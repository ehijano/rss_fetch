      <title>Energy density and stress fields in quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been an enduring interest and controversy about whether or not one can define physically meaningful energy density and stress fields, $e({\bf r})$ and $\sigma_{\alpha \beta}({\bf r})$ in quantum systems. A key issue is kinetic energy since $\frac{1}{2}|\nabla \Psi|^2$ and $-\frac{1}{2}\Psi\nabla^2 \Psi$ lead to different densities, and analogous issues arise interaction energies. This paper presents a resolution to the problems in two steps: 1) All effects of exchange and correlation are shown to be unique functions defined at each point ${\bf r}$; all issues of non-uniqueness involve only the density $n({\bf r})$ and are equivalent to a single-particle problem with wavefunction $s({\bf r}) = \sqrt{n({\bf r})/N}$. 2) Forms for the latter terms are proposed based on the nature of energy and stress, where energy has two distinct roles. Because the energy determines the ground state itself through the variational principle, the appropriate density involves the terms in the hamiltonian: $-\frac{1}{2}\Psi\nabla^2 \Psi$ and interactions in terms of potentials acting on the particles. This leads naturally to density functional theory with the interpretation that the energy density $e({\bf r})$ is equilibrated to minimize fluctuations with the same chemical potential throughout the system. On the other hand, the energy and stress (derivative of the energy with respect to strain) are properties of the ground state, and simple examples to show that the only acceptable expressions involve the combination $\frac{1}{4}[|\nabla \Psi|^2 - \Psi\nabla^2 \Psi]$, as derived by Schrodinger, Pauli and others, and Coulomb interactions in the Maxwell form in terms of electric fields, not potentials. Together these results lead to well-defined formulations of energy density and stress fields that are physically motivated and based on a clear set of arguments.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale metastable structure formation in nickel-aluminum alloys synthesized far from equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study reports a new meta-stable structure in epitaxial nickel-aluminum (Ni-Al) films (Al content up to 24.4 at.%) grown on MgO(001) substrates by magnetron sputtering. Structure probes by XRD, HRTEM and nano-indentation combined with atomistic simulations consistently demonstrate that in thin film samples with coexisting {\gamma} and {\gamma}' phases, domains of the two phases are homogeneously intermixed at the atomic-scale, forming a coherent matched lattice with one overall lattice parameter. It expands as aluminum (Al) concentration increases, with {\gamma} phase domains being progressively replaced by {\gamma}' phase domains. This behavior is similar to a solid solution, where the atomic-scale domain of the {\gamma} and {\gamma}' phases act as solute and solvent, respectively. Isothermal annealing and nanoindentation reveal that the structure decomposes into distinct {\gamma}' and {\gamma} phases due to the loss of lattice matching at 400 {\deg}C, resulting in an increase in hardness. This is followed by further relaxation and domain growth at higher temperatures (600 {\deg}C and 800 {\deg}C), accompanied by a decrease in hardness. These observations confirm the metastable nature of the nanoscale {\gamma} and {\gamma}' phases system, enhance the understanding of the Ni-Al alloy system and providing new insights for meta-stable intermetallic thin film synthesis.</description>

      <title>Ion correlations explain kinetic selectivity in diffusion-limited solid state synthesis reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08560v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Establishing viable solid-state synthesis pathways for novel inorganic materials remains a major challenge in materials science. Previous pathway design methods using pair-wise reaction approaches have navigated the thermodynamic landscape with first-principles data but lack kinetic information, limiting their effectiveness. This gap leads to suboptimal precursor selection and predictions, especially for reactions forming competing phases with similar formation energies, where ion diffusion is a critical influence. Here, we demonstrate an inorganic synthesis framework by incorporating machine learning-derived transport properties through "liquid-like" product layers into a thermodynamic cellular reaction model. In the Ba-Ti-O system, known for its competitive polymorphism, we obtain accurate predictions of phase formation with varying BaO:TiO2 ratios as a function of time and temperature. We find that diffusion-thermodynamic interplay governs phase compositions, with cross-ion transport coefficients critical for predicting diffusion-limited selectivity. This work bridges length and time scales by integrating solid-state reaction kinetics with first-principles thermodynamics and spatial reactivity.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Niobium Electropolishing Using a Generalized Distribution of Relaxation Times Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, we have devised a method of sensing the microscopic surface conditions on the surface of niobium as it is undergoing an electrochemical polishing (EP) treatment. The method uses electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to gather information on the surface state of the electrode without disrupting the polishing reaction. The EIS data is analyzed using a so-called distribution of relaxation times (DRT) method. Using DRT, the EIS data can be deconvolved into discrete relaxation time peaks without any a priori knowledge of the electrode dynamics. By analyzing the relaxation time peaks, we are able to distinguish two distinct modes of the EP reaction. As the polishing voltage is increased, the electrode transitions from the low voltage EP mode, characterized by a single relaxation time peaks, to the high voltage EP mode, characterized by two relaxation time peaks. We theorize that this second peak is caused by the formation of an oxide layer on the electrode. We also find that this oxide induced peak transitions from to a negative relaxation time, which is indicative of a blocking electrode process. By analyzing EPed samples, we show that samples polished in the low voltage mode have significantly higher surface roughness due to grain etching and faceting. We find that the surface roughness of the samples only improves when the oxide film peak is present and in the negative relaxation time region. This shows that EIS combined with DRT analysis can be used to predict etching on EPed Nb. This method can also be performed before or during the EP, which could allow for adjustment of polishing parameters to guarantee a smooth cavity surface finish.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ABACUS (Atomic-orbital Based Ab-initio Computation at USTC) is an open-source software for first-principles electronic structure calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. It mainly features density functional theory (DFT) and is compatible with both plane-wave basis sets and numerical atomic orbital basis sets. ABACUS serves as a platform that facilitates the integration of various electronic structure methods, such as Kohn-Sham DFT, stochastic DFT, orbital-free DFT, and real-time time-dependent DFT, etc. In addition, with the aid of high-performance computing, ABACUS is designed to perform efficiently and provide massive amounts of first-principles data for generating general-purpose machine learning potentials, such as DPA models. Furthermore, ABACUS serves as an electronic structure platform that interfaces with several AI-assisted algorithms and packages, such as DeePKS-kit, DeePMD, DP-GEN, DeepH, DeePTB, etc.</description>

      <title>Effect of interface on magnetic exchange coupling in Co/Ru/Co trilayer: from ab-initio simulations to micromagnetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfaces play a substantial role for the properties function structured magnetic materials and magnetic multilayers. Modeling the functional behavior of magnetic materials requires treatment of the relevant phenomena at the device level. Properties that arise from the electronic structure and spin dynamics at the atomistic level have to be properly transferred into a continuum level treatment. In this work we show how Co/Ru/Co three layers can be simulated with the continuum theory of micromagnetism, if interface coupling energies and bulk intrinsic properties are derived from the results of ab-initio and spin dynamics simulations at different temperatures.</description>

      <title>Beyond the band edge: Unveiling high-mobility hot carriers in a two-dimensional conjugated coordination polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot carriers, inheriting excess kinetic energy from high-energy photons, underpin numerous optoelectronic applications involving non-equilibrium transport processes. Current research on hot carriers has predominantly focused on inorganic materials, with little attention paid to organic-based systems due to their ultrafast energy relaxation and inefficient charge transport. Here, we overturn this paradigm by demonstrating highly mobile hot carriers in solution-processable, highly crystalline two-dimensional conjugated coordination polymer (2D c-CP) Cu3BHT (BHT = benzenehexathiol) films. Leveraging a suite of ultrafast spectroscopic and imaging techniques, we unravel the microscopic charge transport landscape in Cu3BHT films following non-equilibrium photoexcitation across temporal, spatial, and frequency domains, revealing two distinct high-mobility transport regimes. In the non-equilibrium transport regime, hot carriers achieve ultrahigh mobility of ~2,000 cm2 V-1 s-1, traversing grain boundaries up to 300 nm within a picosecond. In the quasi-equilibrium transport regime, free carriers exhibit Drude-type band-like transport with a remarkable mobility of ~400 cm2 V-1 s-1 and an intrinsic diffusion length exceeding 1 micrometer. These findings establish 2D c-CPs as versatile platforms for exploring high-mobility non-equilibrium transport, unlocking new opportunities for organic-based hot carrier applications.</description>

      <title>Unconventional bias-dependent tunneling magnetoresistance in van der Waals ferromagnetic/semiconductor heterojunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnetic/semiconductor heterojunctions represent an ideal platform for studying and exploiting tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effects due to the versatile band structure of semiconductors and their high-quality interfaces. In the all-vdW magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) devices, both the magnitude and sign of the TMR can be tuned by an applied voltage. Typically, as the bias voltage increases, first the amplitude of the TMR decreases, then the sign of the TMR reverses and/or oscillates. Here, we report on an unconventional bias-dependent TMR in the all-vdW Fe3GaTe2/GaSe/Fe3GaTe2 MTJs, where the TMR first increases, then decreases, and finally undergoes a sign reversal as the bias voltage increases. This dependence cannot be explained by traditional models of MTJs. We propose an in-plane electron momentum (k//) resolved tunneling model that considers both the coherent degree of k// and the decay of the electron wave function through the semiconductor spacer layer. This can explain well the conventional and unconventional bias-dependent TMR. Our results thus provide a deeper understanding of the bias-dependent spin-transport in semiconductor-based MTJs and offer new insights into semiconductor spintronics.</description>

      <title>Stress-induced phase transformations in Ti-15Mo alloy at elevated temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlled mechanical loading was applied to Ti-15Mo alloy during annealing at 550 {\deg}C. Massive formation of the $\omega_{\textrm{iso}}$ phase from the parent $\beta$-phase occurred during annealing at 550 {\deg}C without external stress or with stress well below the yield stress. Moreover, a massive $\alpha$ phase precipitation takes place under simultaneous annealing and plastic deformation. Plastic deformation plays a key role in $\beta\rightarrow\alpha$ transformation and achieving refined $\alpha+\beta$ type microstructure resulted in improved mechanical properties. Studying phase transformations during plastic deformation is critical for understanding and optimizing thermomechanical processing of metastable $\beta$-Ti alloys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pattern matching approaches to electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) provide qualitatively new possibilities for the microstructural analysis of chiral non-centrosymmetric phases due to the influence of dynamical electron diffraction effects on the formation of EBSD Kikuchi patterns. In the present study, we analyze the microstructure of polycrystalline alpha-quartz in an agate mineral sample. We identify characteristic intra-grain inversion domains of different handedness which are well-known from classical polarized light microscopy. As a result, the handedness-resolved microstructure of quartz can be imaged with the spatial and orientation resolution provided by EBSD in the SEM.</description>

      <title>Revealing Local Structures through Machine-Learning- Fused Multimodal Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomistic structures of materials offer valuable insights into their functionality. Determining these structures remains a fundamental challenge in materials science, especially for systems with defects. While both experimental and computational methods exist, each has limitations in resolving nanoscale structures. Core-level spectroscopies, such as x-ray absorption (XAS) or electron energy-loss spectroscopies (EELS), have been used to determine the local bonding environment and structure of materials. Recently, machine learning (ML) methods have been applied to extract structural and bonding information from XAS/EELS, but most of these frameworks rely on a single data stream, which is often insufficient. In this work, we address this challenge by integrating multimodal ab initio simulations, experimental data acquisition, and ML techniques for structure characterization. Our goal is to determine local structures and properties using EELS and XAS data from multiple elements and edges. To showcase our approach, we use various lithium nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) oxide compounds which are used for lithium ion batteries, including those with oxygen vacancies and antisite defects, as the sample material system. We successfully inferred local element content, ranging from lithium to transition metals, with quantitative agreement with experimental data. Beyond improving prediction accuracy, we find that ML model based on multimodal spectroscopic data is able to determine whether local defects such as oxygen vacancy and antisites are present, a task which is impossible for single mode spectra or other experimental techniques. Furthermore, our framework is able to provide physical interpretability, bridging spectroscopy with the local atomic and electronic structures.</description>

      <title>Unusual thermal expansion and Curie temperature variation in dhcp-iron hydride under high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen incorporation into iron interstitial sites under high-pressure conditions forms stoichiometric iron monohydride (FeH) with a double hexagonal close-packed (dhcp) structure. This structure is stable over a broad pressure-temperature range, where ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transitions occur. In this study, using synchrotron X-ray diffraction, we identified negative thermal expansion and thermally invariant volume behavior in dhcp-FeH. Our findings, supported by DFT+DMFT calculations, reveal that these thermal effects are governed by magnetic transitions. The Curie temperature decreases linearly with pressure at a rate of about -21 K/GPa, reaching 300 K at 28 GPa. Experimentally measured magnetostriction is an order of magnitude smaller than prior theoretical predictions, possibly due to volume expansion induced by hydrogen incorporation.</description>

      <title>Compositional dependence of magnetic damping in sputter-deposited CoxFe1-x thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Co25Fe75 ferromagnetic films exhibit ultralow magnetic damping. The magnetic damping dependence of Cobalt Iron thin films over a Co composition (23 to 36%) is here reported. The thin film structures were sputter deposited at ambient temperature and FMR measurements in both in plane and out of plane geometries were utilized to measure magnetic damping parameters, which include intrinsic damping and contributions from spin pumping. The damping parameters, decrease as the Co content is increased, except for Co31Fe69. The smallest values of damping correspond to alloys exhibiting interface perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. A value of 0.00091 was measured for Co36Fe64, whereas for Co31Fe69 was measured as 0.002, this composition exhibits the largest in-plane anisotropy. HAADF-STEM cross-section analysis of the Co36Fe64 thin film stack revealed Cu interdiffusion into the magnetic layer. The degree of interdiffusion was found to be up to 7x higher at grain boundaries as compared the bulk of the polycrystalline grains. The incorporation of Cu into the ferromagnetic layer adversely impacts magnetic damping. Reducing impurities in the magnetic layer by improving the growth chamber base pressure resulted in a reduction of magnetic damping of 18%. The diffraction analysis revealed that the primary growth direction of Co36Fe64 is [101] and that of Cu buffer layer is [111], these planes are perpendicular to their respective [101] planes and for this composition the lattice mismatch was determined to be 0.9325%. The lattice mismatch decreases with increasing Co content and hence the lattice strain. The diffusion of Cu into the ferromagnet creates magnon scattering centers and local changes in magnetic properties. Both factors negatively influence magnetic damping.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure of the Kramers nodal-line semimetal YAuGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nodal-line semimetals are a class of topological materials hosting one dimensional lines of band degeneracy. Kramers nodal-line (KNL) metals/semimetals have recently been theoretically recognized as a class of topological states inherent to all non-centrosymmetric achiral crystal lattices. We investigate the electronic structure of candidate KNL semimetal YAuGe by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and quantum oscillations as well as by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. DFT has revealed that YAuGe hosts KNLs on the G-A-L-M plane of the Brillouin zone, that are protected by the time reversal and mirror-inversion symmetries. Through ARPES and quantum oscillations we identify signatures of hole bands enclosing the G point, and the observed splitting of quantum oscillation frequency with angle is attributed to spin-orbit-coupling-induced band splitting away from the KNLs. Furthermore, we show that the degeneracy of the nodal lines along the G-A line is lifted by the time-reversal-symmetry breaking when the Y is substituted by magnetic R ions (R = rare earth). This becomes a source of Berry curvature and contributes to the anomalous Hall effect in magnetic RAuGe. These findings establish RAuGe as a new class of KNL semimetals offering significant potential for engineering of anomalous magnetotransport properties via magnetic rare-earth substitution.</description>

      <title>CrystalGRW: Generative Modeling of Crystal Structures with Targeted Properties via Geodesic Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining whether a candidate crystalline material is thermodynamically stable depends on identifying its true ground-state structure, a central challenge in computational materials science. We introduce CrystalGRW, a diffusion-based generative model on Riemannian manifolds that proposes novel crystal configurations and can predict stable phases validated by density functional theory. The crystal properties, such as fractional coordinates, atomic types, and lattice matrices, are represented on suitable Riemannian manifolds, ensuring that new predictions generated through the diffusion process preserve the periodicity of crystal structures. We incorporate an equivariant graph neural network to also account for rotational and translational symmetries during the generation process. CrystalGRW demonstrates the ability to generate realistic crystal structures that are close to their ground states with accuracy comparable to existing models, while also enabling conditional control, such as specifying a desired crystallographic point group. These features help accelerate materials discovery and inverse design by offering stable, symmetry-consistent crystal candidates for experimental validation.</description>

      <title>Orientation selection in alloy dendritic evolution during melt-pool solidification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigations of directionally solidifying melt pools during metal additive manufacturing (AM) reveal that the resulting subgrain cellular structures often grow along crystalline orientations different from the temperature gradient direction, some of which are not even along preferred crystallographic directions. It is well-known that dendrite orientation results from the growth competition between the heat flow direction and preferred crystallographic orientation. Specifically, the competition between interfacial anisotropy and process anisotropy (thermal gradient and growth velocity) during directional solidification leads to rich morphological diversity of the resulting dendritic structures, including tilted dendrites and seaweed patterns. The orientation selection mechanisms of such patterns remain unexplored at high velocity in the frame of AM. This study examines the tilted growth of cellular-dendritic arrays as a function of the misorientation angle ($\theta_R$) between the thermal gradient and crystal lattice directions and other relevant control parameters. We use a phase-field model to explore dendritic evolution in a binary alloy during high-velocity solidification in 2D. We find marked effects of thermal gradient, growth velocity, alloy composition, and anisotropy parameters on the possible growth directions and the primary arm spacing, constitutional undercooling, microsegregation, and secondary phases that arise during dendritic solidification. Our work provides a detailed yet concise presentation on the tilted growth and morphological transition for a broad range of thermal conditions in the high-velocity regime and the full range of $\theta_R$ for establishing orientation selection maps. These results should have qualitative relevance for controlling the subgrain structure, chemical segregation, and texture randomization in commercial dendrite materials relevant to AM.</description>

      <title>Ultrasound Propagation in Water-Sorbing Carbon Xerogel</title>

Abstract: Adsorption of water vapor in nanoporous carbons is rather complex due to an interplay between the pore structure and surface chemistry of these materials. Deciphering the mechanism of adsorption requires the knowledge of the spatial distribution and the filling fraction of the adsorbed water. Characteristics of ultrasonic wave propagation through a nanoporous sample provides a wealth of information such as properties of fluids confined in the pores and spatial distribution of adsorbate in the pores. Here we studied water vapor adsorption on carbon xerogel, with a bimodal pore size distribution consisting of micropores (1 nm) and mesopores (8 nm) and overall porosity 68%. The relative humidity was increased in steps and the amount of water adsorbed by the sample was measured gravimetrically at each step, producing a type V isotherm, characteristic of water adsorption to weakly interacting carbon nanopores. Concurrently, we recorded the waveforms for longitudinal and transverse ultrasonic waves that passed through the sample at each saturation step. These measurements provided the wave amplitudes and speeds as a function of relative humidity, and these data were used to calculate the elastic moduli and ultrasonic attenuation of the xerogel-water composite. Analysis of the elastic moduli evolution suggested that confined water shows nearly bulk-like properties in mesopores, while in micropores its modulus noticeably differs from that of bulk water, consistent with theoretical predictions. Furthermore, the observed increase in ultrasonic attenuation during micropore filling indicated the spatial heterogeneity of the water-filled pore space within the overall sample volume. Overall, this study demonstrates the successful utilization of nondestructive ultrasonic testing to probe the fluid adsorption mechanism in a nanoporous medium and the properties of adsorbed phase.</description>

      <title>Dielectric permittivity extraction of MoS$_2$ nanoribbons using THz nanoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nanoscale optical properties of high-quality MoS$_2$ nanoribbons are investigated using THz nanoscopy based on a scattering-type scanning probe. The nanoribbons comprise a multi-layer core, surrounded by monolayer edges. A featureless complex permittivity spectrum covering the range 0.6-1.6 THz is extracted from experimental time-domain measurements through a minimization procedure, adopting an extended finite-dipole model of the probe-sample interaction. Real-space mapping of the nanoribbon reveals variations in the local permittivity down to the instrument-limited resolution, on the order of 30 nm. Clustering analysis statistically identifies regions of lower apparent permittivity that we attribute to a high curvature at the edges of the nanoribbon causing an increase in local material strain or cross-talk in the measured signal with topography-induced measurement artifacts. The core of the nanoribbon contains two regions that follow tightly distributed, but slightly shifted Gaussian statistics in complex permittivity space, with the real part mean of both distributions lying around 5.4 and compatible with literature values of the static permittivity of thin-film MoS$_2$ reported previously. Our results show that the nanoribbons exhibit a modest degree of dielectric variation at the nanoscale that could be explained by heterogeneous doping or variations in the local defect density. We believe that our approach could be useful for the direct real-space measurement of dielectric disorder in other low-dimensional semiconducting material systems.</description>

      <title>Predicting Performance of Object Detection Models in Electron Microscopy Using Random Forests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying prediction uncertainty when applying object detection models to new, unlabeled datasets is critical in applied machine learning. This study introduces an approach to estimate the performance of deep learning-based object detection models for quantifying defects in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, focusing on detecting irradiation-induced cavities in TEM images of metal alloys. We developed a random forest regression model that predicts the object detection F1 score, a statistical metric used to evaluate the ability to accurately locate and classify objects of interest. The random forest model uses features extracted from the predictions of the object detection model whose uncertainty is being quantified, enabling fast prediction on new, unlabeled images. The mean absolute error (MAE) for predicting F1 of the trained model on test data is 0.09, and the $R^2$ score is 0.77, indicating there is a significant correlation between the random forest regression model predicted and true defect detection F1 scores. The approach is shown to be robust across three distinct TEM image datasets with varying imaging and material domains. Our approach enables users to estimate the reliability of a defect detection and segmentation model predictions and assess the applicability of the model to their specific datasets, providing valuable information about possible domain shifts and whether the model needs to be fine-tuned or trained on additional data to be maximally effective for the desired use case.</description>

      <title>Preformed Cooper Pairs in a Triclinic Iron Pnictide Superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron pairing along with phase coherence generates superconductivity below the critical temperature ($T_c$). In underdoped high-$T_c$ cuprates, these two quantum phenomena may occur at separate temperatures, which was lately confirmed in the quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) iron chalcogenide superconductors. Here, we report a systematic investigation on the pre-pairing behavior in a triclinic iron pnictide superconductor (Ca$_{0.85}$La$_{0.15}$)$_{10}$(Pt$_3$As$_8$)(Fe$_2$As$_2$)$_5$ with $T_c \approx $ 30 K, where the superconductivity is quasi-2D manifested by the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless behaviors. Inelastic neutron scattering experiments unambiguously reveal a spin resonance peak around $E_R =$ 13 meV in the superconducting state, but its intensity continuously decreases when warming up across $T_c$, accompanied with an anomaly around $T^{*}\approx$ 45 K in spin correlations, and a suppression by an in-plane magnetic field persisting to the same temperature. Below $T^{*}$, a significant Nernst signal and a reduction of density of states at the Fermi level are also observed. These results suggest that the precursor of spin resonance is highly related to the preformed Cooper pairs driven by phase fluctuations, much like the pseudogap case in cuprates.</description>

      <title>Broad Spectral Tuning of Ultra-Low Loss Polaritons in a van der Waals Crystal by Intercalation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phonon polaritons (PhPs) -- light coupled to lattice vibrations -- in polar van der Waals (vdW) crystals are promising candidates for controlling the flow of energy at the nanoscale due to their strong field confinement, anisotropic propagation, and ultra-long lifetime in the picosecond range \cite{ref1,ref2,ref3,ref4,ref5}. However, the lack of tunability in their narrow and material-specific spectral range -- the Reststrahlen Band (RB) -- severely limits their technological implementation. Here, we demonstrate that the intercalation of Na atoms in the vdW semiconductor $\alpha$-V$_2$O$_5$ enables a broad spectral shift of RBs, and that the PhPs excited exhibit ultra-low losses (lifetime of $4 \pm 1$~ps), similar to PhPs in the non-intercalated crystal (lifetime of $6 \pm 1$ ps). We expect our intercalation method to be applicable to other vdW crystals, opening the door for the use of PhPs in broad spectral bands in the mid-infrared domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice degrees of freedom (DoFs) may induce quantum disorder (QD) when nuclear tunneling outvies long-range order, but conventional phonon theory is incapable of describing such QD phases. Here we develop a method based on path-integral molecular dynamics to solve this problem. Its accuracy is verified in a double-well chain model and it is applied to a real material from first principles. A quantum order-disorder-order phase transition sequence is demonstrated when varying the strength of quantum fluctuations using the lattice constants as the tuning factor. Combining the excitation spectra and R\'enyi entanglement entropy, we pinpoint the QD region. This picture may be general in lattice systems having soft phonon modes, not limited to quantum paraelectricity, in which novel entangled lattice motion and its coupling with other DoFs can be expected.</description>

      <title>Implicit Time-Marching for Lagrange Multiplier Formulation for Couple Stress Elastodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of metamaterials and architected materials has increased interest in continuum mechanics models that capture size-dependent microstructure interactions. Among these, Consistent Couple-Stress Theory (C-CST) accounts for mechanical interactions at the microscale adding higher-order derivatives in the strain energy. Previous studies have explored the dynamics of C-CST using methods such as convolutional principles or inverse Laplace transforms to obtain time-dependent solutions. In contrast, our results show that implicit time integration, applied to a mixed finite element method with a Lagrange multiplier, provides direct time-domain solutions for dynamic C-CST modeling and ensures solution stability. In particular, the proposed finite element scheme is verified in comparison with results from previous literature, by employing the Method of Manufactured Solutions in the static case and dynamic simulations of simple cases. The approach presented introduces new tools for studying size-dependent material behavior, laying the groundwork for further applications in advanced material design and wave propagation studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning thermal microscopy is a unique tool for the study of thermal properties at the nanoscale. However, calibration of the method is a crucial problem. When analyzing local thermal conductivity, direct calibration is not possible and reference samples are used instead. As the calibration dependence is non-linear and there are only a few calibration points, this represents a metrological challenge that needs complex data processing. In this contribution we present use of the OEFPIL algorithm for robust and single-step evaluation of local thermal conductivities and their uncertainties, simplifying this procedure. Furthermore, we test the suitability of SThM calibration for automated measurement.</description>

Abstract: The following letter presents a novel, multi-length-scale characterization approach for investigating doping chemistry and spatial distributions within semiconductors, as demonstrated using a state-of-the-art CMOS image sensor. With an intricate structural layout and varying doping types/concentration levels, this device is representative of the current challenges faced in measuring dopants within confined volumes using conventional techniques. Focused ion beam-secondary ion mass spectrometry is applied to produce large-area compositional maps with nanoscale resolution, while atom probe tomography is used to extract quantitative dopant profiles. Leveraging the complementary capabilities of the two methods, this workflow is shown to be an effective approach for resolving nano- and micro- scale dopant information, crucial for optimizing the performance and reliability of advanced semiconductor devices.</description>

      <title>Topological Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of superconducting quantum rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum rings have emerged as a playground for quantum mechanics and topological physics, with promising technological applications. Experimentally realizable quantum rings, albeit at the scale of a few nanometers, are 3D nanostructures. Surprisingly, no theories exist for the topology of the Fermi sea of quantum rings, and a microscopic theory of superconductivity in nanorings is also missing. In this paper, we remedy this situation by developing a mathematical model for the topology of the Fermi sea and Fermi surface, which features non-trivial hole pockets of electronic states forbidden by quantum confinement, as a function of the geometric parameters of the nanoring. The exactly solvable mathematical model features two topological transitions in the Fermi surface upon shrinking the nanoring size either, first, vertically (along its axis of revolution) and, then, in the plane orthogonal to it, or the other way round. These two topological transitions are reflected in a kink and in a characteristic discontinuity, respectively, in the electronic density of states (DOS) of the quantum ring, which is also computed. Also, closed-form expressions for the Fermi energy as a function of the geometric parameters of the ring are provided. These, along with the DOS, are then used to derive BCS equations for the superconducting critical temperature of nanorings as a function of the geometric parameters of the ring. The $T_c$ varies non-monotonically with the dominant confinement size and exhibits a prominent maximum, whereas it is a monotonically increasing function of the other, non-dominant, length scale. For the special case of a perfect square toroid (where the two length-scales coincide), the $T_c$ increases monotonically with increasing the confinement size, and in this case, there is just one topological transition.</description>

      <title>Towards Fast, Specialized Machine Learning Force Fields: Distilling Foundation Models via Energy Hessians</title>

Abstract: The foundation model (FM) paradigm is transforming Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs), leveraging general-purpose representations and scalable training to perform a variety of computational chemistry tasks. Although MLFF FMs have begun to close the accuracy gap relative to first-principles methods, there is still a strong need for faster inference speed. Additionally, while research is increasingly focused on general-purpose models which transfer across chemical space, practitioners typically only study a small subset of systems at a given time. This underscores the need for fast, specialized MLFFs relevant to specific downstream applications, which preserve test-time physical soundness while maintaining train-time scalability. In this work, we introduce a method for transferring general-purpose representations from MLFF foundation models to smaller, faster MLFFs specialized to specific regions of chemical space. We formulate our approach as a knowledge distillation procedure, where the smaller "student" MLFF is trained to match the Hessians of the energy predictions of the "teacher" foundation model. Our specialized MLFFs can be up to 20 $\times$ faster than the original foundation model, while retaining, and in some cases exceeding, its performance and that of undistilled models. We also show that distilling from a teacher model with a direct force parameterization into a student model trained with conservative forces (i.e., computed as derivatives of the potential energy) successfully leverages the representations from the large-scale teacher for improved accuracy, while maintaining energy conservation during test-time molecular dynamics simulations. More broadly, our work suggests a new paradigm for MLFF development, in which foundation models are released along with smaller, specialized simulation "engines" for common chemical subsets.</description>

      <title>Reversible Control of In-plane Elastic Stress Tensor in Nanomembranes</title>

Abstract: Strain engineering allows the physical properties of materials and devices to be widely tailored, as paradigmatically demonstrated by strained transistors and semiconductor lasers employed in consumer electronics. For this reason, its potential impact on our society has been compared to that of chemical alloying. Although significant progress has been made in the last years on strained nanomaterials, strain fields (which are of tensorial nature, with six independent components) are still mostly used in a "scalar" and/or static fashion. Here we present a new class of strain actuators which allow the three components of the in-plane stress tensor in a nanomembrane to be independently and reversibly controlled. The actuators are based on monolithic piezoelectric substrates, which are micro-machined via femtosecond-laser processing. Their functionality is demonstrated by "programming" arbitrary stress states in a semiconductor layer, whose light emission is used as a local and sensitive strain gauge. The results shown in this work open a new route to investigate and make use of strain effects in materials and devices.</description>

      <title>Cluster Sliding Ferroelectricity in Trilayer Quasi-Hexagonal C$_{60}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric polarization typically originates from non-centrosymmetric charge distributions in compounds. In elemental crystalline materials, chemical bonds between atoms of the same element favor symmetrically distributed electron charges and centrosymmetric structures, making elemental ferroelectrics rare. Compared to atoms, elemental clusters are intrinsically less symmetric and can have various preferred orientations when they are assembled to form crystals. Consequently, the assembly of clusters with different orientations tends to break the inversion symmetry. By exploiting this concept, we show that sliding ferroelectricity naturally emerges in trilayer quasi-hexagonal phase (qHP) C$_{60}$, a cluster-assembled carbon allotrope recently synthesized. Compared to many metallic or semi-metallic elemental ferroelectrics, trilayer qHP C$_{60}$'s have sizable band gaps and several ferroelectric structures, which are distinguishable by measuring their second-harmonic generation (SHG) responses. Some of these phases show both switchable out-of-plane and in-plane polarizations on the order of 0.2 pC/m. The out-of-plane and in-plane polarizations can be switched independently and enable an easy-to-implement construction of Van der Waals homostructures with ferroelectrically switchable chirality.</description>

      <title>Electron ptychography reveals a ferroelectricity dominated by anion displacements</title>

Abstract: Sodium niobate, a lead-free ferroic material, hosts delicately-balanced, competing order parameters, including ferroelectric states that can be stabilized by epitaxial strain. Here, we show that the resulting macroscopic ferroelectricity exhibits an unconventional microscopic structure using multislice electron ptychography. This technique overcomes multiple scattering artifacts limiting conventional electron microscopy, enabling both lateral spatial resolution beyond the diffraction limit and recovery of three-dimensional structural information. These imaging capabilities allow us to separate the ferroelectric interior of the sample from the relaxed surface structure and identify the soft phonon mode and related structural distortions with picometer precision. Unlike conventional ferroelectric perovskites, we find that the polar distortion in this material involves minimal distortions of the cation sublattices and is instead dominated by anion displacements relative to the niobium sublattice. We establish limits on film thickness for interfacial octahedral rotation engineering and directly visualize a random octahedral rotation pattern, arising from the flat dispersion of the associated phonon mode.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03214v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, kagome materials have attracted significant attention due to their rich emergent phenomena arising from the quantum interplay of geometry, topology, spin, and correlations. However, in the search for kagome materials, it has been found that bulk compounds with electronic properties related to the kagome lattice are relatively scarce, primarily due to the hybridization of kagome layers with adjacent layers. Therefore, researchers have shown increasing interest in the discovery and construction of two-dimensional (2D) kagome materials, aiming to achieve clean kagome bands near the Fermi level in monolayer or few-layer systems. Substantial advancements have already been made in this area. In this review, we summarize the current progress in the construction and development of 2D kagome materials. We begin by introducing the geometric and electronic structures of the kagome lattice model and its variants, followed by discussions on the experimental realizations and electronic structure characterizations of 2D kagome materials. Finally, we provide an outlook on the future developments of 2D kagome materials.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the discovery of low-energy structure configurations: a computational approach that integrates first-principles calculations, Monte Carlo sampling, and Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding Minimum Energy Configurations (MECs) is essential in fields such as physics, chemistry, and materials science, as they represent the most stable states of the systems. In particular, identifying such MECs in multi-component alloys considered candidate PFMs is key because it determines the most stable arrangement of atoms within the alloy, directly influencing its phase stability, structural integrity, and thermo-mechanical properties. However, since the search space grows exponentially with the number of atoms considered, obtaining such MECs using computationally expensive first-principles DFT calculations often results in a cumbersome task. To escape the above compromise between physical fidelity and computational efficiency, we have developed a novel physics-based data-driven approach that combines Monte Carlo sampling, first-principles DFT calculations, and Machine Learning to accelerate the discovery of MECs in multi-component alloys. More specifically, we have leveraged well-established Cluster Expansion (CE) techniques with Local Outlier Factor models to establish strategies that enhance the reliability of the CE method. In this work, we demonstrated the capabilities of the proposed approach for the particular case of a tungsten-based quaternary high-entropy alloy. However, the method is applicable to other types of alloys and enables a wide range of applications.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of thermal hysteresis in the molecular dynamics of orientationally disordered barocalorics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Barocalorics (BCs) are emerging as promising alternatives to vapour-phase refrigerants, which are problematic as they exacerbate climate change when they inevitably leak into the atmosphere. However, the commercialisation of BC refrigerants is significantly hindered by hysteresis in the solid-solid phase transition that would be exploited in a refrigeration cycle. Here, we provide new insight into the hysteresis that is a critical step towards the rational design of viable BCs. By studying the archetypal BC plastic crystal, neopentyl glycol (NPG), we observe for the first time the liberation of the hydroxyl rotational modes that unlock the hydrogen bonding network. We use high-resolution inelastic fixed-window neutron scattering studies in combination with quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements to build a comprehensive microscopic understanding of the NPG phase transition. Hysteresis previously observed in calorimetric studies of NPG is now observed directly as hysteresis in molecular rotational modes, and hence in the formation and disruption of hydrogen bonding. Furthermore, by tracking the thermal activation of three main reorientation modes, we suggest that their fractional excitations may resolve an outstanding discrepancy between measured and calculated entropy change. These results allow for direct study of the molecular dynamics that govern the thermal hysteresis of small molecule energy materials. They will be broadly applicable, as many promising BC material families possess first-order transitions involving molecular reorientations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A smooth diamond film, characterized by exceptional thermal conductivity, chemical stability, and optical properties, is highly suitable for a wide range of advanced applications. However, achieving uniform film quality presents a significant challenge for the CVD method due to non-uniformities in microwave distribution, electric fields, and the densities of reactive radicals during deposition processes involving $CH_4$ and $H_2$ precursors. Here, we systematically investigate the effects of microwave power and chamber pressure on surface roughness, crystalline quality, and the uniformity of diamond films. These findings provide valuable insights into the production of atomically smooth, high-quality diamond films with enhanced uniformity. By optimizing deposition parameters, we achieved a root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of 2 nm, comparable to high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) diamond substrates. Moreover, these conditions facilitated the formation of a pure single-crystal diamond phase, confirmed by the absence of contamination peaks in the Raman spectra</description>

      <title>Electron-irradiation effects on monolayer MoS2 at elevated temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effect of electron irradiation on 2D materials is an important topic, both for the correct interpretation of electron microscopy experiments and for possible applications in electron lithography. After the importance of including inelastic scattering damage in theoretical models describing beam damage, and the lack of oxygen-sensitivity under electron irradiation in 2D MoS2 were recently shown, the role of temperature has remained unexplored on a quantitative level. Here we show the effect of temperature on both the creation of individual defects as well as the effect of temperature on defect dynamics. Based on the measured displacement cross section of sulphur atoms in MoS2 by atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, we find an increased probability for defect creation for temperatures up to 150{\deg}C, in accordance with theoretical predictions. However, higher temperatures lead to a decrease of the observed cross sections. Despite this apparent decrease, we find that the elevated temperature does not mitigate the creation of defects as this observation would suggest, but rather hides the created damage due to rapid thermal diffusion of the created vacancies before their detection, leading to the formation of vacancy lines and pores outside the measurement's field of view. Using the experimental data in combination with previously reported theoretical models for the displacement cross section, we estimate the migration energy barrier of sulphur vacancies in MoS2 to be 0.26 +- 0.13 eV. These results mark another step towards the complete understanding of electron beam damage in MoS2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Skyrmions are stable topological textures that have garnered substantial attention within the ferroelectric community for their exotic functional properties. While previous studies have questioned the feasibility of [001]$_{\text{pc}}$ skyrmion tubes in rhombohedral BaTiO$_3$ due to the high energy cost of 180$^\circ$ domain walls, we demonstrate here their stabilization with topological charges of $\mathcal{Q} = \pm 1$ from density functional theory and second-principles calculations. By enabling extensive vortex and antivortex polarization configurations, the expected prohibitive energetic barriers are overcomed while preserving the topological nature of the structures. Notably, we extend these findings to demonstrate the appearance of skyrmion and antiskyrmion tubes in other related materials, highlighting their broader relevance. Furthermore, our computational experiments indicate that these structures can be directly stabilized and reversibly switched by applied electric fields, establishing a straightforward route for their practical realization and functional control in nanoelectronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce CHIPS-FF (Computational High-Performance Infrastructure for Predictive Simulation-based Force Fields), a universal, open-source benchmarking platform for machine learning force fields (MLFFs). This platform provides robust evaluation beyond conventional metrics such as energy, focusing on complex properties including elastic constants, phonon spectra, defect formation energies, surface energies, and interfacial and amorphous phase properties. Utilizing 16 graph-based MLFF models including ALIGNN-FF, CHGNet, MatGL, MACE, SevenNet, ORB, MatterSim and OMat24, the CHIPS-FF workflow integrates the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) with JARVIS-Tools to facilitate automated high-throughput simulations. Our framework is tested on a set of 104 materials, including metals, semiconductors and insulators representative of those used in semiconductor components, with each MLFF evaluated for convergence, accuracy, and computational cost. Additionally, we evaluate the force-prediction accuracy of these models for close to 2 million atomic structures. By offering a streamlined, flexible benchmarking infrastructure, CHIPS-FF aims to guide the development and deployment of MLFFs for real-world semiconductor applications, bridging the gap between quantum mechanical simulations and large-scale device modeling.</description>

      <title>How quantum selection rules influence the magneto-optical effects of driven, ultrafast magnetization dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05433v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrafast magnetization dynamics driven by ultrashort pump lasers is typically explained by changes in electronic populations and scattering pathways of excited conduction electrons. This conventional approach overlooks the fundamental role of quantum mechanical selection rules, governing transitions from core states to the conduction band, that forms the key method of the probing step in these experiments. By employing fully ab initio time-dependent density functional theory, we reveal that these selection rules profoundly influence the interpretation of ultrafast spin dynamics at specific probe energies. Our analysis for hcp Co and fcc Ni at the M edge demonstrates that the transient dynamics, as revealed in pump-probe experiments, arise from a complex interplay of optical excitations of the M shell. Taking into account the selection rules and conduction electron spin flips, this leads to highly energy-dependent dynamics. These findings address longstanding discrepancies in experimental TMOKE measurements and show that only through meticulous consideration of matrix elements at the probe stage, can one ensure that magnetization dynamics is revealed in its true nature, instead of being muddled by artifacts arising from the choice of probe energy.</description>

      <title>Energy landscape interpretation of universal linearly increasing absorption with frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03341v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Absorption of elastic waves in complex media is commonly found to increase linearly with frequency, for both longitudinal and shear waves. This ubiquitous property is observed in media such as rocks, unconsolidated sediments, and human tissue. Absorption is due to relaxation processes at the level of atomic scales and up to the sub-micron scale of biological materials. The effect of these processes is usually expressed as an integral over relaxation frequencies or relaxation times. Here we argue that these processes are thermally activated. Unusual for ultrasonics and seismics, we can therefore transform the expression for absorption from the frequency or time domains to an integral over an activation energy landscape weighted by an energy distribution. The universal power-law property surprisingly corresponds to a flat activation energy landscape. This is the solution which maximizes entropy or randomness. Therefore the linearly increasing absorption corresponds to the energy landscape with the fewest possible constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetism typically arises from the effect of exchange interactions on highly localized fermionic wave functions in f- and d-atomic orbitals. In rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG), in contrast, magnetism-manifesting as spontaneous polarization into one or more spin and valley flavors[1-7]-originates from itinerant electrons near a Van Hove singularity. Here, we show experimentally that the electronic entropy in this system shows signatures typically associated with disordered local magnetic moments, unexpected for electrons in a fully itinerant metal. Specifically, we find a contribution $\Delta$ S $\approx$ 1k$_B$/charge carrier that onsets at the Curie temperature and survives over one order of magnitude in temperature. First order phase transitions show an isospin `Pomeranchuk effect' in which the fluctuating moment phase is entropically favored over the nearby symmetric Fermi liquid[8, 9]. Our results imply that despite the itinerant nature of the electron wave functions, the spin- and valley polarization of individual electrons are decoupled, a phenomenon typically associated with localized moments, as happens, for example, in solid 3He[10]. Transport measurements, surprisingly, show a finite temperature resistance minimum within the fluctuating moment regime, which we attribute to the interplay of fluctuating magnetic moments and electron phonon scattering. Our results highlight the universality of soft isospin modes to two-dimensional flat band systems.</description>

      <title>Insulator-Metal Transition and Magnetic Crossover in Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-plane magnetic fields offer a relatively unexplored opportunity to alter the band structure of stacks of 2D materials so that they exhibit desired physical properties. Here we show that an in-plane magnetic field combined with a transverse electric field can induce an insulator-metal (IM) transition in bilayer graphene. Our study of the magnetic response reveals that the orbital magnetic susceptibility changes from diamagnetic to paramagnetic around the transition point. We discuss several strategies to observe the IM transition, switch the diamagnetism, and more generally control the band structure of stacked 2D materials at experimentally accessible magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Amplifying the antiferromagnetic spin Seebeck effect through topological magnons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological magnons emerge as topologically protected spin wave states at the edges of magnets. Here, we theoretically explore how these surface states can be harnessed to amplify the spin Seebeck effect (SSE) in antiferromagnets (AFMs) interfaced with normal metals (NMs). Based on a microscopic model of a kagome AFM, we demonstrate that broken mirror symmetry, combined with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), drives the system into a topological phase hosting spin-polarized magnons at the boundaries. Notably, linear response calculations reveal that in AFM/NM heterostructures, the topological magnons exhibit strong coupling to the metal's charge carriers, resulting in a substantial enhancement of the SSE. The relative contribution of the topological magnons is found to be 4-5 times greater than that of the trivial magnon bands. Moreover, our results show that this enhancement is highly sensitive to the strength of the DMI.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic response in dipole superfluids: vortex lattices and singular domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among the most significant macroscopic quantum phenomena in condensed matter physics is the Meissner effect observed in superconductivity, which arises from the unique interaction between superfluids of charged particles and electromagnetic fields. However, superfluids can also emerge from particles possessing distinct electromagnetic properties. In particular, there has been growing interest in superfluids composed of charge-neutral particles with magnetic or electric dipole moments, such as Bose-Einstein condensates of magnons or excitons. Despite this interest, the electromagnetic response of dipole superfluids, including potential analogs or contrasts to the Meissner effect, remains poorly understood. In this work, we develop a Ginzburg-Landau phenomenological theory to describe magnetic and electric dipole superfluids subjected to pseudo-magnetic fields induced by geometric phases. For magnetic dipole superfluids interacting with the Aharonov-Casher (AC) phase, we find that they form vortex lattices with sharply localized pseudo-magnetic fields along hexagonal domain walls, leading to singular and discontinuous change of physical variables at these boundaries. For electric dipole superfluids influenced by the He-McKellar-Wilkens (HMW) phase, in contrast, we identify vortex lattices where the pseudo-magnetic field and supercurrent are concentrated at vortex cores, resembling superconductors. These results reveal strikingly different electromagnetic responses in dipole superfluids, opening new directions for exploring superfluid systems with unconventional electromagnetic responses.</description>

      <title>eminus - Pythonic electronic structure theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19438v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In current electronic structure research endeavors such as warm dense matter or machine learning applications, efficient development necessitates non-monolithic software, providing an extendable and flexible interface. The open-source idea offers the advantage of having a source code base that can be reviewed and modified by the community. However, practical implementations can often diverge significantly from their theoretical counterpart. Leveraging the efforts of recent theoretical formulations and the features of Python, we try to mitigate these problems. We present eminus, an education- and development-friendly electronic structure package designed for convenient and customizable workflows, yet built with intelligible and modular implementations.</description>
