      <title>A unified neural background-error covariance model for midlatitude and tropical atmospheric data assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11968</link>

Abstract: Estimating background-error covariances remains a core challenge in variational data assimilation (DA). Operational systems typically approximate these covariances by transformations that separate geostrophically balanced components from unbalanced inertio-gravity modes - an approach well-suited for the midlatitudes but less applicable in the tropics, where different physical balances prevail. This study estimates background-error covariances in a reduced-dimension latent space learned by a neural-network autoencoder (AE). The AE was trained using 40 years of ERA5 reanalysis data, enabling it to capture flow-dependent atmospheric balances from a diverse set of weather states.
  We demonstrate that performing DA in the latent space yields analysis increments that preserve multivariate horizontal and vertical physical balances in both tropical and midlatitude atmosphere. Assimilating a single 500 hPa geopotential height observation in the midlatitudes produces increments consistent with geostrophic and thermal wind balance, while assimilating a total column water vapor observation with a positive departure in the nearly-saturated tropical atmosphere generates an increment resembling the tropical response to (latent) heat-induced perturbations. The resulting increments are localized and flow-dependent, and shaped by orography and land-sea contrasts. Forecasts initialized from these analyses exhibit realistic weather evolution, including the excitation of an eastward-propagating Kelvin wave in the tropics.
  Finally, we explore the transition from using synthetic ensembles and a climatology-based background error covariance matrix to an operational ensemble of data assimilations. Despite significant compression-induced variance loss in some variables, latent-space assimilation produces balanced, flow-dependent increments - highlighting its potential for ensemble-based latent-space 4D-Var.</description>

      <title>Mysterious anomalies in Earth's atmosphere and strongly interacting Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04635v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been recently argued in \cite{Bertolucci:2016xjm, Zioutas:2020ndf, Zioutas:2023ybw} that numerous enigmatic observations remain challenging to explain within the framework of conventional physics. These anomalies include unexpected correlations between temperature variations in the stratosphere, the total electron content of the Earth's atmosphere, and earthquake activity on one hand, and the positions of planets on the other. Decades of collected data provide statistically significant evidence for these observed correlations. The work in \cite{Bertolucci:2016xjm, Zioutas:2020ndf, Zioutas:2023ybw} suggests that these correlations arise from strongly interacting ``streaming invisible matter'' which gets gravitationally focused by the solar system bodies including the Earth's inner mass distribution. Here, we propose that some of these, as well as other anomalies, may be explained by rare yet energetic events involving the so-called axion quark nuggets (AQNs) impacting the Earth. In other words, we identify the ``streaming invisible matter'' conjectured in \cite{Bertolucci:2016xjm, Zioutas:2020ndf, Zioutas:2023ybw} with AQNs, offering a concrete microscopic mechanism to elucidate the observed correlations. It is important to note that the AQN model was originally developed to address the observed similarity between the dark matter and visible matter densities in the Universe \cite{Zhitnitsky:2002qa, Zhitnitsky:2021iwg}, i.e., $\Omega_{\rm DM} \sim \Omega_{\rm visible}$ and not explain the anomalies discussed here. Nonetheless, we support our proposal by demonstrating that the intensity and spectral characteristics of AQN-induced events are consistent with the aforementioned puzzling observations.</description>
