      <title>Pooling Liquidity Pools in AMMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Market fragmentation across multiple Automated Market Makers (AMMs) creates inefficiencies such as costly arbitrage, unnecessarily high slippage and delayed incorporation of new information into prices. These inefficiencies raise trading costs, reduce liquidity provider profits, and degrade overall market efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a modification of the Constant Product Market Maker (CPMM) pricing mechanism, called the Global Market Maker (GMM), which aggregates liquidity information from all AMMs to mitigate these inefficiencies. Through theoretical and numerical analyses, we demonstrate that the GMM enhances profits for both AMMs and traders by eliminating arbitrage opportunities. Additionally, it reduces the profitability of sandwich attacks and minimizes impermanent losses.</description>

      <title>The E-Rule: A Novel Composite Indicator for Predicting Economic Recessions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study develops the E-Rule, a novel composite recession indicator that integrates financial market and labor market signals to improve the precision of recession forecasting. Combining the yield curve and the Sahm rule, the E-Rule provides a holistic and early-warning measure of economic downturns. Using historical data from 1976 onward, we empirically evaluate the E-Rule's predictive power relative to traditional indicators. The analysis employs machine learning techniques, including logistic regression, support vector machines, gradient boosting, and random forests, to assess predictive accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that the E-Rule offers a superior lead time in forecasting recessions and improves stability over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Sources of Taste-Based Discrimination Using List Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines how attitudes among supervisors, co-workers, and customers contribute to discrimination against sexual minorities in the workplace. A large, nationally representative sample in Chile was recruited in collaboration with a local firm. The survey employs a series of double list experiments designed to measure attitudes on sensitive issues while reducing social desirability bias, followed by direct questions on attitudes toward sexual minorities. Findings reveal a discrepancy between reported and actual comfort levels with gay individuals in the labor market. Respondents underreport their discomfort by 15 to 23 percentage points, with the largest bias and lowest comfort levels observed when asked about supervising a gay employee. Additionally, respondents consistently underestimate broader societal support for gay employees and co-workers. These differences are reflected in real-stakes donation behavior: respondents who choose not to donate any amount from a lottery to a local LGBTQ-related NGO also report lower comfort levels and exhibit greater misreporting.</description>

      <title>A Pharmacy Benefit Manager Insurance Business Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is time to move on from attempts to make the pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) reseller business model more transparent. Time and time again the Big 3 PBMs have developed opaque alternatives to piece-meal 100% pass-through mandates. Time and time again PBMs have demonstrated expertise in finding loopholes in state government disclosure laws. The purpose of this paper is to provide quantitative estimates of two transparent insurance business models as a solution to the PBM agency issue. The key parameter used is an 8% gross profit margin figure disclosed by the Big 3 PBMs themselves. Based on reported drug trend delivered to plans, we use a $1,200 to $1,500 per member per year (PMPY) as the range for this key performance indicator (KPI). We propose that discussions of PBM insurance business models start with the following figures: (1) a fixed premium model with medical loss ratio ranging from 92% to 85%; (2) a fee-for-service model ranging from $96 to $180 PMPY with risk sharing of deviations from a contracted PMPY delivered drug spend.</description>

      <title>Complementarity, Augmentation, or Substitutivity? The Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on the U.S. Federal Workforce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the near-future impacts of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies on occupational competencies across the U.S. federal workforce. We develop a multi-stage Retrieval-Augmented Generation system to leverage large language models for predictive AI modeling that projects shifts in required competencies and to identify vulnerable occupations on a knowledge-by-skill-by-ability basis across the federal government workforce. This study highlights policy recommendations essential for workforce planning in the era of AI. We integrate several sources of detailed data on occupational requirements across the federal government from both centralized and decentralized human resource sources, including from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and various federal agencies. While our preliminary findings suggest some significant shifts in required competencies and potential vulnerability of certain roles to AI-driven changes, we provide nuanced insights that support arguments against abrupt or generic approaches to strategic human capital planning around the development of generative AI. The study aims to inform strategic workforce planning and policy development within federal agencies and demonstrates how this approach can be replicated across other large employment institutions and labor markets.</description>

      <title>GATE: An Integrated Assessment Model for AI Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assessing the economic impacts of artificial intelligence requires integrating insights from both computer science and economics. We present the Growth and AI Transition Endogenous model (GATE), a dynamic integrated assessment model that simulates the economic effects of AI automation. GATE combines three key ingredients that have not been brought together in previous work: (1) a compute-based model of AI development, (2) an AI automation framework, and (3) a semi-endogenous growth model featuring endogenous investment and adjustment costs. The model allows users to simulate the economic effects of the transition to advanced AI across a range of potential scenarios. GATE captures the interactions between economic variables, including investment, automation, innovation, and growth, as well as AI-related inputs such as compute and algorithms. This paper explains the model's structure and functionality, emphasizing AI development for economists and economic modeling for the AI community. The model is implemented in an interactive sandbox, enabling users to explore the impact of AI under different parameter choices and policy interventions. The modeling sandbox is available at: www.epoch.ai/GATE.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable model of the square-root price impact dynamics under the long-range market-order correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In econophysics, there are several enigmatic empirical laws: (i)~the market-order flow has strong persistence (long-range order-sign correlation), well formulated as the Lillo-Mike-Farmer model. This phenomenon seems paradoxical given the diffusive and unpredictable price dynamics; (ii)~the price impact $I(Q)$ of a large metaorder $Q$ follows the square-root law, $I(Q)\propto \sqrt{Q}$. In this Letter, we propose an exactly solvable model of the nonlinear price-impact dynamics that unifies these enigmas. We generalize the Lillo-Mike-Farmer model to nonlinear price-impact dynamics, which is mapped to an exactly solvable L\'evy-walk model. Our exact solution and numerical simulations reveal three important points: First, the price dynamics remains diffusive under the square-root law, even under the long-range correlation. Second, price-movement statistics follows truncated power laws with typical exponent around three. Third, volatility has long memory. While this simple model lacks adjustable free parameters, it naturally aligns even with other enigmatic empirical laws, such as (iii)~the inverse-cubic law for price statistics and (iv)~volatility clustering. This work illustrates the crucial role of the square-root law in understanding rich and complex financial price dynamics from a single coherent viewpoint.</description>
