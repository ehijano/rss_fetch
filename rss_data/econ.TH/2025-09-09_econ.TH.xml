      <title>Characterizing Optimality in Dynamic Settings: A Monotonicity-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a novel analytical method for studying optimal paths in dynamic optimization problems under general monotonicity conditions. The method centers on a locator function -- a simple object constructed directly from the model's primitives -- whose roots identify interior steady states and whose slope determines their local stability. Under strict concavity of the payoff function, the locator function also characterizes basins of attraction, yielding a complete description of qualitative dynamics. Without concavity, it can still deliver sharp results: if the function is single crossing from above, its root identifies a globally stable steady state; if the locator function is inverted-U-shaped with two interior roots (a typical case), only the higher root can be a locally stable interior steady state. The locator function further enables comparative statics of steady states with respect to parameters through direct analysis of its derivatives. These results are obtained without solving the full dynamic program. We illustrate the approach using a generalized neoclassical growth model, a rational (un)fitness model, and a learning-by-doing economy.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Beta: A Causal Take on CAPM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CAPM regression is typically interpreted as if the market return contemporaneously \emph{causes} individual returns, motivating beta-neutral portfolios and factor attribution. For realized equity returns, however, this interpretation is inconsistent: a same-period arrow $R_{m,t} \to R_{i,t}$ conflicts with the fact that $R_m$ is itself a value-weighted aggregate of its constituents, unless $R_m$ is lagged or leave-one-out -- the ``aggregator contradiction.'' We formalize CAPM as a structural causal model and analyze the admissible three-node graphs linking an external driver $Z$, the market $R_m$, and an asset $R_i$. The empirically plausible baseline is a \emph{fork}, $Z \to \{R_m, R_i\}$, not $R_m \to R_i$. In this setting, OLS beta reflects not a causal transmission, but an attenuated proxy for how well $R_m$ captures the underlying driver $Z$. Consequently, ``beta-neutral'' portfolios can remain exposed to macro or sectoral shocks, and hedging on $R_m$ can import index-specific noise. Using stylized models and large-cap U.S.\ equity data, we show that contemporaneous betas act like proxies rather than mechanisms; any genuine market-to-stock channel, if at all, appears only at a lag and with modest economic significance. The practical message is clear: CAPM should be read as associational. Risk management and attribution should shift from fixed factor menus to explicitly declared causal paths, with ``alpha'' reserved for what remains invariant once those causal paths are explicitly blocked.</description>

      <title>What Slips the Mind Stalls the Deal: Delay in Bargaining with Absentmindedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In finite-horizon bargaining, deals are often made "on the courthouse steps", just before the deadline. Most classic finite-horizon bargaining models fail to generate deadline effects, or even delay, in equilibrium. Players foresee the future path of play, and come to a deal immediately to circumvent bargaining frictions. We propose a novel source of bargaining delay: absentmindedness. A bargainer who does not know the calendar time may rationally reject an "ultimatum offer" as the trade deadline looms. Rational confusion is a source of bargaining power for the absentminded player, as it induces the other party to make fair offers near the trade deadline to prevent negotiations from breaking down. The absentminded party may reject greedier offers in hope of receiving a fair offer closer to the deadline. If any offer is feasible, there are equilibria which feature delay if and only if players are patient. Such equilibria always involve history-dependent strategies. I provide a necessary and sufficient condition for there to exist a Markov perfect equilibrium with delay: the space of feasible offers must be sufficiently disconnected.</description>

      <title>Contracting against Non-contractible Outsider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies contracting in the presence of externalities with a non-contractible outsider. Multiple equilibria arise from strategic symmetry between the insider agent and the outsider. To address strategic uncertainty, the principal guarantees their actions in a unique equilibrium. A novel duality approach reformulates her problem as a series of problems in which she selects agent expectations. The key constraint is that the principal cannot convince the agent to expect non-guaranteed response from the outsider. Due to strategic rents, the principal optimally induces attenuated agent incentives. With completely symmetric strategic dependence, her coordination and commitment power become perfect substitutes; in addition, public contracting can strictly decrease her surplus compared to private contracting, in sharp contrast with the case where she ignores robustness. Applications include regulating international competition, platform design, and labor union contracting.</description>

      <title>Reputation in the Shadow of Exit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18884v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study reputation formation in repeated games where player actions endogenously determine the probability the game permanently ends. Permanent exit can render reputation useless even to a patient long-lived player whose actions are perfectly monitored, in stark contrast to canonical commitment payoff theorems. However, I identify tight conditions for the long-run player to attain their Stackelberg payoff in the unique Markovian equilibria. Along the way, I highlight the role of Markovian strategies in pinning down the value of reputation formation. I apply my results to repeated global games with exit, and obtain new predictions about regime survival and a dynamic foundation for risk dominant selection.</description>

      <title>A Constructive Characterization of Optimal Bundling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a monopolist selling multiple goods to a consumer with one-dimensional private types. I provide a sufficient condition under which the monopolist's problem is equivalent to finding the upper envelope of the marginal revenue curves. This approach guarantees that the optimal mechanism is deterministic and can be implemented via a menu of bundles. I further characterize this upper envelope using a dominance notion. This characterization yields a constructive algorithm to compute the optimal menu by iteratively eliminating dominated bundles. As my main application, I use this framework to introduce and provide sufficient conditions for the optimality of tree bundling, a common but previously unmodeled sales strategy where the optimal menu contains a root bundle but features distinct upgrade paths.</description>

      <title>Separable joint choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03056v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel choice dataset, called joint choice, in which options and menus are multidimensional. In this general setting, we define a notion of choice separability, which requires that selections from some dimensions are never affected by those performed on the remaining dimensions. This generalizes the classical definition of separability for discrete preference relations and utility functions, to encompass a class of choice behaviors that may lack a preference or utility representation. We thoroughly investigate the stability of separability across dimensions, and then suggest effective tests to check whether a joint choice is separable. Upon defining rationalizable joint choices as those explained by the maximization of a relation of revealed preference, we examine the interplay between the notions of rationalizability and separability. Finally, we show that the rationalizability of a separable joint choice can be tested by verifying the rationalizability of some derived joint choices over fewer dimensions.</description>

      <title>Waiting for Trade in Markets with Aggregate Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a market in which a patient long-lived seller offers prices to short-lived buyers. A hidden state determines whether the buyer's common value exceeds the seller's reservation value, and all agents only have noisy signals. If the seller has commitment power, the seller waits for a buyer with the most favorable signal to arrive, and else exits the market. Using techniques for monotone decision problems, this waiting strategy is shown to be optimal for learning whether trade is efficient. Due to the interplay between the seller's and the buyers' information, the seller's decision to exit may be non-monotonic in the seller's information, and prices may be non-monotonic over time. Without commitment power, there is an equilibrium in which the seller also waits for a buyer with the most favorable signal, but the seller exits at inefficient times.</description>
