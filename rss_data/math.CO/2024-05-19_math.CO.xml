      <title>Combinatorics of generic 5-degree polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the space $P$ of generic complex 5-degree polynomials. Critical values of such polynomial, i.e. four points in the complex plane, either are vertices of a convex quadrangle $Q$, or vertices of a triangle $T$ with one point inside $T$. The inverse image of $Q$ is a tree-like connected structure of five ovals (a cactus). The inverse image of $T$ is also a cactus, but of four ovals. Transformations of cacti of the first type into cacti of the second type and vice versa allow one to represent the space $P$ as a ribbon bipartite graph of genus 3.</description>

      <title>On Growth Functions of Coxeter Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(W, S)$ be a Coxeter system of rank $n$ and let $p_{(W, S)}(t)$ be its growth function. It is known that $p_{(W, S)}(q^{-1}) &lt; \infty$ holds for all $n \leq q \in \mathbb{N}$. In this paper we will show that this still holds for $q = n-1$, if $(W, S)$ is $2$-spherical. Moreover, we will prove that $p_{(W, S)}(q^{-1}) = \infty$ holds for $q = n-2$, if the Coxeter diagram of $(W, S)$ is the complete graph. These two results provide a complete characterization of the finiteness of the growth function in the case of $2$-spherical Coxeter systems with complete Coxeter diagram.</description>

      <title>Note on the union-closed sets conjecture and Reimer's average set size theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Union-Closed Sets Conjecture, often attributed to P\'eter Frankl in 1979, remains an open problem in discrete mathematics. It posits that for any finite family of sets $S\neq\{\emptyset\}$, if the union of any two sets in the family is also in the family, then $\underline{\text{there must exist an element that belongs to at least half of the member sets}}$. We will refer to the underlined text as the abundance condition. In 2001, David Reimer proved that the average set size of a union-closed family $S$ must be at least $\frac{1}{2}\log_{2}|S|$. When proving this result, he showed that a family being union-closed implies that the family satisfies certain conditions, which we will refer to as the Reimer's conditions. Therefore, as seen in the context of Tim Gowers' polymath project on the Union-Closed Sets Conjecture, it is natural to ask if all families that satisfy Reimer's conditions meet the abundance condition. A minimal counterexample to this question was offered by Raz in 2017. In this paper, we will discuss a general method to construct infinitely many such counterexamples with any fixed lower bound on the size of the member sets. Furthermore, we will discuss some properties related to these counterexamples, especially those focusing on how far these counterexamples are from being union-closed.</description>

      <title>Webs and squabs of conics over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a contribution towards a solution for the longstanding open problem of classifying linear systems of conics over finite fields initiated by L. E. Dickson in 1908, through his study of the projective equivalence classes of pencils of conics in $\mathrm{PG}(2,q)$, for $q$ odd. In this paper a set of complete invariants is determined for the projective equivalence classes of webs and of squabs of conics in $\mathrm{PG}(2,q)$, both for $q$ odd and even. Our approach is mainly geometric, and involves a comprehensive study of the geometric and combinatorial properties of the Veronese surface in $\mathrm{PG}(5,q)$. The main contribution is the determination of the distribution of the different types of hyperplanes incident with the $K$-orbit representatives of points and lines of $\mathrm{PG}(5,q)$, where $K\cong\mathrm{PGL}(3,q)$, is the subgroup of $\mathrm{PGL}(6,q)$ stabilizing the Veronese surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix $k\geq 2$, choose $\frac{\log n}{n^{(k-1)/k}}\leq p\leq 1-\Omega(\frac{\log^4 n}{n})$, and consider $G\sim G(n,p)$. For any pair of vertices $v,w\in V(G)$, we give a simple and precise formula for the expected number of steps that a random walk on $G$ starting at $w$ needs to first arrive at $v$. The formula only depends on basic structural properties of $G$. This improves and extends recent results of Ottolini and Steinerberger, as well as Ottolini, who considered this problem for constant as well as for mildly vanishing $p$.</description>

      <title>On Minimal Transversals of Maximal Cliques in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hypergraph is conformal if it is the family of maximal cliques of a graph. In this paper we are interested in the problem of determining when is the family of minimal transversal of maximal cliques of a graph conformal. Such graphs are called clique dually conformal (CDC for short). As our main results, we completely characterize CDC graphs within the families of triangle-free graphs and split graphs. Both characterizations lead to polynomial-time recognition algorithms. We also show that the class of CDC graphs is closed under substitution, in the strong sense that substituting a graph $H$ for a vertex of a graph $G$ results in a CDC graph if and only if both $G$ and $H$ are CDC.</description>

      <title>Strong log-convexity of genus sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, and a nonnegative integer $g$, let $a_g(G)$ be the number of $2$-cell embeddings of $G$ in an orientable surface of genus $g$ (counted up to the combinatorial homeomorphism equivalence). In 1989, Gross, Robbins, and Tucker [Genus distributions for bouquets of circles, J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 47 (1989), 292-306] proposed a conjecture that the sequence $a_0(G),a_1(G),a_2(G),\dots$ is log-concave for every graph $G$. This conjecture is reminiscent to the Heron-Rota-Welsh Log Concavity Conjecture that was recently resolved in the affirmative by June Huh et al., except that it is closer to the notion of $\Delta$-matroids than to the usual matroids. In this short paper, we disprove the Log Concavity Conjecture of Gross, Robbins, and Tucker by providing examples that show strong deviation from log-concavity at multiple terms of their genus sequences.</description>

      <title>Bounds for asymptotic characters of simple Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important function attached to a complex simple Lie group $G$ is its asymptotic character $X(\lambda,x)$ (where $\lambda,x$ are real (co)weights of $G$) - the Fourier transform in $x$ of its Duistermaat-Heckman function $DH_\lambda(p)$ (continuous limit of weight multiplicities). It is shown in arXiv:2312.03101 that the best $\lambda$-independent upper bound $-c(G)$ for ${\rm inf}_x{\rm Re}X(\lambda,x)$ for fixed $\lambda$ is strictly negative. We quantify this result by providing a lower bound for $c(G)$ in terms of $\dim G$. We also provide upper and lower bounds for $DH_\lambda(0)$ when $|\lambda|=1$. This allows us to show that $|X(\lambda,x)|\le C(G)|\lambda|^{-1}|x|^{-1}$ for some constant $C(G)$ depending only on $G$, which implies the conjecture in Remark 17.16 of arXiv:2312.03101. We also show that $c(SL_n)\le (\frac{4}{\pi^2})^{n-2}$. Finally, in the appendix, which subsumes our previous paper arXiv:1811.05293, we prove Conjecture 1 in arXiv:1706.02793 about Mittag-Leffler type sums for $G$.</description>

      <title>Symplectic duality via log topological recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the notion of symplectic duality earlier introduced in the context of topological recursion. We show that the transformation of symplectic duality can be expressed as a composition of $x-y$ dualities in a broader context of log topological recursion. As a corollary, we establish nice properties of symplectic duality: various convenient explicit formulas, invertibility, group property, compatibility with topological recursion and KP integrability. As an application of these properties, we get a new and uniform proof of topological recursion for large families of weighted double Hurwitz numbers; this encompasses and significantly extends all previously known results on this matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove some new instances of a conjecture of Bachoc, Couvreur and Z\'emor that generalizes Freiman's $3k-4$ Theorem to a multiplicative version in a function field setting. As a consequence we find that if $F$ is a rational function field over an algebraically closed field $K$ and $S \subset F$ a finite dimensional $K$-vector space such that $\dim S^2 = 2\dim S + 1$, then the conjecture holds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from the geometric construction of the framed braid group, we define and study the framization of several Brauer-type monoids and also the set partition monoid, all of which appear in knot theory. We introduce the concept of deframization, which is a procedure to obtain a tied monoid from a given framed monoid. Furthermore, we show in detail how this procedure works on the monoids mentioned above. We also discuss the framization and deframization of some algebras, which are deformations, respectively, of the framized and deframized monoids discussed here.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sphere graph of $M_r$, a connect sum of $r$ copies of $S^1\times S^2$ was introduced by Hatcher as an analog of the curve graph of a surface to study the outer automorphism group of a free group $F_r$. Bestvina, Bromberg, and Fujiwara proved that the chromatic number of the curve graph is finite; bounds were subsequently improved by Gaster, Greene, and Vlamis. Motivated by the analogy, we provide upper and lower bounds for the chromatic number of the sphere graph of $M_r$. As a corollary to the prime decomposition of 3-manifolds, this gives bounds on the chromatic number of the sphere graph for any orientable 3-manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1607.00131v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $ k $-page book drawing of a graph $ G $ is a drawing of $ G $ on $ k $ halfplanes with common boundary $ l $, a line, where the vertices are on $ l $ and the edges cannot cross $ l $. The $ k $-page book crossing number of the graph $ G $, denoted by $ \nu_k(G) $, is the minimum number of edge-crossings over all $ k $-page book drawings of $ G $. Let $G=K_n$ be the complete graph on $n$ vertices. We improve the lower bounds on $ \nu_k(K_n) $ for all $ k\geq 14 $ and determine $ \nu_k(K_n) $ whenever $ 2 &lt; n/k \leq 3 $. Our proofs rely on bounding the number of edges in convex graphs with small local crossing numbers. In particular, we determine the maximum number of edges that a convex graph with local crossing number at most $ \ell $ can have for $ \ell\leq 4 $.</description>

      <title>Growth of bilinear maps II: Bounds and orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.15060v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A good range of problems on trees can be described by the following general setting: Given a bilinear map $*:\mathbb R^d\times\mathbb R^d\to\mathbb R^d$ and a vector $s\in\mathbb R^d$, we need to estimate the largest possible absolute value $g(n)$ of an entry over all vectors obtained from applying $n-1$ applications of $*$ to $n$ instances of $s$. When the coefficients of $*$ are nonnegative and the entries of $s$ are positive, the value $g(n)$ is known to follow a growth rate $\lambda=\lim_{n\to\infty} \sqrt[n]{g(n)}$. In this article, we prove that for such $*$ and $s$ there exist nonnegative numbers $r,r'$ and positive numbers $a,a'$ so that for every $n$,
  \[
  a n^{-r}\lambda^n\le g(n)\le a' n^{r'}\lambda^n.
  \]
  While proving the upper bound, we actually also provide another approach in proving the limit $\lambda$ itself. The lower bound is proved by showing a certain form of submultiplicativity for $g(n)$. Corollaries include a lower bound and an upper bound for $\lambda$, which are followed by a good estimation of $\lambda$ when we have the value of $g(n)$ for an $n$ large enough.</description>

Abstract: A cosmological polytope is a lattice polytope introduced by Arkani-Hamed, Benincasa, and Postnikov in their study of the wavefunction of the universe in a class of cosmological models. More concretely, they construct a cosmological polytope for any Feynman diagram, i.e. an undirected graph. In this paper, we initiate a combinatorial study of these polytopes. We give a complete description of their faces, identify minimal faces that are not simplices and compute the number of faces in specific instances. In particular, we give a recursive description of the $f$-vector of cosmological polytopes of trees.</description>

      <title>Relative Fractional Independence Number and Its Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06155v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the relative fractional independence number of a graph $G$ with respect to another graph $H$, as $$\alpha^*(G|H)=\max_{W}\frac{\alpha(G\boxtimes W)}{\alpha(H\boxtimes W)},$$ where the maximum is taken over all graphs $W$, $G\boxtimes W$ is the strong product of $G$ and $W$, and $\alpha$ denotes the independence number. We give a non-trivial linear program to compute $\alpha^*(G|H)$ and discuss some of its properties. We show that $\alpha^*(G|H)\geq \frac{X(G)}{X(H)} \geq \frac{1}{\alpha^*(H|G)},$ where $X(G)$ can be the independence number, the zero-error Shannon capacity, the fractional independence number, the Lov\'{a}sz number, or the Schrijver's or Szegedy's variants of the Lov\'{a}sz number of a graph $G$. This inequality is the first explicit non-trivial upper bound on the ratio of the invariants of two arbitrary graphs, as mentioned earlier, which can also be used to obtain upper or lower bounds for these invariants. As explicit applications, we present new upper bounds for the ratio of the zero-error Shannon capacity of two Cayley graphs and compute new lower bounds on the Shannon capacity of certain Johnson graphs (yielding the exact value of their Haemers number). Moreover, we show that $\alpha^*(G|H)$ can be used to present a stronger version of the well-known No-Homomorphism Lemma.</description>

      <title>Scattered trinomials of $\mathbb{F}_{q^6}[X]$ in even characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12829v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, several families of scattered polynomials have been investigated in the literature. However, most of them only exist in odd characteristic. In [B. Csajb\'ok, G. Marino and F. Zullo: New maximum scattered linear sets of the projective line, Finite Fields Appl. 54 (2018), 133-150; G. Marino, M. Montanucci and F. Zullo: MRD-codes arising from the trinomial $x^q+x^{q^3}+cx^{q^5}\in\mathbb{F}_{q^6}[x]$, Linear Algebra Appl. 591 (2020), 99-114], the authors proved that the trinomial $f_c(X)=X^{q}+X^{q^{3}}+cX^{q^{5}}$ of $\mathbb{F}_{q^6}[X]$ is scattered under the assumptions that $q$ is odd and $c^2+c=1$. They also explicitly observed that this is false when $q$ is even. In this paper, we provide a different set of conditions on $c$ for which this trinomial is scattered in the case of even $q$. Using tools of algebraic geometry in positive characteristic, we show that when $q$ is even and sufficiently large, there are roughly $q^3$ elements $c \in \mathbb{F}_{q^6}$ such that $f_{c}(X)$ is scattered. Also, we prove that the corresponding MRD-codes and $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear sets of $\mathrm{PG}(1,q^6)$ are not equivalent to the previously known ones.</description>

      <title>Sparse graph counting and Kelley-Meka bounds for binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12248v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent breakthrough, Kelley and Meka (FOCS 2023) obtained a strong upper bound on the density of sets of integers without nontrivial three-term arithmetic progressions. In this work, we extend their result, establishing similar bounds for all linear patterns defined by binary systems of linear forms, where "binary" indicates that every linear form depends on exactly two variables. Prior to our work, no strong bounds were known for such systems even in the finite field model setting. A key ingredient in our proof is a graph counting lemma. The classical graph counting lemma, developed by Thomason (Random Graphs 1985) and Chung, Graham, and Wilson (Combinatorica 1989), is a fundamental tool in combinatorics. For a fixed graph $H$, it states that the number of copies of $H$ in a pseudorandom graph $G$ is similar to the number of copies of $H$ in a purely random graph with the same edge density as $G$. However, this lemma is only non-trivial when $G$ is a dense graph. In this work, we prove a graph counting lemma that is also effective when $G$ is sparse. Moreover, our lemma is well-suited for density increment arguments in additive number theory. As an immediate application, we obtain a strong bound for the Tur\'an problem in abelian Cayley sum graphs: let $\Gamma$ be a finite abelian group with odd order. If a Cayley sum graph on $\Gamma$ does not contain any $r$-clique as a subgraph, it must have at most $2^{-\Omega_r(\log^{1/16}|\Gamma|)}\cdot |\Gamma|^2$ edges. These results hinge on the technology developed by Kelley and Meka and the follow-up work by Kelley, Lovett, and Meka (STOC 2024).</description>

      <title>Edge coloring of products of signed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2020, Behr defined the problem of edge coloring of signed graphs and showed that every signed graph $(G, \sigma)$ can be colored using exactly $\Delta(G)$ or $\Delta(G) + 1$ colors, where $\Delta(G)$ is the maximum degree in graph $G$.
  In this paper, we focus on products of signed graphs. We recall the definitions of the Cartesian, tensor, strong, and corona products of signed graphs and prove results for them. In particular, we show that $(1)$ the Cartesian product of $\Delta$-edge-colorable signed graphs is $\Delta$-edge-colorable, $(2)$ the tensor product of a $\Delta$-edge-colorable signed graph and a signed tree requires only $\Delta$ colors and $(3)$ the corona product of almost any two signed graphs is $\Delta$-edge-colorable. We also prove some results related to the coloring of products of signed paths and cycles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In his important 1920 paper on partitions, MacMahon defined the partition generating functions \begin{align*} A_k(q)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\mathfrak{m}(k;n)q^n&amp;:=\sum_{0&lt; s_1&lt;s_2&lt;\cdots&lt;s_k} \frac{q^{s_1+s_2+\cdots+s_k}}{(1-q^{s_1})^2(1-q^{s_2})^2\cdots(1-q^{s_k})^2},\\ C_k(q)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \mathfrak{m}_{odd}(k;n)q^n&amp;:=\sum_{0&lt; s_1&lt;s_2&lt;\cdots&lt;s_k} \frac{q^{2s_1+2s_2+\cdots+2s_k-k}}{(1-q^{2s_1-1})^2(1-q^{2s_2-1})^2\cdots(1-q^{2s_k-1})^2}. \end{align*} These series give infinitely many formulas for two prominent generating functions. For each non-negative $k$, we prove that $A_k(q), A_{k+1}(q), A_{k+2}(q),\dots$ (resp. $C_k(q), C_{k+1}(q), C_{k+2}(q),\dots$) give the generating function for the 3-colored partition function $p_3(n)$ (resp. the overpartition function $\overline{p}(n)$).</description>

      <title>Three Examples of Quasisymmetric Compatible $\mathfrak{S}_n$-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Schur functions, a basis for the symmetric polynomials (Sym), encode the irreducible representations of the symmetric group, $\mathfrak{S}_n$, via the Frobenius characteristic map. In 1996, Krob and Thibon defined a quasisymmetric Frobenius map on the representations of $\mathcal{H}_n(0)$, mapping them to the quasisymmetric functions (QSym). Despite the obvious inclusion of Sym in QSym and the close relationship between $\mathfrak{S}_n$ and $\mathcal{H}_n(0)$, there is no known direct link between these two Frobenius characteristic maps and the related representations. We explore three specific situations in which a deformation of an $\mathfrak{S}_n$ action results in a valid $\mathcal{H}_n(0)$ action and gives a quasisymmetric Frobenius characteristic that is equal to the symmetric Frobenius characteristic. We introduce the concept of quasisymmetric compatibility, which formalizes a link between the two maps, and we show it applies to all $\mathfrak{S}_n$-modules.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing a pseudotree from the distance matrix of its boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04039v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A vertex $v$ of a connected graph $G$ is said to be a boundary vertex of $G$ if for some other vertex $u$ of $G$, no neighbor of $v$ is further away from $u$ than $v$. The boundary $\partial(G)$ of $G$ is the set of all of its boundary vertices. The distance matrix $\hat{D}_G$ of the boundary of a graph $G$ is the square matrix of order $\kappa$, being $\kappa$ the order of $\partial(G)$, such that for every $i,j\in \partial(G)$, $[\hat{D}_G]_{ij}=d_G(i,j)$. Given a square matrix $\hat{B}$ of order $\kappa$, we prove under which conditions $\hat{B}$ is the distance matrix $\hat{D}_T$ of the set of leaves of a tree $T$, which is precisely its boundary. We show that if $G$ is either a tree or a unicyclic graph with girth $g\geq 5$ vertices, then $G$ is uniquely determined by the distance matrix $\hat{D}_{G}$ of the boundary of $G$ and we also conjecture that this statement holds for every connected graph. Moreover, two algorithms for reconstructing a tree and a unicyclic graph from the distance matrix of their boundaries are given, whose time complexities in the worst case are, respectively, $O(\kappa n)$ and $O(n^2)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08781v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A totally efficient coloring of a regular graph with color set formed by one unit more than its degree is a total coloring in which each vertex color class is an efficient dominating set, that is a perfect code. We find that the 3-cube graph has a totally efficient coloring and conjecture that this is the only existing case of a totally effective coloring. We also deal with a related problem exemplified by star transposition graphs and related graphs, leading to edge-girth colorings on their prism graphs.</description>

      <title>Generic spectrum of the weighted Laplacian operator on Cayley graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2009.07908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the spectrum of a class of weighted Laplacians on Cayley graphs and determine under what conditions the corresponding eigenspaces are generically irreducible. Specifically, we analyze the spectrum on left-invariant Cayley graphs endowed with an invariant metric, and we give some criteria for generically irreducible eigenspaces. Additionally, we introduce an operator that is comparable to the Laplacian and show that the same criterion holds.</description>

      <title>Topological recursion for Kadomtsev-Petviashvili tau functions of hypergeometric type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.14723v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $n$-point differentials corresponding to Kadomtsev-Petviashvili tau functions of hypergeometric type (also known as Orlov-Scherbin partition functions), with an emphasis on their $\hbar^2$-deformations and expansions. Under the naturally required analytic assumptions, we prove certain higher loop equations that, in particular, contain the standard linear and quadratic loop equations, and thus imply the blobbed topological recursion. We also distinguish two large families of the Orlov-Scherbin partition functions that do satisfy the natural analytic assumptions, and for these families we prove in addition the so-called projection property and thus the full statement of the Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin topological recursion. A particular feature of our argument is that it clarifies completely the role of $\hbar^2$-deformations of the Orlov-Scherbin parameters for the partition functions, whose necessity was known from a variety of earlier obtained results in this direction but never properly understood in the context of topological recursion. As special cases of the results of this paper one recovers new and uniform proofs of the topological recursion to all previously studied cases of enumerative problems related to weighted double Hurwitz numbers. By virtue of topological recursion and the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch formula this, in turn, gives new and uniform proofs of almost all ELSV-type formulas discussed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Aspect Ratio Universal Rectangular Layouts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.03242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A \emph{generic rectangular layout} (for short, \emph{layout}) is a subdivision of an axis-aligned rectangle into axis-aligned rectangles, no four of which have a point in common. Such layouts are used in data visualization and in cartography. The contacts between the rectangles represent semantic or geographic relations. A layout is weakly (strongly) \emph{aspect ratio universal} if any assignment of aspect ratios to rectangles can be realized by a weakly (strongly) equivalent layout. We give combinatorial characterizations for weakly and strongly aspect ratio universal layouts. Furthermore, we describe a quadratic-time algorithm that decides whether a given graph is the dual graph of a strongly aspect ratio universal layout, and finds such a layout if one exists.</description>

      <title>Efficient Construction of Long Orientable Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An orientable sequence of order $n$ is a cyclic binary sequence such that each length-$n$ substring appears at most once \emph{in either direction}. Maximal length orientable sequences are known only for $n\leq 7$, and a trivial upper bound on their length is $2^{n-1} - 2^{\lfloor(n-1)/2\rfloor}$. This paper presents the first efficient algorithm to construct orientable sequences with asymptotically optimal length; more specifically, our algorithm constructs orientable sequences via cycle-joining and a successor-rule approach requiring $O(n)$ time per symbol and $O(n)$ space. This answers a longstanding open question from Dai, Martin, Robshaw, Wild [Cryptography and Coding III (1993)]. Our sequences are applied to find new longest-known orientable sequences for $n\leq 20$.</description>
