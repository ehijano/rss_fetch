      <title>Continuous Donoho-Elad Spark Uncertainty Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Donoho and Elad \textit{[Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 2003]} introduced the important notion of the spark of a frame, using which they derived a fundamental uncertainty principle. Based on spark, they also provided a necessary and sufficient condition for the uniqueness of sparse solutions to the NP-hard $\ell_0$-minimization problem. In this nano note, we show that the notion of spark can be extended to linear maps whose domains are measure spaces. Using this generalization, we derive an uncertainty principle and provide a sufficient condition for the existence of sparse solutions to linear systems on measure spaces.</description>

      <title>Carleman Linearization of Differential-Algebraic Equations Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carleman linearization is a mathematical technique that transforms nonlinear dynamical systems into infinite-dimensional linear systems, enabling simplified analysis. Initially developed for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and later extended to partial differential equations (PDEs), it has found applications in control theory, biological systems, fluid dynamics, quantum mechanics, finance, and machine learning. This paper extends Carleman linearization to differential-algebraic equation (DAE) systems by introducing auxiliary functions and projecting the resulting system onto a higher-order ODE representation. Theoretical foundations are presented along with conditions under which the transformation is valid. The method is demonstrated on synthetic DAE examples, highlighting its effectiveness even when projection from algebraic variables to state variables is nontrivial or undefined.</description>

      <title>Latent-Space Mean-Field Theory for Deep BitNet-like Training: Constrained Gradient Flows with Smooth Quantization and STE Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops a mean-field analysis for the asymptotic behavior of deep BitNet-like architectures as smooth quantization parameters approach zero. We establish that empirical measures of latent weights converge weakly to solutions of constrained continuity equations under vanishing quantization smoothing. Our main theoretical contribution demonstrates that the natural exponential decay in smooth quantization cancels out apparent singularities, yielding uniform bounds on mean-field dynamics independent of smoothing parameters. Under standard regularity assumptions, we prove convergence to a well-defined limit that provides the mathematical foundation for gradient-based training of quantized neural networks through distributional analysis.</description>

      <title>Boundary Stabilization of a Bending and Twisting Wing by Linear Quadratic Gaussian Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first consider the stabilization of the bending and twisting of a rectangular cantilever beam of moderate to high aspect ratio using full state feedback boundary control. Our approach is an infinite dimesnional extension of Linear Quadratic Regulation (LQR). The we develop an infinite dimensional Kalman filter that processes two point measurements and returns an estimate of the full state. The Linear Quadartuc Gaussian approach is to use this estimate in the place of the full state in the LQR feedback
  Then we add aerodynamic forces to obtain a model of a wing. The aerodyamic model is based on a two dimensional state space approximate realiztion of Wagner's indicial function by R.~T.~Jones.</description>

      <title>Distributed Combined Space Partitioning and Network Flow Optimization: an Optimal Transport Approach (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a combined space partitioning and network flow optimization problem, with applications to large-scale power, transportation, or communication systems. In dense wireless networks, one may want to simultaneously optimize the assignment of many spatially distributed users to base stations and route the resulting communication traffic through the backbone network. We formulate the overall problem by coupling a semi-discrete optimal transport (SDOT) problem, capturing the space partitioning component, with a minimum-cost flow problem on a discrete network. This formulation jointly optimizes the assignment of a continuous demand distribution to certain endpoint network nodes and the routing of flows over the network to serve the demand, under capacity constraints. As for SDOT problems, we show that the formulation of our problem admits a tight relaxation taking the form of an infinite-dimensional linear program, derive a finite-dimensional dual problem, and show that strong duality holds. We leverage these results to design a distributed dual gradient ascent algorithm to solve the problem, where nodes in the graph perform computations based solely on locally available information. Simulation results illustrate the algorithm performance and its applicability to an electric power distribution network reconfiguration problem. This version extends the CDC 2025 conference paper with additional proof sketches.</description>

      <title>Stability Constrained Optimal Vessel Loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the revenue maximizing loading for the single voyage of a cargo vessel where metacentric stability is taken into account. We formulate the problem as a maximization of a linear function with two linear and one quadratic constraint. The quadratic form in the constraint can be definite if heavier loads are to be placed low, but not otherwise. We consider a vessel similar to a 3500 TEU container carrier and perform several calculations using a Generalized Reduced Gradient commercial solver.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Proximal Dogleg Majorization for Sparse Regularized Quadratic Optimization Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problems of minimizing the sum of a quadratic function and a proximal-friendly nonconvex nonsmooth function. While the existing Proximal Dogleg Opportunistic Majorization (PDOM) algorithm for these problems offers computational efficiency by minimizing opportunistic majorization subproblems along mixed Newton directions and requiring only a single Hessian inversion, its convergence rate is limited due to the nonconvex nonsmooth regularization term, and its theoretical analysis is restricted to local convergence. To overcome these limitations, we firstly propose a novel algorithm named PDOM with extrapolation (PDOME). Its core innovations lie in two key aspects: (1) the integration of an extrapolation strategy into the construction of the hybrid Newton direction, and (2) the enhancement of the line search mechanism. Furthermore, we establish the global convergence of the entire sequence generated by PDOME to a critical point and derive its convergence rate under the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) property. Numerical experiments demonstrate that PDOME achieves faster convergence and tends to converge to a better local optimum compared to the original PDOM.</description>

      <title>AS-BOX: Additional Sampling Method for Weighted Sum Problems with Box Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A class of optimization problems characterized by a weighted finite-sum objective function subject to box constraints is considered. We propose a novel stochastic optimization method, named AS-BOX (\text{A}ddi\-ti\-onal \text{S}ampling for \text{BOX} constraints), that combines projected gradient directions with adaptive variable sample size strategies and nonmonotone line search. The method dynamically adjusts the batch size based on progress with respect to the additional sampling function and on structural consistency of the projected direction, enabling practical adaptivity of AS-BOX, while ensuring theoretical support. We establish almost sure convergence under standard assumptions and provide complexity bounds. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and competitiveness of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Dynamic control of stochastic matching systems in heavy traffic: An effective computational method for high-dimensional problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bipartite matching systems arise in many settings where agents or tasks from two distinct sets must be paired dynamically under compatibility constraints. We consider a high-dimensional bipartite matching system under uncertainty and seek an effective dynamic control policy that maximizes the expected discounted total value generated by the matches minus the congestion-related costs. To derive a tractable approximation, we focus attention on balanced, high-volume systems, i.e., the heavy-traffic regime, and derive an approximating Brownian control problem. We then develop a computational method that relies on deep neural network technology for solving this problem. To show the effectiveness of the policy derived from our computational method, we compare it to the benchmark policies available in the extant literature in the context of the original matching problem. In the test problems attempted thus far, our proposed policy outperforms the benchmarks, and its derivation is computationally feasible for dimensions up to 100 or more.</description>

      <title>Active-Set Identification in Noisy and Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying active constraints from a point near an optimal solution is important both theoretically and practically in constrained continuous optimization, as it can help identify optimal Lagrange multipliers and essentially reduces an inequality-constrained problem to an equality-constrained one. Traditional active-set identification guarantees have been proved under assumptions of smoothness and constraint qualifications, and assume exact function and derivative values. This work extends these results to settings when both objective and constraint function and derivative values have deterministic or stochastic noise. Two strategies are proposed that, under mild conditions, are proved to identify the active set of a local minimizer correctly when a point is close enough to the local minimizer and the noise is sufficiently small. Guarantees are also stated for the use of active-set identification strategies within a stochastic algorithm. We demonstrate our findings with two simple illustrative examples and a more realistic constrained neural-network training task.</description>

      <title>Sharp-Peak Functions for Exactly Penalizing Binary Integer Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unconstrained binary integer programming (UBIP) is a challenging optimization problem due to the presence of binary variables. To address the challenge, we introduce a novel class of functions named sharp-peak functions (SPFs), which equivalently reformulate the binary constraints as equality constraints, giving rise to an SPF-constrained optimization. Rather than solving this constrained reformulation directly, we focus on its associated penalty model. The established exact penalty theory shows that the global minimizers of UBIP and the penalty model coincide when the penalty parameter exceeds a threshold, a constant independent of the solution set of UBIP. To analyze the penalty model, we introduce Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) points and a new type of stationarity, referred to as P-stationarity, and provide a comprehensive characterization of its optimality conditions. We then develop an efficient algorithm called ShaPeak based on the inexact alternating direction methods of multipliers, which is guaranteed to converge to a P-stationary point at a linear rate under appropriate parameter choices and a single mild assumption, namely, the local Lipschitz continuity of the gradient over a bounded box. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate the high performance of ShaPeak in comparison to several established solvers.</description>

      <title>Convergence Rates of Time Discretization in Extended Mean Field Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Piecewise constant control approximation provides a practical framework for designing numerical schemes of continuous-time control problems. We analyze the accuracy of such approximations for extended mean field control (MFC) problems, where the dynamics and costs depend on the joint distribution of states and controls. For linear-convex extended MFC problems, we show that the optimal control is $1/2$-H\"older continuous in time. Using this regularity, we prove that the optimal cost of the continuous-time problem can be approximated by piecewise constant controls with order $1/2$, while the optimal control itself can be approximated with order $1/4$. For general extended MFC problems, we further show that, under sufficient regularity of the value functions, the value functions converge with an improved first-order rate, matching the best-known rate for classical control problems without mean field interaction, and consistent with the numerical observations for MFC of Cucker-Smale models.</description>

      <title>A Surrogate Framework for General Cruise-Phase Optimization of Commercial Aircraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing commercial aircraft cruise trajectories using the Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) is particularly challenging due to the nonlinear dynamics of aircraft speed, complex costate dynamics, and the inclusion of two continuous controls, one of which (thrust) is typically a singular, affine input. We present a surrogate optimization framework, accounting for space-dependent wind fields, flight-sensitive areas, and equality/inequality constraints. To simulate atmospheric wind, we propose a divergence-free composite inviscid flow model showing structural consistency with large-scale patterns observed in atmospheric wind datasets. Flight-sensitive areas are clustered as parametrized ellipses, considered as soft constraints. Building on turnpike property, the surrogate framework enforces quasi-steady aircraft speed on infinitesimal segments, thereby eliminating the thrust control and treating speed as a direct control. Comprehensive numerical experiments on various setups confirm that the surrogate framework reproduces optimal solutions identical to those of the original problem while significantly reducing computational time and implementation efforts. The accompanying \textbf{supplementary material} includes implementation details and open-source code (with interactive built-in and user-defined environments for aircraft and wind functions, and for flight-sensitive areas), together with an additional example that examines wind-induced variability in optimal solutions via Monte Carlo analysis enabled by the high-speed PMP-based surrogate framework.</description>

      <title>Approximation of Discrete-Time Infinite-Horizon Mean-Field Equilibria via Finite-Horizon Mean-Field Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address in this paper a fundamental question that arises in mean-field games (MFGs), namely whether mean-field equilibria (MFE) for discrete-time finite-horizon MFGs can be used to obtain approximate stationary as well as non-stationary MFE for similarly structured infinite-horizon MFGs. We provide a rigorous analysis of this relationship, and show that any accumulation point of MFE of a discounted finite-horizon MFG constitutes, under weak convergence as the time horizon goes to infinity, a non-stationary MFE for the corresponding infinite-horizon MFG. Further, under certain conditions, these non-stationary MFE converge to a stationary MFE, establishing the appealing result that finite-horizon MFE can serve as approximations for stationary MFE. Additionally, we establish improved contraction rates for iterative methods used to compute regularized MFE in finite-horizon settings, extending existing results in the literature. As a byproduct, we obtain that when two MFGs have finite-horizon MFE that are close to each other, the corresponding stationary MFE are also close. As one application of the theoretical results, we show that finite-horizon MFGs can facilitate learning-based approaches to approximate infinite-horizon MFE when system components are unknown. Under further assumptions on the Lipschitz coefficients of the regularized system components (which are stronger than contractivity of finite-horizon MFGs), we obtain exponentially decaying finite-time error bounds-- in the time horizon--between finite-horizon non-stationary, infinite-horizon non-stationary, and stationary MFE. As a byproduct of our error bounds, we present a new uniqueness criterion for infinite-horizon nonstationary MFE beyond the available contraction results in the literature.</description>

      <title>Optimal control of SDEs with merely measurable drift: an HJB approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an optimal control problem for a diffusion whose drift and running cost are merely measurable in the state variable. Such low regularity rules out the use of Pontryagin's maximum principle and also invalidates the standard proof of the Bellman principle of optimality. We address these difficulties by analyzing the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. Using PDE techniques together with a policy iteration scheme, we prove that the HJB equation admits a unique strong solution, and this solution coincides with the value function of the control problem. Based on this identification, we establish a verification theorem and recover the Bellman optimality principle without imposing any additional smoothness assumptions.
  We further investigate a mollification scheme depending on a parameter $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. It turns out that the smoothed value functions $V_{\varepsilon}$ may fail to converge to the original value function $V$ as $\varepsilon \to 0$, and we provide an explicit counterexample. To resolve this, we identify a structural condition on the control set. When the control set is countable, convergence $V_{\varepsilon} \to V$ holds locally uniformly.</description>

      <title>Is Noisy Data a Blessing in Disguise? A Distributionally Robust Optimization Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noisy data are often viewed as a challenge for decision-making. This paper studies a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) that shows how such noise can be systematically incorporated. Rather than applying DRO to the noisy empirical distribution, we construct ambiguity sets over the \emph{latent} distribution by centering a Wasserstein ball at the noisy empirical distribution in the observation space and taking its inverse image through a known noise kernel. We validate this inverse-image construction by deriving a tractable convex reformulation and establishing rigorous statistical guarantees, including finite-sample performance and asymptotic consistency. Crucially, we demonstrate that, under mild conditions, noisy data may be a ``blessing in disguise." Our noisy-data DRO model is less conservative than its direct counterpart, leading to provably higher optimal values and a lower price of ambiguity. In the context of fair resource allocation problems, we demonstrate that this robust approach can induce solutions that are structurally more equitable. Our findings suggest that managers can leverage uncertainty by harnessing noise as a source of robustness rather than treating it as an obstacle, producing more robust and strategically balanced decisions.</description>

Abstract: In this work is discussed the paper by Osuna-Gomez, Beato-Moreno and Rufian-Lizana, Generalized convexity in multiobjective programming: J. Math. Anal. Appl., v. 233 (1999) pp. 205--220. We point out an error in the proofs of main Theorems 2.4 and 3.6 in this reference. Then we derive correct proofs, which are based on a different approach, because the scheme of the proofs of the authors is not applicable. As a result of the discussion two additional theorems are obtained such that the scheme of the proofs of Theorems 2.4 and 3.6 in the mentioned reference works for them.</description>

      <title>A Correspondence-Driven Approach for Bilevel Decision-making with Nonconvex Lower-Level Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider bilevel optimization problems with general nonconvex lower-level objectives and show that the classical hyperfunction-based formulation is unsettled, since the global minimizer of the lower-level problem is generally unattainable. To address this issue, we propose a correspondence-driven hyperfunction $\phi^{\text{cd}}$. In this formulation, the follower is modeled not as a rational agent always attaining a global minimizer, but as an algorithm-based bounded rational agent whose decisions are produced by a fixed algorithm with initialization and step size. Since $\phi^{\text{cd}}$ is generally discontinuous, we apply Gaussian smoothing to obtain a smooth approximation $\phi^{\text{cd}}_\xi$, then show that its value and gradient converge to those of $\phi^{\text{cd}}$. In the nonconvex setting, we identify that bifurcation phenomena, which arise when $g(x,\cdot)$ has a degenerate stationary point, pose a key challenge for hyperfunction-based methods. This is especially the case when $\phi^{\text{cd}}_\xi$ is solved using gradient methods. To overcome this challenge, we analyze the geometric structure of the bifurcation set under some weak assumptions. Building on these results, we design a biased projected SGD-based algorithm SCiNBiO to solve $\phi^{\text{cd}}_\xi$ with a cubic-regularized Newton lower-level solver. We also provide convergence guarantees and oracle complexity bounds for the upper level. Finally, we connect bifurcation theory from dynamical systems to the bilevel setting and define the notion of fold bifurcation points in this setting. Under the assumption that all degenerate stationary points are fold bifurcation points, we establish the oracle complexity of SCiNBiO for the lower-level problem.</description>

      <title>Subgradient Splitting Methods for Nonsmooth Fractional Programming with Fixed-Point Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of nonsmooth fractional programming problems with fixed-point constraints, where the numerator is convex and the denominator is concave. To solve this problem, we propose splitting algorithms that compute subgradient steps separately for the convex numerator and the concave denominator. These methods offer a straightforward approach by eliminating the need to solve subproblems at each iteration. By leveraging fixed-point constraints, the proposed algorithms are particularly well-suited for problems with complex constraint structures. Under certain assumptions, we establish the convergence of the proposed methods. Furthermore, to address large-scale optimization, we propose an incremental subgradient algorithm for a class of nonsmooth sum-of-ratios fractional programming problems and analyze its convergence. Finally, we present numerical experiments, including comparative analyses of our algorithms with existing methods, to demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Non-SOS Positivstellens\"atze for semi-algebraic sets defined by polynomial matrix inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes new Positivstellens\"atze for polynomials that are positive on sets defined by polynomial matrix inequalities (PMIs). We extend the classical Handelman and Krivine-Stengle theorems from the scalar inequality setting to the matrix context, deriving explicit certificate forms that do not rely on sums-of-squares (SOS). Specifically, we show that under certain conditions, any polynomial positive on a PMI-defined semialgebraic set admits a representation using Kronecker powers of the defining matrix (or its dilated form) with positive semidefinite coefficient matrices. Under correlative sparsity pattern, we further prove more efficient, sparse representations that significantly reduce computational complexity. By applying these results to polynomial optimization with PMI constraints, we construct a hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations whose size depends only on the dimension of the constraint matrix, and not on the number of variables. Consequently, our relaxations may remain computationally feasible for problems with large number of variables and low-dimensional matrix constraints, offering a practical alternative where the traditional SOS-based relaxations become intractable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes and studies the distributed resource allocation problem in asynchronous and stochastic settings. We consider a distributed system with multiple workers and a coordinating server with heterogeneous computation and communication times. We explore an approximate stochastic primal-dual approach with the aim of 1) adhering to the resource budget constraints, 2) allowing for the asynchronicity between the workers and the server, and 3) relying on the locally available stochastic gradients. We analyze our Asynchronous stochastic Primal-Dual (Asyn-PD) algorithm and prove its convergence in the second moment to the saddle point solution of the approximate problem at the rate of $O(1/t)$, where $t$ is the iteration number. Furthermore, we verify our algorithm numerically to validate the analytically derived convergence results, and demonstrate the advantages of utilizing our asynchronous algorithm rather than deploying a synchronous algorithm where the server must wait until it gets update from all workers.</description>

      <title>On a closed-loop identification challenge in feedback optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feedback optimization has emerged as an effective strategy for steady-state optimization of dynamical systems. By exploiting models of the steady-state input-output sensitivity, methods of this type are often sample efficient, and their use of feedback ensures that they are robust against model error. Still, this robustness has its limitations, and the dependence on a model may hinder convergence in settings with high model error. We investigate here the effect of a particular type of model error: bias due to identifying the model from closed-loop data. Our main results are a sufficient convergence condition, and a converse divergence condition. The convergence condition requires a matrix which depends on the closed-loop sensitivity and a noise-to-signal ratio of the data generating system to be positive definite. The negative definiteness of the same matrix characterizes an extreme case where the bias due to closed-loop data results in divergence of model-based feedback optimization.</description>

      <title>Radial Epiderivative Based Fritz John and KKT Conditions in Nonsmooth Nonconvex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we examine Fritz John (FJ) and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) type optimality conditions for a class of nonsmooth and nonconvex optimization problems with inequality constraints, where the objective and constraint functions all are assumed to be radially epidifferentiable. The concept of the radial epiderivative constitutes a distinct generalization of classical derivative notions, as it replaces the conventional limit operation with an infimum-based construction. This formulation permits the analysis of directional behavior without invoking standard neighborhood-based assumptions and constructions commonly required in generalized differentiation. This leads to one of the key advantages of the radial epiderivative which lies in its applicability even to discrete domains, where classical and generalized derivatives are often inapplicable or undefined. The other advantage of this concept is that it provides a possibility to inverstigate KKT conditions for global minimums. Consequently, this approach necessitates a reformulation of fundamental analytical tools such as gradient vectors, feasible direction sets, constraint qualifications and other concepts which are central to the derivation of optimality conditions in smooth optimization theory. The primary contribution of this paper is the development of a comprehensive theoretical framework for KKT conditions tailored to the radially epidifferentiable setting. We introduce novel definitions of the radial gradient vector, of the set of feasible directions, and examine how classical constraint qualifications may be interpreted and extended within this new framework.</description>

      <title>Positively not SOS: pseudo-moments and extreme rays in exact arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A polynomial that is a sum of squares (SOS) of other polynomials is evidently positive. The converse is not true, there are positive polynomials which are not SOS. This note focuses on the problem of certifying, in exact arithmetic, that a given positive polynomial is not SOS. Using convex duality, this can be achieved by constructing a separating linear functional called a pseudo-moment certificate. We present constructive procedures to compute such certificates with rational coefficients for several famous forms (homogeneous polynomials) that are known to be positive but not SOS. Our method leverages polynomial symmetries to reduce the problem size and provides explicit integer-based formulas for generating these rational certificates. As a by-product, we can also generate extreme rays of the pseudomoment cone in exact arithmetic.</description>

      <title>Predictive Control Strategies for Sustaining Innovation Adoption on Multilayer Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies an optimal control problem for an adoption-opinion model that couples innovation adoption with opinion formation on a multilayer network. Adoption spreads through social contagion and perceived benefits, while opinions evolve via social interactions and feedback from adoption levels. Individuals may abandon adoption due to dissatisfaction or external constraints, potentially hindering diffusion. We analyze system equilibria and their stability, identifying conditions under which adoption persists. We introduce a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy that dynamically adapts interventions to the predicted system evolution. Three types of control are compared: shaping opinions, acting on the adoption rate, and reducing dissatisfaction. Overall, MPC interventions outperform static constant control, achieving higher adoption at comparable or lower cost. These results highlight the potential of predictive, adaptive strategies to support sustainable behavior diffusion, offering policymakers scalable tools for effective interventions.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to system identification for nonlinear input-output models by minimizing the simulation error and formulating it as a constrained optimization problem. This method addresses vanishing gradient issues, enabling faster convergence than traditional gradient-based methods. We present an algorithm that utilizes feedback-linearization controlled multipliers optimization and provide a theoretical analysis of its performance. We prove that the algorithm converges to a local minimum, and we optimize the computational efficiency by leveraging the problem structure. Numerical experiments illustrate that our approach outperforms gradient-based methods in computational effort and accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate optimal control problems governed by the elliptic partial differential equation $-\Delta u=f$ subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions on a given domain $\Omega$. The control variable in this setting is the right-hand side $f$, and the objective is to minimize a cost functional that depends simultaneously on the control $f$ and on the associated state function $u$.
  We establish the existence of optimal controls and analyze their qualitative properties by deriving necessary conditions for optimality. In particular, when pointwise constraints of the form $\alpha\le f\le\beta$ are imposed a priori on the control, we examine situations where a {\it bang-bang} phenomenon arises, that is where the optimal control $f$ assumes only the extremal values $\alpha$ and $\beta$. More precisely, the control takes the form $f=\alpha1_E+\beta1_{\Omega\setminus E}$, thereby placing the problem within the framework of shape optimization. Under suitable assumptions, we further establish certain regularity properties for the optimal sets $E$.
  Finally, in the last part of the paper, we present numerical simulations that illustrate our theoretical findings through a selection of representative examples.</description>

      <title>Trust-region Filter Algorithms utilising Hessian Information for Grey-Box Optimisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimising industrial processes is essential for enhancing profitability, efficiency, and sustainability. Conventional optimisation relies on equation-oriented (EO) glass-box models with fully specified equations and accessible derivatives. However, many real-world systems contain black-box components (such as high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulators or proprietary unit models) that lack explicit formulations or analytic gradients. This limits the applicability of derivative-based deterministic optimisation on grey-box (glass-box/black-box) problems. The classical trust-region filter (TRF) algorithm offers a promising framework for such grey-box optimisation, but often requires adjusting numerous tuning parameters and many black-box evaluations to converge. In this work, we extend the classical TRF method by introducing four new variants that incorporate second-order information through local Hessian projections, improving robustness and reducing sensitivity to tuning parameters. We further integrate a flexible surrogate modelling framework, enabling the optimiser to switch between low-fidelity (linear, quadratic, simplified quadratic) and high-fidelity (Taylor series, Gaussian process) surrogates for local approximation of black-box components. Performance is benchmarked on a suite of 25 grey-box test problems and several engineering case studies, including liquid-liquid extraction, pressure vessel design, alkylation process, and spring design. Across all cases, the new variants achieved up to an order-of-magnitude reduction in iterations and black-box evaluations relative to the classical TRF algorithm. These findings demonstrate the new variants as efficient alternatives for grey-box process systems optimisation.</description>

      <title>An intrusion detection system in internet of things using grasshopper optimization algorithm and machine learning algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a foundational paradigm supporting a range of applications, including healthcare, education, agriculture, smart homes, and, more recently, enterprise systems. However, significant advancements in IoT networks have been impeded by security vulnerabilities and threats that, if left unaddressed, could hinder the deployment and operation of IoT based systems. Detecting unwanted activities within the IoT is crucial, as it directly impacts confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Consequently, intrusion detection has become a fundamental research area and the focus of numerous studies. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is essential to the IoTs alarm mechanisms, enabling effective security management. This paper examines IoT security and introduces an intelligent two-layer intrusion detection system for IoT. Machine learning techniques power the system's intelligence, with a two layer structure enhancing intrusion detection. By selecting essential features, the system maintains detection accuracy while minimizing processing overhead. The proposed method for intrusion detection in IoT is implemented in two phases. In the first phase, the Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) is applied for feature selection. In the second phase, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is used to detect intrusions. The method was implemented in MATLAB, and the NSLKDD dataset was used for evaluation. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves accuracy compared to other approaches.</description>

      <title>Compact R-Continuity with Applications to Solving Inclusions and Convergence of Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the notion of compact R-continuity and its specifications for set-valued mappings between Banach spaces. We reveal several important properties of compact R-continuity in general settings and show that in finite dimensions, this notion is supported by the classical \L ojasiewicz inequality for analytic functions. An application of compact R-continuity and the obtained results {is} given to convergence analysis for a broad class of descent algorithms in nonsmooth optimization. We also show that this notion is instrumental for the design and justification of a novel R-class of algorithms to solve inclusion problems.</description>

      <title>Sparse Convex Quantile Regression: A Generalized Benders Decomposition Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a scalable algorithmic framework for sparse convex quantile regression (SCQR), addressing key computational challenges in the literature. Enhancing the classical CQR model, we introduce L2-norm regularization and an epsilon-insensitive zone to improve generalization and mitigate overfitting - both theoretically justified and empirically validated. Based on this extension, we improve the SCQR model and propose the first Generalized Benders Decomposition (GBD) algorithm tailored to this context, further strengthened by a novel local search-based Benders matheuristic. Extensive simulations and a real-world application to Sustainable Development Goals benchmarking demonstrate the accuracy, scalability, and practical value of our approach.</description>

      <title>On Generalized Forward-Reflected-Backward Method for Monotone Inclusion Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we analyze the generalized forward-reflected-backward (GFRB) method, which is an extension of the forward-reflected-backward (FRB) method due to Malitsky and Tam, for solving monotone inclusion problems in real Hilbert spaces. In particular, we study GFRB with an increasing step-size update that does not require prior knowledge of the Lipschitz constant to run the algorithm. In this sequel, we propose an extended version of the primal-dual twice-reflected algorithm (PDTR), which can be derived from GFRB when some metrics are chosen appropriately. Furthermore, for a particular example, we prove that the rate of convergence of GFRB is tight to FRB, and in another example, we improve the rate of convergence of GFRB compared to existing algorithms by choosing proper initial parameters. Finally, we validate the proposed approach on several state-of-the-art problems and demonstrate better numerical performance compared to the existing ones.</description>

      <title>Cancer Detection via Electrical Impedance Tomography and Optimal Control of Elliptic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We pursue a computational analysis of the biomedical problem on the identification of the cancerous tumor at an early stage of development based on the Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) and optimal control of elliptic partial differential equations. Relying on the fact that the electrical conductivity of the cancerous tumor is significantly higher than the conductivity of the healthy tissue, we consider an inverse EIT problem on the identification of the conductivity map in the complete electrode model based on the $m$ current-to-voltage measurements on the boundary electrodes. A variational formulation as a PDE-constrained optimal control problem is introduced based on the novel idea of increasing the size of the input data by adding "voltage-to-current" measurements through various permutations of the single "current-to-voltage" measurement. The idea of permutation preserves the size of the unknown parameters on the expense of increase of the number of PDE constraints. We apply a gradient projection (GPM) method based on the Fr\'echet differentiability in Besov-Hilbert spaces. Numerical simulations of 2D and 3D model examples demonstrate the sharp increase of the resolution of the cancerous tumor by increasing the number of measurements from $m$ to $m^2$</description>

      <title>Multi-period line planning for varying railway passenger demand with asymmetric lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A line plan is an important aspect of the quality of the service provided to railway passengers. Although it is well-known that railway demand is varying throughout the day in volume and structure, the line plan is often still fixed throughout the day. To better match this varying railway demand, we propose a mixed-integer linear programming model for multi-period line planning. This model for railway networks incorporates selection of routes, stopping patterns, frequencies, transfers, and the possibility of asymmetric lines to deal with spatially unbalanced demand. The Epsilon-constraint method is used to determine Pareto optimal solutions. The proposed model and solution method are tested on a case study of part of the Dutch railway network. The results show that allowing for changes to the line plan during the day can reduce the total generalised journey time by up to 4.26%, especially when asymmetric lines are used.</description>

      <title>Online Complexity Estimation for Repetitive Scenario Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of repetitive scenario design where one has to solve repeatedly a scenario design problem and can adjust the sample size (number of scenarios) to obtain a desired level of risk (constraint violation probability). We propose an approach to learn on the fly the optimal sample size based on observed data consisting in previous scenario solutions and their risk level. Our approach consists in learning a function that represents the pdf (probability density function) of the risk as a function of the sample size. Once this function is known, retrieving the optimal sample size is straightforward. We prove the soundness and convergence of our approach to obtain the optimal sample size for the class of fixed-complexity scenario problems, which generalizes fully-supported convex scenario programs that have been studied extensively in the scenario optimization literature. We also demonstrate the practical efficiency of our approach on a series of challenging repetitive scenario design problems, including non-fixed-complexity problems, nonconvex constraints and time-varying distributions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Simulation Budget Allocation Under Unknown Sampling Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ranking and selection problem is a popular framework in the simulation literature for studying optimal information collection. We study a version of this problem in which the simulation output for each design is normally distributed with both its mean and variance being unknown. Using a Bayesian representation of the probability of correct selection, which allows us to explicitly model uncertainty about the variance, we provide a theoretical characterization of the optimal allocation of the simulation budget. Prior work on optimal budget allocation was unable to distinguish between known and unknown sampling variance. We show the impact of this type of uncertainty on the allocation, and design new sequential procedures that can be guaranteed to learn the optimal allocation asymptotically without the need for tuning or forced exploration.</description>

      <title>Bilevel Mixed-Integer Linear Program with Binary Tender</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilevel programs model sequential decision interactions between two sets of players and find wide applications in real-world complex systems. In this paper, we consider a bilevel mixed-integer linear program with binary tender, wherein the upper and lower levels are linked via binary decision variables and both levels may involve additional mixed-integer decisions. We recast this bilevel program as a single-level formulation through a value function for the lower-level problem and then propose valid inequalities to replace and iteratively approximate the value function. We first derive a family of Lagrangian-based valid inequalities that give a complete description of the value function, providing a baseline method to obtain exact solutions for the considered class of bilevel programs. To enhance the strength of this approach, we further investigate another two types of valid inequalities. First, when the lower-level value function has intrinsic special properties such as supermodularity or submodularity, we exploit such properties to separate the Lagrangian-based inequalities quickly. Second, we derive decision rule-based valid inequalities, where linear decision rules and learning techniques are explored respectively. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods in extensive numerical experiments, including instances of general bilevel mixed-integer programs and those of a facility location interdiction problem.</description>

      <title>Low-Power Optimal Strategy for Witsenhausen Counterexample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the Witsenhausen counterexample from the perspective of varying power budgets and propose a low-power estimation (LoPE) strategy. Specifically, our LoPE approach designs the first decision-maker (DM) a quantization step function of the Gaussian source state, making the target system state a piecewise linear function of the source with slope one. This approach contrasts with Witsenhausen's original two-point strategy, which instead designs the system state itself to be a binary step. While the two-point strategy can outperform the linear strategy in estimation cost, it, along with its multi-step extensions, typically requires a substantial power budget. Analogous to Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) communication for Gaussian channels, we show that the binary LoPE strategy attains first-order optimality in the low-power regime, matching the performance of the linear strategy as the power budget increases from zero. Our analysis also provides an interpretation of the previously observed near-optimal sloped step function ("sawtooth") structure to the Witsenhausen counterexample: In the low-power regime, power saving is prioritized, in which case the LoPE strategy dominates, making the system state a piecewise linear function with slope close to one. Conversely, in the high-power regime, setting the system state as a step function with the slope approaching zero facilitates accurate estimation. Hence, the sawtooth solution can be seen as a combination of both strategies.</description>

      <title>A Benders and column generation method to the integrated airline schedule and aircraft recovery with gate reassignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disruptions are inevitable during airline operations, and disruptions cost airlines and the traveling public. Disruption recovery decisions are often made in a sequential process that includes flight rescheduling, aircraft rerouting, crew reassignment, passenger re-accommodation, and gate reassignment for airline operations. Such a sequential recovery approach alleviates the complexity of the whole recovery process but often causes further disruptions to airport gate assignments and high recovery costs for airlines and passengers. This paper presents a novel airline disruption recovery approach by integrating the schedule and aircraft recovery with gate reassignment. We propose a Benders and column generation (BCG) method to solve the integrated problem. By exploiting the favorable structure arising from the Benders decomposition framework, we provide two acceleration techniques for Benders subproblems, a separation technique and an effective infeasibility certificate, to enhance the efficiency of the BCG method. The proposed model is tested on real-world data. In our experiments, all test instances are solved by the BCG method under a five-minute threshold with optimality gaps within 5%. Compared with the sequential recovery approach, the integrated recovery approach significantly saves recovery costs and avoids infeasible gate reassignments caused by the sequential recovery approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a nonmonotone extension of the Front Descent framework for multiobjective optimization. The method uses novel nonmonotone line searches that allow temporary increases in some objective functions. To our knowledge, this is the first descent algorithm employing nonmonotone strategies to generate point sets approximating the Pareto front. We establish convergence properties for the resulting sequences of sets, analogous to the original framework, and present numerical results confirming the approach's consistency in the bound-constrained setting.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Multi-Agent Path Planning for Heterogeneous UAVs in Contested Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of navigating unmanned aerial vehicles in contested environments by introducing a cooperative multi-agent framework that increases the likelihood of safe UAV traversal. The approach involves two types of UAVs: low-priority agents that explore and localize threats, and a high-priority agent that navigates safely to its target destination while minimizing the risk of detection by enemy radar systems. The low-priority agents employ a decentralized optimization algorithm to balance exploration, radar localization, and safe path identification for the high-priority agent. For the high-priority agent, two path-planning methods are proposed: one for deterministic scenarios using weighted Voronoi diagrams, and another for uncertain scenarios that leverages generalized Voronoi diagrams (incorporating a non-Euclidean criterion derived from uncertainty in the radar's probability of detection) alongside probabilistic constraints. Both methods employ optimization techniques to refine the trajectories while accounting for kinematic constraints and radar detection probabilities. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. This research advances UAV path planning methodologies by combining heterogeneous multi-agent cooperation, probabilistic modeling, and optimization to enhance mission success in adversarial environments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of constrained stabilization on the n-sphere under star-shaped constraints is considered. We propose a control strategy that allows to almost globally steer the state to a desired location while avoiding star-shaped constraints on the n-sphere. Depending on the state's proximity to the unsafe regions, the state is either guided towards the target location along the geodesic connecting the target to the state or steered towards the antipode of a predefined point lying in the interior of the nearest unsafe region. We prove that the target location is almost globally asymptotically stable under the proposed continuous, time-invariant feedback control law. Nontrivial simulation results on the 2-sphere and the 3-sphere demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.</description>

It is similar to the derivative free characterization of the pseudolinear functions. We also find the conditions such that a semi-strictly quasilinear function become pseudolinear.</description>

      <title>Limit Analysis Approach for Optimal Reinforcement Design of Masonry Structures: the Weak Reinforcement Concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, first the non-standard limit analysis 2D problem for reinforced masonry structures is suitably reformulated, giving a innovative computational framework for the evaluation of the strengthening effects of tensile reinforcements. This framework is used for designing optimized reinforcements for masonry structures aimed at improving the structural capacity, but without substantial changes in the typical behavior of masonry structural systems, since the reinforcement layout leaves the possibility of cracks opening. Therefore, both rocking motions and adaptation to support settlements remain allowed, and the transmission of too high forces to the unreinforced structural elements supporting the reinforced one is prevented. This way, a new strengthening strategy, called "weak reinforcement" approach is obtained. This strategy pursues the challenging goal of combining structural safety and conservation for architectural heritage: indeed, not only the historical masonry is preserved as much as possible, but also the original special "masonry-like" behavior. The design, in principle, of optimized strengthening intervention through the weak reinforcement approach is exemplified through the application to a trilithon under seismic loads and to an arch under a concentrated load. The capacity of the structure to adapt to support settlements is investigated through a suitable procedure for minimizing the total potential energy of the system.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Cost Hamiltonian Compilation for Max-Cut QAOA on Unweighted Graphs Using Global Controls and Qubit Bit Flips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a cost Hamiltonian compilation problem for the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) applied to the Max-Cut problem, focusing on trapped-ion quantum computers. Instead of standard compilation with CNOT and Rz gates, we employ global coupling operations and single-qubit bit flips. Prior work by Rajakumar et al. established that such a compilation is always possible.
  Minimizing operational error requires short operation sequences. The problem reduces to a low-rank semi-discrete decomposition of the graph's adjacency matrix, where the minimum achievable rank, the graph coupling number gc(G), represents the number of global control layers. Rajakumar et al. introduced the Union of Stars construction, proving gc(G) &lt;= 3n - 2 for unweighted graphs with n vertices, and gave an O(m)-rank construction for weighted graphs.
  We concentrate on unweighted graphs. We derive structural properties of the compilation problem and show the Union of Stars method is order-optimal by proving a lower bound of gc(G) &gt;= n - 1 for a family of graphs. We also improve the general upper bound to 2.5n + 2. For particular graph families -- cliques, perfect matchings, paths, and cycles -- we provide sharper bounds. Further, we reveal a link between the problem and Hadamard matrix theory.
  Finally, we introduce a compact mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation that outperforms the previously studied exponential-size MIP.</description>

      <title>The Nondecreasing Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article the notion of the nondecreasing (ND) rank of a matrix or tensor is introduced. A tensor has an ND rank of r if it can be represented as a sum of r outer products of vectors, with each vector satisfying a monotonicity constraint. It is shown that for certain poset orderings finding an ND factorization of rank $r$ is equivalent to finding a nonnegative rank-r factorization of a transformed tensor. However, not every tensor that is monotonic has a finite ND rank. Theory is developed describing the properties of the ND rank, including typical, maximum, and border ND ranks. Highlighted also are the special settings where a matrix or tensor has an ND rank of one or two. As a means of finding low ND rank approximations to a data tensor we introduce a variant of the hierarchical alternating least squares algorithm.

      <title>A Quantum-Compliant Formulation for Network Epidemic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We deal with controlling the spread of an epidemic disease on a network by isolating one or multiple locations by banning people from leaving them. To this aim, we build on the susceptible-infected-susceptible and the susceptible-infected-removed discrete-time network models, encapsulating a control action that captures mobility bans via removing links from the network. Then, we formulate the problem of optimally devising a control policy based on mobility bans that trades-off the burden on the healthcare system and the social and economic costs associated with interventions. The binary nature of mobility bans hampers the possibility to solve the control problem with standard optimization methods, yielding a NP-hard problem. Here, this is tackled by deriving a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation of the control problem, and leveraging the growing potentialities of quantum computing to efficiently solve it.</description>

      <title>Solving Optimal Power Flow using a Variational Quantum Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimal power flow (OPF) is a large-scale optimization problem that is central in the operation of electric power systems. Although it can be posed as a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program, the complexity of modern-day power grids raises scalability and optimality challenges. In this context, this work proposes a variational quantum paradigm for solving the OPF. We encode primal variables through the state of a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC), and dual variables through the probability mass function associated with a second PQC. The Lagrangian function can thus be expressed as scaled expectations of quantum observables. An OPF solution can be found by minimizing/maximizing the Lagrangian over the parameters of the first/second PQC. We pursue saddle points of the Lagrangian in a hybrid fashion. Gradients of the Lagrangian are estimated using the two PQCs, while PQC parameters are updated classically using a primal-dual method. We propose permuting primal variables so that OPF observables are expressed in a banded form, allowing them to be measured efficiently. Numerical tests on the IEEE 57-node power system using Pennylane's simulator corroborate that the proposed doubly variational quantum framework can find high-quality OPF solutions. Although showcased for the OPF, this framework features a broader scope, including conic programs with numerous variables and constraints, problems defined over sparse graphs, and training quantum machine learning models to satisfy constraints.</description>

      <title>Bessmertny\u{i} realizations of symmetric multivariate rational matrix functions over any field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the following. First, every square matrix whose entries are multivariable rational functions over a field $\mathbb{F}$ has a Bessmertny\u{i} realization, i.e., is the Schur complement of an affine linear square matrix pencil with coefficients in $\mathbb{F}$. Second, if the matrix is also symmetric and the characteristic of the field $\mathbb{F}$ is not two then it has a symmetric Bessmertny\u{i} realization (i.e., the pencil can be chosen to consist of symmetric matrices) and counterexamples are given to prove this statement is false in general for fields of characteristic two. Third, for fields of characteristic two (e.g., binary or Boolean field), we completely characterize those functions that have a symmetric Bessmertny\u{i} realization. Finally, analogous results hold when restricted to the class of homogeneous degree-one rational functions. To solve these realization problems, i.e., finding such structured Bessmertny\u{i} realizations for a given multivariate rational function, we use state-space methods from systems theory to produce realizations for algebraic operations on Schur complements such as sums, products, inverses, and symmetrization, which become the elementary building blocks of our constructions. Further complications arise over fields of characteristic two, so a large part of the paper is devoted to developing additional methods to decide if the symmetric realization problem can be solved and, if so, to construction the symmetric realization for a given symmetric rational matrix function. Our motivations are discussed in the context of multidimensional linear systems theory on generalizing state-space representations for rational functions including the Givone-Roesser and Fornasini-Marchesini realizations.</description>

      <title>On the Global Optimality of Linear Policies for Sinkhorn Distributionally Robust Linear Quadratic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) regulator is a cornerstone of optimal control theory, yet its performance can degrade significantly when the noise distributions deviate from the assumed Gaussian model. To address this limitation, this work proposes a distributionally robust generalization of the finite-horizon LQG control problem. Specifically, we assume that the noise distributions are unknown and belong to ambiguity sets defined in terms of an entropy-regularized Wasserstein distance centered at a nominal Gaussian distribution. By deriving novel bounds on this Sinkhorn discrepancy and proving structural and topological properties of the resulting ambiguity sets, we establish global optimality of linear policies. Numerical experiments showcase improved distributional robustness of our control policy.</description>

      <title>A Structure-Preserving Numerical Method for Harmonic Maps Between High-genus Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by geometry processing for surfaces with non-trivial topology, we study discrete harmonic maps between closed surfaces of genus at least two. Harmonic maps provide a natural framework for comparing surfaces by minimizing distortion. Unlike conformal or isometric maps-which may not exist between surfaces with different geometries-harmonic maps always exist within a fixed homotopy class and yield optimal homeomorphisms when the target surface has negative curvature. We develop a structure-preserving algorithm to compute harmonic maps from a triangulated surface to a reference hyperbolic surface. The method minimizes Dirichlet energy over geodesic realizations of the surface graph into the target hyperbolic surface in the homotopy class of a homeomorphism. A central feature of our framework is the use of canonical edge weights derived from the hyperbolic metric, which generalize the classical cotangent weights from the Euclidean setting. These weights preserve injectivity and ensure that isometries remain harmonic in the discrete theory, reflecting their classical behavior.</description>

      <title>Globally aware optimization with resurgence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern optimization faces a fundamental challenge: local gradient-based methods provide no global information about the objective function $L$ landscape, often leading to suboptimal convergence and sensitivity to initialization. We introduce a novel optimization framework that leverages resurgence theory from complex analysis to extract global structural information from divergent asymptotic series. Our key insight is that the factorially divergent perturbative expansions of parameter space partition functions encode precise information about all critical objective function value in the landscape through their Borel transform singularities.
  The algorithm works by computing the statistical mechanical partition function $Z(g) = \int e^{-L(\theta)/g} d\theta$ for small coupling $g\ll 1$, extracting its asymptotic series coefficients, and identifying Borel plane singularities that correspond one-to-one with critical objective function values. These target values provide global guidance to local optimizers, enabling principled learning rate adaptation and escape from suboptimal regions. Unlike heuristic adaptive methods, targets are theoretically grounded in the geometry of the optimization landscape.</description>

      <title>Energy-optimal control of discrete-time port-Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we study the energy-optimal control of nonlinear port-Hamiltonian (pH) systems in discrete time. For continuous-time pH systems, energy-optimal control problems are strictly dissipative by design. This property, stating that the system to be optimized is dissipative with the cost functional as a supply rate, implies a stable long-term behavior of optimal solutions and enables stability results in predictive control.
  In this work, we show that the crucial property of strict dissipativity is not straightforwardly preserved by any energy-preserving integrator such as the implicit midpoint rule. Then, we prove that discretizations via difference and differential representations lead to strictly dissipative discrete-time optimal control problems. Consequently, we rigorously show a stable long-term behavior of optimal solutions in the form of a manifold (subspace) turnpike property. Finally, we validate our findings using two numerical examples</description>

      <title>OTMol: Robust Molecular Structure Comparison via Optimal Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) is widely used to assess structural similarity in systems ranging from flexible ligand conformers to complex molecular cluster configurations. Despite its wide utility, RMSD calculation is often challenged by inconsistent atom ordering, indistinguishable configurations in molecular clusters, and potential chirality inversion during alignment. These issues highlight the necessity of accurate atom-to-atom correspondence as a prerequisite for meaningful alignment. Traditional approaches often rely on heuristic cost matrices combined with the Hungarian algorithm, yet these methods underutilize the rich intra-molecular structural information and may fail to generalize across chemically diverse systems. In this work, we introduce OTMol, a method that formulates the molecular alignment task as a fused supervised Gromov-Wasserstein (fsGW) optimal transport problem. By leveraging the intrinsic geometric and topological relationships within each molecule, OTMol eliminates the need for manually defined cost functions and enables a principled, data-driven matching strategy. Importantly, OTMol preserves key chemical features such as molecular chirality and bond connectivity consistency. We evaluate OTMol across a wide range of molecular systems, including Adenosine triphosphate, Imatinib, lipids, small peptides, and water clusters, and demonstrate that it consistently achieves low RMSD values while preserving computational efficiency. Importantly, OTMol maintains molecular integrity by enforcing one-to-one mappings between entire molecules, thereby avoiding erroneous many-to-one alignments that often arise in comparing molecular clusters. Our results underscore the utility of optimal transport theory for molecular alignment and offer a generalizable framework applicable to structural comparison tasks in cheminformatics, molecular modeling, and related disciplines.</description>

      <title>On the Estimation of Multinomial Logit and Nested Logit Models: A Conic Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit parameter estimation for multinomial logit (MNL), nested logit (NL), and tree-nested logit (TNL) models through the framework of convex conic optimization. Traditional approaches typically solve the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem using gradient-based methods, which are sensitive to step-size selection and initialization, and may therefore suffer from slow or unstable convergence. In contrast, we propose a novel estimation strategy that reformulates these models as conic optimization problems, enabling more robust and reliable estimation procedures. Specifically, we show that the MLE for MNL admits an equivalent exponential cone program (ECP). For NL and TNL, we prove that when the dissimilarity (scale) parameters are fixed, the estimation problem is convex and likewise reducible to an ECP. Leveraging these results, we design a two-stage procedure: an outer loop that updates the scale parameters and an inner loop that solves the ECP to update the utility coefficients. The inner problems are handled by interior-point methods with iteration counts that grow only logarithmically in the target accuracy, as implemented in off-the-shelf solvers (e.g., MOSEK). Extensive experiments across estimation instances of varying size show that our conic approach attains better MLE solutions, greater robustness to initialization, and substantial speedups compared to standard gradient-based MLE, particularly on large-scale instances with high-dimensional specifications and large choice sets. Our findings establish exponential cone programming as a practical and scalable alternative for estimating a broad class of discrete choice models.</description>

      <title>Preconditioned Regularized Wasserstein Proximal Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider sampling from a Gibbs distribution by evolving finitely many particles. We propose a preconditioned version of a recently proposed noise-free sampling method, governed by approximating the score function with the numerically tractable score of a regularized Wasserstein proximal operator. This is derived by a Cole--Hopf transformation on coupled anisotropic heat equations, yielding a kernel formulation for the preconditioned regularized Wasserstein proximal. The diffusion component of the proposed method is also interpreted as a modified self-attention block, as in transformer architectures. For quadratic potentials, we provide a discrete-time non-asymptotic convergence analysis and explicitly characterize the bias, which is dependent on regularization and independent of step-size. Experiments demonstrate acceleration and particle-level stability on various log-concave and non-log-concave toy examples to Bayesian total-variation regularized image deconvolution, and competitive/better performance on non-convex Bayesian neural network training when utilizing variable preconditioning matrices.</description>

      <title>Totally convex functions, $L^2$-Optimal transport for laws of random measures, and solution to the Monge problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Optimal Transport problem for laws of random measures in the Kantorovich-Wasserstein space $\mathcal{P}_2(\mathcal{P}_2(\mathrm{H}))$, associated with a Hilbert space $\mathrm{H}$ (with finite or infinite dimension) and for the corresponding quadratic cost induced by the squared Wasserstein metric in $\\mathcal{P}_2(\mathrm{H}).$
  Despite the lack of smoothness of the cost, the fact that the space $\mathcal{P}_2(\mathrm{H})$ is not Hilbertian, and the curvature distortion induced by the underlying Wasserstein metric, we will show how to recover at the level of random measures in $\mathcal{P}_2(\mathcal{P}_2(\mathrm{H}))$ the same deep and powerful results linking Euclidean Optimal Transport problems in $\mathcal{P}_2(\mathrm{H})$ and convex analysis.
  Our approach relies on the notion of totally convex functionals, on their total subdifferentials, and their Lagrangian liftings in the space square integrable $\mathrm{H}$-valued maps $L^2(\mathrm{Q},\mathbb{M};\mathrm{H}).$
  With these tools, we identify a natural class of regular measures in $\mathcal{P}_2(\mathcal{P}_2(\mathrm{H}))$ for which the Monge formulation of the OT problem has a unique solution and we will show that this class includes relevant examples of measures with full support in $\mathcal{P}_2(\mathrm{H})$ arising from the push-forward transformation of nondegenerate Gaussian measures in $L^2(\mathrm{Q},\mathbb{M};\mathrm{H}).$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the notion of resilience of a dynamical system, defined by the maximum disturbance a controlled dynamical system can withstand while satisfying given temporal logic specifications. Given a dynamical system and a specification, the objective is to synthesize the controller such that the closed-loop system satisfies this specification while maximizing its resilience. The problem is formulated as a robust optimization program where the objective is to compute the maximum resilience while simultaneously synthesizing the corresponding controller parameters. For linear systems and linear controllers, exact solutions are provided for the class of time-varying polytopic specifications. For the case of nonlinear systems, nonlinear controllers and more general specifications, we leverage tools from the scenario optimization approach, offering a probabilistic guarantee of the solution as well as computational feasibility. Different case studies are presented to illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One might argue that solving a trajectory optimization problem over a million grid points is preposterous. How about solving such a problem at an incredibly fast computational time? On a small form-factor processor? Algorithmic details that make possible this trifecta of breakthroughs are presented in this paper. The computational mathematics that deliver these advancements are: (i) a Birkhoff-theoretic discretization of optimal control problems, (ii) matrix-free linear algebra leveraging Krylov-subspace methods, and (iii) a near-perfect Birkhoff preconditioner that helps achieve $\mathcal{O}(1)$ iteration speed with respect to the grid size,~$N$. A key enabler of this high performance is the computation of Birkhoff matrix-vector products at $\mathcal{O}(N\log(N))$ time using fast Fourier transform techniques that eliminate traditional computational bottlenecks. A numerical demonstration of this unprecedented scale and speed is illustrated for a practical astrodynamics problem.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Paths for Adaptive Fly-Scan Microscopy: An Extended Version</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In x-ray microscopy, traditional raster-scanning techniques are used to acquire a microscopic image in a series of step-scans. Alternatively, scanning the x-ray probe along a continuous path, called a fly-scan, reduces scan time and increases scan efficiency. However, not all regions of an image are equally important. Currently used fly-scan methods do not adapt to the characteristics of the sample during the scan, often wasting time in uniform, uninteresting regions. One approach to avoid unnecessary scanning in uniform regions for raster step-scans is to use deep learning techniques to select a shorter optimal scan path instead of a traditional raster scan path, followed by reconstructing the entire image from the partially scanned data. However, this approach heavily depends on the quality of the initial sampling, requires a large dataset for training, and incurs high computational costs. We propose leveraging the fly-scan method along an optimal scanning path, focusing on regions of interest (ROIs) and using image completion techniques to reconstruct details in non-scanned areas. This approach further shortens the scanning process and potentially decreases x-ray exposure dose while maintaining high-quality and detailed information in critical regions. To achieve this, we introduce a multi-iteration fly-scan framework that adapts to the scanned image. Specifically, in each iteration, we define two key functions: (1) a score function to generate initial anchor points and identify potential ROIs, and (2) an objective function to optimize the anchor points for convergence to an optimal set. Using these anchor points, we compute the shortest scanning path between optimized anchor points, perform the fly-scan, and subsequently apply image completion based on the acquired information in preparation for the next scan iteration.</description>

      <title>Semi-on-Demand Transit Feeders with Shared Autonomous Vehicles and Reinforcement-Learning-Based Zonal Dispatching Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a semi-on-demand transit feeder service using shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) and zonal dispatching control based on reinforcement learning (RL). This service combines the cost-effectiveness of fixed-route transit with the adaptability of demand-responsive transport to improve accessibility in lower-density areas. Departing from the terminus, SAVs first make scheduled fixed stops, then offer on-demand pick-ups and drop-offs in a pre-determined flexible-route area. Our deep RL model dynamically assigns vehicles to subdivided flexible-route zones in response to real-time demand fluctuations and operations, using a policy gradient algorithm - Proximal Policy Optimization. The methodology is demonstrated through agent-based simulations on a real-world bus route in Munich, Germany. Results show that after efficient training of the RL model, the semi-on-demand service with dynamic zonal control serves 16% more passengers at 13% higher generalized costs on average compared to traditional fixed-route service. The efficiency gain brought by RL control brings 2.4% more passengers at 1.4% higher costs. This study not only showcases the potential of integrating SAV feeders and machine learning techniques into public transit, but also sets the groundwork for further innovations in addressing first-mile-last-mile problems in multimodal transit systems.</description>

      <title>A Continuous Energy Ising Machine Leveraging Difference-of-Convex Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many combinatorial optimization problems can be reformulated as the task of finding the ground state of a physical system, such as the Ising model. Most existing Ising solvers are inspired by simulated annealing. Although annealing techniques offer scalability, they lack convergence guarantees and are sensitive to the cooling schedule. We propose to solve the Ising problem by relaxing the binary spins to continuous variables and introducing a potential function (attractor) that steers the solution toward binary spin configurations. The resulting Hamiltonian can be expressed as a difference of convex functions, enabling the design of efficient iterative algorithms that require a single matrix-vector multiplication per iteration and are backed by convergence guarantees. We implement our Ising solver across a range of GPU platforms: from edge devices to high-performance computing clusters and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms existing solvers across problem sizes ranging from small ($10^3$ spins) to ultra-large ($10^8$ spins).</description>

      <title>Online Identification using Adaptive Laws and Neural Networks for Multi-Quadrotor Centralized Transportation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an adaptive-neuro identification method that enhances the robustness of a centralized multi-quadrotor transportation system. This method leverages online tuning and learning on decomposed error subspaces, enabling efficient real-time compensation to time-varying disturbances and model uncertainties acting on the payload. The strategy is to decompose the high-dimensional error space into a set of low-dimensional subspaces. In this way, the identification problem for unseen features is naturally transformed into submappings (``slices'') addressed by multiple adaptive laws and shallow neural networks, which are updated online via Lyapunov-based adaptation without requiring persistent excitation (PE) and offline training. Due to the model-free nature of neural networks, this approach can be well adapted to highly coupled and nonlinear centralized transportation systems. It serves as a feedforward compensator for the payload controller without explicitly relying on the dynamics coupled with the payload, such as cables and quadrotors. The proposed control system has been proven to be stable in the sense of Lyapunov, and its enhanced robustness under time-varying disturbances and model uncertainties was demonstrated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Robustness Enhancement for Multi-Quadrotor Centralized Transportation System via Online Tuning and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an adaptive-neuro geometric control for a centralized multi-quadrotor cooperative transportation system, which enhances both adaptivity and disturbance rejection. Our strategy is to coactively tune the model parameters and learn the external disturbances in real-time. To realize this, we augmented the existing geometric control with multiple neural networks and adaptive laws, where the estimated model parameters and the weights of the neural networks are simultaneously tuned and adjusted online. The Lyapunov-based adaptation guarantees bounded estimation errors without requiring either pre-training or the persistent excitation (PE) condition. The proposed control system has been proven to be stable in the sense of Lyapunov under certain preconditions, and its enhanced robustness under scenarios of disturbed environment and model-unmatched plant was demonstrated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Robust Load Disturbance Rejection in PWM DC-DC Buck Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to robust load disturbance rejection in DC-DC Buck converters. We propose a novel control scheme based on the design of two nested feedback loops. First, we design the controller in the outer loop using H infinity optimal control theory, and we show, by means of mu-analysis, that such a controller provides robust stability in the presence of uncertainty affecting the physical parameters of the circuit. Then, we introduce an inner feedback loop to improve the system's response to output load disturbances. As far as the inner loop is considered, we propose a novel load estimation-compensation (LEC) scheme, and we discuss under what conditions the insertion of such an inner loop preserves the robust stability of the entire control system. The LEC scheme is compared with the other two linear structures based on well-established disturbance rejection methods. The advantages of LEC in terms of both complexity of implementation and obtained performances are discussed and demonstrated by means of numerical simulation. Finally, we present experimental results obtained through the implementation of the proposed control scheme on a prototype board to demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances disturbance rejection performances with respect to the approach commonly used in DC-DC buck converters.</description>

      <title>AdaSwitch: An Adaptive Switching Meta-Algorithm for Learning-Augmented Bounded-Influence Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of multi-period online decision-making problems with sequence-based predictions, which may be generated by machine learning models but whose accuracy is not guaranteed. In each period, the decision-maker observes the realized request and must take an irrevocable action that yields a reward or incurs a cost, without knowledge of future arrivals. We introduce a bounded-influence framework, in which past decisions and requests exert only limited impact on the future optimal reward. Within this framework, we propose the AdaSwitch meta-algorithm, which exploits predictions to attain performance close to the offline benchmark when predictions are accurate, while preserving classical competitive-ratio guarantees under highly inaccurate predictions. Our framework and meta-algorithm apply to diverse settings, including lead-time quotation in processing systems, the $k$-server problem, and online allocation of reusable resources. These applications illustrate the flexibility and broad applicability of our approach to learning-augmented online decision-making.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Information in Incentive Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incentive design deals with interaction between a principal and an agent where the former can shape the latter's utility through a policy commitment. It is well known that the principal faces an information rent when dealing with an agent that has informational advantage. In this work, we embark on a systematic study of the effect of information asymmetry in incentive design games. Specifically, we first demonstrate that it is in principal's interest to decrease this information asymmetry. To mitigate this uncertainty, we let the principal gather information either by letting the agent shape her belief (aka Information Design), or by paying to acquire it. Providing solutions to all these cases we show that while introduction of uncertainty increases the principal's cost, letting the agent shape its belief can be advantageous. We study information asymmetry and information acquisition in both matrix games and quadratic Gaussian game setups.</description>

      <title>Reusing Samples in Variance Reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a general framework to improve trade-offs between the number of full batch and sample queries used to solve structured optimization problems. Our results apply to a broad class of randomized optimization algorithms that iteratively solve sub-problems to high accuracy. We show that such algorithms can be modified to reuse the randomness used to query the input across sub-problems. Consequently, we improve the trade-off between the number of gradient (full batch) and individual function (sample) queries for finite sum minimization, the number of matrix-vector multiplies (full batch) and random row (sample) queries for top-eigenvector computation, and the number of matrix-vector multiplies with the transition matrix (full batch) and generative model (sample) queries for optimizing Markov Decision Processes. To facilitate our analysis we introduce the notion of pseudo-independent algorithms, a generalization of pseudo-deterministic algorithms [Gat and Goldwasser 2011], that quantifies how independent the output of a randomized algorithm is from a randomness source.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of learning the optimal control policy for fine-tuning a given diffusion process, using general value function approximation. We develop a new class of algorithms by solving a variational inequality problem based on the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. We prove sharp statistical rates for the learned value function and control policy, depending on the complexity and approximation errors of the function class. In contrast to generic reinforcement learning problems, our approach shows that fine-tuning can be achieved via supervised regression, with faster statistical rate guarantees.</description>

      <title>Full characterization of optimal transport plans for concave costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3406</link>
      <description>arXiv:1311.3406v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper slightly improves a classical result by Gangbo and McCann (1996) about the structure of optimal transport plans for costs that are concave functions of the Euclidean distance. Since the main difficulty for proving the existence of an optimal map comes from the possible singularity of the cost at $0$, everything is quite easy if the supports of the two measures are disjoint; Gangbo and McCann proved the result under the assumption $\mu(\mathm{supp}(\nu))=0$; in this paper we replace this assumption with the fact that the two measures are singular to each other. In this case it is possible to prove the existence of an optimal transport map, provided the starting measure $\mu$ does not give mass to small sets (i.e. $(d-1)$-rectifiable sets). When the measures are not singular the optimal transport plan decomposes into two parts, one concentrated on the diagonal and the other being a transport map between mutually singular measures.</description>

Abstract: In the literature there are several methods for comparing two convergent iterative processes for the same problem. In this note we have in view mostly the one introduced by Berinde in [Picard iteration converges faster than Mann iteration for a class of quasi-contractive operators, Fixed Point Theory Appl. 2004, no. 2, 97--105] because it seems to be very successful. In fact, if IP1 and IP2 are two iterative processes converging to the same element, then IP1 is faster than IP2 in the sense of Berinde. The aim of this note is to prove this almost obvious assertion and to discuss briefly several papers that cite the mentioned Berinde's paper and use his method for comparing iterative processes.</description>

      <title>Fine Control of Conservatism for Robust Optimization by Adjustable Regret</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.05536v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Overconservatism has long been recognized as a major issue of robust optimization, despite its major advantages of tractability, performance guarantee, and limited information. A new criterion based on adjustable regret is proposed to address this issue by adapting the level of conservatism to the environment, while maintaining all the aforementioned advantages. The level of conservatism can be fine-tuned by maximizing the reward guarantee for scenarios representative of opportunities provided by experts as most likely values, leading to a simple heuristic to best catch opportunities. This criterion also supports a new approach to competitive ratio analysis that is applicable even to multistage problems. The new criterion is then applied to the one-way trading problem with analytical solutions, from which the competitive ratio is easily derived by the new approach. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate fine control of conservatism and the effectiveness of the heuristic, with the average reward improved in one case by 3 - 9% over other commonly used criteria.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.08673v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In preference modelling, it is essential to determine the number of questions and their arrangements to ask from the decision maker. We focus on incomplete pairwise comparison matrices, and provide the optimal filling in patterns, which result in the closest (LLSM) weight vectors on average to the complete case for at most six alternatives and for all possible number of comparisons, when the underlying representing graph is connected. These results are obtained by extensive numerical simulations with large sample sizes. Many optimal filling structures resulted in optimal filling in sequences -- one optimal case can be reached by adding a comparison to a previous one -- which are presented on graph \color{black} of graphs. The star graph is revealed to be optimal among spanning trees, while the optimal graphs are always close to bipartite ones. Regular graphs also correspond to optimal cases, furthermore regularity is important for all optimal graphs, as the degrees of different vertices are always as close to each other as possible. Besides applying optimal filling structures in given decision making problems, practitioners can utilize the optimal filling sequences in the cases, when the decision maker can abandon the problem at any period of the process (e.g., in online questionnaires).</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the linear complementarity problems on the monotone extended second order cones. We demonstrate that the linear complementarity problem on the monotone extended second order cone can be converted into a mixed complementarity problem on the non-negative orthant. We prove that any point satisfying the FB equation is a solution of the converted problem. We also show that the semi-smooth Newton method could be used to solve the converted problem, and we also provide a numerical example. Finally, we derive the explicit solution to a portfolio optimisation problem based on the monotone extended second order cone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.12467v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolution strategy (ES) is one of the promising classes of algorithms for black-box continuous optimization. Despite its broad successes in applications, theoretical analysis on the speed of its convergence is limited on convex quadratic functions and their monotonic transformation. In this study, an upper bound and a lower bound of the rate of linear convergence of the (1+1)-ES on locally $L$-strongly convex functions with $U$-Lipschitz continuous gradient are derived as $\exp\left(-\Omega_{d\to\infty}\left(\frac{L}{d\cdot U}\right)\right)$ and $\exp\left(-\frac1d\right)$, respectively. Notably, any prior knowledge on the mathematical properties of the objective function, such as Lipschitz constant, is not given to the algorithm, whereas the existing analyses of derivative-free optimization algorithms require it.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Approximation for Nonlinear Discrete Stochastic Control: Finite-Sample Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11854v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a nonlinear discrete stochastic control system, and our goal is to design a feedback control policy in order to lead the system to a prespecified state. We adopt a stochastic approximation viewpoint of this problem. It is known that by solving the corresponding continuous-time deterministic system, and using the resulting feedback control policy, one ensures almost sure convergence to the prespecified state in the discrete system. In this paper, we adopt such a control mechanism and provide its finite-sample convergence bounds whenever a Lyapunov function is known for the continuous system. In particular, we consider four cases based on whether the Lyapunov function for the continuous system gives exponential or sub-exponential rates and based on whether it is smooth or not. We provide the finite-time bounds in all cases. Our proof relies on constructing a Lyapunov function for the discrete system based on the given Lyapunov function for the continuous system. We do this by appropriately smoothing the given function using the Moreau envelope. We present numerical experiments corresponding to the various cases, which validate the rates we establish.</description>

      <title>Convergence and Inference of Stream SGD, with Applications to Queueing Systems and Inventory Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09545v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stream stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a simple and efficient method for solving online optimization problems in operations research (OR), where data is generated by parameter-dependent Markov chains. Unlike traditional approaches which require increasing batch sizes during iterations, stream SGD uses a single sample per iteration, significantly improving sample efficiency. This paper establishes a systematic framework for analyzing stream SGD, leveraging the Poisson equation solution to address gradient bias and statistical dependence. We prove optimal O(1/T) convergence rates and the state-of-the-art O(log T) regret, while also introducing an online inference method for uncertainty quantification and supporting it by a novel functional central limit theorem. We propose a novel Wasserstein-type divergence to describe the framework's conditions, which makes the assumptions in question directly verified via coupling techniques tailored to underlying OR models. We consider applications in queueing systems and inventory management, demonstrating the practicality and broad relevance, as well as providing new insights into the effectiveness of stream SGD in OR fields.</description>

      <title>Discrete and Continuous Caching Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a discrete search game called the Multiple Caching Game where the searcher's aim is to find all of a set of $d$ treasures hidden in $n$ locations. Allowed queries are sets of locations of size $k$, and the searcher wins if in all $d$ queries, at least one treasure is hidden in one of the $k$ picked locations. P\'alv\"olgyi showed that the value of the game is at most $\frac{k^d}{\binom{n+d-1}{d}}$, with equality for large enough $n$. We conjecture the exact cases of equality. We also investigate variants of the game and show an example where their values are different, answering a question of P\'alv\"olgyi.
  This game is closely related to a continuous variant, Alpern's Caching Game, based on which we define other continous variants of the multiple caching game and examine their values.</description>

      <title>Impact of domain reduction techniques in polynomial optimization: A computational study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain reduction techniques are at the core of any global optimization solver for NLP or MINLP problems. In this paper, we delve into several of these techniques and assess the impact they may have in the performance of an RLT-based algorithm for polynomial optimization problems. These techniques include i) the use of (nonlinear) conic relaxations for optimality-based bound tightening, ii) the use of Lagrangian dual information to enhance feasibility-based bound tightening, and iii) different strategies for branching point selection. One of this paper's main contributions is providing insights into the relative impact of these techniques with respect to each other, which we hope will guide the efforts to develop and implement this type of enhancements in other solvers. We also explore how a solver equipped with these domain reduction enhancements can further improve its performance by using machine learning to better choose the best domain reduction approach to use on a given instance.</description>

      <title>A First-Order Gradient Approach for the Connectivity Optimization of Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11744v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphs are commonly used to model various complex systems, including social networks, power grids, transportation networks, and biological systems. In many applications, the connectivity of these networks can be expressed through the Mean First Passage Times (MFPTs) of a Markov chain modeling a random walker on the graph. In this paper, we generalize the network metrics based on Markov chains' MFPTs and extend them to networks affected by uncertainty, in which edges may fail and hence not be present according to a pre-determined stochastic model. To find optimally connected Markov chains, we present a parameterization-free method for optimizing the MFPTs of the Markov chain. More specifically, we present an efficient Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) algorithm in the context of Markov chain optimization. The proposed algorithm is suitable for both fixed and random networks. Using various numerical experiments, we demonstrate scalability compared to established benchmarks. Importantly, our algorithm finds an optimal solution without requiring prior knowledge of edge failure probabilities, allowing for an online optimization approach.</description>

      <title>Distributed Fractional Bayesian Learning for Adaptive Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11354v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers a distributed adaptive optimization problem, where all agents only have access to their local cost functions with a common unknown parameter, whereas they mean to collaboratively estimate the true parameter and find the optimal solution over a connected network. A general mathematical framework for such a problem has not been studied yet. We aim to provide valuable insights for addressing parameter uncertainty in distributed optimization problems and simultaneously find the optimal solution. Thus, we propose a novel distributed scheme, which utilizes distributed fractional Bayesian learning through weighted averaging on the log-beliefs to update the beliefs of unknown parameter, and distributed gradient descent for renewing the estimation of the optimal solution. Then under suitable assumptions, we prove that all agents' beliefs and decision variables converge almost surely to the true parameter and the optimal solution under the true parameter, respectively. We further establish a sublinear convergence rate for the belief sequence. Finally, numerical experiments are implemented to corroborate the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Bilevel Optimization of the Kantorovich Problem and its Quadratic Regularization Part III: The Finite-Dimensional Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the title suggests, this is the third paper in a series addressing bilevel optimization problems that are governed by the Kantorovich problem of optimal transport. These tasks can be reformulated as mathematical problems with complementarity constraints in the space of regular Borel measures. Due to the nonsmoothness that is introduced by the complementarity constraints, such problems are often regularized, for instance, using entropic regularization. In this series of papers, however, we apply a quadratic regularization to the Kantorovich problem. By doing so, we enhance its numerical properties while preserving the sparsity structure of the optimal transportation plan as much as possible. While the first two papers in this series focus on the well-posedness of the regularized bilevel problems and the approximation of solutions to the bilevel optimization problem in the infinite-dimensional case, in this paper, we reproduce these results for the finite-dimensional case and present findings that go well beyond the ones of the previous papers and pave the way for the numerical treatment of the bilevel problems.</description>

      <title>A multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model for supply chain planning of 3D printing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05213v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D printing is considered the future of production systems and one of the physical elements of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. 3D printing will significantly impact the product lifecycle, considering cost, energy consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions, leading to the creation of sustainable production systems. Given the importance of these production systems and their effects on the quality of life for future generations, it is expected that 3D printing will soon become one of the global industry's fundamental needs. Although three decades have passed since the emergence of 3D printers, there has not yet been much research on production planning and mass production using these devices. Therefore, we aimed to identify the existing gaps in the planning of 3D printers and to propose a model for planning and scheduling these devices. In this research, several parts with different heights, areas, and volumes have been considered for allocation on identical 3D printers for various tasks. To solve this problem, a multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model has been proposed to minimize the earliness and tardiness of parts production, considering their order delivery times, and maximizing machine utilization. Additionally, a method has been proposed for the placement of parts in 3D printers, leading to the selection of the best edge as the height. Using a numerical example, we have plotted the Pareto curve obtained from solving the model using the epsilon constraint method for several parts and analyzed the impact of the method for selecting the best edge as the height, with and without considering it. Additionally, a comprehensive sensitivity and scenario analysis has been conducted to validate the results.</description>

      <title>Variance-reduced first-order methods for deterministically constrained stochastic nonconvex optimization with strong convergence guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09906v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of deterministically constrained stochastic optimization problems. Existing methods typically aim to find an $\epsilon$-stochastic stationary point, where the expected violations of both constraints and first-order stationarity are within a prescribed accuracy $\epsilon$. However, in many practical applications, it is crucial that the constraints be nearly satisfied with certainty, making such an $\epsilon$-stochastic stationary point potentially undesirable due to the risk of significant constraint violations. To address this issue, we propose single-loop variance-reduced stochastic first-order methods, where the stochastic gradient of the stochastic component is computed using either a truncated recursive momentum scheme or a truncated Polyak momentum scheme for variance reduction, while the gradient of the deterministic component is computed exactly. Under the error bound condition with a parameter $\theta \geq 1$ and other suitable assumptions, we establish that these methods respectively achieve a sample and first-order operation complexity of $\widetilde O(\epsilon^{-\max\{\theta+2, 2\theta\}})$ and $\widetilde O(\epsilon^{-\max\{4, 2\theta\}})$ for finding a stronger $\epsilon$-stochastic stationary point, where the constraint violation is within $\epsilon$ with certainty, and the expected violation of first-order stationarity is within $\epsilon$. For $\theta=1$, these complexities reduce to $\widetilde O(\epsilon^{-3})$ and $\widetilde O(\epsilon^{-4})$ respectively, which match, up to a logarithmic factor, the best-known complexities achieved by existing methods for finding an $\epsilon$-stochastic stationary point of unconstrained smooth stochastic optimization problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10486v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider multi-agent systems with cooperative interactions and study the convergence to consensus in the case of time-dependent connections, with possible communication failure.
  We prove a new condition ensuring consensus: we define a graph in which directed arrows correspond to connection functions that converge (in the weak sense) to some function with a positive integral on all intervals of the form $[t,+\infty)$. If the graph has a node reachable from all other indices, i.e.~``globally reachable'', then the system converges to consensus. We show that this requirement generalizes some known sufficient conditions for convergence, such as Moreau's or the Persistent Excitation one. We also give a second new condition, transversal to the known ones: total connectedness of the undirected graph formed by the non-vanishing of limiting functions.</description>

      <title>Identifiability of the Optimal Transport Cost on Finite Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of optimal transport (OT) is to find optimal assignments or matchings between data sets which minimize the total cost for a given cost function. However, sometimes the cost function is unknown but we have access to (parts of) the solution to the OT problem, e.g. the OT plan or the value of the objective function. Recovering the cost from such information is called inverse OT and has become recently of certain interest triggered by novel applications, e.g. in social science and economics. This raises the issue under which circumstances such cost is identifiable, i.e., it can be uniquely recovered from other OT quantities. In this work we provide sufficient and necessary conditions for the identifiability of the cost function on finite ground spaces. We find that such conditions correspond to the combinatorial structure of the corresponding linear program.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior of the Arrow-Hurwicz differential system with Tikhonov regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a real Hilbert space setting, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of the classical Arrow-Hurwicz differential system combined with Tikhonov regularizing terms. Under some newly proposed conditions on the Tikhonov terms involved, we show that the solutions of the regularized Arrow-Hurwicz differential system strongly converge toward the element of least norm within its set of zeros. Moreover, we provide fast asymptotic decay rate estimates for the so-called primal-dual gap function and the norm of the solutions' velocity. If, in addition, the Tikhonov regularizing terms are decreasing, we provide some refined estimates in the sense of an exponentially weighted moving average. Under the additional assumption that the governing operator of the Arrow-Hurwicz differential system satisfies a reverse Lipschitz condition, we further provide a fast rate of strong convergence of the solutions toward the unique zero. We conclude our study by deriving the corresponding decay rate estimates with respect to the so-called viscosity curve. Numerical experiments illustrate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose Riemannian conditional gradient methods for minimizing composite functions, i.e., those that can be expressed as the sum of a smooth function and a retraction-based convex function. We analyze the convergence of the proposed algorithms, utilizing three types of step-size strategies: adaptive, diminishing, and those based on the Armijo condition. We establish the convergence rate of \(\mathcal{O}(1/k)\) for the adaptive and diminishing step sizes, where \(k\) denotes the number of iterations. Additionally, we derive an iteration complexity of \(\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2)\) for the Armijo step-size strategy to achieve \(\epsilon\)-optimality, where \(\epsilon\) is the optimality tolerance. Finally, the effectiveness of our algorithms is validated through some numerical experiments performed on the sphere and Stiefel manifolds.</description>

      <title>Learning to Relax Nonconvex Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs) are ubiquitous in optimization: Such problems arise in applications from operations research, power systems, signal processing, chemical engineering, portfolio theory, among others. Despite their flexibility in modeling real-life situations and the recent effort to understand their properties, nonconvex QCQPs are hard to solve in practice. Most of the approaches in the literature are based on either Linear Programming (LP) or Semidefinite Programming (SDP) relaxations, each of which works very well for some problem subclasses but perform poorly on others. In this paper, we develop a relaxation selection procedure for nonconvex QCQPs that can adaptively decide whether an LP- or SDP-based approach is expected to be more beneficial by considering the instance structure. The proposed methodology relies on utilizing machine learning methods that involve features derived from spectral properties and sparsity patterns of data matrices, and once trained appropriately, the prediction model is applicable to any instance with an arbitrary number of variables and constraints. We train and test classification and regression models over synthetically generated instances, and empirically show the efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <title>Improved Compression Bounds for Scenario Decision Making</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scenario decision making offers a flexible way of making decision in an uncertain environment while obtaining probabilistic guarantees on the risk of failure of the decision. The idea of this approach is to draw samples of the uncertainty and make a decision based on the samples, called "scenarios". The probabilistic guarantees take the form of a bound on the probability of sampling a set of scenarios that will lead to a decision whose risk of failure is above a given maximum tolerance. This bound can be expressed as a function of the number of sampled scenarios, the maximum tolerated risk, and some intrinsic property of the problem called the "compression size". Several such bounds have been proposed in the literature under various assumptions on the problem. We propose new bounds that improve upon the existing ones without requiring stronger assumptions on the problem.</description>

      <title>The Effective Countable Generalized Moment Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09385v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish new convergence rates for the Moment-Sum-of-Squares (Moment-SoS) relaxations for the Generalized Moment Problem (GMP) with countable moment constraints on vectors of measures, under dual optimum attainment, $S$-fullness and Archimedean conditions. These bounds, which adapt to the geometry of the underlying semi-algebraic set, apply to both the convergence of optima, and to the convergence in Hausdorff distance between the relaxation feasibility set and the GMP feasibility set. We show that under the previous conditions, the sequence of optimizers of the relaxations converge to the optimizer of the GMP for the weak$^*$ topology, provided this optimal measure is unique. This research provides quantitative geometry-adaptive rates for GMPs cast as linear programs on measures. It complements earlier analyses of specific GMP instances (e.g., polynomial optimization) as well as recent methodological frameworks that have been applied to volume computation and optimal control. We apply the convergence rate analysis to symmetric tensor decomposition problems, providing new effective error bounds for the convergence of the Moment-SoS hierarchies for tensor decomposition.</description>

      <title>A scaling characterization of nc-rank via unbounded gradient flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a tuple of $n \times n$ complex matrices ${\cal A} = (A_1,A_2,\ldots, A_m)$, the linear symbolic matrix $A = A_1x_1 + A_2x_2 + \cdots + A_m x_m$ is nonsingular in the noncommutative sense if and only if the completely positive operators $T_{\cal A} (X) = \sum_{i=1}^m A_i X A_i^{\dagger}$ and $T_{\cal A}^*(X) = \sum_{i=1}^m A_i^{\dagger} X A_i$ can be scaled to be doubly stochastic: For every $\epsilon &gt; 0$ there are $g,h \in GL(n,\mathbb{C})$ such that $\|T_{g^{\dagger}{\cal A}h}(I)- I\| &lt; \epsilon$, $\| T^*_{g^\dagger{\cal A}h}(I) - I\| &lt; \epsilon$. In this paper, we show a refinement: The noncommutative corank of $A$ is equal to one-half of the minimum residual $\|T_{g^{\dagger}{\cal A}h}(I) - I\|_1 + \|T^*_{g^{\dagger}{\cal A}h}(I) - I\|_1$ over all possible scalings $g^{\dagger}{\cal A}h$, where $\|\cdot \|_1$ is the trace norm. To show this, we interpret the residuals as gradients of a convex function on symmetric space $GL(n,\mathbb{C})/U_n$, and establish a general duality relation of the minimum gradient-norm of a lower-unbounded convex function $f$ on $GL(n,\mathbb{C})/U_n$ with an invariant Finsler metric, by utilizing the unbounded gradient flow of $f$ at infinity.</description>

      <title>On the resolution and linear optimization problems subject to a system of bipolar fuzzy relational equalities defined with continuous Archimedean t-norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the linear objective function optimization with respect to a more general class of bipolar fuzzy relational equations, where the fuzzy compositions are defined by an arbitrary continuous Archimedean t-norm. In addition, a faster method for finding a global optimum is proposed. Analytical concepts and properties of the Archimedean bipolar fuzzy equations are investigated and two necessary conditions are presented to conceptualize the feasibility of the problem. It is shown that the feasible solution set can be resulted by a union of the finite number of compact sets, where each compact set is obtained by a function (called admissible function in this paper). Moreover, to accelerate identification of the mentioned compact sets (and therefore, to speed up solution finding), four simplification techniques are presented, which are based on either omitting redundant constraints and/or eliminating unknowns by assigning them a fixed value. Also, three additional simplification techniques are given to reduce the search domain by removing some parts of the feasible region that do not contain optimal solutions. Subsequently, a method is proposed to find an optimal solution for the current linear optimization problems. The proposed method consists of two accelerative strategies that are used during the problem solving process. By the first strategy, the method neglects some candidate solutions that are not optimal, by considering only a subset of admissible functions (called modified functions in this paper). As for the second strategy, a branch-and-bound method is used to delete non-optimal branches. Then, the method is summarized in an algorithm that represents all essential steps of the solution and finally, the whole method is applied in an example that has been chosen in such a way that the various situations are illustrated.</description>

      <title>Feedback Optimization with State Constraints through Control Barrier Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00813v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of research on a class of methods called feedback optimization. These are methods to steer the state of a control system to an equilibrium that arises as the solution of an optimization problem. Despite the growing literature on the topic, the important problem of enforcing state constraints at all times remains unaddressed. In this work, we present the first feedback-optimization method that enforces state constraints. The method combines a class of dynamics called safe gradient flows with high-order control barrier functions. We provide a number of results on our proposed controller, including well-posedness guarantees, anytime constraint-satisfaction guarantees, equivalence between the closed-loop's equilibria and the optimization problem's critical points, and local asymptotic stability of optima.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03443v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an analytical approach for the synthesis of ellipsoidal probabilistic reachable sets of saturated systems subject to unbounded additive noise. Using convex optimization methods, we compute a contraction factor of the saturated error dynamics that allows us to tightly bound its evolution and therefore construct accurate reachable sets. The proposed approach is applicable to independent, zero mean disturbances with a known covariance. A numerical example illustrates the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed design.</description>

      <title>Robo-Taxi Fleet Coordination with Accelerated High-Capacity Ridepooling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07776v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapid urbanization has led to a surge of customizable mobility demand in urban areas, which makes on-demand services increasingly popular. On-demand services are flexible while reducing the need for private cars, thus mitigating congestion and parking issues in limited urban space. While the coordination of high-capacity ridepooling on-demand service requires effective control to ensure efficiency, the emergence of the paradigm of robo-taxi opens the opportunity for centralized fleet control for an improved service quality. In this work, we propose two acceleration algorithms for the most advanced large-scale high-capacity algorithm proposed in [1]. We prove the improvement in the real-time performance of the algorithm by using real-world on-demand data from Manhattan, NYC.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Performance Guarantees for Parametric Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23819v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven method to establish probabilistic performance guarantees for parametric optimization problems solved via iterative algorithms. Our approach addresses two key challenges: providing convergence guarantees to characterize the worst-case number of iterations required to achieve a predefined tolerance, and upper bounding a performance metric after a fixed number of iterations. These guarantees are particularly useful for online optimization problems with limited computational time, where existing performance guarantees are often unavailable or unduly conservative. We formulate the convergence analysis problem as a scenario optimization program based on a finite set of sampled parameter instances. Leveraging tools from scenario optimization theory enables us to derive probabilistic guarantees on the number of iterations needed to meet a given tolerance level. Using recent advancements in scenario optimization, we further introduce a relaxation approach to trade the number of iterations against the risk of violating convergence criteria thresholds. Additionally, we analyze the trade-off between solution accuracy and time efficiency for fixed-iteration optimization problems by casting them into scenario optimization programs. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in providing reliable probabilistic convergence guarantees and evaluating the trade-off between solution accuracy and computational cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce cuPDLPx, a further enhanced GPU-based first-order solver for linear programming. Building on the recently developed restarted Halpern PDHG for LP, cuPDLPx incorporates a number of new techniques, including a new restart criterion and a PID-controlled primal weight update. These improvements are carefully tailored for GPU architectures and deliver substantial computational gains. Across benchmark datasets, cuPDLPx achieves 2.5x-5x speedups on MIPLIB LP relaxations and 3x-6.8x on Mittelmann's benchmark set, with particularly strong improvements in high-accuracy and presolve-enabled settings. The solver is publicly available at https://github.com/MIT-Lu-Lab/cuPDLPx.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a kind of linear-quadratic (LQ) optimal control problem of backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) with partial information. The cost functional includes cross terms between the state and control, and the weighting matrices are allowed to be indefinite. Through variational methods and stochastic filtering techniques, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimal control, where a Hamiltonian system plays a crucial role. Moreover, to construct the optimal control, we introduce a matrix-valued differential equation and a BSDE with filtering, and establish their solvability under the assumption that the cost functional is uniformly convex. Finally, we present explicit forms of the optimal control and value function.</description>

      <title>Subspace decomposition in regularized least-squares: solution properties, restricted coercivity and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the solution properties of the regularized least-squares problem.
  Using a subspace decomposition technique, we derive expressions for the solution set in terms of the
  conjugate function, from which various properties, including existence, compactness and uniqueness,
  can then be easily analyzed. A key distinction of our approach from existing works is the separate
  treatment of existence and compactness. We unify many existing results based on recession cones and
  sublevel sets, and link them to our findings by connecting the recession function with the recession
  cone of the subdifferential of the conjugate function. In particular, the concept of restricted coercivity
  is developed and discussed in various aspects. The associated linearly constrained counterpart is
  discussed in a similar manner. Its connections to regularized least-squares are further established via
  the exactness of infimal postcomposition. Our results are supported by numerous examples, among
  which the geometric interpretation of the lasso solution deserves further investigations in near future.</description>

      <title>LLM Serving Optimization with Variable Prefill and Decode Lengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of serving LLM (Large Language Model) requests where each request has heterogeneous prefill and decode lengths. In LLM serving, the prefill length corresponds to the input prompt length, which determines the initial memory usage in the KV cache. The decode length refers to the number of output tokens generated sequentially, with each additional token increasing the KV cache memory usage by one unit. Given a set of n requests, our goal is to schedule and process them to minimize the total completion time. We show that this problem is NP-hard due to the interplay of batching, placement constraints, precedence relationships, and linearly increasing memory usage. We then analyze commonly used scheduling strategies in practice, such as First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) and Shortest-First (SF), and prove that their competitive ratios scale up sublinearly with the memory limit-a significant drawback in real-world settings where memory demand is large. To address this, we propose a novel algorithm based on a new selection metric that efficiently forms batches over time. We prove that this algorithm achieves a constant competitive ratio. Finally, we develop and evaluate a few algorithm variants inspired by this approach, including dynamic programming variants, local search methods, and an LP-based scheduler, demonstrating through comprehensive simulations that they outperform standard baselines while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Joint Planning and Operations of Wind Power under Decision-dependent Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10437v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a joint wind farm planning and operational scheduling problem under decision-dependent uncertainty. The objective is to determine the optimal number of wind turbines at each location to minimize total cost, including both investment and operational expenses. Due to the stochastic nature and geographical heterogeneity of wind power, fluctuations across dispersed wind farms can partially offset one another, thereby influencing the distribution of aggregated wind power generation-a phenomenon known as the smoothing effect. Effectively harnessing this effect requires strategic capacity allocation, which introduces decision-dependent uncertainty into the planning process. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage distributionally robust optimization model with a decision-dependent Wasserstein ambiguity set, in which both the distribution and the radius are modeled as functions of the planning decisions, reflecting the statistical characteristics of wind power resources. Then, we reformulate the model as a mixed-integer second-order cone program, and the optimal objective value provides a probabilistic guarantee on the out-of-sample performance. To improve computational efficiency, we develop a constraint generation based solution framework that accelerates the solution procedure by hundreds of times. Numerical experiments using different datasets validate the effectiveness of the solution framework and demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model.</description>

      <title>Online Stochastic Packing with General Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been a growing interest in studying online stochastic packing under more general correlation structures, motivated by the complex data sets and models driving modern applications. Several past works either assume correlations are weak or have a particular structure, have a complexity scaling with the number of Markovian "states of the world" (which may be exponentially large e.g. in the case of full history dependence), scale poorly with the horizon $T$, or make additional continuity assumptions. Surprisingly, we show that for all $\epsilon$, the online stochastic packing linear programming problem with general correlations (suitably normalized and with sparse columns) has an approximately optimal policy (with optimality gap $\epsilon T$) whose per-decision runtime scales as the time to simulate a single sample path of the underlying stochastic process (assuming access to a Monte Carlo simulator), multiplied by a constant independent of the horizon or number of Markovian states. We derive analogous results for network revenue management, and online bipartite matching and independent set in bounded-degree graphs, by rounding. Our algorithms implement stochastic gradient methods in a novel on-the-fly/recursive manner for the associated massive deterministic-equivalent linear program on the corresponding probability space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Haraux function is an important tool in monotone operator theory and its applications. One of its salient properties for maximally monotone operators is to be valued in $[0,+\infty]$ and to vanish only on the graph of the operator. Sharper lower bounds for this function were recently proposed in specific cases. We derive lower bounds in the general context of set-valued operators in reflexive Banach spaces. These bounds are new, even for maximally monotone operators acting on Euclidean spaces, a scenario in which we show that they can be better than existing ones. As a by-product, we obtain lower bounds for the Fenchel--Young function in variational analysis. Several examples are given and applications to composite monotone inclusions are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.06291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use tropicalization to study the duals to cones of nonnegative polynomials and sums of squares on a semialgebraic set $S$. The truncated cones of moments of measures supported on the set $S$ is dual to nonnegative polynomials on $S$, while "pseudo-moments" are dual to sums of squares approximations to nonnegative polynomials. We provide explicit combinatorial descriptions of tropicalizations of the moment and pseudo-moment cones, and demonstrate their usefulness in distinguishing between nonnegative polynomials and sums of squares. We give examples that show new limitations of sums of squares approximations of nonnegative polynomials. When the semialgebraic set is defined by binomial inequalites, its moment and pseudo-moment cones are closed under Hadamard product. In this case, their tropicalizations are polyhedral cones that encode all binomial inequalities on the moment and pseudo-moment cones.</description>

Abstract: We study the nucleolus in a class of cooperative games where agents collaborate by sharing demands and production-distribution capacities across multiple markets. These production-distribution games form a structured subclass of linear production games and capture applications such as horizontal collaboration in logistics. While computing the nucleolus is generally NP-hard for linear production games, we show that structural properties of production-distribution games enable efficient computation in several cases. Our main results focus on the uncapacitated variant. First, we provide a polynomial-time characterization of instances where the core reduces to a singleton, allowing direct computation of the nucleolus. Second, when the number of markets is fixed, we design a separation-based polynomial-time algorithm. Third, in the single-market case, we develop a faster combinatorial primal-dual algorithm that runs in $O(n^4)$.</description>

      <title>Mean-field games of optimal stopping: master equation and weak equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are interested in the study of stochastic games for which each player faces an optimal stopping problem. In our setting, the players may interact through the criterion to optimise as well as through their dynamics. After briefly discussing the N-player game, we formulate the corresponding mean-field problem. In particular, we introduce a weak formulation of the game for which we are able to prove existence of Nash equilibria for a large class of criteria. We also prove that equilibria for the mean-field problem provide approximated Nash equilibria for the N-player game, and we formally derive the master equation associated with our mean-field game.</description>

      <title>ODTlearn: A Package for Learning Optimal Decision Trees for Prediction and Prescription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15691v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: ODTLearn is an open-source Python package that provides methods for learning optimal decision trees for high-stakes predictive and prescriptive tasks based on the mixed-integer optimization (MIO) framework proposed in (Aghaei et al., 2021) and several of its extensions. The current version of the package provides implementations for learning optimal classification trees, optimal fair classification trees, optimal classification trees robust to distribution shifts, and optimal prescriptive trees from observational data. We have designed the package to be easy to maintain and extend as new optimal decision tree problem classes, reformulation strategies, and solution algorithms are introduced. To this end, the package follows object-oriented design principles and supports both commercial (Gurobi) and open source (COIN-OR branch and cut) solvers. The package documentation and an extensive user guide can be found at https://d3m-research-group.github.io/odtlearn/. Additionally, users can view the package source code and submit feature requests and bug reports by visiting https://github.com/D3M-Research-Group/odtlearn.</description>

      <title>Statistical Performance Guarantee for Subgroup Identification with Generic Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07973v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Across a wide array of disciplines, many researchers use machine learning (ML) algorithms to identify a subgroup of individuals who are likely to benefit from a treatment the most (``exceptional responders'') or those who are harmed by it. A common approach to this subgroup identification problem consists of two steps. First, researchers estimate the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) using an ML algorithm. Next, they use the estimated CATE to select those individuals who are predicted to be most affected by the treatment, either positively or negatively. Unfortunately, CATE estimates are often biased and noisy. In addition, utilizing the same data to both identify a subgroup and estimate its group average treatment effect results in a multiple testing problem. To address these challenges, we develop uniform confidence bands for estimation of the group average treatment effect sorted by generic ML algorithm (GATES). Using these uniform confidence bands, researchers can identify, with a statistical guarantee, a subgroup whose GATES exceeds a certain effect size, regardless of how this effect size is chosen. The validity of the proposed methodology depends solely on randomization of treatment and random sampling of units. Importantly, our method does not require modeling assumptions and avoids a computationally intensive resampling procedure. A simulation study shows that the proposed uniform confidence bands are reasonably informative and have an appropriate empirical coverage even when the sample size is as small as 100. We analyze a clinical trial of late-stage prostate cancer and find a relatively large proportion of exceptional responders.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Risk-Sensitive Policy Gradient: An Iteration Complexity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08955v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown exceptional performance across various applications, enabling autonomous agents to learn optimal policies through interaction with their environments. However, traditional RL frameworks often face challenges in terms of iteration efficiency and safety. Risk-sensitive policy gradient methods, which incorporate both expected return and risk measures, have been explored for their ability to yield safe policies, yet their iteration complexity remains largely underexplored. In this work, we conduct a rigorous iteration complexity analysis for the risk-sensitive policy gradient method, focusing on the REINFORCE algorithm with an exponential utility function. We establish an iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ to reach an $\epsilon$-approximate first-order stationary point (FOSP). Furthermore, we investigate whether risk-sensitive algorithms can achieve better iteration complexity compared to their risk-neutral counterparts. Our analysis indicates that risk-sensitive REINFORCE can potentially converge faster. To validate our analysis, we empirically evaluate the learning performance and convergence efficiency of the risk-neutral and risk-sensitive REINFORCE algorithms in multiple environments: CartPole, MiniGrid, and Robot Navigation. Empirical results confirm that risk-sensitive cases can converge and stabilize faster compared to their risk-neutral counterparts. More details can be found on our website https://anonymous.4open.science/w/riskrl.</description>

      <title>Minimization of the Pseudospectral Abscissa of a Quadratic Matrix Polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04297v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a quadratic matrix polynomial dependent on parameters and a given tolerance $\epsilon &gt; 0$, the minimization of the $\epsilon$-pseudospectral abscissa over the set of permissible parameter values is discussed, with applications in damping optimization and brake squeal reductions in mind. An approach is introduced that is based on nonsmooth and global optimization (or smooth optimization techniques such as BFGS if there are many parameters) equipped with a globally convergent criss-cross algorithm to compute the $\epsilon$-pseudospectral abscissa objective when the matrix polynomial is of small size. For the setting when the matrix polynomial is large, a subspace framework is introduced, and it is argued formally that it solves the minimization problem globally. The subspace framework restricts the parameter-dependent matrix polynomial to small subspaces, and thus solves the minimization problem for such restricted small matrix polynomials. It then expands the subspaces using the minimizers for the restricted polynomials. The proposed approach makes the global minimization of the $\epsilon$-pseudospectral abscissa possible for a quadratic matrix polynomial dependent on a few parameters and for sizes up to at least a few hundreds. This is illustrated on several examples originating from damping optimization.</description>

      <title>Offset-free model predictive control: stability under plant-model mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first general stability results for nonlinear offset-free model predictive control (MPC). Despite over twenty years of active research, the offset-free MPC literature has not shaken the assumption of closed-loop stability for establishing offset-free performance. In this paper, we present a nonlinear offset-free MPC design that is robustly stable with respect to the tracking errors, and thus achieves offset-free performance, despite plant-model mismatch and persistent disturbances. Key features and assumptions of this design include quadratic costs, differentiability of the plant and model functions, constraint backoffs at steady state, and a robustly stable state and disturbance estimator. We first establish nominal stability and offset-free performance. Then, robustness to state and disturbance estimate errors and setpoint and disturbance changes is demonstrated. Finally, the results are extended to sufficiently small plant-model mismatch. The results are illustrated by numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Best Response Convergence for Zero-sum Stochastic Dynamic Games with Partial and Asymmetric Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze best response dynamics for finding a Nash equilibrium of an infinite horizon zero-sum stochastic linear quadratic dynamic game (LQDG) with partial and asymmetric information. We derive explicit expressions for each player's best response within the class of pure linear dynamic output feedback control strategies where the internal state dimension of each control strategy is an integer multiple of the system state dimension. With each best response, the players form increasingly higher-order belief states, leading to infinite-dimensional internal states. However, we observe in extensive numerical experiments that the game's value converges after just a few iterations, suggesting that strategies associated with increasingly higher-order belief states eventually provide no benefit. To help explain this convergence, our numerical analysis reveals rapid decay of the controllability and observability Gramian eigenvalues and Hankel singular values in higher-order belief dynamics, indicating that the higher-order belief dynamics become increasingly difficult for both players to control and observe. Consequently, the higher-order belief dynamics can be closely approximated by low-order belief dynamics with bounded error, and thus feedback strategies with limited internal state dimension can closely approximate a Nash equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Event Camera Tuning for Detection Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the main challenges in unlocking the potential of neuromorphic cameras, also called ''event camera'', is the development of novel methods that solve the multi-variable problem of adjusting their biases parameters to accommodate a desired task. Actually, it is very difficult to find in the literature a systematic heuristic that solves the problem for any desired application. In this paper we present a tuning parameters heuristic for the biases of event cameras, for tasks that require small objects detection in staring scenarios. The main purpose of the heuristic is to squeeze the camera's potential, optimize its performance, and expand its detection capabilities as much as possible. In the presentation, we translate the experimental properties of event camera and systemic constrains into mathematical terms, and show, under certain assumptions and classical tools from functional analysis, how the multi-variable problem collapses into a two-parameter problem that can be solved experimentally. A main conclusion that will be demonstrated is that for certain desired signals, such as the one provided by an incandescent lamp powered by the periodic electrical grid, the optimal values of the camera are very far from the default values recommended by the manufacturer.</description>

      <title>DobLIX: A Dual-Objective Learned Index for Log-Structured Merge Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce DobLIX, a dual-objective learned index specifically designed for Log-Structured Merge(LSM) tree-based key-value stores. Although traditional learned indexes focus exclusively on optimizing index lookups, they often overlook the impact of data access from storage, resulting in performance bottlenecks. DobLIX addresses this by incorporating a second objective, data access optimization, into the learned index training process. This dual-objective approach ensures that both index lookup efficiency and data access costs are minimized, leading to significant improvements in read performance while maintaining write efficiency in real-world LSM-tree systems. Additionally, DobLIX features a reinforcement learning agent that dynamically tunes the system parameters, allowing it to adapt to varying workloads in real-time. Experimental results using real-world datasets demonstrate that DobLIX reduces indexing overhead and improves throughput by 1.19 to 2.21 times compared to state-of-the-art methods within RocksDB, a widely used LSM-tree-based storage engine.</description>

      <title>Armijo Line-search Can Make (Stochastic) Gradient Descent Provably Faster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00229v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Armijo line-search (Armijo-LS) is a standard method to set the step-size for gradient descent (GD). For smooth functions, Armijo-LS alleviates the need to know the global smoothness constant L and adapts to the ``local'' smoothness, enabling GD to converge faster. Existing theoretical analyses show that GD with Armijo-LS (GD-LS) can result in constant factor improvements over GD with a 1/L step-size (denoted as GD(1/L)). We strengthen these results and show that if the objective function satisfies a certain non-uniform smoothness condition, GD-LS can result in a faster convergence rate than GD(1/L). In particular, we prove that for convex objectives corresponding to logistic regression and multi-class classification, GD-LS can converge to the optimum at a linear rate, and hence improves over the sublinear convergence of GD(1/L). Furthermore, for non-convex objectives satisfying gradient domination (e.g., those corresponding to the softmax policy gradient in RL or generalized linear models with a logistic link function), GD-LS can match the fast convergence of algorithms tailored for these specific settings. Finally, we analyze the convergence of stochastic GD with a stochastic line-search on convex losses under the interpolation assumption.</description>

Abstract: This work deals with the generation of theoretical correlation matrices with specific sparsity patterns, associated to graph structures. We present a novel approach based on convex optimization, offering greater flexibility compared to existing techniques, notably by controlling the mean of the entry distribution in the generated correlation matrices. This allows for the generation of correlation matrices that better represent realistic data and can be used to benchmark statistical methods for graph inference.</description>

      <title>Deviation Between Team-Optimal Solution and Nash Equilibrium in Flow Assignment Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between the team-optimal solution and the Nash equilibrium (NE) to assess the impact of strategy deviation on team performance. As a working use case, we focus on a class of flow assignment problems in which each source node acts as a cooperating decision maker (DM) within a team that minimizes the team cost based on the team-optimal strategy. In practice, some selfish DMs may prioritize their own marginal cost and deviate from NE strategies, thus potentially degrading the overall performance. To quantify this deviation, we explore the deviation bound between the team-optimal solution and the NE in two specific scenarios: (i) when the team-optimal solution is unique and (ii) when multiple solutions do exist. This helps DMs analyze the factors influencing the deviation and adopting the NE strategy within a tolerable range. Furthermore, in the special case of a potential game model, we establish the consistency between the team-optimal solution and the NE. Once the consistency condition is satisfied, the strategy deviation does not alter the total cost, and DMs do not face a strategic trade-off. Finally, we validate our theoretical analysis through some simulation studies.</description>

      <title>Robust MPC for Uncertain Linear Systems - Combining Model Adaptation and Iterative Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a robust adaptive learning Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for linear systems with parametric uncertainties and additive disturbances performing iterative tasks. The approach refines the parameter estimates online using set-membership estimation. Performance enhancement over iterations is achieved by learning the terminal cost from data. Safety is enforced using a terminal set, which is also learned iteratively. The proposed method guarantees recursive feasibility, constraint satisfaction, and a robust bound on the closed-loop cost. Numerical simulations on a mass-spring-damper system demonstrate improved computational efficiency and control performance compared to a robust adaptive MPC scheme without iterative learning of the terminal ingredients.</description>

      <title>Responsible Machine Learning via Mixed-Integer Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05857v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last few decades, Machine Learning (ML) has achieved significant success across domains ranging from healthcare, sustainability, and the social sciences, to criminal justice and finance. But its deployment in increasingly sophisticated, critical, and sensitive areas affecting individuals, the groups they belong to, and society as a whole raises critical concerns around fairness, transparency and robustness, among others. As the complexity and scale of ML systems and of the settings in which they are deployed grow, so does the need for responsible ML methods that address these challenges while providing guaranteed performance in deployment.
  Mixed-integer optimization (MIO) offers a powerful framework for embedding responsible ML considerations directly into the learning process while maintaining performance. For example, it enables learning of inherently transparent models that can conveniently incorporate fairness or other domain specific constraints. This tutorial paper provides an accessible and comprehensive introduction to this topic discussing both theoretical and practical aspects. It outlines some of the core principles of responsible ML, their importance in applications, and the practical utility of MIO for building ML models that align with these principles. Through examples and mathematical formulations, it illustrates practical strategies and available tools for efficiently solving MIO problems for responsible ML. It concludes with a discussion on current limitations and open research questions, providing suggestions for future work.</description>

Abstract: This paper analyzes the stability of interconnected continuous-time (CT) and discrete-time (DT) systems coupled through sampling and zero-order hold mechanisms. The DT system updates its output at regular intervals $T&gt;0$ by applying an $n$-fold composition of a given map. This setup is motivated by online and sampled-data implementations of optimization-based controllers - particularly model predictive control (MPC) - where the DT system models $n$ iterations of an algorithm approximating the solution of an optimization problem.
  We introduce the concept of a reduced model, defined as the limiting behavior of the sampled-data system as $T \to 0^+$ and $n \to +\infty$. Our main theoretical contribution establishes that when the reduced model is contractive, there exists a threshold duration $T(n)$ for each iteration count $n$ such that the CT-DT interconnection achieves exponential stability for all sampling periods $T &lt; T(n)$. Finally, under the stronger condition that both the CT and DT systems are contractive, we show exponential stability of their interconnection using a small-gain argument. Our theoretical results provide new insights into suboptimal MPC stability, showing that convergence guarantees hold even when using a single iteration of the optimization algorithm - a practically significant finding for real-time control applications.</description>

      <title>Adaptively Robust LLM Inference Optimization under Prediction Uncertainty</title>

Abstract: We study the problem of optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) inference scheduling to minimize total latency. LLM inference is an online and multi-task service process and also heavily energy consuming by which a pre-trained LLM processes input requests and generates output tokens sequentially. Therefore, it is vital to improve its scheduling efficiency and reduce the power consumption while a great amount of prompt requests are arriving. A key challenge in LLM inference scheduling is that while the prompt length is known upon arrival, the output length, which critically impacts memory usage and processing time, is unknown. To address this uncertainty, we propose algorithms that leverage machine learning to predict output lengths, assuming the prediction provides an interval classification (min-max range) for each request.
  We first design a conservative algorithm, $\mathcal{A}_{\max}$, which schedules requests based on the upper bound of predicted output lengths to prevent memory overflow. However, this approach is overly conservative: as prediction accuracy decreases, performance degrades significantly due to potential overestimation. To overcome this limitation, we propose $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$, an adaptive algorithm that initially treats the predicted lower bound as the output length and dynamically refines this estimate during inferencing. We prove that $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ achieves a log-scale competitive ratio. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ often performs nearly as well as the hindsight scheduler, highlighting both its efficiency and robustness in practical scenarios. Moreover, $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ relies solely on the lower bound of the prediction interval--an advantageous design choice since upper bounds on output length are typically more challenging to predict accurately.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Dead-Zone Dual Sliding Mode Observer for Reliable Electrochemical Model-Based SOC Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21610</link>

Abstract: Accurate state of charge (SOC) estimation is critical for ensuring the safety, reliability, and efficiency of lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles and energy storage systems. Electrochemical models provide high fidelity for SOC estimation but introduce challenges due to parameter variations, nonlinearities, and computational complexity. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive dead-zone dual sliding mode observer(SMO) based on an improved electrochemical single-particle model. The algorithm integrates a state observer for SOC estimation and a parameter observer for online parameter adaptation. A Lyapunov-derived adaptive dead-zone is introduced to ensure stability, activating parameter updates only when the terminal voltage error lies within a rigorously defined bound. The proposed method was validated under constant-current and UDDS dynamic conditions. Results demonstrate that the adaptive dead-zone dual SMO achieves superior accuracy compared with conventional dual SMO and equivalent circuit model-based EKF methods, maintaining SOC estimation errors within 0.2% under correct initialization and below 1% under a 30% initial SOC error, with rapid convergence. Computational efficiency analysis further shows that the adaptive dead-zone dual sliding mode observer reduces execution time compared with the conventional dual SMO by limiting unnecessary parameter updates, highlighting its suitability for real-time battery management applications. Moreover, robustness under battery aging was confirmed using a cycle-aging model, where the adaptive dead-zone dual SMO maintained stable SOC estimation despite parameter drift. These findings indicate that the proposed method offers a reliable, accurate, and computationally efficient solution for SOC estimation.</description>
