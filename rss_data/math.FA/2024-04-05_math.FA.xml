      <title>Scaled global operators and Fueter variables on non-zero scaled hypercomplex numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we describe the rise of global operators in the scaled quaternionic case, an important extension from the quaternionic case to the family of scaled hypercomplex numbers $\mathbb{H}_t,\, t\in\mathbb{R}^*$, of which the $\mathbb{H}_{-1}=\mathbb{H}$ is the space of quaternions and $\mathbb{H}_{1}$ is the space of split quaternions. We also describe the scaled Fueter-type variables associated to these operators, developing a coherent theory in this field. We use these types of variables to build different types of function spaces on $\mathbb{H}_t$. Counterparts of the Hardy space and of the Arveson space are also introduced and studied in the present setting. The two different adjoints in the scaled hypercomplex numbers lead to two parallel cases in each instance. Finally we introduce and study the notion of rational function.</description>

      <title>Completeness of systems of inner functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{Q}$ denote the class of inner functions $\vartheta$ such that the measure $\sum_{w\in\vartheta^{-1}(z)} (1-|w|)\delta_w$ is a Carleson measure for all $z$ in the complement of a set of logarithmic capacity zero. For $\vartheta,\varphi\in\mathcal{Q}$, we give a simple sufficient condition for the system $\vartheta^m,\; \varphi^n$, $m,n\in\mathbb{Z}$, to be complete in the weak-$^*$ topology of $L^\infty(\mathbb{T})$. To be precise, we show that this system is complete whenever there is an arc $I$ of the unit circle $\mathbb{T}$ such that $\vartheta$ is univalent on $I$ and $\varphi$ is univalent on $\mathbb{T}\setminus I$. As an application of this result, we describe a class of analytic curves $\Gamma$ such that $(\Gamma, \mathcal{X})$ is a Heisenberg uniqueness pair, where $\mathcal{X}$ is the lattice cross $\{(m,n)\in\mathbb{Z}^2:\, mn=0\}$. Our main result extends a theorem of Hedenmalm and Montes-Rodr\'iguez for atomic inner functions with one singularity.</description>

      <title>Szeg\H{o} Limit Theorem for Truncated Toeplitz Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss generalizations of the Szeg\H{o} Limit Theorem to truncated Toeplitz operators. In particular, we consider compressions of Toeplitz operators to an increasing sequence of finite dimensional model spaces. We present two theorems. The first is a new variant of the Szeg\H{o} Limit Theorem in this setting. The second relates to the variant given by Strouse-Timotin-Zarrabi in 2017, and characterizes the sequences for which that result holds.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructive properties of uniform convexity, strict convexity, near convexity, and metric convexity in real normed linear spaces are considered. Examples show that certain classical theorems, such as the existence of points of osculation, are constructively invalid. The methods used are in accord with principles introduced by Errett Bishop</description>

      <title>The set of elementary tensors is weakly closed in projective tensor products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we prove that the set of elementary tensors is weakly closed in the projective tensor product of two Banach spaces. As a result, we are able to answer a question from the literature proving that if $(x_n) \subset X$ and $(y_n) \subset Y$ are two weakly null sequences such that $(x_n \otimes y_n)$ converges weakly in $X \widehat{\otimes}_\pi Y$, then $(x_n \otimes y_n)$ is also weakly null.</description>

Abstract: We study a truncated two-dimensional moment problem in terms of the Stieltjes transform. The set of the solutions is described by the Schur step-by-step algorithm, which is based on the continued fraction expansion of the solution. In particular, the obtained results are applicable to the two-dimensional moment problem for atomic measures.</description>

      <title>Spectral projection operators of the Sub-Laplacian and Laguerre calculus on non-degenerate nilpotent Lie groups of step two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the spectral projection operators $\mathbb{P}_m$ on non-degenerate nilpotent Lie groups $\mathcal{N}$ of step two, associated to the joint spectrum of sub-Laplacian and derivatives in step two. We construct their kernels $P_m(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{t})$ by using Laguerre calculus and find a simple integral representation formula for $\mathbf{y}\neq 0$. Then we show the kernels are Lipschitzian homogeneous functions on $\mathcal{N}\setminus \{\mathbf{0}\}$ by analytic continuation. Moreover, they are shown to be Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund kernels, so that the spectral projection operator $\mathbb{P}_m$ can be extended to a bounded operator from $L^p(\mathcal{N})$ to itself. We also prove a convergence theorem of the Abel sum $\lim _{R \rightarrow 1^-} \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} R^{m}\mathbb{P}_{m}\phi=\phi$ by estimating the $L^p(\mathcal{N})$-norms of $\mathbb{P}_m$. Furthermore, $\mathbb{P}_m$ are mutually orthogonal projection operators and $\sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \mathbb{P}_{m}\phi=\phi$ for $\phi\in L^2(\mathcal{N})$.</description>

      <title>The operator distances from projections to an idempotent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to give a full characterization of the operator distances from projections to an idempotent, which includes the minimum value, the maximum value and the intermediate values. Let $H$ be a Hilbert space and $\mathbb{B}(H)$ be the set of bounded linear operators on $H$. Given an arbitrary idempotent $Q\in \mathbb{B}(H)$, it is proved that $$\|m(Q)-Q\|\le \|P-Q\|\le \|I-m(Q)-Q\|$$ for every projection $P$ on $H$, in which $I$ is the identity operator on $H$ and $m(Q)$ is a specific projection called the matched projection of $Q$. When $Q\in\mathbb{B}(H)$ is a non-projection idempotent, it is proved that for every number $\alpha$ contained in the interval $\left[\|m(Q)-Q\|,\|I-m(Q)-Q\|\right]$, there exists a projection $P\in \mathbb{B}(H)$ such that $\|P-Q\|=\alpha$. Two uniqueness problems concerning the projections that attain the minimum value or the maximum value are also dealt with.</description>

      <title>Symmetry of Convex Solutions to Fully Nonlinear Elliptic Systems: Bounded Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the monotonic and symmetric properties of convex solutions to fully nonlinear elliptic systems. We mainly discuss Monge-Amp\`ere type systems for instance, considering
  \begin{equation*}
  \det(D^2u^i)=f^i(x,{\bf u},\nabla u^i), \ 1\leq i\leq m,
  \end{equation*} over bounded domains of various cases, including the bounded smooth simply connected domains and bounded tube shape domains in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We obtain monotonic and symmetric properties of the solutions to the problem with respect to the geometry of domains and the monotonic and symmetric properties of right-hand side terms. The proof is based on carefully using the moving plane method together with various maximum principles and Hopf's lemmas. The existence and uniqueness to an interesting example of such system is also discussed as an application of our results.</description>

      <title>Riemann-Hilbert problems, Toeplitz operators and ergosurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Riemann-Hilbert approach, in conjunction with the canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation of certain matrix functions called monodromy matrices, enables one to obtain explicit solutions to the non-linear field equations of some gravitational theories. These solutions are encoded in the elements of a matrix $M$ depending on the Weyl coordinates $\rho$ and $v$, determined by that factorisation. We address here, for the first time, the underlying question of what happens when a canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation does not exist, using the close connection of Wiener-Hopf factorisation with Toeplitz operators to study this question. For the case of rational monodromy matrices, we prove that the non-existence of a canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation determines curves in the $(\rho,v)$ plane on which some elements of $M(\rho,v)$ tend to infinity, but where the space-time metric may still be well behaved. In the case of uncharged rotating black holes in four space-time dimensions and, for certain choices of coordinates, in five space-time dimensions, we show that these curves correspond to their ergosurfaces.</description>

      <title>Fundamental inequalities for the iterated Fourier-cosine convolution with Gaussian weight and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Derived from the results in (Math. Nachr., 283(12):1758-1770, 2010), in this paper, we devoted to studying the boundedness properties for Fourier-cosine convolution weighted by Gaussian functions via Young's type theorem and Saitoh's type inequality. New norm estimations in the weighted space are obtained and application of the corresponding class of convolutions in Fredholm's second kind of integral equation is discussed. The conditions for the solvability of this equation in $L_1$ space are also found, along with the analysis of an illustrative example, which exemplifies that the present object and method solve cases that are not under the conditions of previously known techniques.</description>

      <title>On algebras of Dirichlet series invariant under permutations of coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr O_u$ be the algebra of holomorphic functions on ${\bf C}_+:=\{s\in{\bf C}:\text{Re }s&gt;0\}$ that are limits of Dirichlet series $D=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n n^{-s}$, $s\in \bf{C}_+$, that converge uniformly on proper half-planes of $\bf{C}_+$. We study algebraic-topological properties of subalgebras of $\mathscr O_u$: the Banach algebras $\mathscr W, \mathscr A, \mathscr H^\infty$ and the Frechet algebra $\mathscr O_b$. Here $\mathscr W$ consists of functions in $\mathscr O_u$ of absolutely convergent Dirichlet series on the closure of $\bf{C}_+$, $\mathscr A$ is the uniform closure of $\mathscr W$, $\mathscr H^\infty$ is the algebra of all bounded functions in $\mathscr O_u$, and $\mathscr O_b$ is set of all $f(s)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n n^{-s}$ in $\mathscr O_u$ so that $f_r\in \mathscr H^\infty$, $r\in (0,1)$, where $f_r(s):=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n r^{\Omega(n)} n^{-s}$ and $\Omega(n)$ is the number of prime factors of $n$. Let $S_\bf{N}$ be the group of permutations of $\bf{N}$. Each $\sigma\in S_\bf{N}$ determines a permutation $\hat\sigma\in S_\bf{N}$ (i.e., such that $\hat\sigma(mn)=\hat\sigma(n)\hat\sigma(m)$ for all $m,n\in \bf{N}$) via the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. For a Dirichlet series $D=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n n^{-s}$, and $\sigma \in S_\bf{N}$, $S_\sigma(D)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_{\hat{\sigma}^{-1}(n)} n^{-s}$ determines an action of $S_\bf{N}$ on the set of all Dirichlet series. It is shown that each of the algebras above is invariant with respect to this action. Given a subgroup $G$ of $S_\bf{N}$, the set of $G$-invariant subalgebras of these algebras are studied, and their maximal ideal spaces are described, and used to characterise groups of units and of invertible elements having logarithms, find the stable rank, show projective freeness, and describe when the special linear group is generated by elementary matrices, with bounds on the number of factors.</description>

Abstract: We extend three related results from the analysis of influences of Boolean functions to the quantum setting, namely the KKL Theorem, Friedgut's Junta Theorem and Talagrand's variance inequality for geometric influences. Our results are derived by a joint use of recently studied hypercontractivity and gradient estimates. These generic tools also allow us to derive generalizations of these results in a general von Neumann algebraic setting beyond the case of the quantum hypercube, including examples in infinite dimensions relevant to quantum information theory such as continuous variables quantum systems. Finally, we comment on the implications of our results as regards to noncommutative extensions of isoperimetric type inequalities, quantum circuit complexity lower bounds and the learnability of quantum observables.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal A$ be a infinite dimensional C*-algebra and $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. We compute the Szlenk index of $\mathcal A$ and $L_p(\mathcal A)$, and show that $Sz(\mathcal A)=\Gamma'(i(\mathcal A))$ and $Dz(\mathcal A)=Sz(L_p(\mathcal A))=\omega Sz(\mathcal A)=\omega\Gamma'(i(\mathcal A))$, where $i(\mathcal A)$ is the noncommutative Cantor-Bendixson index, $\Gamma'(\xi)$ is the minimum ordinal number which is greater than $\xi$ of the form $\omega^\zeta$ for some $\zeta$ and we agree that $\Gamma'(\infty)=\infty$ and $\omega\cdot\infty=\infty$. As a application, we compute the Szlenk index [respectively, $w^\ast$-dentability index] of a C*-tensor product $\mathcal A\otimes_\beta\mathcal B$ of non-zero C*-algebras $\mathcal A$ and $\mathcal B$ in terms of $Sz(\mathcal A)$ and $Sz(\mathcal B)$ [respectively, $Dz(\mathcal A)$ and $Dz(\mathcal B)$]. When $\mathcal A$ is a separable C*-algebra, we show that there exists $a\in \mathcal A_h$ such that $Sz(\mathcal A)=Sz(C^\ast(a))$ and $Dz(\mathcal A)=Dz(C^\ast(a))$, where $C^\ast(a)$ is the C*-subalgebra of $\mathcal A$ generated by $a$.</description>

      <title>From the Choi Formalism in Infinite Dimensions to Unique Decompositions of Generators of Completely Positive Dynamical Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given any separable complex Hilbert space, any trace-class operator $B$ which does not have purely imaginary trace, and any generator $L$ of a norm-continuous one-parameter semigroup of completely positive maps we prove that there exists a unique bounded operator $K$ and a unique completely positive map $\Phi$ such that (i) $L=K(\cdot)+(\cdot)K^*+\Phi$, (ii) the superoperator $\Phi(B^*(\cdot)B)$ is trace class and has vanishing trace, and (iii) ${\rm tr}(B^*K)$ is a real number. Central to our proof is a modified version of the Choi formalism which relates completely positive maps to positive semi-definite operators. We characterize when this correspondence is injective and surjective, respectively, which in turn explains why the proof idea of our main result cannot extend to non-separable Hilbert spaces. In particular, we find examples of positive semi-definite operators which have empty pre-image under the Choi formalism as soon as the underlying Hilbert space is infinite-dimensional.</description>

Abstract: Our note is a complement to recent articles \cite{JS1} (2011) and \cite{JS2} (2013) by M. Jim\'enez-Sevilla and L. S\'anchez-Gonz\'alez which generalise (the basic statement of) the classical Whitney extension theorem for $C^1$-smooth real functions on $\mathbb R^n$ to the case of real functions on $X$ (\cite{JS1}) and to the case of mappings from $X$ to $Y$ (\cite{JS2}) for some Banach spaces $X$ and $Y$. Since the proof from \cite{JS2} contains a serious flaw, we supply a different more transparent detailed proof under (probably) slightly stronger assumptions on $X$ and $Y$. Our proof gives also extensions results from special sets (e.g. Lipschitz submanifolds or closed convex bodies) under substantially weaker assumptions on $X$ and $Y$. Further, we observe that the mapping $F\in C^1(X;Y)$ which extends $f$ given on a closed set $A\subset X$ can be, in some cases, $C^\infty$-smooth (or $C^k$-smooth with $k&gt;1$) on $X\setminus A$. Of course, also this improved result is weaker than Whitney's result (for $X=\mathbb R^n$, $Y=\mathbb R$) which asserts that $F$ is even analytic on $X\setminus A$. Further, following another Whitney's article and using the above results, we prove results on extensions of $C^1$-smooth mappings from open ("weakly") quasiconvex subsets of $X$. Following the above mentioned articles we also consider the question concerning the Lipschitz constant of $F$ if $f$ is a Lipschitz mapping.</description>

      <title>Free probability via entropic optimal transport</title>

Abstract: Let $\mu$ and $\nu$ be probability measures on $\mathbb{R}$ with compact support, and let $\mu \boxplus \nu$ denote their additive free convolution. We show that for $z \in \mathbb{R}$ greater than the sum of essential suprema of $\mu$ and $\nu$, we have \begin{equation*} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \log(z - x) \mu \boxplus \nu (\mathrm{d}x) = \sup_{\Pi} \left\{ \mathbf{E}_\Pi[\log(z - (X+Y)] - H(\Pi|\mu \otimes \nu) \right\}, \end{equation*} where the supremum is taken over all couplings $\Pi$ of the probability measures $\mu$ and $\nu$, and $H(\Pi|\mu \otimes \nu)$ denotes the relative entropy of a coupling $\Pi$ against product measure. We prove similar formulas for the multiplicative free convolution $\mu \boxtimes \nu$ and the free compression $[\mu]_\tau$ of probability measures, as well as for multivariate free operations. Thus the integrals of a log-potential against the fundamental measure operations of free probability may be formulated in terms of entropic optimal transport problems. The optimal couplings in these variational descriptions of the free probability operations can be computed explicitly, and from these we can then deduce the standard $R$- and $S$-transform descriptions of additive and multiplicative free convolution. We use our optimal transport formulations to derive new inequalities relating free and classical operations on probability measures, such as the inequality \begin{equation*} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \log(z - x) \mu \boxplus \nu (\mathrm{d}x) \geq \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \log(z-x) \mu \ast \nu( \mathrm{d}x) \end{equation*} relating free and classical convolution. Our approach is based on applying a large deviation principle on the symmetric group to the quadrature formulas of Marcus, Spielman and Srivastava.</description>
