      <title>Singularity Protocol for Cross Chain AMM without Intermediate Tokens or Bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are decentralized exchange protocols that provide continuous access to token liquidity without the need for order books or traditional market makers. However, this innovation has failed to scale when it comes to cross-chain swaps. Modern cross-chain swaps employ double-sided AMMs, which are not only inefficient due to liquidity fragmentation but also require an intermediate token. This introduces inherent volatility risk as well as blockchain and bridging risk, especially in the case of wrapped tokens. This paper describes the inefficiencies of existing AMM invariants, particularly their mixed polynomial nature, and derives a new class of AMMs that do not have bi-state dependency between the assets being swapped. We propose a novel method of value transfer swaps using the described invariant that mitigates the need for bi-state dependency and eliminates the need for intermediate tokens or bridging. Furthermore, we show how this mechanism enables efficient cross-chain swaps with lower gas requirements and no bridging risks. The proposed technology is designed to support cross-chain swaps across any permutation of L1, L2, and L3 blockchains.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Black Box: Interpretability of LLMs in Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across a spectrum of tasks in financial services, including report generation, chatbots, sentiment analysis, regulatory compliance, investment advisory, financial knowledge retrieval, and summarization. However, their intrinsic complexity and lack of transparency pose significant challenges, especially in the highly regulated financial sector, where interpretability, fairness, and accountability are critical. As far as we are aware, this paper presents the first application in the finance domain of understanding and utilizing the inner workings of LLMs through mechanistic interpretability, addressing the pressing need for transparency and control in AI systems. Mechanistic interpretability is the most intuitive and transparent way to understand LLM behavior by reverse-engineering their internal workings. By dissecting the activations and circuits within these models, it provides insights into how specific features or components influence predictions - making it possible not only to observe but also to modify model behavior. In this paper, we explore the theoretical aspects of mechanistic interpretability and demonstrate its practical relevance through a range of financial use cases and experiments, including applications in trading strategies, sentiment analysis, bias, and hallucination detection. While not yet widely adopted, mechanistic interpretability is expected to become increasingly vital as adoption of LLMs increases. Advanced interpretability tools can ensure AI systems remain ethical, transparent, and aligned with evolving financial regulations. In this paper, we have put special emphasis on how these techniques can help unlock interpretability requirements for regulatory and compliance purposes - addressing both current needs and anticipating future expectations from financial regulators globally.</description>

      <title>Efficient Bayesian multi-fidelity inverse analysis for expensive and non-differentiable physics-based simulations in high stochastic dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional Bayesian inverse analysis (dim &gt;&gt; 100) is mostly unfeasible for computationally demanding, nonlinear physics-based high-fidelity (HF) models. Usually, the use of more efficient gradient-based inference schemes is impeded if the multi-physics models are provided by complex legacy codes. Adjoint-based derivatives are either exceedingly cumbersome to derive or non-existent for practically relevant large-scale nonlinear and coupled multi-physics problems. Similarly, holistic automated differentiation w.r.t. primary variables of multi-physics codes is usually not yet an option and requires extensive code restructuring if not considered from the outset in the software design. This absence of differentiability further exacerbates the already present computational challenges. To overcome the existing limitations, we propose a novel inference approach called Bayesian multi-fidelity inverse analysis (BMFIA), which leverages simpler and computationally cheaper lower-fidelity (LF) models that are designed to provide model derivatives. BMFIA learns a simple, probabilistic dependence of the LF and HF models, which is then employed in an altered likelihood formulation to statistically correct the inaccurate LF response. From a Bayesian viewpoint, this dependence represents a multi-fidelity conditional density (discriminative model). We demonstrate how this multi-fidelity conditional density can be learned robustly in the small data regime from only a few HF and LF simulations (50 to 300), which would not be sufficient for naive surrogate approaches. The formulation is fully differentiable and allows the flexible design of a wide range of LF models. We demonstrate that BMFIA solves Bayesian inverse problems for scenarios that used to be prohibitive, such as finely-resolved spatial reconstruction problems for nonlinear and transient coupled poro-elastic media physics.</description>

      <title>The Surprising Soupability of Documents in State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether hidden states from Structured State Space Models (SSMs) can be merged post-hoc to support downstream reasoning. Inspired by model souping, we propose a strategy where documents are encoded independently and their representations are pooled -- via simple operations like averaging -- into a single context state. This approach, which we call document souping, enables modular encoding and reuse without reprocessing the full input for each query. We finetune Mamba2 models to produce soupable representations and find that they support multi-hop QA, sparse retrieval, and long-document reasoning with strong accuracy. On HotpotQA, souping ten independently encoded documents nearly matches the performance of a cross-encoder trained on the same inputs.</description>

      <title>Transaction Proximity: A Graph-Based Approach to Blockchain Fraud Prevention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a fraud-deterrent access validation system for public blockchains, leveraging two complementary concepts: "Transaction Proximity", which measures the distance between wallets in the transaction graph, and "Easily Attainable Identities (EAIs)", wallets with direct transaction connections to centralized exchanges. Recognizing the limitations of traditional approaches like blocklisting (reactive, slow) and strict allow listing (privacy-invasive, adoption barriers), we propose a system that analyzes transaction patterns to identify wallets with close connections to centralized exchanges.
  Our directed graph analysis of the Ethereum blockchain reveals that 56% of large USDC wallets (with a lifetime maximum balance greater than \$10,000) are EAI and 88% are within one transaction hop of an EAI. For transactions exceeding \$2,000, 91% involve at least one EAI. Crucially, an analysis of past exploits shows that 83% of the known exploiter addresses are not EAIs, with 21% being more than five hops away from any regulated exchange. We present three implementation approaches with varying gas cost and privacy tradeoffs, demonstrating that EAI-based access control can potentially prevent most of these incidents while preserving blockchain openness. Importantly, our approach does not restrict access or share personally identifiable information, but it provides information for protocols to implement their own validation or risk scoring systems based on specific needs. This middle-ground solution enables programmatic compliance while maintaining the core values of open blockchain.</description>

      <title>Looking for Attention: Randomized Attention Test Design for Validator Monitoring in Optimistic Rollups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimistic Rollups (ORUs) significantly enhance blockchain scalability but inherently suffer from the verifier's dilemma, particularly concerning validator attentiveness. Current systems lack mechanisms to proactively ensure validators are diligently monitoring L2 state transitions, creating a vulnerability where fraudulent states could be finalized. This paper introduces the Randomized Attention Test (RAT), a novel L1-based protocol designed to probabilistically challenge validators in ORUs, thereby verifying their liveness and computational readiness. Our game-theoretic analysis demonstrates that an Ideal Security Equilibrium, where all validators are attentive and proposers are honest, can be achieved with RAT. Notably, this equilibrium is attainable and stable with relatively low economic penalties (e.g., under $1000) for non-responsive validators and a low attention test frequency (e.g., under 1% per epoch). RAT thus provides a crucial, practical mechanism to enforce validator diligence, fortifying the overall security and integrity of ORU systems with minimizing additional costs.</description>

      <title>Efficient Estimation of Regularized Tyler's M-Estimator Using Approximate LOOCV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a regularization parameter, or a shrinkage coefficient $\alpha \in (0,1)$ for Regularized Tyler's M-estimator (RTME). In particular, we propose to estimate an optimal shrinkage coefficient by setting $\alpha$ as the solution to a suitably chosen objective function; namely the leave-one-out cross-validated (LOOCV) log-likelihood loss. Since LOOCV is computationally prohibitive even for moderate sample size $n$, we propose a computationally efficient approximation for the LOOCV log-likelihood loss that eliminates the need for invoking the RTME procedure $n$ times for each sample left out during the LOOCV procedure. This approximation yields an $O(n)$ reduction in the running time complexity for the LOOCV procedure, which results in a significant speedup for computing the LOOCV estimate. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach on synthetic high-dimensional data sampled from heavy-tailed elliptical distributions, as well as on real high-dimensional datasets for object recognition, face recognition, and handwritten digit's recognition. Our experiments show that the proposed approach is efficient and consistently more accurate than other methods in the literature for shrinkage coefficient estimation.</description>

      <title>Interpolating Neural Network-Tensor Decomposition (INN-TD): a scalable and interpretable approach for large-scale physics-based problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning has been extensively employed as a powerful function approximator for modeling physics-based problems described by partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite their popularity, standard deep learning models often demand prohibitively large computational resources and yield limited accuracy when scaling to large-scale, high-dimensional physical problems. Their black-box nature further hinders the application in industrial problems where interpretability and high precision are critical. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces Interpolating Neural Network-Tensor Decomposition (INN-TD), a scalable and interpretable framework that has the merits of both machine learning and finite element methods for modeling large-scale physical systems. By integrating locally supported interpolation functions from finite element into the network architecture, INN-TD achieves a sparse learning structure with enhanced accuracy, faster training/solving speed, and reduced memory footprint. This makes it particularly effective for tackling large-scale high-dimensional parametric PDEs in training, solving, and inverse optimization tasks in physical problems where high precision is required.</description>

      <title>GIT-BO: High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization with Tabular Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) effectively optimizes expensive black-box functions but faces significant challenges in high-dimensional spaces (dimensions exceeding 100) due to the curse of dimensionality. Existing high-dimensional BO methods typically leverage low-dimensional embeddings or structural assumptions to mitigate this challenge, yet these approaches frequently incur considerable computational overhead and rigidity due to iterative surrogate retraining and fixed assumptions. To address these limitations, we propose Gradient-Informed Bayesian Optimization using Tabular Foundation Models (GIT-BO), an approach that utilizes a pre-trained tabular foundation model (TFM) as a surrogate, leveraging its gradient information to adaptively identify low-dimensional subspaces for optimization. We propose a way to exploit internal gradient computations from the TFM's forward pass by creating a gradient-informed diagnostic matrix that reveals the most sensitive directions of the TFM's predictions, enabling optimization in a continuously re-estimated active subspace without the need for repeated model retraining. Extensive empirical evaluation across 23 synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrates that GIT-BO consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art Gaussian process-based high-dimensional BO methods, showing superior scalability and optimization performances, especially as dimensionality increases up to 500 dimensions. This work establishes foundation models, augmented with gradient-informed adaptive subspace identification, as highly competitive alternatives to traditional Gaussian process-based approaches for high-dimensional Bayesian optimization tasks.</description>

      <title>MOOSE-Chem3: Toward Experiment-Guided Hypothesis Ranking via Simulated Experimental Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypothesis ranking is a crucial component of automated scientific discovery, particularly in natural sciences where wet-lab experiments are costly and throughput-limited. Existing approaches focus on pre-experiment ranking, relying solely on large language model's internal reasoning without incorporating empirical outcomes from experiments. We introduce the task of experiment-guided ranking, which aims to prioritize candidate hypotheses based on the results of previously tested ones. However, developing such strategies is challenging due to the impracticality of repeatedly conducting real experiments in natural science domains. To address this, we propose a simulator grounded in three domain-informed assumptions, modeling hypothesis performance as a function of similarity to a known ground truth hypothesis, perturbed by noise. We curate a dataset of 124 chemistry hypotheses with experimentally reported outcomes to validate the simulator. Building on this simulator, we develop a pseudo experiment-guided ranking method that clusters hypotheses by shared functional characteristics and prioritizes candidates based on insights derived from simulated experimental feedback. Experiments show that our method outperforms pre-experiment baselines and strong ablations.</description>
