      <title>Effective Adaptive Mutation Rates for Program Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem-solving performance of many evolutionary algorithms, including genetic programming systems used for program synthesis, depends on the values of hyperparameters including mutation rates. The mutation method used to produce some of the best results to date on software synthesis benchmark problems, Uniform Mutation by Addition and Deletion (UMAD), adds new genes into a genome at a predetermined rate and then deletes genes at a rate that balances the addition rate, producing no size change on average. While UMAD with a predetermined addition rate outperforms many other mutation and crossover schemes, we do not expect a single rate to be optimal across all problems or all generations within one run of an evolutionary system. However, many current adaptive mutation schemes such as self-adaptive mutation rates suffer from pathologies like the vanishing mutation rate problem, in which the mutation rate quickly decays to zero. We propose an adaptive bandit-based scheme that addresses this problem and essentially removes the need to specify a mutation rate. Although the proposed scheme itself introduces hyperparameters, we either set these to good values or ensemble them in a reasonable range. Results on software synthesis and symbolic regression problems validate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Towards Biologically Plausible Computing: A Comprehensive Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backpropagation is a cornerstone algorithm in training neural networks for supervised learning, which uses a gradient descent method to update network weights by minimizing the discrepancy between actual and desired outputs. Despite its pivotal role in propelling deep learning advancements, the biological plausibility of backpropagation is questioned due to its requirements for weight symmetry, global error computation, and dual-phase training. To address this long-standing challenge, many studies have endeavored to devise biologically plausible training algorithms. However, a fully biologically plausible algorithm for training multilayer neural networks remains elusive, and interpretations of biological plausibility vary among researchers. In this study, we establish criteria for biological plausibility that a desirable learning algorithm should meet. Using these criteria, we evaluate a range of existing algorithms considered to be biologically plausible, including Hebbian learning, spike-timing-dependent plasticity, feedback alignment, target propagation, predictive coding, forward-forward algorithm, perturbation learning, local losses, and energy-based learning. Additionally, we empirically evaluate these algorithms across diverse network architectures and datasets. We compare the feature representations learned by these algorithms with brain activity recorded by non-invasive devices under identical stimuli, aiming to identify which algorithm can most accurately replicate brain activity patterns. We are hopeful that this study could inspire the development of new biologically plausible algorithms for training multilayer networks, thereby fostering progress in both the fields of neuroscience and machine learning.</description>

      <title>A First Running Time Analysis of the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have emerged as a predominant approach for addressing multi-objective optimization problems. However, the theoretical foundation of multi-objective EAs (MOEAs), particularly the fundamental aspects like running time analysis, remains largely underexplored. Existing theoretical studies mainly focus on basic MOEAs, with little attention given to practical MOEAs. In this paper, we present a running time analysis of strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm 2 (SPEA2) for the first time. Specifically, we prove that the expected running time of SPEA2 for solving three commonly used multi-objective problems, i.e., $m$OneMinMax, $m$LeadingOnesTrailingZeroes, and $m$-OneJumpZeroJump, is $O(\mu n\cdot \min\{m\log n, n\})$, $O(\mu n^2)$, and $O(\mu n^k \cdot \min\{mn, 3^{m/2}\})$, respectively. Here $m$ denotes the number of objectives, and the population size $\mu$ is required to be at least $(2n/m+1)^{m/2}$, $(2n/m+1)^{m-1}$ and $(2n/m-2k+3)^{m/2}$, respectively. The proofs are accomplished through general theorems which are also applicable for analyzing the expected running time of other MOEAs on these problems, and thus can be helpful for future theoretical analysis of MOEAs.</description>

      <title>Emerging NeoHebbian Dynamics in Forward-Forward Learning: Implications for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in neural computation have predominantly relied on the gradient backpropagation algorithm (BP). However, the recent shift towards non-stationary data modeling has highlighted the limitations of this heuristic, exposing that its adaptation capabilities are far from those seen in biological brains. Unlike BP, where weight updates are computed through a reverse error propagation path, Hebbian learning dynamics provide synaptic updates using only information within the layer itself. This has spurred interest in biologically plausible learning algorithms, hypothesized to overcome BP's shortcomings. In this context, Hinton recently introduced the Forward-Forward Algorithm (FFA), which employs local learning rules for each layer and has empirically proven its efficacy in multiple data modeling tasks. In this work we argue that when employing a squared Euclidean norm as a goodness function driving the local learning, the resulting FFA is equivalent to a neo-Hebbian Learning Rule. To verify this result, we compare the training behavior of FFA in analog networks with its Hebbian adaptation in spiking neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate that both versions of FFA produce similar accuracy and latent distributions. The findings herein reported provide empirical evidence linking biological learning rules with currently used training algorithms, thus paving the way towards extrapolating the positive outcomes from FFA to Hebbian learning rules. Simultaneously, our results imply that analog networks trained under FFA could be directly applied to neuromorphic computing, leading to reduced energy usage and increased computational speed.</description>

      <title>A Dual-Channel Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm Based on Adaptive Balance Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The balance between exploration (Er) and exploitation (Ei) determines the generalization performance of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm on different problems. Although the insufficient balance caused by global best being located near a local minimum has been widely researched, few scholars have systematically paid attention to two behaviors about personal best position (P) and global best position (G) existing in PSO. 1) P's uncontrollable-exploitation and involuntary-exploration guidance behavior. 2) G's full-time and global guidance behavior, each of which negatively affects the balance of Er and Ei. With regards to this, we firstly discuss the two behaviors, unveiling the mechanisms by which they affect the balance, and further pinpoint three key points for better balancing Er and Ei: eliminating the coupling between P and G, empowering P with controllable-exploitation and voluntary-exploration guidance behavior, controlling G's full-time and global guidance behavior. Then, we present a dual-channel PSO algorithm based on adaptive balance search (DCPSO-ABS). This algorithm entails a dual-channel framework to mitigate the interaction of P and G, aiding in regulating the behaviors of P and G, and meanwhile an adaptive balance search strategy for empowering P with voluntary-exploration and controllable-exploitation guidance behavior as well as adaptively controlling G's full-time and global guidance behavior. Finally, three kinds of experiments on 57 benchmark functions are designed to demonstrate that our proposed algorithm has stronger generalization performance than selected state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Natural Gradient Interpretation of Rank-One Update in CMA-ES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) is a stochastic search algorithm using a multivariate normal distribution for continuous black-box optimization. In addition to strong empirical results, part of the CMA-ES can be described by a stochastic natural gradient method and can be derived from information geometric optimization (IGO) framework. However, there are some components of the CMA-ES, such as the rank-one update, for which the theoretical understanding is limited. While the rank-one update makes the covariance matrix to increase the likelihood of generating a solution in the direction of the evolution path, this idea has been difficult to formulate and interpret as a natural gradient method unlike the rank-$\mu$ update. In this work, we provide a new interpretation of the rank-one update in the CMA-ES from the perspective of the natural gradient with prior distribution. First, we propose maximum a posteriori IGO (MAP-IGO), which is the IGO framework extended to incorporate a prior distribution. Then, we derive the rank-one update from the MAP-IGO by setting the prior distribution based on the idea that the promising mean vector should exist in the direction of the evolution path. Moreover, the newly derived rank-one update is extensible, where an additional term appears in the update for the mean vector. We empirically investigate the properties of the additional term using various benchmark functions.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Robustness of Deep-Learning Algorithm-Selection Models by Evolving Adversarial Instances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNN) are increasingly being used to perform algorithm-selection in combinatorial optimisation domains, particularly as they accommodate input representations which avoid designing and calculating features. Mounting evidence from domains that use images as input shows that deep convolutional networks are vulnerable to adversarial samples, in which a small perturbation of an instance can cause the DNN to misclassify. However, it remains unknown as to whether deep recurrent networks (DRN) which have recently been shown promise as algorithm-selectors in the bin-packing domain are equally vulnerable. We use an evolutionary algorithm (EA) to find perturbations of instances from two existing benchmarks for online bin packing that cause trained DRNs to misclassify: adversarial samples are successfully generated from up to 56% of the original instances depending on the dataset. Analysis of the new misclassified instances sheds light on the `fragility' of some training instances, i.e. instances where it is trivial to find a small perturbation that results in a misclassification and the factors that influence this. Finally, the method generates a large number of new instances misclassified with a wide variation in confidence, providing a rich new source of training data to create more robust models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel software abstraction termed "model caller," acting as an intermediary for AI and ML model calling, advocating its transformative utility beyond existing model-serving frameworks. This abstraction offers multiple advantages: enhanced accuracy and reduced latency in model predictions, superior monitoring and observability of models, more streamlined AI system architectures, simplified AI development and management processes, and improved collaboration and accountability across AI/ML/Data Science, software, data, and operations teams. Model callers are valuable for both creators and users of models within both predictive and generative AI applications. Additionally, we have developed and released a prototype Python library for model callers, accessible for installation via pip or for download from GitHub.</description>

      <title>Learning in Wilson-Cowan model for metapopulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wilson-Cowan model for metapopulation, a Neural Mass Network Model, treats different subcortical regions of the brain as connected nodes, with connections representing various types of structural, functional, or effective neuronal connectivity between these regions. Each region comprises interacting populations of excitatory and inhibitory cells, consistent with the standard Wilson-Cowan model. By incorporating stable attractors into such a metapopulation model's dynamics, we transform it into a learning algorithm capable of achieving high image and text classification accuracy. We test it on MNIST and Fashion MNIST, in combination with convolutional neural networks, on CIFAR-10 and TF-FLOWERS, and, in combination with a transformer architecture (BERT), on IMDB, always showing high classification accuracy. These numerical evaluations illustrate that minimal modifications to the Wilson-Cowan model for metapopulation can reveal unique and previously unobserved dynamics.</description>

      <title>Improving Quaternion Neural Networks with Quaternionic Activation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose novel quaternion activation functions where we modify either the quaternion magnitude or the phase, as an alternative to the commonly used split activation functions. We define criteria that are relevant for quaternion activation functions, and subsequently we propose our novel activation functions based on this analysis. Instead of applying a known activation function like the ReLU or Tanh on the quaternion elements separately, these activation functions consider the quaternion properties and respect the quaternion space $\mathbb{H}$. In particular, all quaternion components are utilized to calculate all output components, carrying out the benefit of the Hamilton product in e.g. the quaternion convolution to the activation functions. The proposed activation functions can be incorporated in arbitrary quaternion valued neural networks trained with gradient descent techniques. We further discuss the derivatives of the proposed activation functions where we observe beneficial properties for the activation functions affecting the phase. Specifically, they prove to be sensitive on basically the whole input range, thus improved gradient flow can be expected. We provide an elaborate experimental evaluation of our proposed quaternion activation functions including comparison with the split ReLU and split Tanh on two image classification tasks using the CIFAR-10 and SVHN dataset. There, especially the quaternion activation functions affecting the phase consistently prove to provide better performance.</description>

      <title>No More Sliding-Windows: Dynamic Functional Connectivity Based On Random Convolutions Without Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of dynamic functional connectivity, the sliding-window method is widely used and its stability is generally recognized. However, the sliding-window method's data processing within the window is overly simplistic, which to some extent limits its effectiveness. This study proposes a feature expansion method based on random convolution, which achieves better and more noise-resistant results than the sliding-window method without requiring training. Experiments on simulated data show that the dynamic functional connectivity matrix and time series obtained using the random convolution method have a higher degree of fit (95.59\%) with the standard answers within shorter time windows, compared to the sliding-window method (45.99\%). Gender difference studies on real data also reveal that the random convolution method uncovers more gender differences than the sliding-window method. Through theoretical analysis, we propose a more comprehensive convolutional functional connectivity computation model, with the sliding-window method being a special case of this model, thereby opening up vast potential for research methods in dynamic functional connectivity.</description>

Abstract: Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (ERL), which integrates Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for optimization, has demonstrated remarkable performance advancements. By fusing both approaches, ERL has emerged as a promising research direction. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of the diverse research branches in ERL. Specifically, we systematically summarize recent advancements in related algorithms and identify three primary research directions: EA-assisted Optimization of RL, RL-assisted Optimization of EA, and synergistic optimization of EA and RL. Following that, we conduct an in-depth analysis of each research direction, organizing multiple research branches. We elucidate the problems that each branch aims to tackle and how the integration of EAs and RL addresses these challenges. In conclusion, we discuss potential challenges and prospective future research directions across various research directions. To facilitate researchers in delving into ERL, we organize the algorithms and codes involved on https://github.com/yeshenpy/Awesome-Evolutionary-Reinforcement-Learning.</description>

      <title>Learning to Transfer for Evolutionary Multitasking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary multitasking (EMT) is an emerging approach for solving multitask optimization problems (MTOPs) and has garnered considerable research interest. The implicit EMT is a significant research branch that utilizes evolution operators to enable knowledge transfer (KT) between tasks. However, current approaches in implicit EMT face challenges in adaptability, due to the use of a limited number of evolution operators and insufficient utilization of evolutionary states for performing KT. This results in suboptimal exploitation of implicit KT's potential to tackle a variety of MTOPs. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Learning to Transfer (L2T) framework to automatically discover efficient KT policies for the MTOPs at hand. Our framework conceptualizes the KT process as a learning agent's sequence of strategic decisions within the EMT process. We propose an action formulation for deciding when and how to transfer, a state representation with informative features of evolution states, a reward formulation concerning convergence and transfer efficiency gain, and the environment for the agent to interact with MTOPs. We employ an actor-critic network structure for the agent and learn it via proximal policy optimization. This learned agent can be integrated with various evolutionary algorithms, enhancing their ability to address a range of new MTOPs. Comprehensive empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world MTOPs, encompassing diverse inter-task relationships, function classes, and task distributions are conducted to validate the proposed L2T framework. The results show a marked improvement in the adaptability and performance of implicit EMT when solving a wide spectrum of unseen MTOPs.</description>

      <title>Two Tales of Single-Phase Contrastive Hebbian Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for ``biologically plausible'' learning algorithms has converged on the idea of representing gradients as activity differences. However, most approaches require a high degree of synchronization (distinct phases during learning) and introduce substantial computational overhead, which raises doubts regarding their biological plausibility as well as their potential utility for neuromorphic computing. Furthermore, they commonly rely on applying infinitesimal perturbations (nudges) to output units, which is impractical in noisy environments. Recently it has been shown that by modelling artificial neurons as dyads with two oppositely nudged compartments, it is possible for a fully local learning algorithm named ``dual propagation'' to bridge the performance gap to backpropagation, without requiring separate learning phases or infinitesimal nudging. However, the algorithm has the drawback that its numerical stability relies on symmetric nudging, which may be restrictive in biological and analog implementations. In this work we first provide a solid foundation for the objective underlying the dual propagation method, which also reveals a surprising connection with adversarial robustness. Second, we demonstrate how dual propagation is related to a particular adjoint state method, which is stable regardless of asymmetric nudging.</description>

      <title>SWAP-NAS: Sample-Wise Activation Patterns for Ultra-fast NAS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04161v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training-free metrics (a.k.a. zero-cost proxies) are widely used to avoid resource-intensive neural network training, especially in Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Recent studies show that existing training-free metrics have several limitations, such as limited correlation and poor generalisation across different search spaces and tasks. Hence, we propose Sample-Wise Activation Patterns and its derivative, SWAP-Score, a novel high-performance training-free metric. It measures the expressivity of networks over a batch of input samples. The SWAP-Score is strongly correlated with ground-truth performance across various search spaces and tasks, outperforming 15 existing training-free metrics on NAS-Bench-101/201/301 and TransNAS-Bench-101. The SWAP-Score can be further enhanced by regularisation, which leads to even higher correlations in cell-based search space and enables model size control during the search. For example, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between regularised SWAP-Score and CIFAR-100 validation accuracies on NAS-Bench-201 networks is 0.90, significantly higher than 0.80 from the second-best metric, NWOT. When integrated with an evolutionary algorithm for NAS, our SWAP-NAS achieves competitive performance on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet in approximately 6 minutes and 9 minutes of GPU time respectively.</description>
