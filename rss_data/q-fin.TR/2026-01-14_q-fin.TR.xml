      <title>Utility-Weighted Forecasting and Calibration for Risk-Adjusted Decisions under Trading Frictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting accuracy is routinely optimised in financial prediction tasks even though investment and risk-management decisions are executed under transaction costs, market impact, capacity limits, and binding risk constraints. This paper treats forecasting as an econometric input to a constrained decision problem. A predictive distribution induces a decision rule through a utility objective combined with an explicit friction operator consisting of both a cost functional and a feasible-set constraint system. The econometric target becomes minimisation of expected decision loss net of costs rather than minimisation of prediction error. The paper develops a utility-weighted calibration criterion aligned to the decision loss and establishes sufficient conditions under which calibrated predictive distributions weakly dominate uncalibrated alternatives. An empirical study using a pre-committed nested walk-forward protocol on liquid equity index futures confirms the theory: the proposed utility-weighted calibration reduces realised decision loss by over 30\% relative to an uncalibrated baseline ($t$-stat -30.31) for loss differential and improves the Sharpe ratio from -3.62 to -2.29 during a drawdown regime. The mechanism is identified as a structural reduction in the frequency of binding constraints (from 16.0\% to 5.1\%), preventing the "corner solution" failures that characterize overconfident forecasts in high-friction environments.</description>

      <title>Resisting Manipulative Bots in Memecoin Copy Trading: A Multi-Agent Approach with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The launch of \$Trump coin ignited a wave in meme coin investment. Copy trading, as a strategy-agnostic approach that eliminates the need for deep trading knowledge, quickly gains widespread popularity in the meme coin market. However, copy trading is not a guarantee of profitability due to the prevalence of manipulative bots, the uncertainty of the followed wallets' future performance, and the lag in trade execution. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in financial applications by effectively understanding multi-modal data and producing explainable decisions. However, a single LLM struggles with complex, multi-faceted tasks such as asset allocation. These challenges are even more pronounced in cryptocurrency markets, where LLMs often lack sufficient domain-specific knowledge in their training data.
  To address these challenges, we propose an explainable multi-agent system for meme coin copy trading. Inspired by the structure of an asset management team, our system decomposes the complex task into subtasks and coordinates specialized agents to solve them collaboratively. Employing few-shot chain-of-though (CoT) prompting, each agent acquires professional meme coin trading knowledge, interprets multi-modal data, and generates explainable decisions. Using a dataset of 1,000 meme coin projects' transaction data, our empirical evaluation shows that the proposed multi-agent system outperforms both traditional machine learning models and single LLMs, achieving 73% and 70% precision in identifying high-quality meme coin projects and key opinion leader (KOL) wallets, respectively. The selected KOLs collectively generated a total profit of \$500,000 across these projects.</description>
