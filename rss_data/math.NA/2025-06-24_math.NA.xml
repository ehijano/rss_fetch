      <title>Fast solvers for the high-order FEM simplicial de Rham complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new finite elements for solving the Riesz maps of the de Rham complex on triangular and tetrahedral meshes at high order. The finite elements discretize the same spaces as usual, but with different basis functions, so that the resulting matrices have desirable properties. These properties mean that we can solve the Riesz maps to a given accuracy in a $p$-robust number of iterations with $\mathcal{O}(p^6)$ flops in three dimensions, rather than the na\"ive $\mathcal{O}(p^9)$ flops.
  The degrees of freedom build upon an idea of Demkowicz et al., and consist of integral moments on an equilateral reference simplex with respect to a numerically computed polynomial basis that is orthogonal in two different inner products. As a result, the interior-interface and interior-interior couplings are provably weak, and we devise a preconditioning strategy by neglecting them. The combination of this approach with a space decomposition method on vertex and edge star patches allows us to efficiently solve the canonical Riesz maps at high order. We apply this to solving the Hodge Laplacians of the de Rham complex with novel augmented Lagrangian preconditioners.</description>

      <title>Bounds-constrained finite element approximation of time-dependent partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite element methods provide accurate and efficient methods for the numerical solution of partial differential equations by means of restricting variational problems to finite-dimensional approximating spaces. However, they do not guarantee enforcement of bounds constraints inherent in the original problem. Previous work enforces these bounds constraints by replacing the variational equations with variational inequalities. We extend this approach to collocation-type Runge-Kutta methods for time-dependent problems, obtaining (formally) high order methods in both space and time. By using a novel reformulation of the collocation scheme, we can guarantee that the bounds constraints hold uniformly in time. Numerical examples for a model of phytoplankton growth, the heat equation, and the Cahn-Hilliard system are given.</description>

      <title>Operator Splitting Methods: Numerical Solutions of Ordinary Differential Equations via Separation of Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper applies the concept of linear semigroups induced by nonlinear flows, originally developed by Dorroh and Neuberger in the 1990s, to the approximation of uniquely solvable initial value problems for nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Building on a framework rooted in the earlier works of Lie, Kowalewski, and Groebner, we analyze nonlinear systems through the lens of the Koopman-Lie semigroup exp(tK), where K is the linear Lie generator associated with the flow induced by the nonlinear differential equation. A central feature of this approach is the decomposition K = K1 + ... + KN, which enables the use of operator splitting methods. We revisit the foundational first-order splitting scheme introduced by H. F. Trotter in 1959 and extend it to higher-order schemes with improved error bounds. These theoretical developments are supported by numerical examples that demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methods, which are based entirely on the classical separation of variables technique for solving ordinary differential equations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we are devoted to the reconstruction of an unknown initial value from the terminal data. The asymptotic and root-distribution properties of Mittag-Leffler functions are used to establish stability of the backward problem. Furthermore, we introduce a regularization method that effectively handles scattered point measurements contaminated with stochastic noise. Furthermore, we prove the stochastic convergence of our proposed regularization and provide an iterative algorithm to find the optimal regularization parameter. Finally, several numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>A priori error analysis of consistent PINNs for parabolic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new a priori analysis of a class of collocation methods for parabolic PDEs that rely only on pointwise data of force term, boundary data, and initial data. Under Besov regularity assumptions, we characterize the optimal recovery rate of the solution u based on sample complexity. We establish error bounds by constructing a new consistent loss function that effectively controls the approximation error. This loss incorporates contributions from the interior, boundary, and initial data in a discretized form and is designed to reflect the true PDE structure. Our theoretical results demonstrate that minimizing this loss function yields near optimal recovery under suitable conditions of regularity and sampling. Novel practical variants of the loss function are discussed, and numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness.</description>

      <title>A $C^0$ weak Galerkin method with preconditioning for constrained optimal control problems with general tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a $C^0$ weak Galerkin ($C^0$-WG) method combined with an additive Schwarz preconditioner for solving optimal control problems (OCPs) governed by partial differential equations with general tracking cost functionals and pointwise state constraints. These problems pose significant analytical and numerical challenges due to the presence of fourth-order variational inequalities and the reduced regularity of solutions. Our first contribution is the design of a $C^0$-WG method based on globally continuous quadratic Lagrange elements, enabling efficient elementwise stiffness matrix assembly and parameter-free implementation while maintaining accuracy, as supported by a rigorous error analysis. As a second contribution, we develop an additive Schwarz preconditioner tailored to the $C^0$-WG method to improve solver performance for the resulting ill-conditioned linear systems. Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method and preconditioner for both biharmonic and optimal control problems.</description>

      <title>Local feature filtering for scalable and well-conditioned Random Feature Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), with randomized neural networks showing remarkable potential. These networks, typically shallow, differ from conventional approaches by randomizing all parameters except those in the final layer. Notably, by integrating techniques inspired by domain decomposition, they achieve improved local accuracy and computational efficiency. Following \cite{chen:2022:BTM}, we refer to these approaches as \emph{random feature methods} (RFM). Despite their promise, RFMs lead to highly ill-conditioned least squares systems, posing a significant computational challenge. To address this, we introduce a novel approach based on different strategies of local filtering. This technique provides two key advantages: first, it enables the selective elimination of nonexpressive features, reducing system size and improving the condition number without sacrificing accuracy; second, it facilitates the construction of an efficient preconditioner for the global system. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that this strategy can rival or even outperform existing preconditioning techniques, both in terms of condition number and the efficiency of iterative solvers. These results underscore the potential of our method as a powerful enhancement to machine learning-based PDE solvers.</description>

      <title>Rank Inspired Neural Network for solving linear partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a rank inspired neural network (RINN) to tackle the initialization sensitivity issue of physics informed extreme learning machines (PIELM) when numerically solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Unlike PIELM which randomly initializes the parameters of its hidden layers, RINN incorporates a preconditioning stage. In this stage, covariance-driven regularization is employed to optimize the orthogonality of the basis functions generated by the last hidden layer. The key innovation lies in minimizing the off-diagonal elements of the covariance matrix derived from the hidden-layer output. By doing so, pairwise orthogonality constraints across collocation points are enforced which effectively enhances both the numerical stability and the approximation ability of the optimized function space.The RINN algorithm unfolds in two sequential stages. First, it conducts a non-linear optimization process to orthogonalize the basis functions. Subsequently, it solves the PDE constraints using linear least-squares method. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that RINN significantly reduces performance variability due to parameter initialization compared to PIELM. Incorporating an early stopping mechanism based on PDE loss further improves stability, ensuring consistently high accuracy across diverse initialization settings.</description>

      <title>A meshless generalized finite difference method for solving the Stokes-Darcy coupled problem in static and moving systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a meshless Generalized Finite Difference Method (GFDM) is proposed to deal with the Stokes-Darcy coupled problem with the Beavers-Joseph-Saffman (BJS) interface conditions. Some high order GFDMs are proposed to show the advantage of the high order GFDM for the Stokes-Darcy coupled problem, which is that the high order method has high order accuracy and the convergence order. Some Stokes-Darcy coupled problems with closed interfaces, which has more complex geometric shape, are given to show the advantage of the GFDM for the complex interface. The interface location has been changed to show the influence of the interface location for the Stokes-Darcy coupled problem. The BJS interface conditions has related to the partial derivatives of unknown variables and the GFDM has advantage in dealing with the interface conditions with the jump of derivatives. Four numerical examples have been provided to verify the existence of the good performance of the GFDM for the Stokes-Darcy coupled problems, including that the simplicity, accuracy, and stability in static and moving systems. Especially, the GFDM has the tolerance of the large jump. The Neaumann boundary condition is used in numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of transient heat conduction with moving heat source using Physics Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the physics informed neural networks (PINNs) is employed for the numerical simulation of heat transfer involving a moving source. To reduce the computational effort, a new training method is proposed that uses a continuous time-stepping through transfer learning. Within this, the time interval is divided into smaller intervals and a single network is initialized. On this single network each time interval is trained with the initial condition for (n+1)th as the solution obtained at nth time increment. Thus, this framework enables the computation of large temporal intervals without increasing the complexity of the network itself. The proposed framework is used to estimate the temperature distribution in a homogeneous medium with a moving heat source. The results from the proposed framework is compared with traditional finite element method and a good agreement is seen.</description>

      <title>Robust PDE discovery under sparse and highly noisy conditions via attention neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of partial differential equations (PDEs) from experimental data holds great promise for uncovering predictive models of complex physical systems. In this study, we introduce an efficient automatic model discovery framework, ANN-PYSR, which integrates attention neural networks with the state-of-the-art PySR symbolic regression library. Our approach successfully identifies the governing PDE in six benchmark examples. Compared to the DLGA framework, numerical experiments demonstrate ANN-PYSR can extract the underlying dynamic model more efficiently and robustly from sparse, highly noisy data (noise level up to 200%, 5000 sampling points). It indicates an extensive variety of practical applications of ANN-PYSR, particularly in conditions with sparse sensor networks and high noise levels, where traditional methods frequently fail.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous recovery of a corroded boundary and admittance using the Kohn-Vogelius method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17938v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of identifying an unknown portion $\Gamma$ of the boundary of a $d$-dimensional ($d \in \{1, 2\}$) domain $\Omega$ and its associated Robin admittance coefficient, using two sets of boundary Cauchy data $(f, g)$--representing boundary temperature and heat flux--measured on the accessible portion $\Sigma$ of the boundary. Identifiability results \cite{Bacchelli2009,PaganiPierotti2009} indicate that a single measurement on $\Sigma$ is insufficient to uniquely determine both $\Gamma$ and $\alpha$, but two independent inputs yielding distinct solutions ensure the uniqueness of the pair $\Gamma$ and $\alpha$. In this paper, we propose a cost function based on the energy-gap of two auxiliary problems. We derive the variational derivatives of this objective functional with respect to both the Robin boundary $\Gamma$ and the admittance coefficient $\alpha$. These derivatives are utilized to develop a nonlinear gradient-based iterative scheme for the simultaneous numerical reconstruction of $\Gamma$ and $\alpha$. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the a posteriori error analysis of Stabilization-Free Virtual Element Methods for the 2D Poisson equation. The abscence of a stabilizing bilinear form in the scheme allows to prove the equivalence between a suitably defined error measure and standard residual error estimators, which is not obtained in general for stabilized virtual elements. Several numerical experiments are carried out, confirming the expected behaviour of the estimator in the presence of different mesh types, and robustness with respect to jumps of the diffusion term.</description>

      <title>Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin Methods for Thermo-Poroelastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a high-order hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) formulation for the fully dynamic, linear thermo-poroelasticity problem. The governing equations are formulated as a first-order hyperbolic system incorporating solid and fluid velocities, heat flux, effective stress, pore pressure, and temperature as state variables. We establish well-posedness of the continuous problem using semigroup theory and develop an energy-consistent HDG discretization. The method exploits computational advantages of HDG-including locality and static condensation-while maintaining energy conservation for the coupled system. We establish an $hp$-convergence analysis and support it with comprehensive numerical experiments, confirming the theoretical rates and showcasing the method's effectiveness for thermo-poroelastic wave propagation in heterogeneous media.</description>

      <title>Fast solution of a phase-field model of pitting corrosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excessive computational times represent a major challenge in the solution of corrosion models, limiting their practical applicability, e.g., as a support to predictive maintenance. In this paper, we propose an efficient strategy for solving a phase-field model for metal corrosion. Based on the Kronecker structure of the diffusion matrix in classical finite difference approximations on rectangular domains, time-stepping IMEX methods are efficiently solve in matrix form. However, when the domain is non-rectangular, the lack of the Kronecker structure prevents the direct use of this matrix-based approach. To address this issue, we reformulate the problem on an extended rectangular domain and introduce suitable iterative IMEX methods. The convergence of the iterations is analyzed, and numerical experiments show that the proposed approach achieves accuracy comparable to existing methods, while significantly reducing the computational time, to the point of allowing actual predictions on standard workstations.</description>

      <title>Mixed virtual element methods for a stress-velocity-rotation formulation in viscoelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a new mixed virtual element formulation for the numerical approximation of viscoelasticity equations with weakly imposed stress symmetry. The governing equations use the Zener model and are expressed in terms of the principal unknowns of additively decomposed stress into elastic and internal viscoelastic contributions, while the rotation tensor and velocity act as Lagrange multipliers. The time discretisation uses Crank--Nicolson's scheme. We demonstrate the unique solvability of both semi-discrete and fully-discrete problems by leveraging the properties of suitable local projectors. Moreover, we establish optimal a priori error estimates for all variables that appear in the mixed formulation. To validate our theoretical findings, we present several representative numerical examples that also highlight the features of the proposed formulation.</description>

      <title>AE-PINNs: Attention-enhanced physics-informed neural networks for solving elliptic interface problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the attention mechanism, we develop an attention-enhanced physics-informed neural networks (AE-PINNs) for solving elliptic interface equations. In AE-PINNs, we decompose the solution into two complementary components: a continuous component and a component with discontinuities across the interface. The continuous component is approximated by a fully connected neural network in the whole domain, while the discontinuous component is approximated by an interface-attention neural network in each subdomain separated by the interface. The interface-attention neural network adopts a network structure similar to the attention mechanism to focus on the interface, with its key extension is to introduce a neural network that transmits interface information. Some numerical experiments have confirmed the effectiveness of the AE-PINNs, demonstrating higher accuracy compared with PINNs, I-PINNs and M-PINNs.</description>

      <title>Accuracy and componentwise accuracy in multilinear PageRank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability with respect to perturbations and the accuracy of numerical algorithms for computing solutions to the multilinear PageRank problem $\mathbf{x} = (1-\alpha)\mathbf{v} + \alpha \mathcal{P} \mathbf{x}^2$. Our results reveal that the solution can be more stable with respect to perturbations and numerical errors with respect to the classical bounds for nonlinear systems of equations (based on the norm of the Jacobian). In detail, one can obtain bounds for the minimal solution which ignore the singularity of the problem for $\alpha=1/2$, and one can show that the limiting accuracy of the Newton method depends not on the norm of the Jacobian but on a quantity that can be much smaller thanks to the nonnegativity structure of the equation. For the minimal solution, we also suggest subtraction-free modifications to the existing algorithms to achieve componentwise stability.
  Some of the theoretical results we obtain are interesting even outside the scope of this problem: bounds for more general quadratic vector equations, and a partial inverse for M-matrices which remains bounded when the matrix to invert approaches singularity.</description>

      <title>A high-order, conservative and positivity-preserving intersection-based remapping method between meshes with isoparametric curvilinear cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel intersection-based remapping method for isoparametric curvilinear meshes within the indirect arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) framework, addressing the challenges of transferring physical quantities between high-order curved-edge meshes. Our method leverages the Weiler-Atherton clipping algorithm to compute intersections between curved-edge quadrangles, enabling robust handling of arbitrary order isoparametric curves. By integrating multi-resolution weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) reconstruction, we achieve high-order accuracy while suppressing numerical oscillations near discontinuities. A positivity-preserving limiter is further applied to ensure physical quantities such as density remain non-negative without compromising conservation or accuracy. Notably, the computational cost of handling higher-order curved meshes, such as cubic or even higher-degree parametric curves, does not significantly increase compared to secondorder curved meshes. This ensures that our method remains efficient and scalable, making it applicable to arbitrary high-order isoparametric curvilinear cells without compromising performance. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves highorder accuracy, strict conservation (with errors approaching machine precision), essential non-oscillation and positivity-preserving.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the use of flexible GMRES as an outer wrapper for sketched GMRES. Building on a new bound for the residual of FGMRES in terms of the residual of the preconditioner, we derive a practical randomized solver that requires very little parameter tuning, while still being efficient and robust in the sense of generating non-increasing residual norms.</description>

      <title>A Complete-Electrode-Model-Based Forward Approach for Transcranial Temporal Interference Stimulation with Linearization: Numerical Simulation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background and Objective: Transcranial temporal interference stimulation (tTIS) is a promising non-invasive brain stimulation technique in which interference between electrical current fields extends the possibilities of electrical brain stimulation. The objective of this study is to develop an efficient mathematical tTIS forward modelling scheme that allows for realistic and adaptable simulation and can be updated accurately when the stimulation frequency is modified in one or more electrodes. Such a model is vital, for example, in optimization processes that seek the best possible stimulation currents to exhibit or inhibit a given brain region. This study aims to establish and evaluate the complete electrode model (CEM), i.e., a set of boundary conditions incorporating electrode impedance and contact patch, as a forward finite-element-method-based simulation technique for tTIS and investigate linearized CEM as a surrogate.
  Results: The CEM-based forward simulation successfully reproduced the volumetric stimulating fields induced by tTIS. Sensitivity analysis showed that variations in electrode impedance substantially affect the field distribution, especially in regions where the interfering currents have nearly equal amplitudes. The linearized CEM model closely matched the full nonlinear model within a predefined peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) threshold for relative error. Both models exhibited the highest sensitivity near the focal region.</description>

      <title>Semi-discrete heat equations with variable coefficients and the parametrix method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a parametrix approach for constructing solutions and establishing grid-size independent estimates for semi-discrete heat equations with variable coefficients. While the classical continuous setting benefits from Gaussian estimates of the constant coefficient heat kernel, such estimates are not available in the semi-discrete context. To address this complication, we derive estimates involving products of heavy-tailed Lorentz (also known as Cauchy) probability densities. These Lorentzian estimates provide a sufficient handle on certain iterated convolutions involving Bessel functions, enabling us to achieve convergence of the parametrix approach.</description>

      <title>Shifted HSS preconditioners for the indefinite Helmholtz equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a preconditioning approach for the indefinite Helmholtz equation discretised using finite elements, based upon a Hermitian Skew-Hermitian Splitting (HSS) iteration applied to the shifted operator, and prove that the preconditioner is k- and mesh-robust when O(k) HSS iterations are performed. The HSS iterations involve solving a shifted operator that is suitable for approximation by multigrid using standard smoothers and transfer operators, leading to a fully scalable algorithm. We argue that the algorithm converges in O(k) wallclock time when within the range of scalability of the multigrid. We provide numerical results verifying our proofs and demonstrating this claim. This establishes a scalable O(k) method using multigrid with entirely standard components.</description>

      <title>On the computation of tensor functions under tensor-tensor multiplications with linear maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the computation of both algebraic and non-algebraic tensor functions under the tensor-tensor multiplication with linear maps. In the case of algebraic tensor functions, we prove that the asymptotic exponent of both the tensor-tensor multiplication and the tensor polynomial evaluation problem under this multiplication is the same as that of the matrix multiplication, unless the linear map is injective. As for non-algebraic functions, we define the tensor geometric mean and the tensor Wasserstein mean for pseudo-positive-definite tensors under the tensor-tensor multiplication with invertible linear maps, and we show that the tensor geometric mean can be calculated by solving a specific Riccati tensor equation. Furthermore, we show that the tensor geometric mean does not satisfy the resultantal (determinantal) identity in general, which the matrix geometric mean always satisfies. Then we define a pseudo-SVD for the injective linear map case and we apply it on image data compression.</description>

      <title>DPG loss functions for learning parameter-to-solution maps by neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop, analyze, and experimentally explore residual-based loss functions for machine learning of parameter-to-solution maps in the context of parameter-dependent families of partial differential equations (PDEs). Our primary concern is on rigorous accuracy certification to enhance prediction capability of resulting deep neural network reduced models. This is achieved by the use of variationally correct loss functions. Through one specific example of an elliptic PDE, details for establishing the variational correctness of a loss function from an ultraweak Discontinuous Petrov Galerkin (DPG) discretization are worked out. Despite the focus on the example, the proposed concepts apply to a much wider scope of problems, namely problems for which stable DPG formulations are available. The issue of {high-contrast} diffusion fields and ensuing difficulties with degrading ellipticity are discussed. Both numerical results and theoretical arguments illustrate that for high-contrast diffusion parameters the proposed DPG loss functions deliver much more robust performance than simpler least-squares losses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit adaptive time stepping, one of the classical topics of numerical analysis and computational engineering. While widely used in application and subject of many theoretical works, a complete understanding is still missing. Apart from special cases, there does not exist a complete theory that shows how to choose the time steps such that convergence towards the exact solution is guaranteed with the optimal convergence rate. In this work, we use recent advances in adaptive mesh refinement to propose an adaptive time stepping algorithm that is mathematically guaranteed to be optimal in the sense that it achieves the best possible convergence of the error with respect to the number of time steps, and it can be implemented using a time stepping scheme as a black box.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a space-time isogeometric finite element method based on splines with maximal regularity in time for the linear time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation with a spatially varying potential. We investigate the stability and conservation properties of the method, demonstrating that it preserves both mass and energy at the final time, and it is unconditionally stable. Numerical experiments confirm our theoretical findings and illustrate the convergence behavior of the scheme. Incidentally, our analysis also provides an alternative proof of unconditional stability of the first-order-in-time isogeometric method for the wave equation proposed in (M. Ferrari, S. Fraschini, G. Loli and I. Perugia (2025)), eliminating the need for the numerical verifications required in the previous analysis.</description>

      <title>Convex-concave splitting for the Allen-Cahn equation leads to $\varepsilon^2$-slow movement of interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convex-concave splitting discretization of the Allen-Cahn is easy to implement and guaranteed to be energy decreasing even for large time-steps. We analyze the time-stepping scheme for a large class of potentials which includes the standard potential as well as two extreme settings: Potentials with quadratic convex part (uniform positive curvature), and potentials which are concave between the potential wells and either linear or infinite outside (highly concentrated curvature). In all three scenarios, the 'effective time step size' of the scheme scales with the square of the small parameter $\varepsilon$ governing the width of transition layers. A weaker 'slow motion' result is proved under much more general assumptions. Thus, stability is achieved by effectively 'freezing' the interfaces in place. The time step limitation is not geometric in origin, but depends on the phase-field parameter $\varepsilon$. Along the way, we establish a new link between an Allen-Cahn type equation and a thresholding approximation of mean curvature flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This monograph studies the relations between two approaches using positive definite kernels: probabilistic methods using Gaussian processes, and non-probabilistic methods using reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). They are widely studied and used in machine learning, statistics, and numerical analysis. Connections and equivalences between them are reviewed for fundamental topics such as regression, interpolation, numerical integration, distributional discrepancies, and statistical dependence, as well as for sample path properties of Gaussian processes. A unifying perspective for these equivalences is established, based on the equivalence between the Gaussian Hilbert space and the RKHS. The monograph serves as a basis to bridge many other methods based on Gaussian processes and reproducing kernels, which are developed in parallel by the two research communities.</description>

      <title>Convergent Proximal Multiblock ADMM for Nonconvex Dynamics-Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a provably convergent multiblock ADMM for nonconvex optimization with nonlinear dynamics constraints, overcoming the divergence issue in classical extensions. We consider a class of optimization problems that arise from discretization of dynamics-constrained variational problems that are optimization problems for a functional constrained by time-dependent ODEs or PDEs. This is a family of $n$-sum nonconvex optimization problems with nonlinear constraints. We study the convergence properties of the proximal alternating direction method of multipliers (proximal ADMM) applied to those problems. Taking the advantage of the special problem structure, we show that under local Lipschitz and local $L$-smooth conditions, the sequence generated by the proximal ADMM is bounded and all accumulation points are KKT points. Based on our analysis, we also design a procedure to determine the penalty parameters $\rho_i$ and the proximal parameters $\eta_i$. We further prove that among all the subsequences that converge, the fast one converges at the rate of $o(1/k)$. The numerical experiments are performed on 4D variational data assimilation problems and as the solver of implicit schemes for stiff problems. The proposed proximal ADMM has more stable performance than gradient-based methods. We discuss the implementation to solve the subproblems, a new way to solve the implicit schemes, and the advantages of the proposed algorithm.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel parallelization strategy for evaluating Finite Element Method (FEM) variational forms on GPUs, focusing on those that are expressible through the Unified Form Language (UFL) on simplex meshes. We base our approach on code transformations, wherein we construct a space of scheduling candidates and rank them via a heuristic cost model to effectively handle the large diversity of computational workloads that can be expressed in this way. We present a design of a search space to which the cost model is applied, along with an associated pruning strategy to limit the number of configurations that need to be empirically evaluated. The goal of our design is to strike a balance between the device's latency-hiding capabilities and the amount of state space, a key factor in attaining near-roofline performance.
  To make our work widely available, we have prototyped our parallelization strategy within the \textsc{Firedrake} framework, a UFL-based FEM solver. We evaluate the performance of our parallelization scheme on two generations of Nvidia GPUs, specifically the Titan V (Volta architecture) and Tesla K40c (Kepler architecture), across a range of operators commonly used in applications, including fluid dynamics, wave propagation, and structural mechanics, in 2D and 3D geometries. Our results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves more than $50\%$ roofline performance in $65\%$ of the test cases on both devices.</description>

      <title>Structural Optimal Jacobian Accumulation and Minimum Edge Count are NP-Complete Under Vertex Elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study graph-theoretic formulations of two fundamental problems in algorithmic differentiation. The first (Structural Optimal Jacobian Accumulation) is that of computing a Jacobian while minimizing multiplications. The second (Minimum Edge Count) is to find a minimum-size computational graph. For both problems, we consider the vertex elimination operation. Our main contribution is to show that both problems are NP-complete, thus resolving longstanding open questions. In contrast to prior work, our reduction for Structural Optimal Jacobian Accumulation does not rely on any assumptions about the algebraic relationships between local partial derivatives; we allow these values to be mutually independent. We also provide $O^*(2^n)$-time exact algorithms for both problems, and show that under the exponential time hypothesis these running times are essentially tight. Finally, we provide a data reduction rule for Structural Optimal Jacobian Accumulation by showing that false twins may always be eliminated consecutively.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Identification of Coefficients and Source in a Subdiffusion Equation from One Passive Measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is devoted to the detection of parameters in anomalous diffusion from a single passive measurement. More precisely, we consider the simultaneous identification of coefficients as well as a time-dependent source term appearing in a time-fractional diffusion equation from a single boundary or internal passive measurement. We obtain several uniqueness results in dimension one as well as a multidimensional extension under some symmetry assumptions. Our analysis relies on spectral representation of solutions, complex and harmonic analysis combined with some known inverse spectral results for Sturm-Liouville operators. The theoretical results are complemented by a corresponding reconstruction algorithm and numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Regular Tree Search for Simulation Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tackling simulation optimization problems with non-convex objective functions remains a fundamental challenge in operations research. In this paper, we propose a class of random search algorithms, called Regular Tree Search, which integrates adaptive sampling with recursive partitioning of the search space. The algorithm concentrates simulations on increasingly promising regions by iteratively refining a tree structure. A tree search strategy guides sampling decisions, while partitioning is triggered when the number of samples in a leaf node exceeds a threshold that depends on its depth. Furthermore, a specific tree search strategy, Upper Confidence Bounds applied to Trees (UCT), is employed in the Regular Tree Search. We prove global convergence under sub-Gaussian noise, based on assumptions involving the optimality gap, without requiring continuity of the objective function. Numerical experiments confirm that the algorithm reliably identifies the global optimum and provides accurate estimates of its objective value.</description>

      <title>Classical optimization algorithms for diagonalizing quantum Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diagonalizing a Hamiltonian, which is essential for simulating its long-time dynamics, is a key primitive in quantum computing and has been proven to yield a quantum advantage for several specific families of Hamiltonians. Yet, despite its importance, only a handful of diagonalization algorithms exist, and correspondingly few families of fast-forwardable Hamiltonians have been identified. This paper introduces classical optimization algorithms for Hamiltonian diagonalization by formulating a cost function that penalizes off-diagonal terms and enforces unitarity via an orthogonality constraint, both expressed in the Pauli operator basis. We pinpoint a class of Hamiltonians that highlights severe drawbacks of existing methods, including exponential per-iteration cost, exponential circuit depth, or convergence to spurious optima. Our approach overcomes these shortcomings, achieving polynomial-time efficiency while provably avoiding suboptimal points. As a result, we broaden the known realm of fast-forwardable systems, showing that quantum-diagonalizable Hamiltonians extend to cases generated by exponentially large Lie algebras. On the practical side, we also present a randomized-coordinate variant that achieves a more efficient per-iteration cost than the deterministic counterpart. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms through explicit examples and numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Conservative data-driven finite element formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new data-driven finite element framework derived with mixed finite element formulation. The standard approach to diffusion problems requires the solution of the mathematical equations that describe both the conservation law and the constitutive relations, where the latter is traditionally obtained after fitting experimental data to simplified material models. To exploit all available information and avoid bias in the material model, we follow a data-driven approach. While the conservation laws and boundary conditions are satisfied by means of the finite element method, the experimental data is used directly in the numerical simulations, avoiding the need of fitting material model parameters. In order to satisfy the conservation law a priori in the strong sense, we introduce a mixed finite element formulation. This relaxes the regularity requirements on approximation spaces while enforcing continuity of the normal flux component across all of the inner boundaries. This weaker mixed formulation provides a posteriori error indicators tailored for this data-driven approach, enabling adaptive hp-refinement. The relaxed regularity of the approximation spaces makes it easier to observe how the variation in the datasets results in the non-uniqueness of the solution, which can be quantified to predict the uncertainty of the results. The capabilities of the formulation are demonstrated in an example of the nonlinear heat transfer in nuclear graphite using synthetically generated material datasets.</description>

      <title>The Exponential of Skew-Symmetric Matrices: A Nearby Inverse and Efficient Computation of Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The matrix exponential restricted to skew-symmetric matrices has numerous applications, notably in view of its interpretation as the Lie group exponential and Riemannian exponential for the special orthogonal group. We characterize the invertibility of the derivative of the skew-restricted exponential, thereby providing a simple expression of the tangent conjugate locus of the orthogonal group. In view of the skew restriction, this characterization differs from the classic result on the invertibility of the derivative of the exponential of real matrices. Based on this characterization, for every skew-symmetric matrix $A$ outside the (zero-measure) tangent conjugate locus, we explicitly construct the domain and image of a smooth inverse -- which we term \emph{nearby logarithm} -- of the skew-restricted exponential around $A$. This nearby logarithm reduces to the classic principal logarithm of special orthogonal matrices when $A=\mathbf{0}$. The symbolic formulae for the differentiation and its inverse are derived and implemented efficiently. The extensive numerical experiments show that the proposed formulae are up to $3.9$-times and $3.6$-times faster than the current state-of-the-art robust formulae for the differentiation and its inversion, respectively.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic approximation of fully nonlinear second-order PIDEs with convergence rates for the universal robust limit theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a probabilistic approximation scheme for a class of nonstandard, fully nonlinear second-order partial integro-differential equations (PIDEs) arising from nonlinear L\'evy processes under Peng's G-expectation framework. The PIDE involves a supremum over a set of \(\alpha\)-stable L\'evy measures, potentially with degenerate diffusion and a non-separable uncertainty set, which renders existing numerical results inapplicable. We construct a recursive, piecewise-constant approximation to the viscosity solution and derive explicit error bounds. A key application of our analysis is the quantification of convergence rates for the universal robust limit theorem under sublinear expectations, unifying Peng's robust central limit theorem, laws of large numbers, and the \(\alpha\)-stable limit theorem of Bayraktar and Munk, with explicit Berry--Esseen-type bounds.</description>

      <title>Bayesian decomposition using Besov priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many inverse problems, the unknown is composed of multiple components with different regularities, for example, in imaging problems, where the unknown can have both rough and smooth features. We investigate linear Bayesian inverse problems, where the unknown consists of two components: one smooth and one piecewise constant. We model the unknown as a sum of two components and assign individual priors on each component to impose the assumed behavior. We propose and compare two prior models: (i) a combination of a Haar wavelet-based Besov prior and a smoothing Besov prior, and (ii) a hierarchical Gaussian prior on the gradient coupled with a smoothing Besov prior. To achieve a balanced reconstruction, we place hyperpriors on the prior parameters and jointly infer both the components and the hyperparameters. We propose Gibbs sampling schemes for posterior inference in both prior models. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach on 1D and 2D deconvolution problems, where the unknown consists of smooth parts with jumps. The numerical results indicate that our methods improve the reconstruction quality compared to single-prior approaches and that the prior parameters can be successfully estimated to yield a balanced decomposition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07865v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Iterative refinement (IR) is a popular scheme for solving a linear system of equations based on gradually improving the accuracy of an initial approximation. Originally developed to improve upon the accuracy of Gaussian elimination, interest in IR has been revived because of its suitability for execution on fast low-precision hardware such as analog devices and graphics processing units. IR generally converges when the error associated with the solution method is small, but is known to diverge when this error is large. We propose and analyze a novel enhancement to the IR algorithm by adding a line search optimization step that guarantees the algorithm will not diverge. Numerical experiments verify our theoretical results and illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00672v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing block Kaczmarz methods face challenges in balancing computational efficiency and convergence for large sparse linear systems with scattered nonzero patterns, due to costly partitioning strategies and non-orthogonal projections. In this paper, we propose the orthogonal block Kaczmarz (OBK-RCM) algorithm with the Reverse Cuthill-McKee (RCM), which integrates the RCM reordering with a novel orthogonal block partitioning strategy. RCM transforms sparse matrices into banded structures to enhance inter-block orthogonality, while dynamic grouping of mutually orthogonal blocks based on angle cosine thresholds reduces iterative complexity. In addition, two extended versions (SOBK-RCM and UOBK-RCM) are proposed to deal with non-square systems by constructing extended matrices without sacrificing sparsity. This work offers a practical framework for efficient sparse linear algebra solvers. Experiments on 33 real-world and synthetic matrices show that OBK-RCM achieves 10-50 times faster CPU time (up to several hundred) and 50-90% fewer iterations than state-of-the-art methods (RBK,RBK(k),GREBK(k),aRBK), especially for scattered sparse structures in most cases. Theoretical analysis confirms linear convergence, driven by hyperplane orthogonality.</description>

      <title>Preconditioners based on Voronoi quantizers of random variable coefficients for stochastic elliptic partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07824v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A preconditioning strategy is proposed for the iterative solve of large numbers of linear systems with parameter-dependent matrix and right-hand side which arise during the computation of solution statistics of stochastic elliptic partial differential equations with random and spatially variable coefficients sampled by Monte Carlo. Building on the assumption that a truncated Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve expansion of a known transform of the random coefficient is available, we introduce a compact approximation of the random coefficient in the form of a Voronoi quantizer. The number of Voronoi cells, each of which is represented by a centroidal coefficient, is set to the prescribed number of preconditioners. Upon sampling the random coefficient, the linear system assembled with a given realization of the coefficient is solved using a Krylov subspace iterative solver with the preconditioner whose centroidal coefficient is the closest to the realization. We consider different ways to define and obtain the centroidal coefficients, and we investigate the properties of the induced preconditioning strategies in terms of average number of solver iterations for sequential simulations, and of load balancing for parallel simulations. Another approach, which is based on deterministic grids on the system of stochastic coordinates of the truncated representation of the random coefficient, is proposed with a stochastic dimension that increases with the number of preconditioners. This approach allows to bypass the need for preliminary computations in order to determine the optimal stochastic dimension of the truncated approximation of the random coefficient for a given number of preconditioners.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-frequency features are critical in multiscale phenomena such as turbulent flows and phase transitions, since they encode essential physical information. The recently proposed Wavelet Neural Operator (WNO) utilizes wavelets' time-frequency localization to capture spatial manifolds effectively. While its factorization strategy improves noise robustness, it suffers from high-frequency information loss caused by finite-scale wavelet decomposition. In this study, a new U-WNO network architecture is proposed. It incorporates the U-Net path and residual shortcut into the wavelet layer to enhance the extraction of high-frequency features and improve the learning of spatial manifolds. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive activation mechanism to mitigate spectral bias through trainable slope parameters. Extensive benchmarks across seven PDE families (Burgers, Darcy flow, Navier-Stokes, etc.) show that U-WNO achieves 45--83% error reduction compared to baseline WNO, with mean $L_2$ relative errors ranging from 0.043% to 1.56%. This architecture establishes a framework combining multiresolution analysis with deep feature learning, addressing the spectral-spatial tradeoff in operator learning. Code and data used are available on https://github.com/WeiminLei/U-WNO.git.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a class of tumor growth models governed by porous medium-type equations with uncertainties arisen from the growth function, initial condition, tumor support radius or other parameters in the model. We develop a stochastic asymptotic preservation (s-AP) scheme in the generalized polynomial chaos-stochastic Galerkin (gPC-SG) framework, which remains robust for all index parameters $m\geq 2$. The regularity of the solution to porous medium equations in the random space is studied, and we show the s-AP property, ensuring the convergence of SG system on the continuous level to that of Hele-Shaw dynamics as $m \to \infty$. Our numerical experiments, including capturing the behaviors such as finger-like projection, proliferating, quiescent and dead cell's evolution, validate the accuracy and efficiency of our designed scheme. The numerical results can describe the impact of stochastic parameters on tumor interface evolutions and pattern formations.</description>

Abstract: This work introduces and rigorously analyzes a novel operator-splitting finite element scheme for approximating viscosity solutions of a broad class of constrained second-order partial differential equations. By decoupling the primary PDE evolution from the enforcement of constraints, the proposed method combines a stabilized finite element method for spatial discretization with an efficient semi-implicit time-stepping strategy.
  The cornerstone of our analysis is a proof that the scheme satisfies a discrete comparison principle. We demonstrate that under a mild time-step restriction and with appropriate stabilization, the discrete operator yields an M-matrix, which is sufficient to guarantee the scheme's monotonicity and consequent $L^\infty$-stability. These properties -- consistency, stability, and monotonicity -- are shown to be sufficient to prove convergence of the numerical approximation to the unique viscosity solution within the celebrated Barles--Souganidis framework. For solutions with enhanced regularity, we further establish an optimal-order error estimate of $O(\Delta t + h^2)$.
  The rigorously established stability of the scheme provides a blueprint for a novel Physics-Constrained Neural Operator (PCNO) architecture. We prove that by emulating the scheme's structure, the PCNO can provably break the curse of dimensionality for the challenging class of domain-to-solution mapping problems with complex topological variations, a problem for which standard learning approaches often fail. Numerical experiments for both a Hamilton-Jacobi equation with state constraints and a controlled reaction-diffusion system are presented to validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the scheme's effectiveness.</description>

      <title>On the fast convergence of minibatch heavy ball momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.07553v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simple stochastic momentum methods are widely used in machine learning optimization, but their good practical performance is at odds with an absence of theoretical guarantees of acceleration in the literature. In this work, we aim to close the gap between theory and practice by showing that stochastic heavy ball momentum retains the fast linear rate of (deterministic) heavy ball momentum on quadratic optimization problems, at least when minibatching with a sufficiently large batch size. The algorithm we study can be interpreted as an accelerated randomized Kaczmarz algorithm with minibatching and heavy ball momentum. The analysis relies on carefully decomposing the momentum transition matrix, and using new spectral norm concentration bounds for products of independent random matrices. We provide numerical illustrations demonstrating that our bounds are reasonably sharp.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Analysis of Distributed Linear Solvers under Data Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10640v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of solving a large-scale system of linear equations in a distributed or federated manner by a taskmaster and a set of machines, each possessing a subset of the equations. We provide a comprehensive comparison of two well-known classes of algorithms used to solve this problem: projection-based methods and optimization-based methods. First, we introduce a novel geometric notion of data heterogeneity called angular heterogeneity and discuss its generality. Using this notion, we characterize the optimal convergence rates of the most prominent algorithms from each class, capturing the effects of the number of machines, the number of equations, and that of both cross-machine and local data heterogeneity on these rates. Our analysis establishes the superiority of Accelerated Projected Consensus in realistic scenarios with significant data heterogeneity and offers several insights into how angular heterogeneity affects the efficiency of the methods studied. Additionally, we develop distributed algorithms for the efficient computation of the proposed angular heterogeneity metrics. Our extensive numerical analyses validate and complement our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Quasioptimal alternating projections and their use in low-rank approximation of matrices and tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16097v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the convergence of specific inexact alternating projections for two non-convex sets in a Euclidean space. The $\sigma$-quasioptimal metric projection ($\sigma \geq 1$) of a point $x$ onto a set $A$ consists of points in $A$ the distance to which is at most $\sigma$ times larger than the minimal distance $\mathrm{dist}(x,A)$. We prove that quasioptimal alternating projections, when one or both projections are quasioptimal, converge locally and linearly for super-regular sets with transversal intersection. The theory is motivated by the successful application of alternating projections to low-rank matrix and tensor approximation. We focus on two problems -- nonnegative low-rank approximation and low-rank approximation in the maximum norm -- and develop fast alternating-projection algorithms for matrices and tensor trains based on cross approximation and acceleration techniques. The numerical experiments confirm that the proposed methods are efficient and suggest that they can be used to regularise various low-rank computational routines.</description>

      <title>LieDetect: Detection of representation orbits of compact Lie groups from point clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We suggest a new algorithm to estimate representations of compact Lie groups from finite samples of their orbits. Different from other reported techniques, our method allows the retrieval of the precise representation type as a direct sum of irreducible representations. Moreover, the knowledge of the representation type permits the reconstruction of its orbit, which is useful for identifying the Lie group that generates the action, from a finite list of candidates. Our algorithm is general for any compact Lie group, but only instantiations for SO(2), T^d, SU(2), and SO(3) are considered. Theoretical guarantees of robustness in terms of Hausdorff and Wasserstein distances are derived. Our tools are drawn from geometric measure theory, computational geometry, and optimization on matrix manifolds. The algorithm is tested for synthetic data up to dimension 32, as well as real-life applications in image analysis, harmonic analysis, density estimation, equivariant neural networks, chemical conformational spaces, and classical mechanics systems, achieving very accurate results.</description>

      <title>Pathwise convergence of the Euler scheme for rough and stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The convergence of the first order Euler scheme and an approximative variant thereof, along with convergence rates, are established for rough differential equations driven by c\`adl\`ag paths satisfying a suitable criterion, namely the so-called Property (RIE), along time discretizations with vanishing mesh size. This property is then verified for almost all sample paths of Brownian motion, It\^o processes, L\'evy processes and general c\`adl\`ag semimartingales, as well as the driving signals of both mixed and rough stochastic differential equations, relative to various time discretizations. Consequently, we obtain pathwise convergence in p-variation of the Euler--Maruyama scheme for stochastic differential equations driven by these processes.</description>

      <title>Energy-consistent integration of mechanical systems based on Livens principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02825v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we make use of Livens principle (sometimes also referred to as Hamilton-Pontryagin principle) in order to obtain a novel structure-preserving integrator for mechanical systems. In contrast to the canonical Hamiltonian equations of motion, the Euler-Lagrange equations pertaining to Livens principle circumvent the need to invert the mass matrix. This is an essential advantage with respect to singular mass matrices, which can yield severe difficulties for the modelling and simulation of multibody systems. Moreover, Livens principle unifies both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian viewpoints on mechanics. Additionally, the present framework avoids the need to set up the system's Hamiltonian. The novel scheme algorithmically conserves a general energy function and aims at the preservation of momentum maps corresponding to symmetries of the system. We present an extension to mechanical systems subject to holonomic constraints. The performance of the newly devised method is studied in representative examples.</description>

      <title>G-Adaptivity: optimised graph-based mesh relocation for finite element methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04516v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel, and effective, approach to achieve optimal mesh relocation in finite element methods (FEMs). The cost and accuracy of FEMs is critically dependent on the choice of mesh points. Mesh relocation (r-adaptivity) seeks to optimise the mesh geometry to obtain the best solution accuracy at given computational budget. Classical r-adaptivity relies on the solution of a separate nonlinear "meshing" PDE to determine mesh point locations. This incurs significant cost at remeshing, and relies on estimates that relate interpolation- and FEM-error. Recent machine learning approaches have focused on the construction of fast surrogates for such classical methods. Instead, our new approach trains a graph neural network (GNN) to determine mesh point locations by directly minimising the FE solution error from the PDE system Firedrake to achieve higher solution accuracy. Our GNN architecture closely aligns the mesh solution space to that of classical meshing methodologies, thus replacing classical estimates for optimality with a learnable strategy. This allows for rapid and robust training and results in an extremely efficient and effective GNN approach to online r-adaptivity. Our method outperforms both classical, and prior ML, approaches to r-adaptive meshing. In particular, it achieves lower FE solution error, whilst retaining the significant speed-up over classical methods observed in prior ML work.</description>

      <title>Holistic Physics Solver: Learning PDEs in a Unified Spectral-Physical Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in operator learning have produced two distinct approaches for solving partial differential equations (PDEs): attention-based methods offering point-level adaptability but lacking spectral constraints, and spectral-based methods providing domain-level continuity priors but limited in local flexibility. This dichotomy has hindered the development of PDE solvers with both strong flexibility and generalization capability. This work introduces Holistic Physics Mixer (HPM), a simple framework that bridges this gap by integrating spectral and physical information in a unified space. HPM unifies both approaches as special cases while enabling more powerful spectral-physical interactions beyond either method alone. This enables HPM to inherit both the strong generalization of spectral methods and the flexibility of attention mechanisms while avoiding their respective limitations. Through extensive experiments across diverse PDE problems, we demonstrate that HPM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency, while maintaining strong generalization capabilities with limited training data and excellent zero-shot performance on unseen resolutions.</description>

      <title>The Empirical Spectral Distribution of i.i.d. Random Matrices with Random Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21919v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A large i.i.d. random matrix with deterministic low-rank perturbation has been extensively studied, particularly in the aspects of the ESD (Empirical Spectral Distribution) and the outliers of eigenvalues. In this work, we investigate the analogous scenario where the perturbation is random and extend the previous results from the deterministic perturbation to the random case. Specifically, we consider an i.i.d. matrix with random perturbation, $\mathbf{M}$. Our results show that: (i) the eigenvalue outliers of $\mathbf{M}$ converge to the eigenvalues of its perturbation; (ii) the ESD of $\mathbf{M}$ converges to the circular law; (iii) the eigenvector alignment holds for specific perturbations.
  As an application of the above random matrices, we present the first optimal query complexity lower bound for approximating the top eigenvector of asymmetric matrices. In the inverse polynomial accuracy regime, the complexity matches the upper bounds that can be obtained via the power method. As far as we know, it is the first lower bound for approximating the eigenvector of an asymmetric matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional image data often require dimensionality reduction before further analysis. This paper provides a purely analytical comparison of two linear techniques-Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). After the derivation of each algorithm from first principles, we assess their interpretability, numerical stability, and suitability for differing matrix shapes. building on classical and recent numerical literature, We synthesize rule-of-thumb guidelines for choosing one out of the two algorithms without empirical benchmarking, building on classical and recent numerical literature. Limitations and directions for future experimental work are outlined at the end.</description>
