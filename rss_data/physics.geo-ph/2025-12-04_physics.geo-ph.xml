      <title>Postseismicity of slow-slip doublets discerned on the outermost of the Nankai Trough subduction megathrust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite dissimilar slip rates, slow earthquakes are faulting as ordinary earthquakes are. It is therefore physically natural that slow earthquakes also cause postseismic motions similarly to ordinary earthquakes, even though coseismic and postseismic slips remain undifferentiated for slow earthquakes. We pursue the slow-earthquake postseismicity based on the analysis of a fault slip beneath the Bungo Channel, the westernmost region of the Nankai Trough subduction zone in southwestern Japan. Its 2010 long-term slow slip event (SSE) was mispredicted by physics-based models, which concludes that the initial acceleration of this SSE was too abrupt for a slow variant of a fault rupture. We identify that a mispredicted GNSS signal evolves logarithmically in time, preceded by minor signals that evolve exponentially, lasting about two years west and about half a year east. By performing sparse inverse modeling on the GNSS, we have estimated that exponential slips occur at the same depth, bracketing a logarithmic slip that occurs beneath the channel. The regions of exponential slips match repeating slow-slip regions, and deep tremors synchronize exclusively with the logarithmic slip. This source complexity can be explained as a neighboring rupture doublet and its afterslip and aftershocks by the known mechanics of ordinary earthquakes. If slow earthquakes have a dual origin in exponentially nucleating slow rupture and logarithmically decelerating postseismic creep, it is possible to pick the slow earthquake nuclei that could accelerate into megathrust catastrophes.</description>

      <title>An infrasound source analysis of the OSIRIS-REx sample return capsule hypersonic re-entry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The OSIRIS-REx sample return capsule hypersonic re-entry into the atmosphere is a rare opportunity to test a variety of sonic boom source models since the projectile dimensions are well characterized. While the as-flown flight path is unknown, the predicted flight path enables a rough approximation of the source Mach number and location. Six infrasound microphones deployed in the boom carpet along the predicted flight path recorded impulsive signals from the OSIRIS-REx re-entry. Using a suite of atmosphere profiles and the geometric acoustics approximation, we estimate locations with uncertainty estimates along the flight path from which the signals were emitted. Acoustic overpressure and signal duration predictions from Whitham's far field theory, Carlson's simplified sonic boom prediction method, and a drag-dominated hypersonic model are analyzed with uncertainty estimates from the location estimate. While the Carlson simplified sonic boom prediction method could be accurate, our preference is for the drag-dominated source model. Using this source model with an inviscid Burgers' equation solver for propagation, we obtained an excellent match to the recorded data. These results will help better inform future sample return capsule re-entry observation campaigns as well as contribute to a better understanding of high altitude infrasonic sources.</description>

      <title>Tetragonal Fe2O: the stable iron oxide at Earth's core conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fe-O system is fundamental to understanding the composition and properties of the Earth's core. Recent studies have suggested the possible existence of stable, iron-rich FenO compounds at around 215 GPa. Here, we performed crystal-structure searches and fully anharmonic free-energy calculations to investigate the Fe-FeO system under inner-core conditions. We identified Fe2O as a stable phase and constructed its high P-T phase diagram. Fe2O undergoes a hexagonal-to-tetragonal transition with increasing pressure and temperature. It remains thermodynamically stable against decomposition into Fe and FeO from 200 to 400 GPa and at high temperatures. Although oxygen has been considered nearly absent in the inner core due to its limited solubility, these results suggest that oxygen can, in fact, be incorporated into the solid inner core in the form of an Fe+Fe2O mixture, and can match PREM densities for 53 mol% Fe2O. Our work has the potential to lead to a significant revision of the current understanding of the core's structure and composition.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models Bridge Deep Learning and Physics in ENSO Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate long-range forecasting of the El \Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is vital for global climate prediction and disaster risk management. Yet, limited understanding of ENSO's physical mechanisms constrains both numerical and deep learning approaches, which often struggle to balance predictive accuracy with physical interpretability. Here, we introduce a data driven model for ENSO prediction based on conditional diffusion model. By constructing a probabilistic mapping from historical to future states using higher-order Markov chain, our model explicitly quantifies intrinsic uncertainty. The approach achieves extending lead times of state-of-the-art methods, resolving early development signals of the spring predictability barrier, and faithfully reproducing the spatiotemporal evolution of historical extreme events. The most striking implication is that our analysis reveals that the reverse diffusion process inherently encodes the classical recharge-discharge mechanism, with its operational dynamics exhibiting remarkable consistency with the governing principles of the van der Pol oscillator equation. These findings establish diffusion models as a new paradigm for ENSO forecasting, offering not only superior probabilistic skill but also a physically grounded theoretical framework that bridges data-driven prediction with deterministic dynamical systems, thereby advancing the study of complex geophysical processes.</description>

      <title>Formation of abiogenic hydrocarbons in supercritical fluids under Earth's upper mantle conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of hydrocarbons in Earth's interior has traditionally been considered to have biogenic origins; however, growing evidence suggests that some hydrocarbons may instead originate abiotically in the deep carbon cycle. It is widely expected that the Fisher-Tropsch-type (FTT) process, which typically refers to the conversion of inorganic carbon to organic matter in geological settings,may also happen in Earth's interior, but the absence of industrial catalysts and aqueous conditions in deep environments suggest that the FTT process can be very different from that in the chemical industry. Here, we performed extensive \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations ($&gt;$ 2.4 ns) to investigate the FTT synthesis in dry mixture and in aqueous solutions at 10-13 GPa and 1000-1400 K.We found that large hydrocarbon-related species containing C, O, and H($&gt;$C$_2$) are abiotically synthesized via the polymerization of CO without any catalyst. Supercritical water, commonly found in the deep Earth, does not prevent organic molecule formation but restricts product size and carbon reduction.Our studies reveal a previously unrecognized abiogenic route for hydrocarbon synthesis in mantle geofluids. These carbon-containing fluids could potentially migrate from depth to shallower crustal reservoirs, thereby influencing Earth's surface carbon budget.</description>
