      <title>String Theory from Maximal Supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the space of non-gravitational, maximally supersymmetric, planar 4d effective field theories (EFTs) that have $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills (SYM) at leading order. We show that in the weakly-coupled regime, highly non-trivial nonlinear constraints on the 4-point Wilson coefficients follow from enforcing $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetry and $SU(4)$ R-symmetry together with the requirement of standard tree-level factorization on the massless poles of the 4-, 5-, and 6-point EFT scattering amplitudes. Additionally, when these novel constraints are combined with positivity, the resulting bounds on the 4-point Wilson coefficients converge to the values of the open string Veneziano amplitude. Our results strongly suggest that supersymmetry, R-symmetry, and positivity are sufficient to single out this unique UV completion at tree level. Our findings, moreover, highlight the power of higher-point amplitudes in constraining EFT data and imply that the space of consistent quantum field theories is even more restricted than previously suggested by causality or swampland-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Weyl Mutations in Quiver Yangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of solving non-linear equations would be considerably simplified by a possibility to convert known solutions into the new ones. This could seem an element of art, but in the context of ADHM-like equations describing quiver varieties there is a systematic approach. In this note we study moduli spaces and dualities of quiver gauge theories associated to effective dynamics of D-branes compactified on Calabi-Yau resolutions. We concentrate on a subfamily of quivers $\mathfrak{Q}_{\mathfrak{g}}$ covering Dynkin diagrams for simple Lie algebras $\mathfrak{g}$, where the respective BPS algebra is expected to be the Yangian algebra $Y(\mathfrak{g})$. For Yangians labeled by quivers their representations are described by solutions of ADHM-like equations. As quivers substitute Dynkin diagrams a generalization of the Weyl group $\mathcal{W}_{\mathfrak{g}}$ acts on the ADHM solutions. Here we work with the case $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$ and treat this group as a group of electro-magnetic Seiberg-like dualities (we call them Weyl mutations) on the respective quiver gauge theories. We lift it to the case of higher representations associated to rectangular Young diagrams. An action of Weyl mutations on the BPS Yangian algebra is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Tensionless spinning string: emergence of world-sheet torsion and covariant density of energy-momentum tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The action of tensionless spinning string invariant under reparametrizions, both local supersymmetry and dilatations, is considered. The density of energy-momentum tensor is constructed and vanishing of its covariant divergence is proved. This result arises from mutual cancellation of the bosonic and fermionic contributions. Differences in the geometry of worldsheets swept by tensionless and tensionfull spinning strings are analyzed. Shown is emergence of covariant trace of a torsion tensor on w-s of the tensionless spinning string. It is derived from the condition for the fermionic scalar density to be a composite one including the 2-dim. w-s density simulating the 4-dim. Rarita-Schwinger field. The said condition is accompanied with the Noether condition for covariant divergence of the vector metric density to vanish.</description>

      <title>Structural Origin of the Gravitino Mass Term: Geometric and Supergravity Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a minimal superspace projector that uniquely selects the Rarita Schwinger mass bilinear in four-dimensional N=1 supergravity. Working in a reduced superspace with a single fermionic direction, we show that Berezin projection of a canonical even supergeometric form isolates the unique Lorentz-invariant fermionic bilinear compatible with local supersymmetry. The construction is predynamical: it fixes the algebraic structure of the gravitino mass term independently of supersymmetry breaking mechanisms, background geometry, or matter couplings. We show that this projector embeds consistently into curved superspace, extends to N&gt;1 theories, and clarifies the universality of the gravitino mass structure in supergravity.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Basis in Conformal Field Theory: The Free Fermion Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we use the master function approach to describe the CFT limit of the six-vertex model at the free fermion point. Using the ODE/IM correspondence, we obtain an explicit form of the master function. This allows us to compute the asymptotic expansion of the function $\omega(\lambda, \mu)$ describing the expectation values of the fermionic basis operators. As a result, we describe the entire Virasoro module of the corresponding CFT, including the integrals of motion as well.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Topological String Partition Function on Twisted Affine Line Bundle over $\mathbb{C}\times T^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using instanton partition function for five dimensional $U(1)$ gauge theory with eight supercharges and a single adjoint massive hypermultiplet on the $\Omega$ background, we give explicit expression for non-perturbative corrections to the topological string theory in the holomorphic limit. It was argued that in this case the theory is compactified on the twisted affine line bundle over $\mathbb{C}\times T^2$. We perform calculations in two ways. First we modify the integration contour by adding poles responsible for non-perturbative physics in accordance with a recent proposal. Then, we compute the genus zero Gopakumar-Vafa invariants for our case and evaluate the non-perturbative corrections to the partition function. We check that both calculations give the same result.</description>

      <title>Edge Modes on Stringy Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a quantum field of arbitrary mass and spin in the static patch of de Sitter spacetime, the Euclidean partition function receives contributions from edge modes localized on the horizon, expressible in terms of the Harish-Chandra character of the de Sitter group. Considering the flat limit and summing over all string fields, we obtain the partition function of edge modes in string theory near the Minkowski-Rindler horizon. Application of the Kronecker limit formula naturally yields a modular invariant one-loop partition function. The resulting expression generalizes the edge contribution of a massive vector boson in a spontaneously broken gauge theory to the infinite tower in string theory. It is naturally ultraviolet finite and amenable to a state-counting interpretation.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative Isentropic Processes in AdS Black Holes with Nonlinear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the isentropic processes in a class of Anti de Sitter black holes coupled to non-linear electrodynamics. We demonstrate that such processes are classically forbidden but can proceed via quantum mechanical tunnelling. We compute the Euclidean action associated with the tunnelling process and analyze its dependence on the black hole charge, horizon radius, and the non-linear electrodynamics parameters characterizing each model. We find that the tunnelling probability is increasingly suppressed as the strength of the non-linearity is enhanced. We further find that smaller black holes exhibit a significantly higher tunnelling probability compared to larger ones, indicating a departure from classical behaviour. We conjecture that this behaviour may be universal across a broad class of black hole spacetimes. We discuss the implications of our results for entropy bounds and their potential relevance to the black hole information loss paradox.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Gravitational Wave Production from Unitarity in an Early NEC-Violating Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a cosmological scenario featuring an early phase of null energy condition (NEC) violation. Within this framework, we show that perturbative unitarity bounds place strong constraints on both the amplitude and the spectral tilt of primordial gravitational waves. Our analysis is largely insensitive to the detailed realization of the transition between the NEC-violating phase and subsequent cosmological phases, allowing our results to be extended to a broader class of models. Finally, the perturbative unitarity approach employed here is applicable to a wide range of cosmological scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the connection between the four-dimensional Minkowski-space Bethe-Salpeter equation and its light-front projection, emphasizing the implications for bound-state dynamics. Our approach incorporates dressed particles, such as quarks, via the integral representation of the corresponding propagator. We analyze the light-front dynamics of the valence component of the physical state using a hierarchical set of Green's functions, which reveals its coupling to higher Fock components when dressed particles are considered. We also present the light-front Faddeev-Bethe-Salpeter equations for three-body systems with dressed constituents. Furthermore, we discuss formal developments that are central to connecting the three-dimensional light-front dynamics onto the null-plane and the four-dimensional Minkowski-space framework, based on the Nakanishi integral representation. Selected applications to hadron structure are also reviewed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories predict fundamental scalar fields of considerable interest in astrophysics and cosmology. We investigate the superradiant instability of scalar clouds around Kerr black holes, showing that stimulated decay generates detectable electromagnetic signals. The growth of the superradiant scalar cloud differs from that of other bosonic fields and depends sensitively on the matter distribution surrounding the black hole, which originates from the scalar-matter coupling realized by the chameleon mechanism in modified gravity theories. In non-uniform matter distributions, stimulated emission from scalar clouds offers an observational signature that distinguishes fundamental scalars from other light bosonic fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that simple affine vertex operator algebras with positive integral levels admit only trivial first-order deformations. Therefore, the deformation rigidity conjecture of strongly rational vertex operator algebras holds for these cases. We also show that the same holds simple affine vertex operator algebra of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at the non-integral admissible level $-4/3$. Therefore, neither $C_2$-cofiniteness nor rationality is a necessary condition for deformation rigidity of VOAs. We conjecture that the same should hold for every simple affine VOA that does not coincide with the corresponding universal affine VOA.</description>

      <title>The gravitational energy-momentum pseudo-tensor in $f(Q)$ non-metric gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the affine tensor associated with the energy and momentum densities of both gravitational and matter fields, the complex pseudo-tensor, for $f(Q)$ non-metric gravity, the straightforward extension of Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (STEGR), characterized by a flat, torsion-free, non-metric connection. The local conservation of energy-momentum complex on-shell is satisfied through a continuity equation. An important analogy is pointed out between gravitational pseudo-tensor of teleparallel $f(T)$ gravity, in the Weitzenb\"ock gauge, and the same object of symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity, in the coincident gauge. Furthermore, we perturb the gravitational pseudo-tensor $\tau^{\alpha}_{\phantom{\alpha}\lambda}$ in the coincident gauge up to the second order in the metric perturbation, obtaining a useful expression for the power carried by the related gravitational waves. We also present an application of the gravitational pseudotensor, determining the gravitational energy density of a Schwarzschild spacetime in STEGR gravity, adopting the concident gauge. Finally, analyzing the conserved quantities on manifolds, the Stokes theorem can be formulated for generic affine connections</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Long-Distance Expansion of Euclidean Correlators in Lattice Parton Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bilinear Euclidean quark and gluon correlators with Wilson links have been used widely for applications of large-momentum effective field theories to computing non-perturbative collinear and soft parton physics. Due to color confinement, these correlators decay exponentially at large spatial distances, a behavior crucial for computing momentum-space Fourier transformations with controlled errors from lattice QCD data. Using heavy-quark effective theory reduction, dispersive analysis, Lorentz symmetry, and heavy-flavor spectra, we determine the leading and next-to-leading asymptotic behaviors and relate the expansion parameters to binding energies of heavy-flavor hadrons. We demonstrate the results through two-loop calculations in $\phi^3$ theory and from the perspective of locality and analyticity. We also study the impact of the asymptotic analysis on realistic lattice QCD data and demonstrate reliable error estimates.</description>

      <title>Topological quantum color code model on infinite lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The color code model is a crucial instance of a Calderbank--Shor--Steane (CSS)-type topological quantum error-correcting code, which notably supports transversal implementation of the full Clifford group. Its robustness against local noise is rooted in the structure of its topological excitations. From the perspective of quantum phases of matter, it is essential to understand these excitations in the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we analyze the color code model on an infinite lattice within the quasi-local $C^{*}$-algebra framework, using a cone-localized Doplicher-Haag-Roberts (DHR) analysis. We classify its irreducible anyon superselection sectors and construct explicit string operators that generate anyonic excitations from the ground state. We further examine the fusion and braiding properties of these excitations. Our results show that the topological order of the color code is described by $\mathsf{Rep}(D(\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2)) \simeq \mathsf{Rep}(D(\mathbb{Z}_2)) \boxtimes \mathsf{Rep}(D(\mathbb{Z}_2))$, which is equivalent to a double layer of the toric code and consistent with established analyses on finite lattices.</description>

      <title>Investigation of deuteron-like singly bottomed dibaryon resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a systematical investigation of the existence of the deuteron-like singly bottomed dibaryon resonance states with strangeness $S=-1,~-3,~-5$ in the chiral quark model. Two resonance states with strangeness $S=-1$ are obtained in the baryon-baryon scattering process. The first candidate is $\Sigma\Sigma_b$ in the $\Lambda\Lambda_b$ and $N\Xi_b^*$ scattering process, with the resonance energy 6974.22 MeV - 6975.37 MeV and the decay width 14.450 MeV, respectively; the other one is $\Sigma \Sigma_b^*$ in the $N\Xi_b$ and $N\Xi'_b$ scattering process, with the resonance energy 6990.69 MeV - 7008.37 MeV and the decay width 43.790 MeV, respectively. The Root Mean Square (RMS) radius calculation shows that the former tends to be in a compact structure, while the latter tends to be in a molecular structure. Both of these resonance states are worthy of experimental exploration. Furthermore, it should be emphasized that the effect of channel-coupling is of great importance in exploring exotic hadron states, and investigating the scattering process may serve as an effective approach to identifying genuine resonances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $V$ be a M\"{o}bius vertex algebra and $G$ an abelian group of automorphisms of $V$. We construct $P(z)$-tensor product bifunctors for the category of $C_{n}$-cofinite grading-restricted generalized $g$-twisted $V$-modules (without $g$-actions) for $g\in G$ and the category of $C_{n}$-cofinite grading-restricted generalized $g$-twisted $V$-modules with $G$-actions for $g\in G$. In this paper, an automorphism $g$ of $V$ can be of infinite order and does not have to act semisimply on $V$, and the group $G$ can be an infinite abelian group containing nonsemisimple automorphisms of $V$.</description>

Abstract: This paper is a sequel in which we further analyze the recently derived quantum gravity equations which apply in accelerating cosmological spacetimes and whose solutions should be equivalent to all order re-summations of the perturbative leading logarithms that appear.

      <title>Quark sector effects and glueball mass sensitivity estimates in Lorentz-violating supersymmetric QCD-like theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $N=1$ supersymmetric Yang--Mills--Carroll--Field--Jackiw (SYM--CFJ) model is extended to include the quark sector of supersymmetric quantum chromodynamics (SQCD) in the presence of Lorentz--symmetry violation (LSV). The Lorentz--violating data are carried by a spurion chiral superfield whose components define a purely spacelike background vector $v_\mu$ and fermionic bilinears, inducing a topological mass scale in the gauge sector. Working within a spurion effective field theory (EFT) and a small--LSV expansion, we classify the allowed parametric dependence of glueball observables on the induced mass scales. Using lattice Yang--Mills (YM) glueball masses only as a reference hadronic scale, we provide parametric sensitivity estimates and naturalness ranges for the topological mass $|v|$ relative to $\Lambda_{\rm YM}$.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Decay Rate in D-dimensional Electroweak theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic framework for calculating the vacuum decay rate in D-dimensional electroweak theories, providing a unified treatment of quantum fluctuations for scalar, fermion, and gauge boson fields via a combined WKB expansion and dimensional regularization. This method ensures rapid convergence even at large angular momenta. Application to a $D=4$ standard model effective field theory gives $\log_{10}(\gamma \times \text{Gyr} \times \text{Gpc}^3)=183$. In the finite-temperature, dimensionally reduced standard model effective field theory with $D=3$, the values are $\log_{10}(\Gamma_T \times \text{Gyr} \times \text{Gpc}^3)=42.4$ at tree level and $116.1$ at two-loop order. The approach offers a general and efficient tool for analyzing vacuum stability and decay across dimensions.</description>

Abstract: This paper describes the reduced phase space of $N=1$, $D=4$ supergravity in the fully off-shell Palatini--Cartan formalism. This is achieved through the KT construction, allowing an explicit description of first-class constraints on the boundary. The corresponding BFV description is obtained, and its relation with the BV one in the bulk is described by employing the BV pushforward in the particular example of a cylindrical spacetime.</description>

      <title>Was the Early Universe Quantum? Falsifying Classical Stochastic Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inflationary cosmology successfully accounts for the observed properties of primordial fluctuations using quantum field theory in an expanding background. However, the quantum nature of these fluctuations has not been experimentally established, since classical stochastic models could reproduce the observed two-point statistics by construction. Existing approaches to testing primordial quantumness focus primarily on Bell inequalities, which provide a sharp conceptual criterion but are difficult to implement with cosmological observables. In this work we adopt a falsification-based approach. We define a precise classical hypothesis for the origin of primordial perturbations (local stochastic fields admitting a positive probability distribution) and identify inequality constraints that must be satisfied within this class. We show how violations of these classicality inequalities can be probed using realistic cosmological observables, without invoking Bell tests or non-commuting measurement settings. We further identify symmetry-protected spectator sectors in which quantum coherence is parametrically preserved during inflation, allowing violations of observable magnitude to survive decoherence. Our results show that large-scale structure and future 21 cm surveys provide a viable and quantitative route to falsifying classical stochastic descriptions of primordial fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Propagation and polarization of gravitational waves on curved spacetime backgrounds in Einstein-\AE ther theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the propagation and polarization properties of high-frequency gravitational waves in Einstein-\AE ther theory on vorticity-free and slowly-varying backgrounds at both leading and next-to-leading orders within the geometric optics approximation. The linear perturbation analysis is performed in the background \AE ther-orthogonal frame, in which the axes of the gravitational wave sound cones remain perpendicular to these hypersurfaces, thereby simplifying the analysis. The leading-order results show that Einstein-\AE ther theory admits two tensor modes, two vector modes, and one scalar mode, consistent with the findings in the flat spacetime background. We further derive the dispersion relations and linear stability conditions for these modes in curved backgrounds. At next-to-leading order, we obtain the amplitude evolution equations, finding that the graviton number is conserved for the tensor modes but not for the vector and scalar modes. Next-to-leading-order effects also induce mixing among polarization modes. Our study demonstrates that, after imposing the GW170817 constraint on the propagation speed of gravitational waves, the vector modes mixed with the leading-order tensor modes cannot be used to distinguish between general relativity and Einstein-\AE ther theory. On the other hand, the mixing between scalar modes and the leading-order tensor modes leads to distinct predictions in the two theories, providing a promising avenue to test Einstein-\AE ther gravity through the detection of polarization mixing in gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Heavy Quarks in the initial stages of Proton-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisions among heavy ions, like Pb or Au, are a great tool to study the theory of strong interactions, that is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In particular, these experiments are able to give insights on all the complex phases of matter that the theory of QCD allows. In this PhD Thesis we have investigated the initial stages of proton-ion collisions: in particular, we will focus on the first $\sim 0.4$ fm/c ($\sim 10^{-24}$ s) after the collision, which are dominated by very intense gluon fields, in a state called glasma. We investigated the effect of such fields on the dynamics of heavy quarks (charm and beauty) which are created and evolve in this medium. The effect of the initial gluon fields on heavy quarks is quite substantial, in particular we observe that the glasma provokes a $50\%$ dissociation rate on quark-antiquark pairs. Moreover, glasma fields have a large momentum anisotropy, and transmit a large part of such anisotropy to the heavy quarks which evolve in this medium. Finally, we have generalized our study to a non-boost invariant medium, and shown that fluctuations in rapidity do not lead to significant isotropization within glasma timescales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work aims to present the quantum aspects of a non-commutative gauge gravity formulation of a Schwarzschild-like black hole constructed via the Moyal twist $\partial_t \wedge \partial_\theta$. Particle creation is estimated for bosonic and fermionic fields using the quantum tunneling method, with divergent integrals treated through the residue prescription. Since the surface gravity is well defined for this configuration, the corresponding emission rates and evaporation lifetimes are also computed. In addition, previously reported results in the literature on gauge gravity Schwarzschild black holes are revisited. Finally, we infer constraints on the non-commutative parameter $\Theta$ from solar-system tests.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of the extra-dimensional Randall-Sundrum set-up, we investigate the freeze-in production of Standard Model (SM) gauge-singlet scalar, fermionic, and massive vector dark matter (DM). Assuming that both the DM and SM fields reside on the IR brane and interact solely through the graviton and radion, we demonstrate that the observed DM relic abundance measured by Planck can be achieved across a wide range of reheating temperatures, all while naturally addressing the hierarchy problem, satisfying constraints from collider, early Universe cosmology including $\Delta{N}_{\rm eff}$. We further show that the same set-up can accommodate TeV-scale leptogenesis capable of generating the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe. Remarkably, we find that current graviton searches at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) already impose strong constraints on the reheating temperature in this scenario.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes and their excitation beyond general relativity. II: isospectrality loss in gravitational waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue our series of papers where we study the quasinormal modes, and their excitation, of black holes in the simplest beyond general relativity model in which first-principle calculations are tractable: a nonrotating black hole in an effective-field-theory extension of general relativity with cubic-in-curvature terms. In this theory, the equivalence between the quasinormal mode spectra associated with metric perturbations of polar and axial parities ("isospectrality") of the Schwarzschild black hole in general relativity no longer holds. How does this loss of isospectrality translate into the time-domain ringdown of gravitational waves? Given such a ringdown, can we identify the two "fundamental quasinormal modes" associated to the two metric-perturbation parities? We study these questions through a large suite of time-domain numerical simulations, by a prescription on how to relate the gauge-invariant master functions that describe metric perturbations of each parity with the gravitational polarizations. Under the assumptions made in our calculations, we find that it is in general difficult to identify either of the two fundamental modes from the time series, although finding evidence for a non-general-relativistic mode is possible sometimes. We discuss our results in light of our assumptions and speculate about what may occur when they are relaxed.</description>

      <title>Finite-resolution measurement induces topological curvature defects in spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that regularizing $(2+1)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime with a finite-resolution Gaussian probe, analogous to Weyl-Heisenberg (Gabor) signal analysis and related quantization, induces a curved geometry with a topological defect. The regularized metric replaces $r^2$ by $r^2+\sigma^2$ in the angular part, where $\sigma$ is the resolution scale from the width of the Gaussian probe. The resulting Gaussian curvature integrates to $-2\pi$, independently of $\sigma$, and including the boundary contribution, yields Euler characteristic $\chi=0$, corresponding to a punctured plane. This curvature defines an effective stress-energy source with total energy $E_{\text{eff}}=-1/(4G)$, universal and $\sigma$-independent. Spatial slices embed isometrically as helicoids, and geodesics exhibit a characteristic swirling motion. These results show that finite spatial resolution measurement does not merely smooth singularities but imprints topological defects with fixed physical consequences, suggesting that observational limitations fundamentally shape spacetime geometry. We show how our Gabor regularisation is extendable to $(3+1)$ Minkowski space-time.</description>

      <title>Onset of thermalization of q-deformed SU(2) Yang-Mills theory on a trapped-ion quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems is one of the main targets of quantum simulations. This focus - together with rapid advances in quantum-computing hardware - has driven increasing applications in high-energy physics, particularly in lattice gauge theories. However, most existing experimental demonstrations remain restricted to (1+1)-dimensional and/or abelian gauge theories, such as the Schwinger model and the toric code. It is essential to develop quantum simulations of nonabelian gauge theories in higher dimensions, addressing realistic problems in high-energy physics. To fill the gap, we demonstrate a quantum simulation of thermalization dynamics in a (2+1)-dimensional $q$-deformed $\mathrm{SU}(2)_3$ Yang-Mills theory using a trapped-ion quantum computer. By restricting the irreducible representations of the gauge fields to the integer-spin sector of $\mathrm{SU}(2)_3$, we obtain a simplified yet nontrivial model described by Fibonacci anyons, which preserves the essential nonabelian fusion structure of the gauge fields. We successfully simulate the real-time dynamics of this model using quantum circuits that explicitly implement $F$-moves. In our demonstrations, the quantum circuits execute up to 47 sequential $F$-moves. We identify idling errors as the dominant error source, which can be effectively mitigated using dynamical decoupling combined with a parallelized implementation of $F$-moves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the standard framework in which electroweak sphaleron processes relate lepton and baryon number, we derive an upper limit on the amplitude of a chiral gravitational wave background produced prior to the electroweak epoch. This bound is independent of the production time of chiral GWs for superhorizon modes, while it becomes sensitive to the production time for subhorizon modes. For sufficiently high reheating temperatures, the bound becomes significantly more stringent than the conventional big bang nucleosynthesis constraints at frequencies above the MHz scale, thereby providing a powerful and \emph{model-independent} probe of parity-violating physics in the early Universe.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing number of high-precision astronomical observations, physical quantities that were previously inaccessible to accurate calculations, such as cosmic birefringence, have once again become a focal point of interest. Such phenomena induce a nonvanishing cross-correlation between the $E$- and $B$-mode polarizations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), thereby providing a direct observational signature of parity violation. The Chern-Simons coupling between the scalar field in early dark energy (EDE) models and CMB photons is regarded as a plausible mechanism for generating cosmic birefringence. Recent data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) deliver $EB$ measurements at higher multipole moments than those previously achieved by {Planck}, while DESI and PantheonPlus datasets provide new and stringent constraints on the late-time expansion history. Using a joint analysis of {Planck}, DESI DR1, Pantheon+, and ACT data, we perform a full-parameter constraint on the cosmic birefringence effects induced by the EDE-CMB photon coupling. Our results favor a higher Hubble constant, $H_0 = 76.9^{+2.9}_{-2.5}\,\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}$, and a relatively large EDE fraction, $f_{\mathrm{EDE}} = 0.232^{+0.074}_{-0.047}$. By comparing the cosmological evolution of this model across different data combinations, we find that the ACT-$EB$ data combined with {Planck} + DESI + PantheonPlus provide good constraints to both early- and late-Universe observations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement Geometry on Severi-Brauer Schemes: Subsystem Reductions of Azumaya Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate pure-state entanglement in families as a geometric obstruction. In standard quantum information, entanglement is defined relative to a chosen tensor-product factorization of a fixed Hilbert space. In contrast, for a twisted family of pure-state spaces, which can be described by Azumaya algebras $A$ of degree $n$ on $X$ and their Severi-Brauer schemes \[ SB(A)=P\times^{PGL_n}\mathbb{P}^{n-1}\to X, \] such a subsystem choice may fail to globalize. We formalize this algebro-geometrically: fixing a factorization type $\mathbf d=(d_1,\dots,d_s)$ with $n=\prod_i d_i$, the existence of a global product-state locus of type $\mathbf d$ is equivalent to a reduction of the underlying $PGL_n$-torsor $P\to X$ to the stabilizer $G_{\mathbf d}\subset PGL_n$. Thus, entanglement is the obstruction to the existence of a relative Segre subscheme inside $SB(A)$.
  Writing $\Sigma_{\mathbf d}\subset \mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ for the Segre variety, we call a reduction to $G_{\mathbf d}$ a $\mathbf d$-subsystem structure. Our first main result identifies the moduli of $\mathbf d$-subsystem structures with the quotient $P/G_{\mathbf d}$. Moreover, we realize naturally $P/G_{\mathbf d}$ as a locally closed subscheme of the relative Hilbert scheme, \[ \text{Hilb}^{\Sigma_{\mathbf d}}\!\bigl(SB(A)/X\bigr)\ \subset\ \text{Hilb}\bigl(SB(A)/X\bigr), \] parametrizing relative closed subschemes fppf-locally isomorphic to $\Sigma_{\mathbf d}\times X$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the frame dependence of distribution functions within the framework of generalized chiral kinetic theory. Based on the derived transformation rules governing the choice of frame, we analytically obtain the global equilibrium solution in the presence of vorticity and electromagnetic fields. Our results show that, under the assumption of a varying electromagnetic field, these equilibrium solutions can be uniquely determined.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional arrow of time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the effect of extra dimensions on the arrow of time within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity. We demonstrate that the observed irreversibility of physical processes can be explained by the monotonic growth of the extra-dimensional space. Unlike traditional cosmological approaches, our model does not link the arrow of time to the entropy of matter or radiation; rather, it identifies it with the Bekenstein-Hawking-Wald entropy of the geometric background. We establish a formal relation between the volume of the multidimensional manifold and the statistical weights of its geometric states. This leads to a fundamental relationship where the flow of time is intrinsically linked to the growth of multidimensional entropy.
  A key consequence of our framework is that the arrow of time remains a persistent feature for a 4D observer situated on a brane, even in the complete absence of matter or radiation. This directionality is driven by the dominant entropy production in the higher-dimensional bulk, which dominates local statistical fluctuations and ensures a stable causal direction.</description>

      <title>A model of errors in transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the error rate of LLMs on tasks like arithmetic that require a deterministic output, and repetitive processing of tokens drawn from a small set of alternatives. We argue that incorrect predictions arise when small errors in the attention mechanism accumulate to cross a threshold, and use this insight to derive a quantitative two-parameter relationship between the accuracy and the complexity of the task. The two parameters vary with the prompt and the model; they can be interpreted in terms of an elementary noise rate, and the number of plausible erroneous tokens that can be predicted. Our analysis is inspired by an ``effective field theory'' perspective: the LLM's many raw parameters can be reorganized into just two parameters that govern the error rate. We perform extensive empirical tests, using Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro and DeepSeek R1, and find excellent agreement between the predicted and observed accuracy for a variety of tasks, although we also identify deviations in some cases. Our model provides an alternative to suggestions that errors made by LLMs on long repetitive tasks indicate the ``collapse of reasoning'', or an inability to express ``compositional'' functions. Finally, we show how to construct prompts to reduce the error rate.</description>

      <title>Decoupling of large-scale, adiabatic inflationary perturbations from enhanced small-scale modes at one-loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reconsider back-reaction from large amplitude, short-scale perturbations onto a long wavelength adiabatic mode. In a loop expansion of the long-mode power spectrum, this back-reaction appears first at 1-loop. Due to the separation between the long and short scales, the separate universe method provides a simple and efficient framework for this computation. In this paper, building on our earlier work, we employ a $\delta N$ formula for the long mode, which captures the effect of short scales. We show that back-reaction at 1-loop is due to either (i) non-linearity of the $\delta N$ formula, or (ii) 1-loop corrections to the initial conditions. We argue that contributions of type (ii) cannot themselves be described within the separate universe framework, but their properties can be constrained using soft theorems and a ''multi-point propagator'' expansion. When applied to a band of enhanced short-scale perturbations that crossed the horizon during inflation, our result shows that the loop correction decouples from their detailed properties. Furthermore, the back-reaction we obtain is scale-invariant. Its magnitude is model-dependent, but is degenerate with effects from modes that were still sub-horizon at the end of inflation. In this scenario (but not necessarily in all scenarios), we conclude that the effect is not observable.</description>

Abstract: We define the notion of adjustment for strict Lie 2-groups and provide the complete cocycle description for non-Abelian gerbes with connections whose structure 2-group is an adjusted 2-group. Most importantly, we depart from the common fake-flat connections and employ adjusted connections. This is an important generalisation that is needed for physical applications especially in the context of supergravity. We give a number of explicit examples; in particular, we lift the spin structure on $S^4$, corresponding to an instanton-anti-instanton pair, to a string structure, a 2-group bundle with connection. We also outline how categorified forms of Bogomolny monopoles known as self-dual strings can be obtained via a Penrose-Ward transform of string bundles over twistor space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06404v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Dirac equations on relativistic phase spaces $T^*{\mathbb R}^{p-1,1}$, where ${\mathbb R}^{p-1,1}$ is Minkowski space with $p=2,4$. We use the geometric quantization approach in which the wave functions are polarized sections of a complex line bundle $L_{\sf{v}}$ over $T^*{\mathbb R}^{p-1,1}$. The covariant derivatives with connection $A_{\sf{vac}}$ in this bundle define canonical commutation relations. Fermions are charged with respect to the field $A_{\sf{vac}}$, so lifting the Dirac equations from space-time ${\mathbb R}^{p-1,1}$ to phase space $T^*{\mathbb R}^{p-1,1}$ results in their solutions being localized in the space ${\mathbb R}^{p-1}$ or in space-time ${\mathbb R}^{p-1,1}$. We describe the explicit form of these solutions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16377v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using 3D-3D correspondence, we construct 3D dual bulk field theories for general Virasoro minimal models $M(P,Q)$. These theories correspond to Seifert fiber spaces $S^2 ((P,P-R),(Q,S),(3,1))$ with two integers $(R,S)$ satisfying $PS-QR =1$. In the unitary case, where $|P-Q|=1$, the bulk theory has a mass gap and flows to a unitary topological field theory (TQFT) in the IR, which is expected to support the chiral Virasoro minimal model at the boundary under an appropriate boundary condition. For the non-unitary case, where $|P-Q|&gt;1$, the bulk theory flows to a 3D $\mathcal{N}=4$ rank-0 superconformal field theory, whose topologically twisted theory supports the chiral minimal model at the boundary. We also provide a concrete field theory description of the 3D bulk theory using $T[SU(2)]$ theories. Our proposals are supported by various consistency checks using 3D-3D relations and direct computations of various partition functions.</description>

Abstract: We give a framework to describe abelian bosonic topological systems with parity symmetry on a torus in terms of the projective representation of $GL(2,\mathbb{Z})$. However, this information alone does not guarantee that we can assign Hilbert spaces to non-orientable surfaces in a way compatible with the gluing axiom of topological quantum field theory. Here, we show that we may assign Hilbert spaces with integer dimensions to non-orientable surfaces in the case of abelian bosonic topological systems with time-reversal symmetry, which can be seen as a necessary condition for the existence of topological quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>On internal mechanical properties of Electroweak Magnetic Monopoles and their effects on stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04872v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By considering properties of the energy-momentum tensor of the electroweak magnetic monopole and its Born-Infeld extension, we attempt to make comments on the stability of these configurations. Specifically, we perform a study of the behaviour of the so-called internal force and pressure of these extended field-theoretic solitonic objects, which are derived from the energy-momentum tensor. Our method is slightly different from the so-called Laue's criterion for stability of nuclear matter, a local form of which had been proposed and applied in the earlier literature to the `t Hooft-Polyakov (HP) magnetic monopole, and found to be violated.By applying our method first to HP monopole, we also observe that, despite its topological stability, the total (finite) internal force (which has only radial components) is directed inwards, towards the centre of the monopole, which would imply instability. Thus this mechanical criterion for stability is arguably violated in the case of the HP monopole, as is the local version of Laue's criterion. The criterion is satisfied for the short-range part of the energy momentum tensor, in which the long-range part, due to the massless photon of the U(1) subgroup, is subtracted. Par contrast, the total internal force of the Cho-Maison (CM) electroweak monopole has both radial and angular components, which diverge at the origin, leading to rotational instabilities. Finally, by studying finite-energy extensions of the CM, either with non-minimal Higgs couplings with the hypercharge sector or hypercharge Born-Infeld type models, we find that the total force, integrated over space, is finite, but it has also angular components in the Born-Infeld case. The latter feature is interpreted as indicating that the Born-Infeld-CM monopole might be subject to rotations upon the action of perturbations, but it does not necessarily imply instabilities of the configuration.</description>

      <title>Higher-form anomalies and state-operator correspondence beyond conformal invariance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a state-operator correspondence for a class of non-conformal quantum field theories with continuous higher-form symmetries and a mixed anomaly. Such systems can always be realised as a relativistic superfluid. The symmetry structure induces an infinite tower of conserved charges, which we construct explicitly. These charges satisfy an abelian current algebra with a central extension, generalising the familiar Kac-Moody algebras to higher dimensions. States and operators are organised into representations of this algebra, enabling a direct correspondence. We demonstrate the correspondence explicitly in free examples by performing the Euclidean path integral on a $d$-dimensional ball, with local operators inserted in the origin, and matching to energy eigenstates on $S^{d-1}$ obtained by canonical quantisation. Interestingly, in the absence of conformal invariance, the empty path integral prepares a squeezed vacuum rather than the true ground state.</description>

Abstract: We derive the spectrum generating algebra for the hybrid string with manifest $\mathcal{N}=1$ super Poincar\'e symmetry in $\mathbb{R}^{3,1}\times\mathbb{R}^{6}$. Our DDF operators establish a one-to-one correspondence with the conventional superstring spectrum, while making its four-dimensional structure manifest. We also discuss part of the antifield spectrum, and introduce a simple realization of the supersymmetry charges involving the $\mathbb{R}^{6}$ directions. As an application, we algebraically compute the helicity partition function. These results provide new tools for analyzing four-dimensional on-shell superspaces and may extend naturally to phenomenologically relevant compactifications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As an exact count of protected states, the superconformal index provides a powerful probe into holography and quantum aspects of gravity, reproducing the Bekenstein--Hawking entropy of supersymmetric AdS black holes in the large-$N$ limit. As a step toward understanding quantum black hole microstates, we study the finite-$N$ index of the 3d ADHM quiver gauge theory, a UV description of the 3d $\mathcal N=8$ SCFT dual to M-theory on AdS$_4 \times S^7$. In this note, we analyze both microcanonical and canonical features of the superconformal index. By computing the index to sufficiently high orders using the factorization formula, we identify signatures of quantum black hole states in the finite-$N$ spectrum of the ADHM quiver, which align with the leading large-$N$ contribution reflecting the holographic dual black hole entropy. Furthermore, we introduce the complex-$\beta$ phase diagram of the index, which exhibits distinct peaks potentially associated with different gravitational saddles. We also examine the Hilbert series limit of the factorized index. Our results demonstrate that the finite-$N$ index encodes rich information about black hole microstates and their quantum gravitational interpretation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constructing a rational CHY integrand that realizes prescribed physical pole constraints is a discrete inverse problem whose combinatorial complexity grows with multiplicity. We encode the pole hierarchy through generalized pole degrees $K(A)$ (channels $s_A$), defined as signed internal-edge counts associated with particle subsets in a colored integrand graph. Additivity under integrand multiplication together with the elementary face recursion on the subset lattice expresses all higher-channel $K(A)$ as linear functions of the two-particle data $\{K(s_{ij})\}$ and reduces the inverse step to a mixed-integer linear feasibility problem. The subset lattice provides a fixed dependency graph for deterministic message passing with forward evaluation and backward residual propagation; this computation is parameter-free and involves no training. In factorial-rescaled variables $\widetilde K(A)=(|A|-2)!\,K(A)$, every local update is integral, so propagation is exact in the rescaled recursion variables and does not rely on numerical reconstruction. We further organize generalized integrand graphs by an $n$-regular grading under multiplication, where degree-zero (0-regular) factors act as M\"obius-invariant insertions that can be decomposed into four-point cross ratios. We illustrate the construction at six and eight points, including pick-pole selection and higher-order pole reduction.</description>

      <title>Generalization of anomaly formula for time reversal symmetry in (2+1)D abelian bosonic TQFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04990v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study time-reversal symmetry in $(2+1)$D abelian bosonic topological phases. Time-reversal anomalies in such systems are classified by $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in $(3+1)$D, and can be diagnosed via partition functions on manifolds such as $\mathbb{RP}^4$ and $\mathbb{CP}^2$. These partition functions are related by the anomaly formula \begin{equation*}
  Z(\mathbb{RP}^4)\, Z(\mathbb{CP}^2) = \theta_{\mathcal{M}}, \end{equation*} where $\theta_\mathcal{M}$ is the Dehn twist phase associated with the crosscap state.
  Meanwhile, the existence of gapped boundaries is constrained by so-called higher central charges $\xi_n$, which serve as computable invariants encoding obstruction data. Motivated by the known relation $Z(\mathbb{CP}^2) = \xi_1$, we propose a generalization of the anomaly formula that involves both the higher central charges $\xi_n$ and a new time-reversal invariant $\eta_n$. Introducing a distinguished subset $\mathcal{M}^n \subset \mathcal{A}$ of anyons, we establish the relation \begin{equation*}
  \eta_n \cdot \xi_n = \frac{\sum_{a \in \mathcal{M}^n} \theta(a)^n}{\left| \sum_{a \in \mathcal{M}^n} \theta(a)^n \right|}, \end{equation*} which generalizes the known anomaly formula.
  We analyze the algebraic structure of $\mathcal{M}^n$, derive consistency relations it satisfies, and clarify its connection to the original anomaly formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a novel holographic duality by taking a Carrollian limit of the AdS/CFT correspondence, relating string theory in a Carroll bulk geometry to a Carroll $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills theory. We further propose the existence of an underlying triality connecting Carroll string theory, relativistic string theory in flat spacetime, and Carroll gauge theory. Finally, we analyse the symmetries of the Carroll gauge theory, showing that they are non-linearly realised and do not close under ordinary Lie brackets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12316v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The massless S-matrix of the pure RR AdS3 X S3 X T4 theory is very similar but not quite the same as Fendley-Intriligator's N=2 S-matrix, in turns related to Sine-Gordon taken at a special coupling. In this short note we review the reason why supersymmetry emerges but with a fractional statistics of the particles. We then use this to obtain a very simple interpolating S-matrix between massless AdS3 and Sine-Gordon, and further find two interpolating S-matrices between these and the mixed-flux relativistic S-matrix, solving the Yang-Baxter equation all the way in-between. They are all relativistic invariant and braiding unitary, can be written in terms of particles with fractional statistics, and they might serve the purpose to embed into a parent integrable system.</description>

      <title>Vanishing of the $H^3$ obstruction for time-reversal symmetry in (2+1)D abelian bosonic TQFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In $(2+1)$-dimensional topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), the action of a global symmetry group on the anyon system is one of the central topics of research. Owing to the subtle categorical nature of anyons, a global symmetry acting on them is generally realized in a projective manner. Symmetry fractionalization encodes this projective realization. The obstruction to defining symmetry fractionalization is captured by a cohomology class, known as the $H^3$ obstruction, whose nontriviality signals a failure to define symmetry fractionalization consistently. In this short note, we prove that the $H^3$ obstruction for time-reversal symmetry always vanishes in abelian bosonic TQFTs.</description>

Abstract: Following Feynman's lectures on gravitation, we consider the theory of the gravitational (massless spin-2) field in flat spacetime and present the third- and fourth-order Lagrangian densities for the gravitational field. In particular, we present detailed calculations for the third-order Lagrangian density. We point out that the expression for the third-order Lagrangian density which Feynman provided is not a solution of Feynman's condition that the third-order Lagrangian density must satisfy. However, Feynman's third-order Lagrangian density gives the correct perihelion shift.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the potential-graviton contributions to the conservative scattering angle of two non-spinning bodies in maximal supergravity at fifth order in Newton's constant, including second-order self-force effects. Our goal is to tackle the challenging integrals arising at this order in Einstein gravity, but within the technically simpler framework of supergravity. The calculation employs the scattering-amplitude framework, effective field theory, and multi-loop integration techniques based on integration by parts and differential equations. The final result is expressed as a series expansion around the static limit, thereby avoiding the explicit evaluation of intricate special functions. This series solution for the master integrals applies, as well, to the corresponding computation in general relativity. Remarkably, we observe nontrivial cancellations among contributions associated with Calabi-Yau integrals, alongside a distinct contribution governed by a Heun differential equation.</description>

Abstract: Using scattering amplitudes, we compute the coupling between a general super-renormalizable gravity and massive scalar particles. This allows us to derive the $D$-dimensional Newtonian potential at both tree-level and one-loop level-the latter containing the first calculation by using newly derived three-graviton Feynman rules. In four-dimensional spacetime, we numerically demonstrate that the Newtonian potential remains finite at the origin, providing compelling evidence that the singularity-free nature of super-renormalizable gravity persists at the one-loop level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate pinched geometries in a two-dimensional Lorentzian model of quantum Regge calculus (QRC) using the tensor renormalization group (TRG) method. A pinched geometry refers to a configuration with an infinitely long temporal extent, even when the total spacetime area is fixed. We examine several choices of integration measures and triangulations to study whether such geometries can dominate in the limit of infinitely many triangles. Our results indicate that pinched geometries are strongly suppressed, and this suppression is observed across different integral measures and triangulations. These results suggest the possible emergence of smooth geometries as well as a sort of universality for infinitely many triangles.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Entanglement Entropy from the von Neumann Algebra of Double-Scaled SYK &amp; Its Connection with Krylov Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate entanglement entropy between the pair of type II$_1$ algebras of the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model given a chord state, its holographic interpretation as generalized horizon entropy; particularly in the (anti-)de Sitter ((A)dS) space limits of the bulk dual; and its connection with Krylov complexity. The density matrices in this formalism are operators in the algebras, which are specified by the choice of global state; and there exists a trace to evaluate their von Neumann entropy since the algebras are commutants of each other, which leads to a notion of algebraic entanglement entropy. We match it in triple-scaling limits to an area computed through a Ryu-Takayanagi formula in (A)dS$_2$ space with entangling surfaces at the asymptotic timelike or spacelike boundaries respectively; providing a first-principles example of holographic entanglement entropy for (A)dS$_2$ space. This result reproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking and Gibbons-Hawking entropy formulas for specific entangling regions points, while it decreases for others. This construction does not display some of the puzzling features in dS holography. The entanglement entropy remains real-valued since the theory is unitary, and it depends on the Krylov spread complexity of the Hartle-Hawking state. At last, we discuss higher dimensional extensions.</description>

      <title>Transient de Sitter and Quasi de Sitter States in SO(32) and E_8 x E_8 Heterotic String Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the long-standing puzzles in string theory has been on the existence of a four-dimensional de Sitter and quasi de Sitter configurations, the latter being defined with a temporally varying dark energy, in E_8 x E_8 and SO(32) heterotic theories. In this work, novel dynamical duality-sequences are devised that provide natural constructions of de Sitter and quasi de Sitter excited states in the aforementioned theories allowing no late-time singularities. The emergent positive dark energies -- including the intriguing possibility of their slow temporal variations -- appear from Borel resumming Gevrey series from the path-integral representations of such states. Additionally, precise ways to handle the equations of motion, Bianchi identities, flux quantizations and anomaly cancellations -- consistent with the underlying axionic cosmology, with the temporal dependence, and with the probability of forming wormholes that connect baby universes -- are presented for the SO(32) and the E_8 x E_8 theories within a framework that systematically incorporates perturbative and non-perturbative corrections in the far infrared. The temporally varying dark energy, which is much more natural in our set-up because of its emergent nature, surprisingly simplifies many of the aforementioned computations. Interestingly, our analysis also provides, probably for the first time, a set-up to consistently embed four-dimensional standard model degrees of freedom at late time in a realistic gravitational background with positive dark energy from string theory.</description>

      <title>Self-dual instantons and gravitating dyons in non-Abelian ModMax theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent interest in conformal and duality invariant nonlinear electrodynamics, we study the non-Abelian extension of ModMax electrodynamics. The theory is parameterized by a single dimensionless constant, and it is continuously connected to Yang-Mills theory in its vanishing limit. We show that the theory admits (anti-)self-dual instantons, despite the additional nonlinearities that characterize the non-Abelian ModMax theory. For $SU(2)$, we construct the generalization of the BPST instanton and extend this solution to Euclidean de Sitter and anti-de Sitter backgrounds. In the latter case, the Chern-Pontryagin index depends on the instanton size since the configuration is not a pure gauge at infinity; a property already pointed out in Yang-Mills on negative-curvature backgrounds by Callan and Wilczek. We compute the contribution of the latter to the spectrum of the Dirac operator at the boundary, which is crucial for determining the non-local contributions to the Dirac index. Then, we show that the ansatz constructed with 't Hooft symbols accommodates multi-instantons in the non-Abelian ModMax theory. The system of (anti-)self-dual equations reduces to a single nonlinear equation, which can be perturbatively solved order by order in the parameter that controls the nonlinearity. Following such a strategy, we provide a formal solution for the $N$-instanton configuration to first order in the expansion. Then, we couple non-Abelian ModMax theory to gravity with a conformally coupled scalar field and construct new gravitating solutions that describe Euclidean wormholes and other smooth configurations with secondary hair.</description>

Abstract: We consider a class of models in even spacetime dimensions $2n$ which share many similarities with Chern-Simons theories in odd spacetime dimensions $2n+1$. The independent dynamical variables of these models are a $GL(2n)$-connection and a metric in internal space. The action is a polynomial of degree $n$ in the curvature of the connection, with indices saturated by means of the metric and the Levi-Civita tensor. We show that the theory has no local degree of freedom in $2$ spacetime dimensions ($n=1$), where it can be reformulated as a constrained $BF$ model, but that its dynamics is more intrincate in higher dimensions ($n&gt;1$), where local degrees of freedom are present. We treat in detail the cases of $2$ and $4$ spacetime dimensions.}</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the equivalence of a class of generalised Schur partition functions $\mathcal Z_G(q;\alpha)$ of 4d $\mathcal N=2$ superconformal gauge theories to contour integral representations of vector-valued modular forms of the type that arise in 2d rational conformal field theories (RCFT). Concretely, we consider the $USp(2N)$ theory with $2N+2$ fundamental hypermultiplets and analytically prove that $\mathcal Z_{USp(2N)}(q;\alpha)$ satisfies an order-$(N+1)$ modular linear differential equation (MLDE) with vanishing Wronskian index, explaining how the parameter $\alpha$ of the former determines the parameters of the latter. Several connections are made to characters of RCFTs including unitary ones. We then propose a two-parameter extension $\mathcal Z_{USp(2N)}(q;\alpha,\beta)$ of the generalised Schur partition function. Finally, we relate the $\alpha=-k$ specialisation to quantum monodromy traces ${\rm Tr}\,M^k$ and formulate a conjecture linking their $k$-dependence to MLDEs.</description>

      <title>Weak Gravity Conjecture in the sky: gravitational waves from preheating in Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar EFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effective field theory (EFT) concept provides a necessary tool for obtaining general predictions of low-energy theory valid below its unitarity-breaking scale (cutoff scale). Early Universe inflation and subsequent reheating could be a unique setup for testing potentially observable effects coming from the derivative expansion of the corresponding EFT around the flat space vacuum. In this work, we consider an EFT describing perturbative reheating dominated by the decay of inflaton to photons caused by the dimension-5 operator $\phi F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu}$. We compute the graviton production during reheating and high frequency gravitational wave signal due to the bremsstrahlung effect in the presence of $R_{\mu\nu\lambda\rho}F^{\mu\nu} F^{\lambda\rho}$ operator. It may lead to the dominant contribution at high momenta if the EFT cutoff is lower than the Planck mass. Assuming the general consequences of the unitarity and causality constraints, which imply that all EFT operators should be present, and be suppressed by the scales following from the dimension analysis, we obtain the observational constraints (CMB bound for the dark radiation) on the mass of the inflaton and UV cutoff of gravity. We find that for the typical parameters of large field inflation models, the gravitational cutoff scale cannot be lower than $10^{15}$ GeV.</description>

Abstract: We analytically construct families of type IIB supergravity backgrounds in ten dimensions in which the four-dimensional metric is time dependent, while the six-dimensional internal space is an arbitrary compact Calabi-Yau manifold (with no restriction on holonomy) up to an overall time-dependent scale factor. Our solutions include cases with all fluxes (three-form and self-dual five-form) switched on, as well as cases with subsets of these fluxes, together with a time-dependent axiodilaton in most cases. These constructions require no local sources. We show that the associated energy-momentum tensors (both 10D and the resulting 4D effective) satisfy the null, weak, strong, and dominant energy conditions. In our explicit constructions, the Ricci scalar of the four-dimensional Einstein frame metric is negative; such backgrounds may find applications to anisotropic or FLRW cosmologies in the early universe. We also revisit the Maldacena--Nu\~nez no-go analysis, incorporating new elements that appear in our constructions, namely an overall noncompact spacetime-dependent scale factor multiplying the internal metric, and field strengths with components partially covering the noncompact directions. We argue that, with these generalizations, a four-dimensional Einstein-frame metric with positive Ricci scalar cannot be ruled out by such an analysis.</description>

      <title>Affine Symmetry and the Group-Theoretic Basis of the Unruh Effect</title>

Abstract: A massless scalar field in two spacetime dimensions splits into two independent sectors of left and right-moving modes on the light cone. At the quantum level, these two sectors carry a representation of the group of affine transformations of the real line, with translations corresponding to transformations generated by light-cone momenta and dilations given by light-cone Rindler momenta formed by a linear combination of generators of boosts and dilations. One-particle states for inertial observers are eigenvectors of translation generators belonging to irreducible representations of the affine group. Rindler one-particle states are related to eigenfunctions of the generator of dilations. We show that simple manipulations connecting these two representations involving the Mellin transform can be used to derive the thermal spectrum of Rindler particles observed by an accelerated observer. Beyond providing a representation-theoretic basis for vacuum thermal effects, our results suggest that analogous phenomena may arise in any quantum system admitting realizations of translation and dilation eigenstates.</description>

      <title>Resurgence in the two-field scalar and spinor Quantum Electrodynamics Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first systematic resurgent analysis of the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian in spinor and scalar quantum electrodynamics for the most general constant background field configuration. In contrast to the extensively studied single-field cases, the two-field case exhibits unique asymptotic structures, leading to a substantially richer pattern of singularities in the Borel plane. Explicit large-order asymptotic formulas for the weak-field coefficients in both spinor and scalar quantum electrodynamics are derived. These reveal a nontrivial interplay between alternating and non-alternating factorial growth, governed by distinct structures associated with electric and magnetic contributions, and smoothly interpolating between the known single-field limits. Using Borel dispersion techniques, we demonstrate that the complete instanton structure underlying Schwinger pair production in two-field backgrounds is encoded in the divergent perturbative coefficients. We then construct resurgent approximants using Pad\'{e}-Borel and Pad\'{e}-Conformal-Borel resummation schemes adapted to the two-field case. For the spinor case, conformal improvement results in a significant enhancement in reconstructing both the real and imaginary parts of the effective Lagrangian across a wide range of field ratios, accurately capturing the subtle sign-changing features in the strong-field regime while in the scalar case, it yields minor improvement. Detailed comparisons with exact special-function representations demonstrate the reliability of reconstructions from a modest number of weak-field coefficients. This work establishes a natural completion of the resurgence programme for constant electromagnetic backgrounds, providing a robust analytic framework for exploring nonperturbative physics and strong-field phenomena in spinor and scalar quantum electrodynamics, from finite perturbative data.</description>

      <title>Twisted de Rham theory for string double copy in AdS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is motivated by the recent evidence for a double-copy relationship between open- and closed-string amplitudes in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. At present, the evidence has the form of a double-copy relation for string-amplitude building blocks, which are combined using the multiple-polylogarithm (MPL) generating functions. These generate MPLs relevant for all-order AdS curvature corrections of four-point string amplitudes. In this paper, we prove this building-block double copy using a new, noncommutative version of twisted de Rham theory. In flat space, the usual twisted de Rham theory is already known to be a natural framework to describe the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) double-copy map from open- to closed-string amplitudes, in which the KLT kernel can be computed from the intersections of the open-string amplitude integration contours. We formulate twisted de Rham theory for noncommutative-ring-valued differential forms on complex manifolds and use it to derive the intersection number of two open-string contours, which are closed in the noncommutative twisted homology sense. The inverse of this intersection number is precisely the AdS double-copy kernel for the four-point open- and closed-string generating functions.</description>

      <title>S-Duality for Non-Abelian Monopoles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory with gauge group $G$ spontaneously broken to a subgroup $H$, S-duality requires that the BPS monopole spectrum organizes into the same representation as W-bosons in the dual theory, where $G^{\vee}$ is broken to $H^{\vee}$. The expectation has been extensively verified in the maximally broken phase $G\to U(1)^r$. Here we address the non-Abelian regime in which $H$ contains a semisimple factor $H^{s}$. Using the stratified description of monopole moduli space, we give a general proof of this matching for any simple gauge group $G$. Each BPS monopole state is naturally labeled by a weight of the relevant $W$-boson representation of $(H^{\vee})^{s}$. We construct non-Abelian magnetic gauge transformation operators implementing the $(H^{\vee})^{s}$-action on the monopole Hilbert space, which commute with the electric $H^{s}$-transformations and thereby realize the $H^{s}\times (H^{\vee})^{s}$ symmetry at the level of monopole quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Spin-operator form factors of the critical Ising chain and their finite volume scaling limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00751v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a self-contained derivation of the spin-operator matrix elements in the fermionic basis, for the critical periodic Ising chain at a generic system length $N\in 2Z_{\ge 2}$. The approach relies on the near-Cauchy property of certain matrices formed by the Toeplitz symbols in the critical model, and leads to a few square-root products for the leg functions. The square root products allow simple integral representations, that further reduce to the Binet's second integral and its generalization by Hermite, in the finite volume scaling limit. This leads to product formulas for the spin operator matrix elements in the scaling limit, providing explicit expressions for the spin-operator form factors of the Ising CFT in the fermionic basis, that were computed iteratively in Yurov:1991my. They are all rational numbers up to $\sqrt{2}$. We also determine the normalization factor of the spin-operator and show explicitly how the coefficient $G(\frac{1}{2})G(\frac{3}{2})$ appear through a ground state overlap. Moreover, by expanding the spin-spin two point correlator in the fermionic basis, we observed a Fredholm determinant identity that allows to show the convergence of the rescaled two-point correlator to the CFT version on a cylinder.</description>

Abstract: Both the Wavefunction of the Universe and the Schwinger-Keldysh in-in formalism are central tools for analyzing primordial cosmological observables, such as equal-time correlation functions. While their conceptual equivalence is well established, a systematic and explicit map between their diagrammatic expansions has remained elusive. In this article, I construct such a map by analyzing the relation between the two frameworks at the diagrammatic level. I show that diagrams contributing to correlation functions in the Wavefunction of the Universe approach can be uniquely reorganized into Schwinger-Keldysh diagrams. This correspondence holds to all orders in perturbation theory, including arbitrary numbers of interaction vertices and loops.</description>

      <title>Causality Criteria for Island Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05620v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Island models offer a compelling resolution of the black hole information paradox, but they also raise persistent questions about causal consistency in effective descriptions. In particular, effective theories arising in double holography can exhibit apparent violations of micro-causality, despite the underlying bulk dynamics being local and causal. The aim of this work is to clarify the physical origin of this phenomenon and to identify the structural features that control causal consistency in island models.
  We argue that the apparent non-causality in double holography is neither intrinsic to island physics nor a consequence of nonlocal operator reconstruction. Rather, it reflects a mismatch between effective spacetime separation and bulk causal accessibility, a feature already implicit in earlier analyses. Nonlocal reconstruction instead encodes quantum error correction within a restricted code subspace and does not introduce independent propagation channels.
  Motivated by this perspective, we formulate a structural criterion for micro-causality in effective island descriptions. The criterion consists of three conditions: the absence of independent propagation channels beyond those of the bulk theory, a local bulk-supported operator dictionary, and a consistent matching between effective spacelike separation and dynamically accessible bulk causal curves. When these conditions are satisfied, effective micro-causality follows directly from bulk micro-causality. We apply the criterion to brane world realizations of island models, including the defect-extremal-surface construction, and show that they preserve causal consistency, in contrast to double holography. We further demonstrate that the criterion remains robust in time-dependent processes such as island formation and evaporation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unified Lorentzian replica-path-integral framework for computing entanglement entropy in fully time-dependent quantum field theories and gravitational systems. Building on this framework, we apply the real-time replica trick to cosmological spacetimes without spatial boundaries and relate it to existing proposals that identify effective dual QFT descriptions on screen-like surfaces inside the spacetime. We also extend the Lorentzian replica construction to intrinsic gravitational subsystems, focusing on Hawking radiation and including quantum corrections in purely gravitational settings lacking time-reflection symmetry. In both contexts, island-type replica saddles arise naturally. A brief review of the QFT and holographic cases is included to establish the common structure underlying these applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a non-compact GIT quotient of a vector space, in the presence of an abelian group action and an equivariant regular function (potential) on the quotient. We define virtual counts of quasimaps from prestable curves to the critical locus of the potential, and prove a gluing formula in the formalism of cohomological field theories.
  The main examples studied in this paper is when the above setting arises from quivers with potentials, where the above construction gives quantum correction to the equivariant Chow homology of the critical locus. Following similar ideas as in quasimaps to Nakajima quiver varieties studied by the Okounkov school, we analyse vertex functions in several examples, including Hilbert schemes of points on $\mathbb{C}^3$, moduli spaces of perverse coherent systems on the resolved conifold, and a quiver which defines higher $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-spin chains. Bethe equations are calculated in these cases.
  The construction in the present paper is based on the theory of gauged linear sigma models as well as shifted symplectic geometry of Pantev, To\"en, Vaquie and Vezzosi, and uses the virtual pullback formalism of symmetric obstruction theory of Park, which arises from the recent development of Donaldson-Thomas theory of Calabi-Yau 4-folds.</description>

Abstract: It is shown that the Kerr metric represents the nonlinear superposition of self-dual and anti-self-dual Taub-NUT instantons. This promotes the Newman-Janis algorithm to a rigorous derivation of the Kerr metric with a definite physical origin. In the same way, the Kerr-Newman and charged Kerr-Taub-NUT solutions are systems of Taub-NUT instantons and chiral dyons.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the action of a non-invertible symmetry on spins chains whose topological lines are labelled by representations of the four-dimensional Taft algebra. The main peculiarity of this symmetry is the existence of junctions between distinct indecomposable lines. Sacrificing Hermiticity, we construct several symmetric, frustration-free, gapped Hamiltonians with real spectra and analyse their ground state subspaces. Our study reveals two intriguing phenomena. First, we identify a smooth path of gapped symmetric Hamiltonians whose ground states transform inequivalently under the symmetry. Second, we find a model where a product state and the so-called W state spontaneously break the symmetry, and propose an explanation for the indistinguishability of these two states in the infinite-volume limit in terms of the symmetry category.</description>

      <title>The Signals of Doomsday I: False Higgs vacuum decay signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15848v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The measured standard model parameters indicate that we might live in a false Higgs vacuum, though with a very long lifetime. However, small black holes can serve as catalysers and significantly speed up the phase transition. In fact, bubbles of true vacuum might already exist in our universe. If the propagation of the bubble walls slows down due to interaction with the surrounding matter and plasma, these signals can reach us before the bubble wall hits us. Using the vacuum mismatch method, we calculate the spectrum of the Higgs particles produced by such a bubble until the terminal velocity is reached. In addition, we show that frictional dissipation at the terminal wall velocity generates a large population of thermally produced Higgs particles, which continues even after the mismatch channel shuts off. Since the Higgs is neutral, a good part of the final decay products (after hadronization, annihilation and decay of unstable particles) will be photons and neutrinos, which will then act as a long-range signature. For the conservative set of parameters used here, the thermal channel produces a macroscopically large burst of high energy neutrinos and photons from Higgs decays, which could be detectable from sufficiently nearby bubbles with current or upcoming multi messenger facilities.</description>

      <title>Canonical torus action on symplectic singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15791v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any symplectic singularity lying on a smoothable projective symplectic variety locally admits a good action of an algebraic torus of dimension $r \geq 1$, which is canonical. Under mild assumptions, $r=1$ is also confirmed. In particular, it admits (canonical) good $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. This proves Kaledin's conjecture conditionally but in a substantially stronger form. Our key idea is to use Donaldson-Sun theory on local Kahler metrics in complex differential geometry to connect with the theory of Poisson deformations of symplectic varieties.
  For general symplectic singularities, we prove the same assertion -- namely, the existence of a canonical (local) torus action -- assuming that the Donaldson-Sun theory extends to such singularities along with suitable singular (hyper)Kahler metrics. Conversely, our results can be also used to study local behaviour of such metrics around the germ. For instance, we show that such singular hyperKahler metric around isolated singularity is close to a metric cone in a polynomial order, and satisfies $r=1$ i.e., has a good canonical (local) $\mathbb{C}^*$-action, as the complexification of the cone metric rescaling. Our theory also fits well to singularities on many hyperKahler reductions.</description>

      <title>Deflection angle in the strong deflection limit for static and axisymmetric spacetimes: Local curvature, matter fields, and quasinormal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07906v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the deflection of photons in the strong deflection limit within static and axisymmetric spacetimes possessing reflection symmetry. As the impact parameter approaches its critical value, the deflection angle exhibits a logarithmic divergence. This divergence is characterized by a logarithmic coefficient and a constant offset, which we express in terms of the coordinate-invariant curvature quantities evaluated at the unstable circular photon orbit. The curvature contribution is encoded in the electric part of the Weyl tensor, reflecting tidal effects, and the matter contribution is encoded in the Einstein tensor, capturing the influence of local energy and pressure. We also express these coefficients using the Newman--Penrose scalars. By exploiting the relationship between the strong deflection limit and the quasinormal modes, we derive a new expression for the quasinormal mode frequency in the eikonal limit in terms of the curvature scalars. Our results provide a unified and coordinate-invariant framework that connects observable lensing features and quasinormal modes to the local geometry and matter distribution near compact objects.</description>

      <title>Lattice models with subsystem/weak non-invertible symmetry-protected topological order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of lattice models which possess subsystem non-invertible symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order and analyze their interface modes protected by the symmetry, whose codimension turns out to be more than one. We also propose 2+1d lattice models which belong to two different weak SPT phases distinguished by a combination of translational symmetry and non-invertible symmetry. We show that the interface between them exhibits an exotic Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomaly associated with a modulated symmetry, which cannot be factorized into a direct product of internal and translational symmetries.</description>

      <title>Emergence of cosmic structure from Planckian discreteness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the standard inflationary paradigm the inhomogeneities observed in the CMB arise from quantum fluctuations of an initially homogeneous and isotropic vacuum state. This picture suffers from two well-known weaknesses. First, it assumes that quantum field theory remains valid at trans-Planckian scales, without modifications from quantum gravity. Second, it necessitates a quantum-to-classical transition in which fluctuations of a homogeneous quantum state become the classical inhomogeneities seen in the CMB. Recently, an alternative paradigm has been proposed in which such inhomogeneities are present from the very beginning, emerging from the assumed discreteness of spacetime at the Planck scale predicted by certain approaches to quantum gravity. Within this framework, scale-invariant scalar perturbations are generated naturally, without relying on trans-Planckian assumptions or invoking a quantum-to-classical transition. Specifically, inhomogeneities in the quantum state at the Planck scale propagate into semiclassical inhomogeneities on CMB scales. Here, we extend the aforementioned proposal to the most realistic case of a quasi-de Sitter expansion; in particular, we compute the scalar perturbation spectrum as a function of the slow-roll parameters, systematically encoded through the Hubble flow functions.</description>

      <title>Emergent Symmetry and Phase Transitions on the Domain Wall of $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Topological Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The one-dimensional (1D) domain wall of 2D $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological orders is studied theoretically. The Ising domain wall model is shown to have an emergent SU(2)$_{1}$ conformal symmetry because of a hidden nonsymmorphic octahedral symmetry. While a weak magnetic field is an irrelevant perturbation to the bulk topological orders, it induces a domain wall transition from the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid to a ferromagnetic order, which spontaneously breaks the anomalous $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ symmetry and the time-reversal symmetry on the domain wall. Moreover, the gapless domain wall state also realizes a 1D topological quantum critical point between a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{T}$-symmetry-protected topological phase and a trivial phase, thus demonstrating the holographic construction of topological transitions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Bootstrap Approach to a Non-Relativistic Potential for Quarkonium systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum bootstrap method is applied to determine the bound-state spectrum of Quarkonium systems using a non-relativistic potential approximation. The method translates the Schr\"odinger equation into a set of algebraic recursion relations for radial moments $\langle r^m \rangle$, which are constrained by the positive semidefiniteness of their corresponding Hankel matrices. The numerical implementation is first validated by calculating the $1S$ and $1P$ mass centroids for both charmonium ($c\bar{c}$) and bottomonium ($b\bar{b}$) systems, finding deviations of less than 0.5\% from experimental data from the Particle Data Group (PDG). This analysis is then extended to the hypothetical toponium ($t\bar{t}$) system, predicting a $1S$ ground state mass of $M \approx 344.3 \text{ GeV}$. This theoretical mass is in agreement with the energy of the recently observed resonance-like enhancement in the $t\bar{t}$ cross-section by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations. This result provides theoretical support for the interpretation of this experimental phenomenon as the formation of a quasi-bound toponium state and highlights the predictive power of the non-relativistic potential approach for systems of two massive quarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals potentials describing interactions between color-singlet mesons and/or baryons vanish at leading order in potential nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics (pNRQCD). This result and constraints from Gauss's law are used to prove that weakly-coupled pNRQCD van der Waals potentials in generic non-Abelian gauge theories with only heavy quarks are too weak to form bound states whose color state is a product of color-singlets. Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of four, five, and six quarks with equal masses provide numerical evidence that exotic color configurations are higher energy than products of color-singlet hadrons, suggesting that equal-mass fully-heavy tetraquark, pentaquark, and hexaquark bound states do not exist at next-to-leading order in pNRQCD and at all orders in QCD-like theories in which all quark masses are asymptotically large. Mechanisms for generating hadron-hadron bound states are identified, which necessarily involve large quark-mass hierarchies, relativistic effects arising from the presence of sufficiently light quarks, or nonperturbative effects outside the scope of weakly-coupled pNRQCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05087v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we use the weak cosmic censorship conjecture(WCC) to constrain black hole solutions in modified gravity theories. While Wald showed that extremal Kerr-Newman black holes in general relativity cannot be overcharged by test charged particles, this protection may fail in theories beyond general relativity. We have considered generic rotating black hole solutions beyond the Kerr-Newman family and examined particle absorption processes that could lead to overcharging and the emergence of naked singularities. Identifying regions of parameter space where WCC is violated allows us to place direct, physically motivated bounds on deviations from general relativity.</description>

      <title>Charged particle dynamics in singular spacetimes: hydrogenic mapping and curvature-corrected thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of charged test particles in a singular, horizonless spacetime arising as the massless limit of a charged wormhole in the Einstein--Maxwell--Scalar (EMS) framework. The geometry, sustained solely by an electric charge $Q$, features an infinite sequence of curvature singularity shells, with the outermost at \( r_* = \frac{2|Q|}{\pi} \) acting as a hard boundary for nonradial motion, while radial trajectories can access it depending on the particle charge-to-mass ratio \( |q|/m \). Exploiting exact first integrals, we construct the effective potential and obtain circular orbit radii, radial epicyclic frequencies, and azimuthal precession rates. In the weak-field limit (\( r \gg |Q| \)), the motion reduces to a Coulombic system with small curvature-induced retrograde precession. At large radii, the dynamics maps to a hydrogenic system, with curvature corrections inducing perturbative energy shifts. Approaching \( r_* \), the potential diverges, producing hard-wall confinement. Curvature corrections also modify the spectral thermodynamics, raising energies and slightly altering entropy and heat capacity. Our results characterize the transition from Newtonian-like orbits to strongly confined, curvature-dominated dynamics.</description>

      <title>There and Back Again: A Gauging Nexus between Topological and Fracton Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coupled layer constructions are a valuable tool for capturing the universal properties of certain interacting quantum phases of matter in terms of the simpler data that characterizes the underlying layers. In the study of fracton phases, the X-Cube model in 3+1D can be realized via such a construction by starting with a stack of 2+1D Toric Codes and turning on a coupling which condenses a composite "particle-string" object. In a recent work [Phys. Rev. B 112, 125124 (2025)], we have demonstrated that in fact, the particle-string can be viewed as a symmetry defect of a topological 1-form symmetry. In this paper, we study the result of gauging this symmetry in depth. We unveil a rich gauging web relating the X-Cube model to symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases protected by a mix of subsystem and higher-form symmetries, subsystem symmetry fractionalization in the 3+1D Toric Code, and non-trivial extensions of topological symmetries by subsystem symmetries. Our work emphasizes the importance of topological symmetries in non-topological, geometric phases of matter.</description>

      <title>High Reheating Temperature without Axion Domain Walls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a cosmological scenario in which the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry remains broken in the entire history of the Universe, thereby avoiding the formation of axion strings and domain walls. Contrary to the conventional expectation, it is demonstrated that appropriately chosen scalar interactions are able to keep the PQ symmetry broken at arbitrarily high temperatures. We carefully examine the finite-temperature effective potential in a model with two PQ breaking scalar fields. The existence of flat directions plays a vital role in suppressing axion isocurvature perturbations during inflation by stabilizing a PQ field at a large field value. The viable parameter space consistent with theoretical and observational constraints is identified. Our scenario provides a minimal path for PQ symmetry breaking that addresses both the axion domain wall and isocurvature problems while permitting arbitrarily high reheating temperatures accommodating high-scale baryogenesis scenarios such as thermal leptogenesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An interaction between ferromagnetic and superconducting orders, to be realized in a two dimensional ferromagnetic superconductor, is proposed obeying necessary symmetry principles. This interaction allows us to formulate a duality, similar to the Boson-vortex duality in 2+1 dimensional superfluid. In the dual theory the Skyrmion and the vortex excitations interact with each other via an emergent gauge field. The static interaction potential is attractive for a Skyrmion and a vortex with opposite topological charges. This interaction can lead to formation of bound pairs of the mentioned topological excitations. Furthermore, we argue that such pairing implies that a Magnus force acting on the vortex induces a transverse, Hall-like drift motion of the Skyrmion, which we term the vortex-drag induced Skyrmion Hall effect. Possible experimental manifestations of this effect are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Finite Distance Corrections to Vacuum Birefringence in Strong Gravitational and Electromagnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study polarization dependent photon propagation in static, spherically symmetric spacetimes permeated by strong magnetic fields, with the aim of quantifying how finite emission and detection radii modify vacuum birefringence signals. Working in the geometric optics limit of NLED, we formulate the two polarization modes as null geodesics of distinct effective (optical) metrics. We then develop a controlled weak-coupling expansion that cleanly separates the standard gravitational deflection from the birefringent contribution induced by the electromagnetic nonlinearity. Using a finite distance Gauss-Bonnet construction on the associated optical manifolds, we derive a general expression for the differential bending angle in which the source and observer are kept at arbitrary radii, thereby extending the usual scattering-at-infinity treatment. As benchmark applications, we specialize our results to the Euler-Heisenberg effective action of quantum electrodynamics (QED) and to Born-Infeld electrodynamics. We find that the observable birefringence is generically reduced by finite-distance truncation of the curvature flux, and we provide explicit correction series suitable for data analysis. For magnetar-motivated dipole-like falloff, the same geometric truncation can reduce the predicted polarization-dependent deflection at the order-tens-of-percent level for surface/near-surface emission; in a simple one-sided (outward-only) benchmark the suppression can approach 1/2 for near-limb rays. Since realistic dipole magnetospheres are axisymmetric rather than spherically symmetric, we present this as an illustrative scaling estimate and leave a fully axisymmetric treatment to future work. Our results furnish a necessary finite-distance calibration for interpreting current and future X-ray polarimetry measurements and for placing unbiased constraints on strong-field QED and broader NLED parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for exact solutions describing asymptotically FLRW compact objects in General Relativity (GR) remains a notoriously challenging problem. To a large extent, progress has been restricted to the spherically symmetric sector, with the exception of the Kerr-de Sitter and Thakhurta solutions. In this work, we present two new results that advance the description of axisymmetric compact objects embedded in a cosmological background. We first introduce a new solution-generating technique allowing one to construct non-stationary and axisymmetric solutions of the self-interacting Einstein-Scalar system. Using this method, we present the first exact solution which describes a dynamical axisymmetric black (or white) hole embedded in an expanding or contracting cosmology. We provide a detailed investigation of its properties, and in particular its dynamical trapping (or anti-trapping) horizons. To that end, we use the mean curvature vector (MCV) which stands as a natural generalization of the Kodama vector beyond spherical symmetry. The norm of this vector provides a foliation-independent quantity to locate the trapped/anti-trapped and untrapped regions and characterize the causal nature of a given geometry without specific symmetry requirement. The solution-generating method and the techniques to analyze the new solutions provide new powerful tools to further explore the description and the phenomenology of dynamical compact objects embedded in cosmology, in particular those of primordial black holes.</description>

Abstract: Tensor networks provide a powerful new framework for classifying and simulating correlated and topological phases of quantum matter. Their central premise is that strongly correlated matter can only be understood by studying the underlying entanglement structure and its associated (generalised) symmetries. In essence, tensor networks provide a compressed, holographic description of the complicated vacuum fluctuations in strongly correlated systems, and as such they break down the infamous many-body exponential wall. These lecture notes provide a concise overview of the most important conceptual, computational and mathematical aspects of this theory.</description>

      <title>Continuum-Field-Theoretical Construction of Conserved Currents, Non-Invertible Symmetries, and Mixed Anomalies in (3+1)D Non-Abelian Topological Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate generalized symmetries, with particular emphasis on non-invertible ones, in three-dimensional non-Abelian topological orders hosting both particle- and loop-like excitations. We adopt a continuum topological field theory description, focusing on twisted $BF$ theories with gauge group $G=\prod_i \mathbb{Z}_{N_i}$ and an $a \wedge a \wedge b$ twisted term. This field theory supports Borromean-Rings braiding and realizes non-Abelian topological order, which for $G=(\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$ admits a microscopic realization via the $\mathbb{D}_4$ Kitaev quantum double lattice model. We systematically identify all generalized symmetry operators by extracting conserved currents from the equations of motion. Two distinct classes of currents emerge: type-I currents, which generate invertible higher-form symmetries, and type-II currents, which give rise to non-invertible higher-form symmetries. The non-invertibility originates from projectors accompanying the symmetry operators, which restrict admissible gauge-field configurations. We further analyze the fusion rules of these symmetries, showing that invertible symmetries admit inverses, while non-invertible symmetries fuse through multiple channels. Finally, we study mixed anomalies among these generalized symmetries by simultaneously coupling multiple currents to proper types of background gauge fields and examining their gaugeability. We identify two types of mixed anomalies: one cancellable by topological field theories in one higher dimension, and another representing an intrinsic gauging obstruction encoded in the $(3+1)$D continuum topological field theory.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Hilbert polynomial of a Calabi-Yau hypersurface $Z$ in a smooth toric variety $M$ associated to a convex polytope $\Delta$ is given by a lattice point count in the polytope boundary $\partial \Delta,$ just as the Hilbert polynomial of $M$ is known to be given by a lattice point count in the convex polytope $\Delta.$ Our main tool is a computation of the Euler class in $K$-theory of the normal line bundle to the hypersurface $Z,$ in terms of the Euler classes of the divisors corresponding to the facets of the moment polytope. We observe a remarkable parallel between our expression for the Euler class and the inclusion-exclusion principle in combinatorics. To obtain our result we combine these facts with the known relation between lattice point counts in the facets of $\Delta$ and the Hilbert polynomials of the smooth toric varieties corresponding to these facets.</description>

      <title>Local Scale Invariance in Quantum Theory: A Non-Hermitian Pilot-Wave Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Weyl's abandoned idea of local scale invariance has a natural realization at the quantum level in pilot-wave (deBroglie-Bohm) theory. We obtain the Weyl covariant derivative by complexifying the electromagnetic gauge coupling parameter. The resultant non-hermiticity has a natural interpretation in terms of local scale invariance in pilot-wave theory. The conserved current density is modified from $|\psi|^2$ to the local scale invariant, trajectory-dependent ratio $|\psi|^2/ \mathbf{1}^2[\mathcal{C}]$, where $\mathbf 1[\mathcal C]$ is a scale factor that depends on the pilot-wave trajectory $\mathcal C$ in configuration space. Our approach is general, and we implement it for the Schr\"odinger, Pauli, and Dirac equations coupled to an external electromagnetic field. We also implement it in quantum field theory for the case of a quantized axion field interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field. We discuss the equilibrium probability density and show that the corresponding trajectories are unique.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Primordial Black Hole Abundance with Space-Based Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Overdense regions can collapse into primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early universe, which are a compelling candidate for dark matter. Current constraints leave the asteroid-mass window the only possible one for PBH to account for all the dark matter, which can only be probed indirectly by the scalar-induced gravitational waves (GWs) sourced by the curvature perturbation which forms PBH. In this work, we explore the capabilities of future space-based gravitational wave detectors, including LISA, Taiji, and TianQin, to constrain such induced GWs as well as the PBH abundance. We systematically account for the width of the primordial curvature power spectrum, and find that the asteroid-mass window can be fully probed by all three space-based interferometers. If PBHs constitute the majority of dark matter, the induced GW leaves a strong signal in the mHz band with a signal-to-noise ratio of $10^3$--$10^4$.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet Behavior of the Wheeler-DeWitt Equation in Horava-Lifshitz Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08222v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum structure of black hole interiors in Horava-Lifshitz gravity by analyzing the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in minisuperspace. Focusing on the ultraviolet regime, where higher-order spatial curvature terms dominate, we derive analytical solutions in this UV limit for both the original Horava-Lifshitz action and its analytically continued counterpart. We study their behavior near the event horizon and the classical singularity, with particular attention to the interpretation of the wave function in terms of the annihilation-to-nothing scenario proposed in general relativity. In this paper, we have considered cases in which the two-dimensional spatial section is spherical, planar, or hyperbolic, as well as models with positive, negative, or vanishing cosmological constant. In all cases, we find that the terms dominating in the ultraviolet regime, together with the effects of the running scaling parameter, act to suppress the annihilation-to-nothing behavior. These results suggest that, at least within the range explored in this study, the characteristic annihilation-to-nothing behavior does not appear in the ultraviolet regime of Horava-Lifshitz gravity, and provide a new perspective on the understanding of singularity resolution in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>QCD phase-transition under the light of Thermofractal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deconfining transition in $SU(3)$ gauge theory, traditionally interpreted through the Gross-Witten-Wadia (GWW) model as a sharp third-order phase transition in the large-$N_c$ limit, appears as a smooth crossover in lattice QCD. This work demonstrates that the transition is topologically smoothed into a crossover by incorporating the fractal momentum space structure inherent to thermofractals. By matching the non-extensive $\beta$-function to one-loop QCD results, a fundamental scaling of the thermofractal index $q$ is derived as a function of the number of flavours $N_f$. It is proven that applying a $q$-deformed derivative operator $\mathcal{D}_q$ to the $q$-logarithm of the eigenvalue distance results in a non-extensive measure that effectively smears the topological stiffness of the gauge vacuum. A unified master equation for the Polyakov loop $\langle L \rangle$ is presented, governed by the thermofractal index $q$ and a single variance parameter $\sigma^2(T)$ that scales as $T^{1/(q-1)}$. The observed phase dynamics are shown to be asymptotic limits of this unified density: a ``soft'' algebraic growth $\langle L \rangle \propto T^{11}$ in the 1D string-like confined regime for $N_f=0$, and a rapid $1 - \langle L \rangle \propto T^{-21}$ suppression in the 3D deconfined volume for $N_f=3$. This approach provides a microscopic foundation for partial deconfinement theory and reproduces lattice QCD data with a reduced $\chi^2 \approx 1.12$, offering a rigorous reconciliation between matrix model topology and the continuous QCD crossover.</description>

      <title>Effects of spontaneous Lorentz Symmetry breaking on Letelier-AdS charged black holes within Kalb-Ramond gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the geodesic motion of massless particles -- specifically photons -- in the spacetime of a charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole (BH) surrounded by a cloud of strings (CoS) within the framework of Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity. We analyze the effective potential that governs photon trajectories, explore the properties and location of the photon sphere (PS), and examine the effective radial force acting on photons. The resulting BH shadow is also studied, highlighting the roles of both the CoS parameter $\alpha$ and the KR field parameter $\ell$ in shaping its geometry. We constrain these parameters using observational data from M87* and Sgr A* obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Furthermore, we extend our investigation to the motion of neutral test particles in the same gravitational background. By examining the impact of the CoS and KR field, we show how these additional fields modify the dynamics relative to standard charged BH scenarios. Finally, we study the fundamental frequencies associated with quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) of test particles, demonstrating how these frequencies are affected by the presence of the CoS and KR field. Our results reveal the rich structure of AdS-BH spacetimes influenced by string clouds and antisymmetric tensor fields, with potential observational consequences in gravitational wave and BH imaging astronomy.</description>
