      <title>BotHash: Efficient and Training-Free Bot Detection Through Approximate Nearest Neighbor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online Social Networks (OSNs) are a cornerstone in modern society, serving as platforms for diverse content consumption by millions of users each day. However, the challenge of ensuring the accuracy of information shared on these platforms remains significant, especially with the widespread dissemination of disinformation. Social bots -- automated accounts designed to mimic human behavior, frequently spreading misinformation -- represent one of the critical problems of OSNs. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has further complicated bot behaviors, making detection increasingly difficult. This paper presents BotHash, an innovative, training-free approach to social bot detection. BotHash leverages a simplified user representation that enables approximate nearest-neighbor search to detect bots, avoiding the complexities of Deep-Learning model training and large dataset creation. We demonstrate that BotHash effectively differentiates between human and bot accounts, even when state-of-the-art LLMs are employed to generate posts' content. BotHash offers several advantages over existing methods, including its independence from a training phase, robust performance with minimal ground-truth data, and early detection capabilities, showing promising results across various datasets.</description>

      <title>Emotion-Aware Design: Modulating Valence, Arousal, and Dominance in Communication via Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16038v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an era of emotionally saturated digital media and information overload, effective communication demands more than clarity and accuracy-it requires emotional awareness. This review introduces the paradigm of emotion-aware design, a framework grounded in the valence-arousal-dominance (VAD) model of affect, which systematically examines how emotional modulation shapes comprehension, memory, and behavior. Drawing on insights from psychology, neuroscience, communication, and design, we show that emotional responses significantly influence how information is perceived, retained, and shared. We further propose a multimodal design space-encompassing text, visuals, audio, and interaction-that enables strategic regulation of emotional dimensions to enhance communication efficacy. By linking emotional dynamics to cognitive outcomes and practical design strategies, this review offers both a conceptual foundation and an applied roadmap for designing emotionally resonant communication across domains such as education, health, media, and public discourse.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Precinct and District Voting Data Using Persistent Homology to Identify Gerrymandering in North Carolina</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an extension of Feng and Porter's 2019 paper on the use of the level-set method for the construction of a filtered simplicial complex from geospatial election data. Precincts are regarded to be too small to be gerrymandered, allowing us to identify discrepancies between precinct and district level voting data to quantify gerrymandering in the United States. Comparing the persistent homologies of Democratic voting areas on the precinct and district level shows when areas have been 'cracked' or 'packed' for partisan gain. This analysis was done for North Carolina House of Representatives elections (2012 to 2024). North Carolina has been redistricted 4 times in the past 10 years, whereas most states redistrict decennially, allowing us to understand how and when redistricted maps deviate from precinct-level voting data, and when gerrymandering occurs. Comparing persistence barcodes at the precinct and district levels (using the bottleneck distance) shows that precinct-level voting patterns do not significantly fluctuate biannually, while district level patterns do, suggesting that shifts are likely a result of redistricting rather than voter behavior, providing strong evidence of gerrymandering. North Carolina election data was collected from the public domain. Composite shapefiles were created using QGIS and R, and rasterized using Python. The level-set method was employed to generate filtered simplicial complexes. Persistence barcodes were produced using GUDHI and PHAT libraries. Additionally, we compare our results with traditional measures such as Polsby-Popper and Reock scores (gerrymandering identification measures). This research presents a novel application of topological data analysis in evaluating gerrymandering.</description>

      <title>Block-corrected Modularity for Community Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unknown node attributes in complex networks may introduce community structures that are important to distinguish from those driven by known attributes. We propose a block-corrected modularity that discounts given block structures present in the network to reveal communities masked by them. We show analytically how the proposed modularity finds the community structure driven by an unknown attribute in a simple network model. Further, we observe that the block-corrected modularity finds the underlying community structure on a number of simple synthetic network models while methods using different null models fail. We develop an efficient spectral method as well as two Louvain-inspired fine-tuning algorithms to maximize the proposed modularity and demonstrate their performance on several synthetic network models. Finally, we assess our methodology on various real-world citation networks built using the OpenAlex data by correcting for the temporal citation patterns.</description>

      <title>Forgetful by Design? A Critical Audit of YouTube's Search API for Academic Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper critically audits the search endpoint of YouTube's Data API (v3), a common tool for academic research. Through systematic weekly searches over six months using eleven queries, we identify major limitations regarding completeness, representativeness, consistency, and bias. Our findings reveal substantial differences between ranking parameters like relevance and date in terms of video recall and precision, with relevance often retrieving numerous off-topic videos. We also find severe temporal decay, as the number of findable videos for a specific period dramatically decreases after just 20-60 days from the publication date, potentially hampering many different research designs. Furthermore, search results lack consistency, with identical queries yielding different video sets over time, compromising replicability. A case study on the European Parliament elections highlights how these issues impact research outcomes. While the paper offers several mitigation strategies, it concludes that the API's search function, potentially prioritizing "freshness" over comprehensive retrieval, is not adequate for robust academic research, especially concerning Digital Services Act requirements.</description>
