      <title>TopoBind: Multi-Modal Prediction of Antibody-Antigen Binding Free Energy via Sequence Embeddings and Structural Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the binding free energy between antibodies and antigens is a key challenge in structure-aware biomolecular modeling, with direct implications for antibody design. Most existing methods either rely solely on sequence embeddings or struggle to capture complex structural relationships, thus limiting predictive performance. In this work, we present a novel framework that integrates sequence-based representations from pre-trained protein language models (ESM-2) with a set of topological features. Specifically, we extract contact map metrics reflecting residue-level connectivity, interface geometry descriptors characterizing cross-chain interactions, distance map statistics quantifying spatial organization, and persistent homology invariants that systematically capture the emergence and persistence of multi-scale topological structures - such as connected components, cycles, and cavities - within individual proteins and across the antibody-antigen interface. By leveraging a cross-attention mechanism to fuse these diverse modalities, our model effectively encodes both global and local structural organization, thereby substantially enhancing the prediction of binding free energy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms sequence-only and conventional structural models, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in binding free energy prediction.</description>

      <title>Modal Geometry Governs Proteoform Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central mystery is how a specific proteoform, a distinct molecular variant of a protein, dynamically shapes its own future by evolving into new modes that exist only in potential until realised. Here, Modal Geometric Field (MGF) Theory couples real and abstract proteoform transitions through four axioms. Axioms one-three (invariant) dictate that only first-order transitions occur on the discrete, volume invariant, non symplectic modal manifold. Axiom four (mutable) functorially projects the general relativity derived curvature of an instantiated proteoform into this modal manifold, coupling what is real to what is abstract. Curvature, conserved per a discrete Noether theorem, actively shapes proteoform dynamics. Because curvature distribution renders activation energy relative, curvature-derived barriers are mutable, in direct analogy to general relativity. Entropy then emerges inevitably from curvature transport. This unification of energy, entropy, and curvature yields hysteresis, path dependence, fractal self similarity, and trajectories that oscillate between order and chaos. As a scale invariant and universal framework, MGF Theory reveals how modal geometry governs proteoform dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Layered Framework for Modeling Human Biology: From Basic AI Agents to a Full-Body AI Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We envision the Full-Body AI Agent as a comprehensive AI system designed to simulate, analyze, and optimize the dynamic processes of the human body across multiple biological levels. By integrating computational models, machine learning tools, and experimental platforms, this system aims to replicate and predict both physiological and pathological processes, ranging from molecules and cells to tissues, organs, and entire body systems. Central to the Full-Body AI Agent is its emphasis on integration and coordination across these biological levels, enabling analysis of how molecular changes influence cellular behaviors, tissue responses, organ function, and systemic outcomes. With a focus on biological functionality, the system is designed to advance the understanding of disease mechanisms, support the development of therapeutic interventions, and enhance personalized medicine. We propose two specialized implementations to demonstrate the utility of this framework: (1) the metastasis AI Agent, a multi-scale metastasis scoring system that characterizes tumor progression across the initiation, dissemination, and colonization phases by integrating molecular, cellular, and systemic signals; and (2) the drug AI Agent, a system-level drug development paradigm in which a drug AI-Agent dynamically guides preclinical evaluations, including organoids and chip-based models, by providing full-body physiological constraints. This approach enables the predictive modeling of long-term efficacy and toxicity beyond what localized models alone can achieve. These two agents illustrate the potential of Full-Body AI Agent to address complex biomedical challenges through multi-level integration and cross-scale reasoning.</description>

      <title>Single-molecule biophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological molecules, like all active matter, use free energy to generate force and motion which drive them out of thermal equilibrium, and undergo inherent dynamic interconversion between metastable free energy states separated by levels barely higher than stochastic thermal energy fluctuations. Here, we explore the founding and emerging approaches of the field of single-molecule biophysics which, unlike traditional ensemble average approaches, enable the detection and manipulation of individual molecules and facilitate exploration of biomolecular heterogeneity and its impact on transitional molecular kinetics and underpinning molecular interactions. We discuss the ground-breaking technological innovations which scratch far beyond the surface into open questions of real physiology, that correlate orthogonal data types and interplay empirical measurement with theoretical and computational insights, many of which are enabling artificial matter to be designed inspired by biological systems. And finally, we examine how these insights are helping to develop new physics framed around biology.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Multi-Task Learning with Solvent-Aware Augmentation for Drug Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand interactions is essential for computer-aided drug discovery. However, existing methods often fail to capture solvent-dependent conformational changes and lack the ability to jointly learn multiple related tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce a pre-training method that incorporates ligand conformational ensembles generated under diverse solvent conditions as augmented input. This design enables the model to learn both structural flexibility and environmental context in a unified manner. The training process integrates molecular reconstruction to capture local geometry, interatomic distance prediction to model spatial relationships, and contrastive learning to build solvent-invariant molecular representations. Together, these components lead to significant improvements, including a 3.7% gain in binding affinity prediction, an 82% success rate on the PoseBusters Astex docking benchmarks, and an area under the curve of 97.1% in virtual screening. The framework supports solvent-aware, multi-task modeling and produces consistent results across benchmarks. A case study further demonstrates sub-angstrom docking accuracy with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.157 angstroms, offering atomic-level insight into binding mechanisms and advancing structure-based drug design.</description>

      <title>FraGNNet: A Deep Probabilistic Model for Tandem Mass Spectrum Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compound identification from tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data is a critical step in the analysis of complex mixtures. Typical solutions for the MS/MS spectrum to compound (MS2C) problem involve comparing the unknown spectrum against a library of known spectrum-molecule pairs, an approach that is limited by incomplete library coverage. Compound to MS/MS spectrum (C2MS) models can improve retrieval rates by augmenting real libraries with predicted MS/MS spectra. Unfortunately, many existing C2MS models suffer from problems with mass accuracy, generalization, or interpretability. We develop a new probabilistic method for C2MS prediction, FraGNNet, that can efficiently and accurately simulate MS/MS spectra with high mass accuracy. Our approach formulates the C2MS problem as learning a distribution over molecule fragments. FraGNNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of prediction error and surpasses existing C2MS models as a tool for retrieval-based MS2C.</description>
