      <title>Sloshing in vertical cylinders with circular walls: the effect of porous, radial baffles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavior of sloshing eigenvalues is studied for vertical cylindrical containers that have circular walls and constant (possibly infinite) depth. The effect of breaking the axial symmetry due to the presence of porous, radial baffles is analyzed. Examples of explicit solutions are constructed which demonstrate that at some frequencies the damping efficiency of these baffles is the same as that of the rigid ones having the same configuration.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Enhanced Interface Preservation in Lattice Boltzmann Multiphase Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an improved approach for preserving sharp interfaces in multiphase Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) simulations using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Interface diffusion is a common challenge in multiphase LBM, leading to reduced accuracy in simulating phenomena where interfacial dynamics are critical. We propose a coupled PINN-LBM framework that maintains interface sharpness while preserving the physical accuracy of the simulation. Our approach is validated through droplet simulations, with quantitative metrics measuring interface width, maximum gradient, phase separation, effective interface width, and interface energy. The enhanced visualization techniques employed in this work clearly demonstrate the superior performance of PINN-LBM over standard LBM for multiphase simulations, particularly in maintaining well-defined interfaces throughout the simulation. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the results, showcasing how the neural network integration effectively counteracts numerical diffusion, while maintaining physical consistency with the underlying fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Visual anemometry of natural vegetation from their leaf motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution, near-ground wind-speed data are critical for improving the accuracy of weather predictions and climate models,$^{1-3}$ supporting wildfire control efforts,$^{4-7}$ and ensuring the safe passage of airplanes during takeoff and landing maneouvers.$^{8,9}$ Quantitative wind speed anemometry generally employs on-site instrumentation for accurate single-position data or sophisticated remote techniques such as Doppler radar for quantitative field measurements. It is widely recognized that the wind-induced motion of vegetation depends in a complex manner on their structure and mechanical properties, obviating their use in quantitative anemometry.$^{10-14}$ We analyze measurements on a host of different vegetation showing that leaf motion can be decoupled from the leaf's branch and support structure, at low-to-moderate wind speed, $U_{wind}$. This wind speed range is characterized by a leaf Reynolds number, enabling the development of a remote, quantitative anemometry method based on the formula, $U_{wind}\approx740\sqrt{{\mu}U_{leaf}/{\rho}D}$, that relies only on the leaf size $D$, its measured fluctuating (RMS) speed $U_{leaf}$, the air viscosity $\mu$, and its mass density $\rho$. This formula is corroborated by a first-principles model and validated using a host of laboratory and field tests on diverse vegetation types, ranging from oak, olive, and magnolia trees through to camphor and bullgrass. The findings of this study open the door to a new paradigm in anemometry, using natural vegetation to enable remote and rapid quantitative field measurements at global locations with minimal cost.</description>

      <title>TURB-MHD: an open-access database of forced homogeneous magnetohydrodynamic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present TURB-MHD, a database formed by six datasets of three-dimensional incompressible homogeneous magnetohydrodynamic turbulence maintained by a large-scale random forcing with minimal injection of cross helicity. Five of them describe a stationary state including one characterised by a weak background magnetic field. The remaining dataset is non-stationary and is featured by a strong background magnetic field. The aim is to provide datasets that clearly exhibit the phenomenon of the total energy cascade from the large to the small scales generated by the large-scale energy injection and one showing a partial inverse kinetic energy cascade from the small to the large scales. This database offers the possibility to realize a wide variety of analyses of fully developed magnetohydrodynamic turbulence from the sub-grid scale filtering up to the validation of an a posteriori LES. TURB-MHD is available for download using the SMART-Turb portal http://smart-turb.roma2.infn.it.</description>

      <title>Modeling liquid-mediated interactions for close-to-substrate magnetic microparticle transport in dynamic magnetic field landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the on-chip motion of magnetic particles in a microfluidic environment is key to realizing magnetic particle-based Lab-on-a-chip systems for medical diagnostics. In this work, a simulation model is established to quantify the trajectory of a single particle moving close to a polymer surface in a quiescent liquid. The simulations include hydrodynamic, magnetostatic, and Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) interactions. They are applied to particle motion driven by a dynamically changing magnetic field landscape created by engineered parallel-stripe magnetic domains superposed by a homogeneous, time-varying external magnetic field. The simulation model is adapted to experiments in terms of fluid-particle interactions with the magnetic field landscape approximated by analytic equations under the assumption of surface charges. Varying simulation parameters, we especially clarify the impact of liquid-mediated DLVO interactions, which are essential for diagnostic applications, on the 3D trajectory of the particle. A comparison to experimental results validates our simulation approach.</description>

      <title>What it takes to break a liquid: analysis of the cavitation threshold in various media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavitation has historically been related to parameters measured at equilibrium, such as vapor pressure and surface tension. However, nucleation might occur when the liquid is metastable, especially for fast phenomena such as cavitation induced by high-frequency acoustic waves. This is one of the reasons for the large discrepancy between the experimental estimate of the cavitation threshold and the theory's predictions.
  Our investigation aims to identify nucleation thresholds in various substances characterized by different physical properties. The experiments were performed by initiating nucleation through ultrasound at 24 kHz. The cavitation onset was studied using a novel procedure based on high-speed imaging and acoustic measurements with a hydrophone. Combining these two techniques allowed us to define the exact instant cavitation occurred in the liquid medium. The bubble nucleation was framed at 200,000 fps with a spatial resolution in the order of micrometers. Such fine temporal and spatial resolutions allowed us to track the expansion of the cavitation bubble right after its onset. We tested five different substances and tracked the amplitude of the transducer oscillation to reconstruct the pressure field when cavitation occurs. This allows us to identify the liquid's acoustic cavitation threshold (tensile strength). The data collected confirmed that the vapor pressure is not a good indicator of the occurrence of cavitation for acoustic systems. Furthermore, all substances exhibit similar behavior despite their different physical properties. This might seem counterintuitive, but it sheds light on the nucleation mechanism that originates cavitation in a lab-scale acoustic system.</description>

      <title>On kinetic energy localization in fluid flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This works focuses on participation number -- a parameter that allows to quantitatively asses the level of kinetic energy localization. The author presents a clear way of deriving participation number in a continuous case without making any assumptions about the system, fluid or flow regime. Moreover, a method of computing participation number in discretized cases is discussed and verified against well known analytical solutions using three methods, in which one was used previously in research on fluid flow through porous media. A robust formula, that works for both uniform and nonuniform discretization grids is presented.</description>

      <title>Policy heterogeneity improves collective olfactory search in 3-D turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of policy heterogeneity in enhancing the olfactory search capabilities of cooperative agent swarms operating in complex, real-world turbulent environments. Using odor fields from direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations, we demonstrate that heterogeneous groups, with exploratory and exploitative agents, consistently outperform homogeneous swarms where the exploration-exploitation tradeoff is managed at the individual level. Our results reveal that policy diversity enables the group to reach the odor source more efficiently by mitigating the detrimental effects of spatial correlations in the signal. These findings provide new insights into collective search behavior in biological systems and offer promising strategies for the design of robust, bioinspired search algorithms in engineered systems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Compressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modulating the number of particles in a region is key to accurately capturing the nuances in compressible flows with Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). This paper details the implementation of a volume-based adaptive refinement and derefinement procedure, incorporating state-of-the-art features such as automatic local adaptivity and solution adaptivity. A shock-aware particle shifting procedure is introduced to regularize the particle distribution while preserving the integrity of shocks. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of shock-based solution adaptivity and shock-aware particle shifting in the literature. A wide variety of test problems, which involve flow in and around boundaries, are employed to highlight the utility of these adaptivity features in improving the results and in making simulations faster. For instance, the adaptive resolution procedure is shown to deliver an order of magnitude speedup. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptivity procedure in resolving existing issues like errors due to interaction with differently spaced ghost particles at boundaries, formation of spot-like structures due to particle clumping, and poorly resolved low-density regions. In essence, the adaptivity technique presented in this paper is positioned as a powerful tool for simulating compressible flows with enhanced accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Momentum and Heat Intercoupling in Reattaching Turbulent Boundary Layers Using Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic mode decomposition method is deployed to investigate the heat transfer mechanism in a compressible turbulent shear layer and shockwave. To this end, highly resolved Large Eddy Simulations are performed to explore the effect of wall thermal conditions on the behavior of a reattaching free shear layer interacting with an oblique shock in compressible turbulent flows. Various different wall temperature conditions, such as cold adiabatic and hot wall, are considered. Dynamic mode decomposition is used to isolate and study the structures generated by the shear layer exposed in the boundary layer. Results reveal that the shear layer flapping is the most energetic mode. The hot wall gains the highest amplitude for the flapping frequency, and the vortical motions are most intense in the vicinity of the reattachment point of the heated wall. The vortex shedding due to the large-scale motion of the shear layer is associated with the second energetic mode. The cold wall not only has a higher amplitude of the shedding mode, but it also has a lower frequency compared to the adiabatic and hot walls. This work sheds light on the underlying physics of the nonlinear intercoupling of momentum and heat, hence providing guidelines for designing control systems for high speed flight vehicles and mitigating aircraft fatigue loading caused by intense wall pressure fluctuations and heat flux.</description>

      <title>Advances in Prebiotic Chemistry: the potential of Analog Computing and Navier-Stokes Nernst-Planck (NPNS) Modeling in Organic Electronics Technologies (OECTs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we attempt to make a conceptual bridge between the research in biology, pre-biotic chemistry, biomimetics, and the tools used in organic bioelectronics in terms of materials and devices. The goal is discussing how materials and devices of organic bioelectronics can be exploited and used at the interface with biology, but also how, and at what extent, they can be adapted to mimicking nature-inspired properties, herein including unconventional computing strategies. The idea is to provide new hints and solid hypotheses for designing niche experiments that could benefit from a proper interaction, even at a basic communicative level, between materials science and biotechnology. The finale long-term vision goal being the vision of collecting experimental data that may help to made a step forward toward the implementation of the transition from inanimate objects to animated beings. The mathematical model canonically considered in this work is the Navier-Stokes-Nernst-Planck (NPNS) Model which is often used to model a charged continuum system such as the organic electrochemical transistors.</description>

      <title>Global Well-Posedness of the 3D Navier-Stokes Equations in the Limiting Case: Infinitely Nested Logarithmic Improvements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a complete framework for infinitely nested logarithmic improvements to regularity criteria for the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Building upon our previous works on logarithmically improved and multi-level logarithmically improved criteria, we demonstrate that the limiting case of infinitely nested logarithms fully bridges the gap between subcritical and critical regularity. Specifically, we prove that if the initial data $u_0 \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)$ satisfies the condition $\|(-\Delta)^{1/4}u_0\|_{L^q(\mathbb{R}^3)} \leq C_0\Psi(\|u_0\|_{\dot{H}^{1/2}})$, where $\Psi$ incorporates infinitely nested logarithmic factors with appropriate decay conditions, then there exists a unique global-in-time smooth solution to the Navier-Stokes equations. This result establishes global well-posedness at the critical regularity threshold $s = 1/2$. The proof relies on infinitely nested commutator estimates, precise characterization of the critical exponent function in the limiting case, and careful analysis of the energy cascade. We also derive the exact Hausdorff dimension bound for potential singular sets in this limiting case, proving that the dimension reduces to zero. Through systematic construction of the limiting function spaces and detailed analysis of the associated ODEs, we demonstrate that infinitely nested logarithmic improvements provide a pathway to resolving the global regularity question for the Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Tunable self-emulsification via viscoelastic control of Marangoni-driven interfacial instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interfacial instabilities in multicomponent fluidic systems are widespread in nature and in industrial processes, yet controlling their dynamics remains a challenge. Here, we present a strategy to actively tune Marangoni-driven self-emulsification at liquid-liquid interfaces by harnessing fluid viscoelasticity. When a water-alcohol droplet spreads on an oil bath, a radial surface tension gradient induced by selective alcohol evaporation drives an interfacial instability, leading to the spontaneous formation of a dense two-dimensional array of "daughter" droplets. We demonstrate that introducing trace amounts of high-molecular-weight polymers, which introduces viscoelasticity, provides a robust means of controlling this process. Increasing viscoelasticity systematically suppresses the instability, resulting in a delayed onset of fragmentation and longer spreading fingers. By combining high-resolution experimental visualization and theoretical analysis, we uncover a quantitative relationship between the polymer concentration and the finger length prior to breakup. These findings establish a predictive framework for designing viscoelastic interfacial materials with programmable dynamic and offer new opportunities for surface-tension-mediated patterning, emulsification, and fluidic control in soft material systems.</description>

      <title>Predicting Wave Dynamics using Deep Learning with Multistep Integration Inspired Attention and Physics-Based Loss Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a physics-based deep learning framework for data-driven prediction of wave propagation in fluid media. The proposed approach, termed Multistep Integration-Inspired Attention (MI2A), combines a denoising-based convolutional autoencoder for reduced latent representation with an attention-based recurrent neural network with long-short-term memory cells for time evolution of reduced coordinates. This proposed architecture draws inspiration from classical linear multistep methods to enhance stability and long-horizon accuracy in latent-time integration. Despite the efficiency of hybrid neural architectures in modeling wave dynamics, autoregressive predictions are often prone to accumulating phase and amplitude errors over time. To mitigate this issue within the MI2A framework, we introduce a novel loss decomposition strategy that explicitly separates the training loss function into distinct phase and amplitude components. We assess the performance of MI2A against two baseline reduced-order models trained with standard mean-squared error loss: a sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural network and a variant using Luong-style attention. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the MI2A model, we consider three benchmark wave propagation problems of increasing complexity, namely one-dimensional linear convection, the nonlinear viscous Burgers equation, and the two-dimensional Saint-Venant shallow water system. Our results demonstrate that the MI2A framework significantly improves the accuracy and stability of long-term predictions, accurately preserving wave amplitude and phase characteristics. Compared to the standard long-short term memory and attention-based models, MI2A-based deep learning exhibits superior generalization and temporal accuracy, making it a promising tool for real-time wave modeling.</description>

      <title>Cascades transition in generalised two-dimensional turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalised two-dimensional (2D) fluid dynamics is characterised by a relationship between a scalar field $q$, called generalised vorticity, and the stream function $\psi$, namely $q = (-\nabla^2)^\frac{\alpha}{2} \psi$. We study the transition of cascades in generalised 2D turbulence by systematically varying the parameter $\alpha$ and investigating its influential role in determining the directionality (inverse, forward, or bidirectional) of these cascades. We derive upper bounds for the dimensionless dissipation rates of generalised energy $E_G$ and enstrophy $\Omega_G$ as the Reynolds number tends to infinity. These findings corroborate numerical simulations, illustrating the inverse cascade of $E_G$ and forward cascade of $\Omega_G$ for $\alpha &gt; 0$, contrasting with the reverse behaviour for $\alpha &lt; 0$. The dependence of dissipation rates on system parameters reinforces these observed transitions, substantiated by spectral fluxes and energy spectra, which hint at Kolmogorov-like scalings at large scales but discrepancies at smaller scales between numerical and theoretical estimates. These discrepancies are possibly due to nonlocal transfers, which dominate the dynamics as we go from positive to negative values of $\alpha$. Intriguingly, the forward cascade of $E_G$ for $\alpha &lt; 0$ reveals similarities to three-dimensional turbulence, notably the emergence of vortex filaments within a 2D framework, marking a unique feature of this generalised model.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional FGM modeling of turbulent spray flames: Effects of evaporation non-adiabaticity and scalar correlation</title>

Abstract: In turbulent spray flames, the evaporation of fuel droplets not only induces heat loss in the gaseous mixture, but also influences flame dynamics by generating substantial local fluctuations of the mixture fraction $\widetilde{Z}$ and progress variable $\widetilde{c}$. These two scalars, conventionally assumed independent in flamelet models, exhibit significant correlations arising from the coupling among evaporation, turbulent mixing and chemical reactions. This study proposes a six-dimensional flamelet-generated manifolds (FGM) method, considering the evaporation non-adiabaticity and scalar correlation. A novel joint presumed probability density function (PDF) method is derived using the copula theory, achieving rapid convergence and good feasibility to copulas in implicit formulas. Large-eddy simulation (LES) is performed on the Sydney ethanol turbulent spray flames (EtF1, EtF4 and EtF7), which feature different ethanol mass flow rates and jet Reynolds numbers. Both gas and liquid phase statistics show good agreement with experimental data across the three flames. The incorporation of heat loss and scalar correlation in FGM modeling improves gas temperature predictions, along with enhanced liquid-phase prediction through refined gas-field resolution. The correlation coefficient of $\widetilde{Z}$ and $\widetilde{c}$ is found to be a complex competing result of local evaporation and combustion, since evaporation elevates mixture fraction and dilutes reaction progress variable, whereas chemical reactions enhance progress variable fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking in Chemical Systems: Engineering Complexity through Self-Organization and Marangoni Flows</title>

Abstract: Far from equilibrium, chemical and biological systems can form complex patterns and waves through reaction-diffusion coupling. Fluid motion often tends to disrupt these self-organized concentration patterns. In this study, we investigate the influence of Marangoni-driven flows inside a thin layer of fluid ascending the outer surfaces of hydrophilic obstacles on the spatio-temporal dynamics of chemical waves in the modified Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction. Our observations reveal that circular waves originate nearly simultaneously at the obstacles and propagate outward. In a covered setup, where evaporation is minimal, the wavefronts maintain their circular shape. However, in an uncovered setup with significant evaporative cooling, the interplay between surface tension-driven Marangoni flows and gravity destabilizes the wavefronts, creating distinctive flower-like patterns around the obstacles. Our experiments further show that the number of petals formed increases linearly with the obstacle's diameter, though a minimum diameter is required for these instabilities to appear. These findings demonstrate the potential to 'engineer' specific wave patterns, offering a method to control and direct reaction dynamics. This capability is especially important for developing microfluidic devices requiring precise control over chemical wave propagation.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Transonic Flows around an Airfoil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17364v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks have gained popularity as a deep-learning based parametric partial differential equation solver. Especially for engineering applications, this approach is promising because a single neural network could substitute many classical simulations in multi-query scenarios. Only recently, researchers have successfully solved subsonic flows around airfoils with physics-informed neural networks by utilizing mesh transformations to precondition the training. However, compressible flows in the transonic regime could not be accurately approximated due to shock waves resulting in local discontinuities. In this article, we propose techniques to successfully approximate solutions of the compressible Euler equations for sub- and transonic flows with physics-informed neural networks. Inspired by classical numerical algorithms for solving conservation laws, the presented method locally introduces artificial dissipation to stabilize shock waves. We compare different viscosity variants such as scalar- and matrix-valued artificial viscosity, and validate the method at transonic flow conditions for an airfoil, obtaining good agreement with finite-volume simulations. Finally, the suitability for parametric problems is showcased by approximating transonic solutions at varying angles of attack with a single network. The presented work enables the application of parametric neural network based solvers to a new class of industrially relevant flow conditions in aerodynamics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Characterization of local energy transfer in large-scale intermittent stratified turbulent flows via coarse graining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies based on simulations of the Boussinesq equations indicate that stratified turbulent flows can develop large-scale intermittency in the velocity and temperature fields, as detected in the atmosphere and oceans. In particular, emerging powerful vertical drafts were found to generate local turbulence, proving necessary for stratified flows to dissipate the energy as efficiently as homogeneous isotropic turbulent flows. The existence of regions characterized by enhanced turbulence and dissipation, as observed, for instance, in the ocean, requires appropriate tools to assess how energy is transferred across the scales and at the same time locally in the physical space. After refining a classical space-filtering procedure, here we investigate the feedback of extreme vertical velocity drafts on energy transfer and exchanges in subdomains of simulations of stably stratified flows of geophysical interest. Our analysis shows that vertical drafts are indeed able to trigger upscale and downscale energy transfers, strengthening the coupling between kinetic and potential energies at certain scales, depending on the intensity of the local vertical velocity.</description>
