      <title>Parallel implementation of the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method achieving a quarter petaFLOPS performance on a single DGX-H100 GPU node</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report cutting edge performance results for a hybrid CPU-multi GPU implementation of the spin adapted ab initio Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method on current state-of-the-art NVIDIA DGX-H100 architectures. We evaluate the performance of the DMRG electronic structure calculations for the active compounds of the FeMoco and cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes with complete active space (CAS) sizes of up to 113 electrons in 76 orbitals [CAS(113, 76)] and 63 electrons in 58 orbitals [CAS(63, 58)], respectively. We achieve 246 teraFLOPS of sustained performance, an improvement of more than 2.5x compared to the performance achieved on the DGX-A100 architectures and an 80x acceleration compared to an OpenMP parallelized implementation on a 128-core CPU architecture. Our work highlights the ability of tensor network algorithms to efficiently utilize high-performance GPU hardware and shows that the combination of tensor networks with modern large-scale GPU accelerators can pave the way towards solving some of the most challenging problems in quantum chemistry and beyond.</description>

      <title>Ab initio calculations of molecular double Auger decay rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the application of the recently developed Fano-ADC(2,2) method to compute total and partial Auger decay widths of molecular core-hole states, including explicit evaluation of double Auger decay branching ratios. The method utilizes the fast-convergent intermediate state representation to construct many-electron wave functions and is readily applicable to atoms, molecules and clusters. The ADC(2,2) scheme describes the initial and final states of the normal Auger decay consistently up to the second order of perturbation theory. In addition, excitations with two electrons in the continuum provide access to three-electron decay modes. The method yields decay widths and the Auger electron spectra in excellent agreement with the experiment, demonstrating the high accuracy of partial widths. The average relative error of double Auger decay branching ratios compared to available experimental data is about 30\%, which should be evaluated as an excellent result considering the universality of the method, the complexity of the double decay process and the neglection of nuclear motion in the present study.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Frequency-Dependent Optical Spectrum for Solid Materials: A Multi-Output &amp; Multi-Fidelity Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frequency-dependent optical spectrum is pivotal for a broad range of applications, from material characterization to optoelectronics and energy harvesting. Data-driven surrogate models, trained on density functional theory (DFT) data, have effectively alleviated the scalability limitations of DFT while preserving its chemical accuracy, expediting material discovery. However, prevailing machine learning (ML) efforts often focus on scalar properties such as the band gap, overlooking the complexities of optical spectra. In this work, we employ deep graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict the frequency-dependent complex-valued dielectric function across the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet spectra directly from crystal structures. We explore multiple architectures for multi-output spectral representation of the dielectric function and utilize various multi-fidelity learning strategies, such as transfer learning and fidelity embedding, to address the challenges associated with the scarcity of high-fidelity DFT data. Additionally, we model key solar cell absorption efficiency metrics, demonstrating that learning these parameters is enhanced when integrated through a learning bias within the learning of the frequency-dependent absorption coefficient. This study demonstrates that leveraging multi-output and multi-fidelity ML techniques enables accurate predictions of optical spectra from crystal structures, providing a versatile tool for rapidly screening materials for optoelectronics, optical sensing, and solar energy applications across an extensive frequency spectrum.</description>

      <title>ArcaNN: automated enhanced sampling generation of training sets for chemically reactive machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of artificial intelligence has profoundly impacted computational chemistry, particularly through machine-learned potentials (MLPs), which offer a balance of accuracy and efficiency in calculating atomic energies and forces to be used in molecular dynamics simulations. These MLPs have significantly advanced molecular dynamics simulations across various applications, including large-scale simulations of materials, interfaces, and chemical reactions. Despite these advances, the construction of training datasets - a critical component for the accuracy of MLPs - has not received proportional attention. This is particularly critical for chemical reactivity which depends on rare barrier-crossing events. Here we address this gap by introducing ArcaNN, a comprehensive framework designed for generating training datasets for reactive MLPs. ArcaNN employs a concurrent learning approach combined with advanced sampling techniques to ensure accurate representation of high-energy geometries. The framework integrates automated processes for iterative training, exploration, new configuration selection, and energy and force labeling, while ensuring reproducibility and documentation. We demonstrate ArcaNN's capabilities through a paradigm nucleophilic substitution reaction in solution, showcasing its effectiveness, the uniformly low error of the resulting MLP everywhere along the chemical reaction coordinate, and its potential for broad applications in reactive molecular dynamics. We also provide guidelines on how to assess the quality of a NNP for a reactive system.</description>

      <title>Combining Hammett $\sigma$ constants for $\Delta$-machine learning and catalyst discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the applicability of the Hammett-inspired product (HIP) Ansatz to model relative substrate binding within homogenous organometallic catalysis, assigning $\sigma$ and $\rho$ to ligands and metals, respectively. Implementing an additive combination (c) rule for obtaining $\sigma$ constants for any ligand pair combination results in a cHIP model that enhances data efficiency in computational ligand tuning. We show its usefulness (i) as a baseline for $\Delta$-machine learning (ML), and (ii) to identify novel catalyst candidates via volcano plots. After testing the combination rule on Hammett constants previously published in the literature, we have generated numerical evidence for the Suzuki-Miyaura (SM) C-C cross-coupling reaction using two synthetic datasets of metallic catalysts (including (10) and (11)-metals Ni, Pd, Pt, and Cu, Ag, Au as well as 96 ligands such as N-heterocyclic carbenes, phosphines, or pyridines). When used as a baseline, $\Delta$-ML prediction errors of relative binding decrease systematically with training set size and reach chemical accuracy ($\sim$1 kcal/mol) for 20k training instances. Employing the individual ligand constants obtained from cHIP, we report relative substrate binding for a novel dataset consisting of 720 catalysts (not part of training data), of which 145 fall into the most promising range on the volcano plot accounting for oxidative addition, transmetalation, and reductive elimination steps. Multiple Ni-based catalysts, e.g. Aphos-Ni-P($t$-Bu)$_3$, are included among these promising candidates, potentially offering dramatic cost savings in experimental applications.</description>

      <title>i-PI 3.0: a flexible and efficient framework for advanced atomistic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic-scale simulations have progressed tremendously over the past decade, largely due to the availability of machine-learning interatomic potentials. These potentials combine the accuracy of electronic structure calculations with the ability to reach extensive length and time scales. The i-PI package facilitates integrating the latest developments in this field with advanced modeling techniques, thanks to a modular software architecture based on inter-process communication through a socket interface. The choice of Python for implementation facilitates rapid prototyping but can add computational overhead. In this new release, we carefully benchmarked and optimized i-PI for several common simulation scenarios, making such overhead negligible when i-PI is used to model systems up to tens of thousands of atoms using widely adopted machine learning interatomic potentials, such as Behler-Parinello, DeePMD and MACE neural networks. We also present the implementation of several new features, including an efficient algorithm to model bosonic and fermionic exchange, a framework for uncertainty quantification to be used in conjunction with machine-learning potentials, a communication infrastructure that allows deeper integration with electronic-driven simulations, and an approach to simulate coupled photon-nuclear dynamics in optical or plasmonic cavities.</description>

      <title>Facilities and practices for linear response Hubbard parameters U and J in Abinit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Members of the DFT+U family of functionals are increasingly prevalent methods of addressing errors intrinsic to (semi-) local exchange-correlation functionals at minimum computational cost, but require their parameters U and J to be calculated in situ for a given system of interest, simulation scheme, and runtime parameters. The SCF linear response approach offers ab initio acquisition of the U and has recently been extended to compute the J analogously, which measures localized errors related to exchange-like effects. We introduce a renovated post-processor, the lrUJ utility, together with this detailed best-practices guide, to enable users of the popular, open-source Abinit first-principles simulation suite to engage easily with in situ Hubbard parameters and streamline their incorporation into material simulations of interest. Features of this utility, which may also interest users and developers of other DFT codes, include $n$-degree polynomial regression, error analysis, Python plotting facilities, didactic documentation, and avenues for further developments. In this technical introduction and guide, we place particular emphasis on the intricacies and potential pitfalls introduced by the projector augmented wave (PAW) method, SCF mixing schemes, and non-linear response, several of which are translatable to DFT+U(+J) implementations in other packages.</description>
