      <title>Simultaneous measurement of extensional stress and flow birefringence field for uniaxially extending worm-like micellar solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study proposes a novel and simple rheo-optical technique to investigate the relation between the rheology of complex fluids and their internal structural deformation under uniaxial extensional flow. The macroscale results of viscoelasticity from rheological measurements and microscale results of birefringence from optical measurements are combined to evaluate the microstructural deformation and orientation state inside the fluids under extensional stress. The proposed technique combines a liquid dripping method with a high-speed polarization camera to measure the extensional stress and flow-induced birefringence field simultaneously. In the liquid dripping method, temporal evolution images of the liquid filament diameter for fluids dripping from a nozzle are measured to obtain the extensional stress loading on the liquid filament. These images are captured with a high-speed polarization camera connected to a micro polarization element alley, enabling high-speed imaging of the birefringent field. Worm-like micellar solutions of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium salicylate (NaSal) with varying concentrations of CTAB and NaSal are employed as the measurement targets. Consequently, we successfully visualized temporally developing images of the birefringence field of uniaxially extending worm-like micellar solutions induced by the orientation of micelles toward the extensional direction. Furthermore, the proposed technique supports investigating the conditions for establishing the stress-optical rule, which is the linear relation between stress and birefringence for complex fluids. The stress-optical coefficient, a proportionality constant indicating the sensitivity of birefringence to stress, is analyzed from these measurements. The stress-optical coefficient under uniaxial extensional flow is confirmed to be comparable to that under shear flow.</description>

      <title>Interfaces as transport barriers in two-dimensional Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of interfaces as transport barriers in binary-fluid turbulence by employing Lagrangian tracer particles. The Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) system of partial differential equations provides a natural theoretical framework for our investigations. For specificity, we utilize the two-dimensional (2D) CHNS system. We capture efficiently interfaces and their fluctuations in 2D binary-fluid turbulence by using extensive pseudospectral direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of the 2D CHNS equations. We begin with $n$ tracers within a droplet of one phase and examine their dispersal into the second phase. The tracers remain within the droplet for a long time before emerging from it, so interfaces act as transport barriers in binary-fluid turbulence. We show that the fraction of the number of particles inside the droplet decays exponentially and is characterized by a decay time $\tau_{\xi}\sim R_0^{3/2}$ that increases with $R_0$, the radius of the initially circular droplet. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the average first-passage time $\langle \tau \rangle$ for tracers inside a droplet is orders of magnitude larger than it is for transport out of a hypothetical circle with the same radius as the initially circular droplet. We examine the roles of the Okubo-Weiss parameter $\Lambda$, the fluctuations of the droplet perimeter, and the probability distribution function of $\cos(\theta)$, with $\theta$ the angle between the fluid velocity and the normal to a droplet interface, in trapping tracers inside droplets. We mention possible generalisations of our study.</description>

      <title>Exploring the efficacy of a hybrid approach with modal decomposition over fully deep learning models for flow dynamics forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid dynamics problems are characterized by being multidimensional and nonlinear, causing the experiments and numerical simulations being complex, time-consuming and monetarily expensive. In this sense, there is a need to find new ways to obtain data in a more economical manner. Thus, in this work we study the application of time series forecasting to fluid dynamics problems, where the aim is to predict the flow dynamics using only past information. We focus our study on models based on deep learning that do not require a high amount of data for training, as this is the problem we are trying to address. Specifically in this work we have tested three autoregressive models where two of them are fully based on deep learning and the other one is a hybrid model that combines modal decomposition with deep learning. We ask these models to generate $200$ time-ahead predictions of two datasets coming from a numerical simulation and experimental measurements, where the latter is characterized by being turbulent. We show how the hybrid model generates more reliable predictions in the experimental case, as it is physics-informed in the sense that the modal decomposition extracts the physics in a way that allows us to predict it.</description>

      <title>Releasing trapped Taylor bubbles via centrifugation and inclination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In confined systems, the entrapment of a gas volume with an equivalent spherical diameter greater than the dimension of the channel can form extended bubbles that obstruct fluid circuits and compromise performance. Notably, in sealed vertical tubes, buoyant long bubbles -- called Taylor bubbles -- cannot rise if the inner tube radius is below a critical value near the capillary length. This critical threshold for steady ascent is determined by geometric constraints related to matching the upper cap shape with the lubricating film in the elongated part of the bubble. Developing strategies to overcome this threshold and release stuck bubbles is essential for applications involving narrow liquid channels. Effective strategies involve modifying matching conditions with an external force field to facilitate bubble ascent. However, it's unclear how changes in acceleration conditions affect the motion onset of buoyancy-driven long bubbles. This study investigates the mobility of elongated bubbles in sealed tubes with an inner radius near the critical value inhibiting bubble motion in a vertical setting. Two strategies are explored to tune bubble motion, leveraging variations in axial and transversal accelerations: tube rotation around its axis and tube inclination relative to gravity. By revising the geometrical constraints of the simple vertical setting, the study predicts new thresholds based on rotational speed and tilt angle, respectively, providing forecasts for the bubble rising velocity under modified apparent gravity. Experimental measurements of motion threshold and rising velocity compare well with theoretical developments, thus suggesting practical approaches to control and tune bubble motion in confined environments.</description>

      <title>On instability of the Taylor-Green vortex in 2D Euler flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Euler flows on two-dimensional (2D) periodic domain and are interested in the stability, both linear and nonlinear, of a simple equilibrium given by the 2D Taylor-Green vortex. As the first main result, numerical evidence is provided for the fact that such flows possess unstable eigenvalues embedded in the band of the essential spectrum of the linearized operator, which suggests that passage from linear to non-linear instability in the energy metric is likely for such flows. The latter is confirmed numerically as well by demonstrating exponential transient growth of the nonlinear dynamics with the rate given by the real part of the unstable eigenvalue. However, the unstable eigenfunction is a distribution, rather than a smooth function, and is unbounded in the neighbourhood of the hyperbolic stagnation points of the base flow. As the second main result, we illustrate a fundamentally different, nonmodal, growth mechanism involving a continuous family of uncorrelated functions, instead of an eigenfunction of the linearized operator. Constructed by solving a suitable PDE optimization problem, the resulting flows saturate the known estimates on the growth of the semigroup related to the essential spectrum of the linearized Euler operator as the numerical resolution is refined. These findings are contrasted with the results of earlier studies of a similar problem conducted in a slightly viscous setting where only the modal growth of instabilities was observed. This highlights the special stability properties of equilibria in inviscid flows.</description>

      <title>Micro-swimmer collective dynamics in Brinkman flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suspensions of swimming micro-organisms are known to undergo intricate collective dynamics as a result of hydrodynamic and collision interactions. Micro-swimmers, such as bacteria and micro-algae, naturally live and have evolved in complex habitats that include impurities, obstacles and interfaces. To elucidate their dynamics in a heterogeneous environment, we consider a continuum theory where the the micro-swimmers are embedded in a Brinkman wet porous medium, which models viscous flow with an additional resistance or friction due to the presence of smaller stationary obstacles. The conservation equation for the swimmer configurations includes advection and rotation by the immersing fluid, and is coupled to the viscous Brinkman fluid flow with an active stress due to the swimmers' motion in it. Resistance alters individual swimmer locomotion and the way it disturbs the surrounding fluid, and thus it alters its hydrodynamic interactions with others and and such affects collective dynamics.The entropy analysis and the linear stability analysis of the system of equations both reveal that resistance delays and hinders the onset and development of the collective swimming instabilities, and can completely suppress it if sufficiently large. Simulations of the full nonlinear system confirm these. We contrast the results with previous theoretical studies on micro-swimmers in homogeneous viscous flow, and discuss relevant experimental realizations.</description>

      <title>A Review of the Accuracy of Direct Numerical Simulation Tools for the Simulation of Non-Spherical Bubble Collapses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical methods for the simulation of cavitation processes have been developed for more than 50 years. The rich variety of physical phenomena triggered by the collapse of a bubble has several applications in medicine and environmental science but requires the development of sophisticated numerical methods able to capture the presence of sharp interfaces between fluids and solid/elastic materials, the generation of shock waves and the development of non-spherical modes. One important challenge faced by numerical methods is the important temporal and scale separation inherent to the process of bubble collapse, where many effects become predominant during very short time lapses around the instant of minimum radius when the simulations are hardly resolved. In this manuscript, we provide a detailed discussion of the parameters controlling the accuracy of direct numerical simulation in general non-spherical cases, where a new theoretical analysis is presented to generalize existing theories on the prediction of the peak pressures reached inside the bubble during the bubble collapse. We show that the ratio between the gridsize and the minimum radius allows us to scale the numerical errors introduced by the numerical method in the estimation of different relevant quantities for a variety of initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Numerical investigation of fluid-structure interaction in a pilot-operated microfluidic valve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper is concerned with numerical investigation of the performance of a pilot-operated control valve based on shape memory alloy actuation control. The valve under investigation can be integrated into miniaturized hydraulic systems and is developed to perform precise dispensing, mixing, or dosing tasks while being able to withstand relatively high pressure differences. The study evaluates the valve's response under the current ON/OFF and the desired proportional control regimes using numerical methods for fluid-structure interaction. The computational model replicates the operation of the valve, which requires an understanding of the complex interactions between the fluid flow with the pressurized valve and the contact with the valve seat during the opening and closing processes. In addition, the model leverages advanced numerical techniques to overcome several complexities arising mainly from the geometrical, material, and contact nonlinearities, and to mitigate the shortcomings of the partitioned fluid-structure interaction approach. Several simulations are conducted to examine the valve's structural and flow behavior under varying pressure conditions. Results indicate that the valve is adequate for ON/OFF actuation control but is susceptible to flow-induced vibrations during the proportional control regime that occurs due to the sharp pressure drop in the valve-seat gap and the ensuing Venturi effect, which counteract the opening of the main valve. The fluid-structure-interaction simulations provide insight into the mechanism underlying the flow-induced vibrations, which can serve to improve the design and enhance the performance of the valve in microfluidic applications.</description>

      <title>Characteristics of active and inactive motions in high-Reynolds-number turbulent boundary layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wall-scaled (attached) eddies play a significant role in the overall drag experienced in high-Reynolds-number turbulent boundary layers (TBLs). This study aims to delve into the underlying mechanisms driving this phenomenon by dissecting the active and inactive components of these attached eddies, as initially proposed by Townsend (1976). Employing a recently introduced energy-decomposition scheme, we analyze TBL datasets covering a wide range of Reynolds numbers ($Re_{\tau}$ $\sim$ $\mathcal{O}$(10$^{3}$)--$\mathcal{O}$(10$^{6}$)). This analysis provides empirical evidence of the distinct contributions of these components to drag generation, and reveals that while active motions are responsible solely for generating Reynolds shear stresses, inactive motions are crucial for transporting streamwise momentum from the logarithmic region to the wall, thus corroborating earlier hypotheses in the literature.</description>

      <title>Spectral measures and iterative bounds for effective diffusivity of steady and space-time periodic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over three decades ago the advection-diffusion equation for a steady fluid velocity field was homogenized, leading to a Stieltjes integral representation for the effective diffusivity, which is given in terms of a spectral measure of a compact self-adjoint operator and the P\'eclet number of the fluid flow. This result was recently extended to space-time periodic flows, instead involving an unbounded self-adjoint operator. Pad\'e approximants provide rigorous upper and lower bounds for Stieltjes functions in terms of the moments of the spectral measure. However, with the lack of a method for calculating the moments of the spectral measure for general fluid velocity fields, the utility of this powerful mathematical framework for calculating bounds for the effective diffusivity has not been fully realized. Here we significantly expand the applicability of this framework by providing an iterative method that enables an arbitrary number of moments, hence bounds, to be calculated analytically in closed form for both spatially and space-time periodic flows. The method is demonstrated for periodic flows in two spatial dimensions. The known asymptotic behavior of the effective diffusivity for a steady flow is accurately captured by high order upper and lower bounds, demonstrating the ability of the method to provide accurate estimates for the effective diffusivity for a broad range of parameter values.</description>

      <title>A real-time digital twin of azimuthal thermoacoustic instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When they occur, azimuthal thermoacoustic oscillations can detrimentally affect the safe operation of gas turbines and aeroengines. We develop a real-time digital twin of azimuthal thermoacoustics of a hydrogen-based annular combustor. The digital twin seamlessly combines two sources of information about the system (i) a physics-based low-order model; and (ii) raw and sparse experimental data from microphones, which contain both aleatoric noise and turbulent fluctuations. First, we derive a low-order thermoacoustic model for azimuthal instabilities, which is deterministic. Second, we propose a real-time data assimilation framework to infer the acoustic pressure, the physical parameters, and the model and measurement biases simultaneously. This is the bias-regularized ensemble Kalman filter (r-EnKF), for which we find an analytical solution that solves the optimization problem. Third, we propose a reservoir computer, which infers both the model bias and measurement bias to close the assimilation equations. Fourth, we propose a real-time digital twin of the azimuthal thermoacoustic dynamics of a laboratory hydrogen-based annular combustor for a variety of equivalence ratios. We find that the real-time digital twin (i) autonomously predicts azimuthal dynamics, in contrast to bias-unregularized methods; (ii) uncovers the physical acoustic pressure from the raw data, i.e., it acts as a physics-based filter; (iii) is a time-varying parameter system, which generalizes existing models that have constant parameters, and capture only slow-varying variables. The digital twin generalizes to all equivalence ratios, which bridges the gap of existing models. This work opens new opportunities for real-time digital twinning of multi-physics problems.</description>

      <title>The Role of Normal and Non-Normal Contributions to Enstrophy Production in the Near-Wall Region of a Turbulent Channel Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The turbulent boundary-layer is a region where both preferential dissipation of energy and the production of significant vorticity arises as a consequence of the strong velocity gradients. Previous work has shown that, following a Reynolds decomposition of the enstrophy production, the purely fluctuating contribution is the dominant term and that near the wall this varies in a complex manner with height. In this study we additionally decompose the strain rate and vorticity terms into normal and non-normal components using a Schur decomposition and are able to explain all these features in terms of contributions at different heights from constituents involving different combinations of normal and non-normal quantities. What is surprising about our results is that while the mean shear and the action of larger scale structures should mean that non-normal effects are of over-riding importance, the most important individual term involves the fluctuating, normal straining in the transverse direction. Furthermore, the reason that the term that involves only non-normal contributions is smaller on average than that involving normal straining coupled to non-normal vorticity is that in the former case there are individual constituents that are negative in the mean. Hence, we not only explain the nature of near-wall enstrophy production in greater detail, but highlight how local straining that is orthogonal to the direction of the dominant mean and fluctuating shear plays a crucial role in amplifying vorticity that is yet to have developed sufficiently to gain a solid body rotational component.</description>

      <title>Odd viscosity suppresses intermittency in direct turbulent cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermittency refers to the broken self-similarity of turbulent flows caused by anomalous spatio-temporal fluctuations. In this Letter, we ask how intermittency is affected by a non-dissipative viscosity, known as odd viscosity, which appears in parity-breaking fluids such as magnetized polyatomic gases, electron fluids under magnetic field and spinning colloids or grains. Using a combination of Navier-Stokes simulations and theory, we show that intermittency is suppressed by odd viscosity at small scales. This effect is caused by parity-breaking waves, induced by odd viscosity, that break the multiple scale invariances of the Navier-Stokes equations. Building on this insight, we construct a two-channel helical shell model that reproduces the basic phenomenology of turbulent odd-viscous fluids including the suppression of anomalous scaling. Our findings illustrate how a fully developed direct cascade that is entirely self-similar can emerge below a tunable length scale, paving the way for designing turbulent flows with adjustable levels of intermittency.</description>

      <title>On the behavior of pressure in a low Mach number flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our recent works, we proposed a theory of turbulence via the mean field effect of an intermolecular potential, which in part relies on an empirically observed "equilibrated" behavior of the pressure variable in a low Mach number flow -- that is, while other variables may exhibit considerable variations at low Mach numbers, the pressure is (nearly) constant. At the same time, conventional kinetic theory does not offer a satisfactory explanation for such a behavior of the pressure variable, instead leading to an isentropic flow in the form of the usual compressible Euler equations.
  In the current work, we introduce a novel correction term into the pair correlation function of the BBGKY closure for the collision integral, which adjusts the density of incident or recedent pairs of particles depending on the macroscopic compression or expansion rate of the gas. Remarkably, this term does not affect the density and momentum transport equations, and manifests solely in the pressure transport equation. We also find that the effect of the novel term on the pressure dynamics matches the observed behavior -- that is, it tends to attenuate the acoustic waves and smooth out the pressure solution. It appears that the missing piece of the low Mach number puzzle has finally been identified.</description>

Abstract: Lagrangian turbulence lies at the core of numerous applied and fundamental problems related to the physics of dispersion and mixing in engineering, bio-fluids, atmosphere, oceans, and astrophysics. Despite exceptional theoretical, numerical, and experimental efforts conducted over the past thirty years, no existing models are capable of faithfully reproducing statistical and topological properties exhibited by particle trajectories in turbulence. We propose a machine learning approach, based on a state-of-the-art diffusion model, to generate single-particle trajectories in three-dimensional turbulence at high Reynolds numbers, thereby bypassing the need for direct numerical simulations or experiments to obtain reliable Lagrangian data. Our model demonstrates the ability to reproduce most statistical benchmarks across time scales, including the fat-tail distribution for velocity increments, the anomalous power law, and the increased intermittency around the dissipative scale. Slight deviations are observed below the dissipative scale, particularly in the acceleration and flatness statistics. Surprisingly, the model exhibits strong generalizability for extreme events, producing events of higher intensity and rarity that still match the realistic statistics. This paves the way for producing synthetic high-quality datasets for pre-training various downstream applications of Lagrangian turbulence.</description>

      <title>Influence of adversarial training on super-resolution turbulence reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Supervised super-resolution deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have gained significant attention for their potential in reconstructing velocity and scalar fields in turbulent flows. Despite their popularity, CNNs currently lack the ability to accurately produce high-frequency and small-scale features, and tests of their generalizability to out-of-sample flows are not widespread. Generative adversarial networks (GANs), which consist of two distinct neural networks (NNs), a generator and discriminator, are a promising alternative, allowing for both semi-supervised and unsupervised training. The difference in the flow fields produced by these two NN architectures has not been thoroughly investigated, and a comprehensive understanding of the discriminator's role has yet to be developed. This study assesses the effectiveness of the unsupervised adversarial training in GANs for turbulence reconstruction in forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence. GAN-based architectures are found to outperform supervised CNNs for turbulent flow reconstruction for in-sample cases. The reconstruction accuracy of both architectures diminishes for out-of-sample cases, though the GAN's discriminator network significantly improves the generator's out-of-sample robustness using either an additional unsupervised training step with large eddy simulation input fields and a dynamic selection of the most suitable upsampling factor. These enhance the generator's ability to reconstruct small-scale gradients, turbulence intermittency, and velocity-gradient probability density functions. The extrapolation capability of the GAN-based model is demonstrated for out-of-sample flows at higher Reynolds numbers. Based on these findings, incorporating discriminator-based training is recommended to enhance the reconstruction capability of super-resolution CNNs.</description>

      <title>Robust and Adaptive Deep Reinforcement Learning for Enhancing Flow Control around a Square Cylinder with Varying Reynolds Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12123v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present study applies a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm to Active Flow Control (AFC) of a two-dimensional flow around a confined square cylinder. Specifically, the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm is employed to modulate the flow of a pair of synthetic jets placed on the upper and lower surfaces of the confined squared cylinder in flow configurations characterized by Re of 100, 200, 300, and 400. The investigation starts with an analysis of the baseline flow in the absence of active control. It is observed that at Re = 100 and Re = 200, the vortex shedding exhibits mono-frequency characteristics. Conversely, at Re = 300 and Re = 400, the vortex shedding is dominated by multiple frequencies, which is indicative of more complex flow features. With the application of the SAC algorithm, we demonstrate the capability of DRL-based control in effectively suppressing vortex shedding, while significantly diminishing drag and fluctuations in lift. Quantitatively, the data-driven active control strategy results in a drag reduction of approximately 14.4%, 26.4%, 38.9%, and 47.0% for Re = 100, 200, 300, and 400, respectively. To understand the underlying control mechanism, we also present detailed flow field comparisons, which showcase the adaptability of DRL in devising distinct control strategies tailored to the dynamic conditions at varying Re. These findings substantiate the proficiency of DRL in controlling chaotic, multi-frequency dominated vortex shedding phenomena, underscoring the robustness of DRL in complex AFC problems.</description>

      <title>Deep reinforcement learning-based active flow control of an elliptical cylinder: transitioning from an elliptical cylinder to a circular cylinder and a flat plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13003</link>

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of active flow control (AFC) technology supported by deep reinforcement learning (DRL) applied to flows around elliptical cylinders at Re=100. We vary the aspect ratio (Ar) of the elliptical cylinder from an ellipsoid (Ar=2.0) to a circular shape (Ar=1.0), and ultimately to a flat plate (Ar=0). We utilize the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm to precisely control the mass flow rates of synthetic jets located on both the upper and lower surfaces of the cylinder. The control objective focuses on reducing drag, minimizing lift and suppressing vortex shedding. We examine the robustness and adaptability of DRL-based control techniques across different geometric configurations. Our research findings indicate that, for elliptical cylinders with Ar between 1.75 and 0.75, the reduction in drag coefficient ranges from 0.9% to 15.7%, and the reduction in lift coefficient ranges from 95.2% to 99.7%. Notably, the DRL-based control strategy not only significantly reduces lift and drag, but also completely suppresses vortex shedding while using less than 1% of external excitation energy, demonstrating its efficiency and energy-saving capabilities. Additionally, for Ar from 0.5 to 0, the reduction in drag coefficient ranges from 26.9% to 43.6%, and the reduction in lift coefficient from 50.2% to 68.0%. This reflects the control strategy's significant reduction in both drag and lift coefficients, while also alleviating vortex shedding. Overall, our findings underscore the adaptability and potential of DRL-based AFC in controlling complex fluid dynamics across diverse geometric configurations.</description>

      <title>Hindered settling of log-normally distributed particulate suspensions: theoretical models vs. Stokesian simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Settling velocity statistics for dilute, non-Brownian suspensions of polydisperse spheres having a log-normal size distribution are analysed by Stokesian Dynamics, as a function of the total volume fraction and width of the size distribution. Several hundred instantaneous configurations are averaged to obtain reliable statistics. Average velocities for each particle class are compared to the models proposed by Batchelor, Richardson &amp; Zaki, Davis &amp; Gecol, and Masliyah-Lockett-Bassoon (MLB). Batchelor's model is shown to give reasonably accurate predictions when the volume fraction is within 5%. Because of its complexity, this model is however hardly used in practice, so lower-order models are needed. We found that while the other hindered settling models can give reasonably accurate predictions of the velocity of the largest particles, all of them overestimate - in certain cases by a large margin - the velocity of the smaller particles. By computing the fluid-particle velocity slip for each particle class and using Batchelor's model, we explain why predicting the lower tail of the particle size distribution is challenging, and propose possible avenues for model improvement. The analysis of velocity fluctuations suggest quantitative similarities between velocity fluctuations in monodisperse and polydisperse suspensions.</description>

      <title>A simple model for the emergence of relaxation-oscillator convection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Earth's tropics are characterized by quasi-steady precipitation with small oscillations about a mean value, which has led to the hypothesis that moist convection is in a state of quasi-equilibrium (QE). In contrast, very warm simulations of Earth's tropical convection are characterized by relaxation-oscillator-like (RO) precipitation, with short-lived convective storms and torrential rainfall forming and dissipating at regular intervals with little to no precipitation in between. We develop a model of moist convection by combining a zero-buoyancy model of bulk-plume convection with a QE heat engine model, and we use it to show that QE is violated at high surface temperatures. We hypothesize that the RO state emerges when the equilibrium condition of the convective heat engine is violated, i.e., when the net cooling times a thermodynamic efficiency exceeds the work that can be performed. We test our hypothesis against one- and three-dimensional numerical simulations and find that it accurately predicts the onset of RO convection. The proposed mechanism for RO emergence from QE breakdown is agnostic of the condensing component, and can be applied to any planetary atmosphere undergoing moist convection. To date, RO states have only been demonstrated in three-dimensional convection-resolving simulations, which has made it seem that the physics of the RO state requires simulations that can explicitly resolve the three-dimensional interaction of cloudy plumes and their environment. We demonstrate that RO states also exist in single-column simulations of radiative-convective equilibrium with parameterized convection, albeit in a different surface temperature range and with much longer storm-free intervals.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of regular solutions for 3-D full compressible Navier-Stokes equations with degenerate viscosities and heat conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the degenerate viscous and heat conductive compressible fluids, the momentum equations and the energy equation are degenerate both in the time evolution and spatial dissipation when vacuum appears, and then the physical entropy S behaves singularly, which make it challenging to study the corresponding well-posedness of regular solutions with high order regularities of S near the vacuum. In this paper, for the physically important case that the coefficients of viscosities and heat conductivity depend on the absolute temperature \theta in a power law of Chapman-Enskog, we identify a class of initial data admitting a local-in-time regular solution with far field vacuum to the Cauchy problem of the 3-D full CNS, and such a solution possesses the uniformly high order regularities for S near the vacuum. The key idea here is to study the vacuum problem in terms of the mass density \rho, velocity u and S instead of (\rho, u,\theta), which makes it possible to compare the orders of the degeneracy of the time evolution and the spatial dissipations near the vacuum in terms of the powers of \rho. However, for heat conductive fluids, both a degenerate spatial dissipation and a source term related to \triangle \rho^{\gamma-1}, will appear in the time evolution equation for S, which makes it formidable to study the propagation of regularities of S. Fortunately, based on some elaborate analysis of the intrinsic degenerate-singular structures of the 3-D full CNS, we can choose proper weights to control the behaviors of (\rho, u,S) by introducing an enlarged reformulated system, which includes a singular parabolic system for u, and one degenerate-singular parabolic equation for S. Then one can carry out a series of weighted energy estimates carefully designed for this reformulated system, which provides an effective propagation mechanism for S's high order regularities near the vacuum.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Reasoning for Physics Informed Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the application of the physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach in Bayesian formulation. We have adopted the Bayesian neural network framework to obtain posterior densities from Laplace approximation. For each model or fit, the evidence is computed, which is a measure that classifies the hypothesis. The optimal solution is the one with the highest value of evidence. We have proposed a modification of the Bayesian algorithm to obtain hyperparameters of the model. We have shown that within the Bayesian framework, one can obtain the relative weights between the boundary and equation contributions to the total loss. Presented method leads to predictions comparable to those obtained by sampling from the posterior distribution within the Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm (HMC). We have solved heat, wave, and Burger's equations, and the results obtained are in agreement with the exact solutions, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. In Burger's equation problem, we have demonstrated that the framework can combine information from differential equations and potential measurements. All solutions are provided with uncertainties (induced by the model's parameter dependence) computed within the Bayesian framework.</description>

      <title>Optimal Parallelization Strategies for Active Flow Control in Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Computational Fluid Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11515v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach for handling highly dynamic and nonlinear Active Flow Control (AFC) problems. However, the computational cost associated with training DRL models presents a significant performance bottleneck. To address this challenge and enable efficient scaling on high-performance computing architectures, this study focuses on optimizing DRL-based algorithms in parallel settings. We validate an existing state-of-the-art DRL framework used for AFC problems and discuss its efficiency bottlenecks. Subsequently, by deconstructing the overall framework and conducting extensive scalability benchmarks for individual components, we investigate various hybrid parallelization configurations and propose efficient parallelization strategies. Moreover, we refine input/output (I/O) operations in multi-environment DRL training to tackle critical overhead associated with data movement. Finally, we demonstrate the optimized framework for a typical AFC problem where near-linear scaling can be obtained for the overall framework. We achieve a significant boost in parallel efficiency from around 49% to approximately 78%, and the training process is accelerated by approximately 47 times using 60 CPU cores. These findings are expected to provide valuable insights for further advancements in DRL-based AFC studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10878v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To integrate wave and sediment transport modeling, a computationally extensive wave-resolving Voronoi mesh-based simulation has been developed to improve upon heretofore separate sediment and spectral wave modeling. Orbital wave motion-dependent sediment transport and fine structures of the dynamic Rouse number distribution across the seabed were brought into focus. The entirely parallelized wave-resolving hydrodynamic model is demonstrated for nearshore beach waters adjacent to artificial islands in Doha Bay. The nested model was validated with tidal time series for three locations and two seasons.</description>

      <title>Scaling laws for Rayleigh-B\'enard convection between Navier-slip boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional Rayeigh-B\'enard convection problem between Navier-slip fixed-temperature boundary conditions and present a new upper bound for the Nusselt number. The result, based on a localization principle for the Nusselt number and an interpolation bound, exploits the regularity of the flow. On one hand our method yields a shorter proof of the celebrated result in Whitehead &amp; Doering (2011) in the case of free-slip boundary conditions. On the other hand, its combination with a new, refined estimate for the pressure gives a substantial improvement of the interpolation bounds in Drivas et al. (2022) for slippery boundaries. A rich description of the scaling behaviour arises from our result: depending on the magnitude of the Prandtl number and slip-length, our upper bounds indicate five possible scaling laws: $\textit{Nu} \sim (L_s^{-1}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{1}{3}}$, $\textit{Nu} \sim (L_s^{-\frac{2}{5}}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{5}{13}}$, $\textit{Nu} \sim \textit{Ra}^{\frac{5}{12}}$, $\textit{Nu} \sim \textit{Pr}^{-\frac{1}{6}} (L_s^{-\frac{4}{3}}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{1}{2}}$ and $\textit{Nu} \sim \textit{Pr}^{-\frac{1}{6}} (L_s^{-\frac{1}{3}}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{1}{2}}$</description>
