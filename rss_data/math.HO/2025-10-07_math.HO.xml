      <title>Ethical and sustainable mathematics is localised: why global paradigms fail and culturally-situated practices are essential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper identifies several different interconnected challenges preventing the move towards more ethical and sustainable mathematics education: the entrenched belief in mathematical neutrality, the difficulty of simultaneously reforming mathematics and its pedagogy, the gap between academic theory and classroom practice, and the need for epistemic decolonisation. In this context, we look at both bottom-up and top-down approaches, and argue that globalised frameworks such as the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals are insufficient for this transformation, and that ethical and sustainable forms of mathematics ought not to be built using these as their (philosophical) foundation. These frameworks are often rooted in a Western-centric development paradigm that can perpetuate colonial hierarchies and fails to resolve inherent conflicts between economic growth and ecological integrity. As an alternative, this paper advocates for embracing localised, culturally-situated mathematical practices. Using the Ethics in Mathematics Project as a case study within a Western, Global North institution, this paper illustrates a critical-pragmatic, multi-level strategy for fostering ethical consciousness within a specific research community, and shows how this may be achieved in otherwise adversarial circumstances.</description>

      <title>Scattered polynomials: an overview on their properties, connections and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this survey is to outline the state of the art in research on a class of linearized polynomials with coefficients over finite fields, known as scattered polynomials. These have been studied in several contexts, such as in [A. Blokhuis, M. Lavrauw. Scattered spaces with respect to a spread in $\mathrm{PG}(n, q)$. Geometriae Dedicata 81(1) (2000), 231-243] and [G. Lunardon, O. Polverino. Blocking sets and derivable partial spreads. J. Algebraic Combin. 14 (2001), 49-56]. Recently, their connection to maximum rank-metric codes was brought to light in [J. Sheekey. MRD codes: Constructions and connections. In K.-U. Schmidt and A. Winterhof, editors, Combinatorics and Finite Fields, De Gruyter (2019), 255-286]. This link has significantly advanced their study and investigation, sparking considerable interest in recent years. Here, we will explore their relationship with certain subsets of the finite projective line $\mathrm{PG}(1, q^n)$ known as maximum scattered linear sets, as well as with codes made up of square matrices of order $n$ equipped with the rank metric. We will review the known examples of scattered polynomials up to date and discuss some of their key properties. We will also address the classification of maximum scattered linear sets of the finite projective line $\mathrm{PG}(1, q^n)$ for small values of $n$ and discuss characterization results for the examples known so far. Finally, we will retrace how each scattered polynomial gives rise to a translation plane, as discussed in [V. Casarino, G. Longobardi, C. Zanella. Scattered linear sets in a finite projective line and translation planes, Linear Algebra Appl. 650 (2022), 286-298] and in [G. Longobardi, C. Zanella, A standard form for scattered linearized polynomials and properties of the related translation planes, J. Algebr. Comb. 59(4) (2024), 917-937].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We offer an experimental lens on mathematics that reframes the role of proofs, axioms and computations and parallels much better the story in other sciences. This offers a new interpretation of Godel's theorems and raises questions for the practice of mathematics, especially in the age of AI.</description>

      <title>Growing Mathlib: maintenance of a large scale mathematical library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lean mathematical library Mathlib is one of the fastest-growing libraries of formalised mathematics. We describe various strategies to manage this growth, while allowing for change and avoiding maintainer overload. This includes dealing with breaking changes via a deprecation system, using code quality analysis tools (linters) to provide direct user feedback about common pitfalls, speeding up compilation times through conscious library (re-)design, dealing with technical debt as well as writing custom tooling to help with the review and triage of new contributions.</description>
