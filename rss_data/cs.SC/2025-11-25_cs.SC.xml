      <title>Computing basis of solutions of any Mahler equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mahler equations arise in a wide range of contexts including the study of finite automata, regular sequences, algebraic series over Fp(z), and periods of Drinfeld modules. Introduced a century ago by K. Mahler to study the transcendence of certain complex numbers, they have recently been the subject of several works establishing a deep connection between such transcendence properties and the nature of their solutions. While numerous studies have investigated these solutions, existing algorithms can only compute them in specific rings: rational functions, power series, Puiseux series, or Hahn series. This paper solves the problem by providing an algorithm that computes a complete basis of solutions for any Mahler equation, along with a decomposition of each solution over the field of Puiseux series. Along the way, we describe an algorithm that computes a fundamental matrix of solutions for any Mahler system.</description>

      <title>AbstRaL: Augmenting LLMs' Reasoning by Reinforcing Abstract Thinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07751v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs), especially smaller ones, often lack robustness in grade school math (GSM) reasoning. In particular, they tend to experience performance drops when faced with distribution shifts, such as changes to numerical or nominal variables, or insertions of distracting clauses. A possible strategy to address this involves generating synthetic data to further "instantiate" reasoning problems on potential variations. In this work, we instead focuses on the strategy of "abstracting" reasoning problems. This not only helps counteract distribution shifts but also facilitates the connection to symbolic tools for deriving solutions. Focusing on GSM, we find that this abstraction process is better acquired through reinforcement learning (RL) than just supervised fine-tuning, which often fails to produce faithful abstractions. Our method, AbstRaL -- which promotes abstract reasoning in LLMs using RL on granular abstraction data -- significantly mitigates performance degradation on recent GSM perturbation benchmarks. Besides, improving GSM robustness via AbstRaL is shown to also implicitly benefit LLMs' capabilities on OOD mathematical and general reasoning tasks, indicating that abstract thinking broadly enables better generalizability.</description>

      <title>Computing Sound and Accurate Upper and Lower Bounds on Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Value Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a fundamental tool for safety verification and control synthesis for nonlinear-control systems. Classical HJ reachability analysis methods discretize the continuous state space and solve the HJ partial differential equation over a grid, but these approaches do not account for discretization errors and can under-approximate backward reachable sets, which represent unsafe sets of states. We present a framework for computing sound upper and lower bounds on the HJ value functions via value iteration over grids. Additionally, we develop a refinement algorithm that splits cells that were not possible to classify as safe or unsafe given the computed bounds. This algorithm enables computing accurate over-approximations of backward reachable sets even when starting from coarse grids. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our method in two case studies.</description>
