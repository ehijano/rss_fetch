      <title>Regular Black Holes From Pure Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show via an explicit construction how an infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections generically leads to a resolution of the Schwarzschild singularity in any spacetime dimension $D \ge 5$. The theories we consider have two key properties that ensure the results are general and robust: (1) they provide a basis for (vacuum) gravitational effective field theory in five and higher-dimensions, (2) for each value of the mass, they have a unique static spherically symmetric solution. We present several exact solutions of the theories that include the Hayward black hole and metrics similar to the Bardeen and Dymnikova ones. Unlike previous constructions, these regular black holes arise as vacuum solutions, as we include no matter fields whatsoever in our analysis. We show how the black hole thermodynamics can be studied in a completely universal and unambiguous way for all solutions.</description>

      <title>A Monte Carlo algorithm for spin foam intertwiners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monte Carlo algorithms are barely considered in spin foam quantum gravity. Due to the quantum nature of spin foam amplitudes one cannot readily apply them, and the present sign problem is a threat to convergence and thus efficiency. Yet, ultimately the severity of the sign problem in spin foams is not known. In this article we propose a new probability distribution for coherent (boundary) intertwiners, which we use to define a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We apply this algorithm to the SU(2) coherent vertex amplitude for various Regge-type boundary data and find convergent, accurate results at far lower costs than the explicit calculation. The resources are instead used to increase the size of boundary spins, bridging the gap to the asymptotic formulae. While the sign problem is not solved, it is under control in the vast majority of cases. We close by discussing how this algorithm can be extended to larger triangulations with boundary and 4d Lorentzian spin foam models. More speculatively, we discuss how this algorithm can be used to sample (Regge-geometric) bulk intertwiners.</description>

      <title>Phase structures and critical behaviour of rational non-linear electrodynamics AdS black holes in Rastall gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research paper presents a black hole solution with a rational non-linear electrodynamics source in the Rastall gravity framework. The paper analyzes the thermodynamic properties of the solution in normal phase space and explores its critical behavior. The phase structure is examined using the extended first law of thermodynamics, with the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ serving as pressure $P$. The isotherms exhibit van der Waals behavior at small values of horizon $r_+$. The paper also investigates the Gibbs free energy behavior and finds two critical points with two pressures where the reentrant phase transition occurs and disappears. On the other hand, we explore the prevalent microstructure of black holes in Ruppeiner geometry, uncovering significant deviations in the nature of particle interactions from conventional practice. Moreover, the thermodynamic geometry is analyzed using the Ruppeiner formalism, with the normalized Ricci scalar indicating possible point-phase transitions of the heat capacity, and the normalized extrinsic curvature having the same sign as the normalized Ricci scalar. The three-phase transitions of the heat capacity are those that we find for the normalized Ruppeiner curvatures. Thus, there is an absolute correspondence.</description>

      <title>Probing the Solar System for Dark Matter Using the Sagnac Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the potential of the Sagnac Effect for detecting dark matter in the Solar System, particularly within the Sun. Originating from the relative delay and interference of light beams traveling in opposite directions on rotating platforms, the effect can account how varying gravitational conditions affect its manifestation. We analyze the Sagnac time in two static, spherically symmetric spacetimes: Schwarzschild and one incorporating dark matter. By comparing the calculated relative deviations in Sagnac time obtained from satellites orbiting our star with the current precision of onboard atomic clocks (about $10^{-11}$), we evaluate the feasibility of detecting dark matter's gravitational influence through this effect.</description>

      <title>The response of the Moon to gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The response of the Moon to gravitational waves (GWs) is used by some of the proposed lunar GW detectors like the Lunar Gravitational-wave Antenna (LGWA) to turn the Moon into an antenna for GWs. The deep connection between the lunar internal structure, its geophysical environment and the study of the Universe is intriguing, but given our limited understanding of the Moon today, it also makes it very difficult to predict the science potential of lunar GW detectors accurately. Lunar response models have been developed since the Apollo program, but there is evidence coming from seismic measurements during the Apollo missions that the models are not good enough and possibly underestimating the lunar GW response especially in the decihertz frequency band. In this paper, we will provide an extension of Freeman Dyson's half-space model to include horizontally layered geologies, which allows us to carry out computationally efficient calculations of the lunar GW response above 0.1\,Hz compared to the normal-mode simulations used in the past. We analyze how the results depend on the values of geometric and elastic parameters of the layered geological model, and we find that modifications of the geological model as required to explain Apollo seismic observations can boost the lunar GW response.</description>

      <title>Gravity as a topological gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a topological gauge theory with underlying Cartan geometry $G/H$ and principal $H$-bundle. The topological action is constructed as a linear combination of the Euler and Pontrjagin numbers coming from entries of the curvature $\bar{\Omega}$ of a Cartan connection.
  As an example we show that for respectively
  $G=
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
  SO(4,1) \text{ for } \Lambda_0 &gt; 0
  SO(3,2) \text{ for } \Lambda_0 &lt; 0
  \end{array}
  \right.$ and $H=SO(3,1)$ a very particular linear combination yields the Holst + Euler and Pontrjagin of the curvature $R$ of the spin connection + Nieh-Yan + bare cosmological constant $\Lambda_0$ terms. Additionally, in this construction, the coupling constants of these different terms are inherently linked together.
  The other treated example is the one of the M\"obius group $G= SO(4,2) /\{\pm I\}$ and $H = CO(4,2) \ltimes \mathbb{R}^{3,1}$. By considering a constraint on the "pair of frames" $(\alpha,\beta)$ we retrieve an action comprising all terms compatible with diffeomorphism invariance and local Lorentz invariance described in the previous example + kinetic term for a scalar field + an interaction of that scalar field with the Torsion $T$, the scalar field being related to dilation.
  Finally, in both examples, we study the equations of motion associated to the total (Gauge + Matter) action. It is especially shown that one of the solutions in the M\"obius case consists of Einstein's equations modified by the Holst term with an additional source term for curvature depending on specific variations of spin density of matter.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Airy tensor modes of cosmological gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From a classical analysis, it is shown that the nondiffractive accelerating gravitational Airy wave packets are solutions of Einstein equations for their linearized tensor modes in a Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker cosmological background filled with a perfect fluid, with equations of state $w=1/3$ and $w=-1/3$. These solutions have finite energy, presenting accelerating behavior due to the structured spatial form of the wavepacket. This is manifested by curved trajectories along the wave path. Also, using spectral functions, it is possible, with these packets, to construct more general, arbitrary wave packets. All these new solutions bring insights on new forms for gravitational wave propagation.</description>

      <title>Effect of dark matter on the shadow of a distorted and deformed compact object</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates observational properties, namely the shadow and photon ring structure, of emission profiles originated near compact objects. In particular, we consider a distorted and deformed compact object characterized by quadrupoles and surrounded by an optically thin and geometrically thin accretion disk with different emission profiles modeled by the Johnson's Standard-Unbound (SU) distribution in the reference frame of the emitter. Under these assumptions, we produce the observed intensity profiles and shadow images for a face-on observer. Our results indicate that, due to the fact that modifications of the quadrupole parameters affect the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and the photon sphere (PS), the observed shadow images and their properties are significantly influenced by the quadrupole parameters and emission profiles. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of the presence of a dark matter halo in the observational imprints considered and verify that both the increase in the matter contained in the halo or decrease in the length-scale of the halo lead to an increase in the size of the observed shadow. Our results indicate potential degeneracies between the observational features of distorded and deformed compact objects with those of spherically symmetric blackholes, which could be assessed by a comparison with the current and future generation of optical experiments in gravitational physics.</description>

      <title>Loop Blow-up Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new model of string inflation driven by a blow-up K\"ahler modulus of type IIb compactifications with a potential generated by string loops. Slow-roll is naturally realized thanks to the fact that the blow-up mode is a leading-order flat direction lifted by string loops which are unavoidable and generate a plateau at large field values. We check that throughout the whole inflationary dynamics the effective field theory is under control. We perform a phenomenological analysis determining the exact number of efoldings by studying the post-inflationary evolution. We determine the values of the microscopic parameters which lead to agreement with CMB data, together with the prediction of a tensor-to-scalar ratio of order $r\sim 10^{-5}$.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background from Highly-Eccentric Stellar-Mass Binaries in the Milli-hertz Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many gravitational wave (GW) sources are expected to have non-negligible eccentricity in the millihertz band. These highly eccentric compact object binaries may commonly serve as a progenitor stage of GW mergers, particularly in dynamical channels where environmental perturbations bring a binary with large initial orbital separation into a close pericenter passage, leading to efficient GW emission and a final merger. This work examines the stochastic GW background from highly eccentric ($e\gtrsim 0.9$), stellar-mass sources in the mHz band. Our findings suggest that these binaries can contribute a substantial GW power spectrum, potentially exceeding the LISA instrumental noise at $\sim 3-7$~mHz. This stochastic background is likely to be dominated by eccentric sources within the Milky Way, thus introducing anisotropy and time dependence in LISA's detection. However, given efficient search strategies to identify GW transients from highly eccentric binaries, the unresolvable noise level can be substantially lower, approaching $\sim 2$ orders of magnitude below the LISA noise curve. Therefore, we highlight the importance of characterizing stellar-mass GW sources with extreme eccentricity, especially their transient GW signals in the millihertz band.</description>

      <title>Local-in-time Conservative Binary Dynamics at Fourth Post-Minkowskian Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging scattering information to describe binary systems in generic orbits requires identifying local- and nonlocal-in-time tail effects. We report here the derivation of the universal (non-spinning) local-in-time conservative dynamics at fourth Post-Minkowskian order, i.e. ${\cal O}(G^4)$. This is achieved by computing the nonlocal-in-time contribution to the deflection angle, and removing it from the full conservative value in [2112.11296,2210.05541]. Unlike the total result, the integration problem involves two scales, velocity and mass ratio, and features multiple polylogarithms, complete elliptic and iterated elliptic integrals, notably in the mass ratio. We reconstruct the local radial action, center-of-mass momentum and Hamiltonian, as well as the exact logarithmic-dependent part(s), all valid for generic orbits. We incorporate the remaining nonlocal terms for elliptic-like motion to sixth Post-Newtonian order. The combined Hamiltonian is in perfect agreement in the overlap with the Post-Newtonian state of the art. The results presented here provide the most accurate description of gravitationally-bound binaries harnessing scattering data to date, readily applicable to waveform modelling.</description>

      <title>Deep-Learning Classification and Parameter Inference of Rotational Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test Deep-Learning (DL) techniques for the analysis of rotational core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) gravitational-wave (GW) signals by performing classification and parameter inference of the GW strain amplitude ($D \cdot \Delta h $) and the maximum (peak) frequency $(f_\textrm{peak})$, attained at core bounce. Our datasets are built from a catalog of numerically generated CCSN waveforms assembled by Richers 2017. Those waveforms are injected into noise from the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors corresponding to the O2 and O3a observing runs. For a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) above 5, our classification network using time series detects Galactic CCSN GW signals buried in detector noise with a false positive rate (FPR) of 0.10% and a 98% accuracy, being able to detect all signals with SNR&gt;10. The inference of $f_\textrm{peak}$ is more accurate than for $D \cdot \Delta h $, particularly for our datasets with the shortest time window (0.25 s) and for a minimum SNR=15. From the calibration plots of predicted versus true values of the two parameters, the standard deviation ($\sigma$) and the slope deviation with respect to the ideal value are computed. We find $\sigma_{D \cdot \Delta h}$ = 52.6cm and $\sigma_{f_\textrm{peak}}$ = 18.3Hz, with respective slope deviations of 11.6% and 8.3%. Our best model is also tested on waveforms from a recent CCSN catalog built by Mitra 2023, different from the one used for the training. For these new waveforms the true values of the two parameters are mostly within the 1$\sigma$ band around the network's predicted values. Our results show that DL techniques hold promise to infer physical parameters of Galactic rotational CCSN even in the presence of real (non-Gaussian) noise conditions from current GW detectors.</description>

      <title>Improving the Cosmological Constraints by Inferring the Formation Channel of Extreme-mass-ratio Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme-mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) could be detected by space-borne gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), TianQin and Taiji. In general, locating EMRIs by space-borne GW detectors can help us select the candidate host galaxies which can be used to infer the cosmic expansion history. In this paper, we show that the localization information of EMRIs can also be used to select the candidate host AGNs which can be used to infer the formation channel of the EMRIs and extract more precisely the redshift probability distributions of the EMRIs. Using the EMRIs that are expected to be detected by TianQin and LISA and the galaxy catalog that can be provided by the Chinese Space Station Telescope for the analysis, we find that TianQin can constrain the Hubble-Lema\^itre constant $H_0$ to a precision of about $3\%-8\%$ and the dark energy equation of state parameter $w_0$ to about $10\%-40\%$, the network composed of TianQin and LISA can improve the precisions of $H_0$ and $w_0$ to about $0.4\% - 7\%$ and $4\%-20\%$, respectively, without considering the effects of AGNs. Furthermore, combining the detected EMRIs with AGN catalog by the statistical framework of likelihood-ratio-based, we find TianQin can establish the EMRI-AGN correlation with about $500$ EMRIs if all of the EMRIs indeed originate in AGNs, and the TianQin+LISA network can reduce this required number to about $30$. Once the EMRI-AGN correlation is confirmed, the combination of the EMRIs and AGN catalog can significantly improve the constraints on the cosmological parameters. These results demonstrate the potentials of using EMRIs as well as galaxy and AGN catalogs to constrain the cosmological parameters and astrophysical models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The universal eigenvalue distribution characterizing the Gram matrix of semiclassical ensembles of black hole microstates is recognized as the Marchenko-Pastur distribution, which plays a prominent role as the universal limit distribution in a large class of random matrix and vector models. It is proposed that this distribution also universally determines the energy spectral density of black holes, which allows to construct a Krylov space for the time evolution of typical black hole states and calculate their state complexity. It is checked that the state complexity growth at late times saturates Lloyd's bound. Some implications of the proposed spectral density for the generation of Hawking radiation and black hole evaporation are discussed.</description>

      <title>The minimal cosmological standard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel minimal scenario which simultaneously addresses the following theoretical/cosmological/phenomenological puzzles: (i) the origin of scales, (ii) primordial inflation, (iii) matter-antimatter asymmetry, (iv) tiny neutrino masses, (v) dark matter, and (vi) the strong CP-problem. Exact scale-symmetry was assumed. A global $U(1)_{\rm PQ}$-symmetry was also assumed but only in the matter sector. The novelty of the scenario is the introduction of an explicit $U(1)_{\rm PQ}$-breaking term in the gravity sector only. Such a term does not disturb the axion solution whereas naturally realizes an axi-majoron hybrid inflation which allows a natural realization of Affleck-Dine mechanism for generating Peccei-Quinn number asymmetry. The asymmetry is transferred to the visible sector via the right-handed neutrino portal through non-thermal decay and/or thermal processes, even without the presence of a CP-violating phase in the matter sector. Dark matter and dark radiation are obtained by cold and hot components of axi-majorons, respectively.</description>

      <title>Spinning Particle Geometries in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study spinning particle/defect geometries in the context of AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$. These solutions lie below the BTZ threshold, and can be obtained from identifications of AdS$_3$. We construct the Feynman propagator by solving the bulk equation of motion in the spinning particle geometry, summing over the modes of the fields and passing to the boundary. The quantization of the scalar fields becomes challenging when confined to the regions that are causally well-behaved. If the region containing closed timelike curves (CTCs) is included, the normalization of the scalar fields enjoys an analytical simplification and the propagator can be expressed as an infinite sum over image geodesics. In the dual CFT$_2$, the propagator can be recast as the HHLL four-point function, where by taking into account the $PSL (2,\mathbb{Z})$ modular images, we recover the bulk computation. We comment on the casual behavior of bulk geometries associated with single-trace operators of spin scaling with the central charge below the BTZ threshold.</description>

      <title>Classically and Quantum Stable Emergent Universe in a Jordan-Brans-Dicke Theory</title>

Abstract: The study of Emergent Universe models is based on the assumption that the universe emerged from a past eternal Einstein Static (ES) state towards an inflationary phase and then evolves into a hot big bang era. These models are appealing since they provide specific examples of nonsingular (geodesically complete) inflationary universes. However, it has been pointed out by Mithani-Vilenkin that certain Emergent Universe scenarios which have a classically stable ES state could experience a semiclassical instability and collapse. In this paper, we investigate the classical and quantum stability of the ES regime of Emergent Universes within the framework of Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory. We demonstrate that when considering these models, it is possible to have both, classical and semiclassical stability of the ES state without addressing the instability highlighted by Mithani-Vilenkin.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes and Greybody factors of de Sitter Black holes surrounded by Quintessence in Rastall gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we have studied the quasinormal mode, greybody factors, and absorption cross section of de Sitter Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole surrounded by quintessence field in Rastall gravity. The violation of energy-momentum conservation has a non-linear effect on the quasinormal modes. With an increase in the black hole charge, both real parts of quasinormal modes i.e. oscillation frequency of ring-down Gravitational Waves (GWs) and damping or decay rate of GWs increase non-linearly. A similar observation is made for the black hole structural parameter also, however in this case the variation is almost linear. The remnant mass of a black hole depends on different physical parameters of a black hole. In the case of greybody factors also, we observed that both parameters have similar impacts. With an increase in these parameters, greybody factors decrease. Moreover, the null geodesics and the impact of Rastall gravity on the light trajectory are also investigated. Our study suggests that the presence of a surrounding quintessence field may shadow the existence of black hole charges in such black hole configurations.</description>

      <title>Observational properties of hot-spots orbiting relativistic fluid spheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we analyze the observational properties of relativistic fluid spheres when orbited by isotropically emitting sources, known as hot spots. We consider fluid star configurations in four different regimes of compacticity, from the Buchdahl limit to non-ultra compact solutions, thus obtaining fluid stars with qualitatively different geodesic structures and observational properties. We show that the observational properties for fluid stars at the Buchdahl limit are qualitatively similar to the ones for the Schwarzschild black hole, whereas for more dilute configurations one can find observational properties similar to other fundamentally different models e.g. bosonic star configurations with and without self interactions. For solutions with a radius in the range $2.25M&lt;R&lt;3M$, where $M$ is the total mass of the fluid star, the presence of a light-ring (LR) pair, which becomes degenerate at $R=3M$, leads to the appearance of additional observational signatures e.g. secondary images and LR contributions, which allow one to distinguish these models from their black-hole counterparts. Fluid star configurations supported by thin shells are also analyzed and it is proven that the stability of the inner LR is increased for these solutions, resulting in a non-differentiable extremum in the effective potential of the photons. Our results suggest that compact fluid star configurations provide a suitable and physically relevant alternative to the black-hole scenario in accordance with the current generation of observational experiments.</description>

      <title>Universality of the quantum energy flux at the inner horizon of asymptotically de Sitter black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, it was found that the energy flux of a free scalar quantum field on a Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter spacetime has a quadratic divergence towards the inner horizon of the black hole. Moreover, the leading divergence was found to be state independent as long as the spectral gap of the wave equation on the spacetime is sufficiently large. In this work, we show that the latter result can be extended to all subextremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter and subextremal Kerr-de Sitter spacetimes with a positive spectral gap.</description>

      <title>Junction conditions in gravity theories with extra scalar degrees of freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we present a general method to obtain the junction conditions of modified theories of gravity whose action can be written in the form $f\left(X_1,...,X_n\right)$, where $X_1$ to $X_n$ are any combination of scalar dependencies, e.g. the Ricci scalar $R$, the trace of the stress-energy tensor $T$, the Gauss-Bonnet invariant $\mathcal G$, among others. We discriminate the junction conditions into three sub-groups: the immediate conditions, arising from the imposition of regularity of the relevant quantities in the distribution formalism; the differential conditions, arising from the differential terms in the field equations; and the coupling conditions, arising from the interaction between different scalars $X_i$. Writing the modified field equations in terms of a linear combination of the different contributions of the scalars $X_i$ allows one to analyze the direct and differential junction conditions independently for each of these scalars, whereas the coupling junction conditions can be analyzed separately afterwards. We show that the coupling junction conditions induced on a scalar $X_i$ due to a coupling with a scalar $X_j$ are of the same form as the differential junction conditions of the scalar $X_j$, but applied to the analogous quantity in the framework of the scalar $X_i$. We provide a complete analysis of three different types of spacetime matching, namely smooth matching, matching with a thin-shell, and matching with double gravitational layers, and we also describe under which conditions the full sets of junction conditions might be simplified. Our results are applicable to several well-known theories of gravity e.g. $f\left(R\right)$, $f\left(T\right)$, and $f\left(\mathcal G\right)$, and can be straightforwardly extrapolated to other theories with scalar dependencies and more complicated scenarios where several dependencies are present simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Dynamical tidal response of non-rotating relativistic stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately modeling the tidal response of neutron stars is crucial to connecting gravitational wave observations of binaries to ultra-dense nuclear physics. Most current models of the tidal response of relativistic stars either assume a static response model, or use phenomenological models inspired by Newtonian gravity. In this work, we present a general formalism for computing the linear dynamical tidal response function of relativistic, spherically symmetric stars. Our formalism incorporates stratification due to thermal and chemical imbalances, allowing one to study the effects of g modes on the tidal response function. We also describe how to incorporate sources of dissipation due to shear and bulk viscosity. To showcase the utility of our approach, we present several applications for polytropic stars in general relativity. We show how our formalism can capture the dynamical tidal resonance due to the f and g modes of inviscid stars and explore the sensitivity of the dynamical tidal response to the compactness of the star. We also compute the dissipative tidal deformability due to bulk and shear viscous dissipation. We find that, for the same viscous profile, the shear viscous tidal lag parameter is 100-1000 times larger than the dimensionless bulk viscous tidal lag parameter.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the heat kernel method for one-loop effective action following the Seeley-DeWitt expansion technique of heat kernel with Seeley-DeWitt coefficients. We also review a general approach of computing the Seeley-DeWitt coefficients in terms of background or geometric invariants. We, then consider the Einstein-Maxwell theory embedded in minimal $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity in four dimensions and compute the first three Seeley-DeWitt coefficients of the kinetic operator of the bosonic and the fermionic fields in an arbitrary background field configuration. We find the applications of these results in the computation of logarithmic corrections to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the extremal Kerr-Newman, Kerr and Reissner-Nordstrom black holes in minimal $\mathcal{N}=2$ Einstein-Maxwell supergravity theory following the quantum entropy function formalism.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Edge Mode in Asymptotically AdS$_2$: JT Gravity Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06088v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the gravitational edge mode of the Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity and its $sl(2,\mathbb{R})$ BF theory description with the asymptotic AdS$_2$ boundary condition. We revisit the derivation of the Schwarzian theory from the wiggling boundary as an action for the gravitational edge mode. We present an alternative description for the gravitational edge mode from the metric fluctuation with the fixed boundary, which is often referred as "would-be gauge mode". We clarify the relation between the wiggling boundary and the would-be gauge mode. We demonstrate a natural top-down derivation of $PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$ gauging and the path integral measure of the Schwarzian theory. In the $sl(2,\mathbb{R})$ BF theory, we incorporate the gravitational edge mode and derive the Schwarzian theory with $PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$ gauging. We also discuss the path integral measure from the Haar measure in the Iwasawa decomposition of $PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that volume-preserving diffomorphisms and the chemical shift symmetry defining relativistic lagrangian ideal fluid dynamics can be derived as an emerging symmetry when ergodicity is assumed to apply locally in a way that is invariant under smooth spacetime foliations. This can be used as a way to derive the ideal hydrodynamic limit in a strongly coupled but strongly fluctuating medium.
  We comment on the connection with thermalization in small systems, the Eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and deviations from the ideal limit.</description>

      <title>On counterexamples to unique continuation for critically singular wave equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider wave equations with a critically singular potential $\xi \cdot \sigma^{-2}$ diverging as an inverse square at a hypersurface $\sigma = 0$. Our aim is to construct counterexamples to unique continuation from $\sigma = 0$ for this equation, provided there exists a family of null geodesics trapped near $\sigma = 0$. This extends the classical geometric optics construction of Alinhac-Baouendi (i) to linear differential operators with singular coefficients, and (ii) over non-small portions of $\sigma = 0$ - by showing that such counterexamples can be further continued as long as this null geodesic family remains trapped and regular. As an application to relativity and holography, we construct counterexamples to unique continuation from the conformal boundaries of asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spacetimes for some Klein-Gordon equations; this complements the unique continuation results of the second author with Chatzikaleas, Holzegel, and McGill and suggests a potential mechanism for counterexamples to the AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>Confinement from Distance in Metric Space and its Relation to Cosmological Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that, in a theory of quantum gravity, the gauge coupling and the confinement scale of a gauge theory are related to distance in the space of metric configurations, and in turn to the cosmological constant. To support the argument, we compute the gauge kinetic functions in variuos supersymmetric Heterotic and type II string compactifications and show that they depend on distance. According to the swampland program, the distance between two (anti) de Sitter vacua in the space of metric configurations is proportional to the logarithm of the ratio of cosmological constants and thus the confinement scale depends on the value of the cosmological constant. In this framework, for de Sitter space, we revisit the swampland Festina Lente bound and gauge theories in the dark dimension scenario. We show that if the Festina Lente bound is realized in a de Sitter vacuum and dependence on distance is strong enough, it will be realized in vacua with higher cosmological constants. In dark dimension scenario, as the value of cosmological constant is related to the decompactifying dimension, we find that the confinement scale is indeed related to radius of dark dimension. We show that in this scenario the Festina Lente bound holds for the standard model QCD, as well as all confining gauge groups with $N_c\lesssim 10^3$.</description>

Abstract: We consider $f(R,T)$ modified theories of gravity in the context of string theory inspired dilaton gravity. We deal with a specific model that under certain conditions describes the late time Universe in accord with observational data in modern cosmology and addresses the $H_0$ tension. This is done by exploring the space of parameters made out of those coming from the modified gravity and dilatonic charge sectors. We employ numerical methods to obtain several important observable quantities.</description>

Abstract: We report on a direct search for scalar field dark matter using data from LIGO's third observing run. We analyse the coupling of size oscillations of the interferometer's beamsplitter and arm test masses that may be caused by scalar field dark matter. Using new efficient search methods to maximise sensitivity for signatures of such oscillations, we set new upper limits for the coupling constants of scalar field dark matter as a function of its mass, which improve upon bounds from previous direct searches by several orders of magnitude in a frequency band from 10 Hz to 180 Hz.</description>

      <title>Induced Gravitational Wave interpretation of PTA data: a complete study for general equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We thoroughly study the induced gravitational wave interpretation of the possible gravitational wave background reported by PTA collaborations, considering the unknown equation of state $w$ of the early universe. We perform a Bayesian analysis of the NANOGrav data using the publicly available \textsc{PTArcade} code together with \textsc{SIGWfast} for the numerical integration of the induced gravitational wave spectrum. We focus on two cases: a monochromatic and a log-normal primordial spectrum of fluctuations. For the log-normal spectrum, we show that, while the results are not very sensitive to $w$ when the GW peak is close to the PTA window, radiation domination is out of the $2\sigma$ contours when only the infra-red power-law tail contributes. For the monochromatic spectrum, the $2\sigma$ bounds yield $0.1\lesssim w\lesssim0.9$ so that radiation domination is close to the central value. We also investigate the primordial black hole (PBH) counterpart using the peak formalism. We show that, in general terms, a larger width and stiffer equation of state alleviates the overproduction of PBHs. No PBH overproduction requires $w\gtrsim0.42$ up to 2-$\sigma$ level for the monochromatic spectrum. Furthermore, including bounds from the cosmic microwave background, we find in general that the mass range of the PBH counterpart is bounded by $10^{-5} M_\odot\lesssim M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim10^{-1} M_\odot$. Lastly, we find that the PTA signal can explain the microlensing events reported by OGLE for $0.42\lesssim w\lesssim 0.50$. Our work showcases a complete treatment of induced gravitational waves and primordial black holes for general $w$ for future data analysis.</description>

Despite the impossibility of obtaining general analytical solutions, statistical theories have been developed based on the ergodic principle. This assumption is justified by chaos, which is expected to fully mix the accessible phase space of the 3BP. This study probes the presence of regular (i.e. non chaotic) trajectories within the 3BP and assesses their impact on statistical escape theories. Using numerical simulations, we establish criteria for identifying regular trajectories and analyse their impact on statistical outcomes. Our analysis reveals that regular trajectories occupy up to 32% of the phase space, and their outcomes defy the predictions of statistical escape theories. The coexistence of regular and chaotic regions at all scales is characterized by a multi-fractal behaviour. Integration errors manifest as numerical chaos, artificially enhancing the mixing of the phase space and affecting the reliability of individual simulations, yet preserving the statistical correctness of an ensemble of realizations. Our findings underscore the challenges in applying statistical escape theories to astrophysical problems, as they may bias results by excluding the outcome of regular trajectories. This is particularly important in the context of formation scenarios of gravitational wave mergers, where biased estimates of binary eccentricity can significantly impact estimates of coalescence efficiency and detectable eccentricity.</description>
