      <title>Foundation Time-Series AI Model for Realized Volatility Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series foundation models (FMs) have emerged as a popular paradigm for zero-shot multi-domain forecasting. These models are trained on numerous diverse datasets and claim to be effective forecasters across multiple different time series domains, including financial data. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of FMs, specifically the TimesFM model, for volatility forecasting, a core task in financial risk management. We first evaluate TimesFM in its pretrained (zero-shot) form, followed by our custom fine-tuning procedure based on incremental learning, and compare the resulting models against standard econometric benchmarks. While the pretrained model provides a reasonable baseline, our findings show that incremental fine-tuning, which allows the model to adapt to new financial return data over time, is essential for learning volatility patterns effectively. Fine-tuned variants not only improve forecast accuracy but also statistically outperform traditional models, as demonstrated through Diebold-Mariano and Giacomini-White tests. These results highlight the potential of foundation models as scalable and adaptive tools for financial forecasting-capable of delivering strong performance in dynamic market environments when paired with targeted fine-tuning strategies.</description>

      <title>Why is the volatility of single stocks so much rougher than that of the S&amp;P500?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Nested factor model was introduced by Chicheportiche et al. to represent non-linear correlations between stocks. Stock returns are explained by a standard factor model, but the (log)-volatilities of factors and residuals are themselves decomposed into factor modes, with a common dominant volatility mode affecting both market and sector factors but also residuals. Here, we consider the case of a single factor where the only dominant log-volatility mode is rough, with a Hurst exponent $H \simeq 0.11$ and the log-volatility residuals are ''super-rough'', with $H \simeq 0$. We demonstrate that such a construction naturally accounts for the somewhat surprising stylized fact reported by Wu et al. , where it has been observed that the Hurst exponents of stock indexes are large compared to those of individual stocks. We propose a statistical procedure to estimate the Hurst factor exponent from the stock returns dynamics together with theoretical guarantees of its consistency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through numerical experiments and apply it to daily stock data from the S&amp;P500 index. The estimated roughness exponents for both the factor and idiosyncratic components validate the assumptions underlying our model.</description>
