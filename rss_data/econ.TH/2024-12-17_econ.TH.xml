      <title>Quantifying Educational Competition: A Game-Theoretic Model with Policy Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The competitive pressures in China's primary and secondary education system have persisted despite decades of policy interventions aimed at reducing academic burdens and alleviating parental anxiety. This paper develops a game-theoretic model to analyze the strategic interactions among families in this system, revealing how competition escalates into a socially irrational "education arms race." Through equilibrium analysis and simulations, the study demonstrates the inherent trade-offs between education equity and social welfare, alongside the policy failures arising from biased social cognition. The model is further extended using Spence's signaling framework to explore the inefficiencies of the current system and propose policy solutions that address these issues.</description>

      <title>Navigating through Economic Complexity: Phase Diagrams &amp; Parameter Sloppiness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that establishing the phase diagram of Agent Based Models (ABM) is a crucial first step, together with a qualitative understanding of how collective phenomena come about, before any calibration or more quantitative predictions are attempted. Computer-aided *gedanken* experiments are by themselves of genuine value: if we are not able to make sense of emergent phenomena in a world in which we set all the rules, how can we expect to be successful in the real world? ABMs indeed often reveal the existence of Black Swans/Dark Corners i.e. discontinuity lines beyond which runaway instabilities appear, whereas most classical economic/finance models are blind to such scenarii. Testing for the overall robustness of the phase diagram against changes in heuristic rules is a way to ascertain the plausibility of such scenarii. Furthermore, exploring the phase diagrams of ABM in high dimensions should benefit enormously from the identification of ``stiff'' and ``sloppy'' directions in parameter space.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Inefficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We axiomatically define a cardinal social inefficiency function, which, given a set of alternatives and individuals' vNM preferences over the alternatives, assigns a unique number -- the social inefficiency -- to each alternative. These numbers -- and not only their order -- are uniquely defined by our axioms despite no exogenously given interpersonal comparison, outside option, or disagreement point. We interpret these numbers as per capita losses in endogenously normalized utility. We apply our social inefficiency function to a setting in which interpersonal comparison is notoriously hard to justify -- object allocation without money -- leveraging techniques from computer science to prove an approximate-efficiency result for the Random Serial Dictatorship mechanism.</description>

      <title>Optimal Strategy-proof Mechanisms on Single-crossing Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an economic environment with one buyer and one seller. For a bundle $(t,q)\in [0,\infty[\times [0,1]=\mathbb{Z}$, $q$ refers to the winning probability of an object, and $t$ denotes the payment that the buyer makes. We consider continuous and monotone preferences on $\mathbb{Z}$ as the primitives of the buyer. These preferences can incorporate both quasilinear and non-quasilinear preferences, and multidimensional pay-off relevant parameters. We define rich single-crossing subsets of this class and characterize strategy-proof mechanisms by using monotonicity of the mechanisms and continuity of the indirect preference correspondences. We also provide a computationally tractable optimization program to compute the optimal mechanism for mechanisms with finite range. We do not use revenue equivalence and virtual valuations as tools in our proofs. Our proof techniques bring out the geometric interaction between the single-crossing property and the positions of bundles $(t,q)$s in the space $\mathbb{Z}$. We also provide an extension of our analysis to an $n-$buyer environment, and to the situation where $q$ is a qualitative variable.</description>

      <title>Paid with Models: Optimal Contract Design for Collaborative Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collaborative machine learning (CML) provides a promising paradigm for democratizing advanced technologies by enabling cost-sharing among participants. However, the potential for rent-seeking behaviors among parties can undermine such collaborations. Contract theory presents a viable solution by rewarding participants with models of varying accuracy based on their contributions. However, unlike monetary compensation, using models as rewards introduces unique challenges, particularly due to the stochastic nature of these rewards when contribution costs are privately held information. This paper formalizes the optimal contracting problem within CML and proposes a transformation that simplifies the non-convex optimization problem into one that can be solved through convex optimization algorithms. We conduct a detailed analysis of the properties that an optimal contract must satisfy when models serve as the rewards, and we explore the potential benefits and welfare implications of these contract-driven CML schemes through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Weak Strategyproofness in Randomized Social Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important -- but very demanding -- property in collective decision-making is strategyproofness, which requires that voters cannot benefit from submitting insincere preferences. Gibbard (1977) has shown that only rather unattractive rules are strategyproof, even when allowing for randomization. However, Gibbard's theorem is based on a rather strong interpretation of strategyproofness, which deems a manipulation successful if it increases the voter's expected utility for at least one utility function consistent with his ordinal preferences. In this paper, we study weak strategyproofness, which deems a manipulation successful if it increases the voter's expected utility for all utility functions consistent with his ordinal preferences. We show how to systematically design attractive, weakly strategyproof social decision schemes (SDSs) and explore their limitations for both strict and weak preferences. In particular, for strict preferences, we show that there are weakly strategyproof SDSs that are either ex post efficient or Condorcet-consistent, while neither even-chance SDSs nor pairwise SDSs satisfy both properties and weak strategyproofness at the same time. By contrast, for the case of weak preferences, we discuss two sweeping impossibility results that preclude the existence of appealing weakly strategyproof SDSs.</description>

      <title>Collective Sampling: An Ex Ante Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05758v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study collective dynamic information acquisition. Players decide when to stop sequential sampling via a collective stopping rule, which specifies decisive coalitions that can terminate information acquisition upon agreement. I develop a methodology to characterize equilibria using an ex ante perspective. Instead of stopping strategies, players choose distributions over posterior beliefs subject to majorization constraints. Equilibrium sampling regions are characterized via a fixed-point argument based on concavification. Collective sampling generates learning inefficiencies and having more decisive coalitions typically reduces learning. I apply the model to committee search and competition in persuasion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a multi-agent contract design problem with moral hazard. In our model, each agent exerts costly effort towards an individual task at which it may either succeed or fail, and the principal, who wishes to encourage effort, has an exclusive-use budget that it can use to reward the agents. We first show that any optimal contract must distribute the entire budget among the successful agents. Moreover, every such contract is optimal for some objective function. Our main contribution is then to introduce a novel class of contracts, which we call Luce contracts, and show that there is always a Luce contract that is optimal. A (generic) Luce contract assigns weights to the agents and distributes the entire budget among the successful agents in proportion to their weights. Lastly, we characterize effort profiles that can be implemented by Luce contracts, and note that Luce contracts offer a desirable alternative for implementation over commonly studied contracts, like piece-rate and bonus-pool contracts, on account of their reward variance-minimizing property.</description>

      <title>Designing Social Learning</title>

Abstract: This paper studies strategic communication in the context of social learning. Product reviews are used by consumers to learn product quality, but in order to write a review, a consumer must be convinced to purchase the item first. When reviewers care about welfare of future consumers, this leads to a conflict: a reviewer today wants the future consumers to purchase the item even when this comes at a loss to them, so that more information is revealed for the consumers that come after. We show that due to this conflict, communication via reviews is inevitably noisy, regardless of whether reviewers can commit to a communication strategy or have to resort to cheap talk. The optimal communication mechanism involves truthful communication of extreme experiences and pools the moderate experiences together.</description>

      <title>Learning to be Indifferent in Complex Decisions: A Coarse Payoff-Assessment Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Coarse Payoff-Assessment Learning (CPAL) model, which captures reinforcement learning by boundedly rational decision-makers who focus on the aggregate outcomes of choosing among exogenously defined clusters of alternatives (similarity classes), rather than evaluating each alternative individually. Analyzing a smooth approximation of the model, we show that the learning dynamics exhibit steady-states corresponding to smooth Valuation Equilibria (Jehiel and Samet, 2007). We demonstrate the existence of multiple equilibria in decision trees with generic payoffs and establish the local asymptotic stability of pure equilibria when they occur. Conversely, when trivial choices featuring alternatives within the same similarity class yield sufficiently high payoffs, a unique mixed equilibrium emerges, characterized by indifferences between similarity classes, even under acute sensitivity to payoff differences. Finally, we prove that this unique mixed equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable under the CPAL dynamics.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Collusion Without Threats</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been substantial recent concern that pricing algorithms might learn to ``collude.'' Supra-competitive prices can emerge as a Nash equilibrium of repeated pricing games, in which sellers play strategies which threaten to punish their competitors who refuse to support high prices, and these strategies can be automatically learned. In fact, a standard economic intuition is that supra-competitive prices emerge from either the use of threats, or a failure of one party to optimize their payoff. Is this intuition correct? Would preventing threats in algorithmic decision-making prevent supra-competitive prices when sellers are optimizing for their own revenue? No. We show that supra-competitive prices can emerge even when both players are using algorithms which do not encode threats, and which optimize for their own revenue. We study sequential pricing games in which a first mover deploys an algorithm and then a second mover optimizes within the resulting environment. We show that if the first mover deploys any algorithm with a no-regret guarantee, and then the second mover even approximately optimizes within this now static environment, monopoly-like prices arise. The result holds for any no-regret learning algorithm deployed by the first mover and for any pricing policy of the second mover that obtains them profit at least as high as a random pricing would -- and hence the result applies even when the second mover is optimizing only within a space of non-responsive pricing distributions which are incapable of encoding threats. In fact, there exists a set of strategies, neither of which explicitly encode threats that form a Nash equilibrium of the simultaneous pricing game in algorithm space, and lead to near monopoly prices. This suggests that the definition of ``algorithmic collusion'' may need to be expanded, to include strategies without explicitly encoded threats.</description>
