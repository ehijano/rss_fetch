      <title>Temperature Mapping in Urban Biomes Using an Infrared Thermometer: An Investigative Approach to Physics Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the frequency of extreme weather events on Earth has increased significantly. This phenomenon is driven by the intensification of the greenhouse effect caused by anthropogenic activities, leading to temperature variations in urban environments that affect thermal comfort and quality of life. Given this context, the present study investigates temperature mapping in urban biomes using an infrared thermometer, conducted as part of a hands-on workshop offered during the 21st National Science and Technology Week. The initiative involved students from the public school system and was grounded in Physics education, aiming to foster scientific enculturation. Participants engaged in a problem-based learning experience, actively contributing to all stages of the knowledge construction process. The objective was to examine the relationship between vegetation presence and its impact on temperature in urban environments. A qualitative and quantitative methodological approach was adopted, enabling the identification of scientific literacy indicators such as information sequencing, data organization, logical reasoning, hypothesis formulation, justification, and explanation of observed phenomena. The analysis of students' statements and activity guidelines provided insights into their critical thinking development. The findings indicate that students developed essential skills for understanding physical and environmental phenomena, effectively linking collected data to scientific concepts and proposing well-supported interpretations. Moreover, the experience reinforced the perception of science as a dynamic and investigative process, fostering curiosity and enhancing students' argumentative abilities. Thus, the workshop proved to be an effective strategy for promoting scientific literacy and engaging participants in the study of environmental impacts in urban contexts.</description>

      <title>Complex networks approach to curriculum analysis and subject integration: a case study on Physics and Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15929v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a methodological approach based on the use of complex networks to analyze the structure and content of curricula. We analyze the concept network built from the final year of a particular high school Physics curriculum, as well as that of Mathematics. We examine the most central nodes in each case, the community structures (coherent units or groupings), and the changes that occurred when the network was considered in isolation or integrated with Mathematics. The results show that the integrated Physics and Mathematics network has a higher average degree compared to the individual networks, driven by numerous interdisciplinary connections. The modularity analysis indicates similarities with the original curriculum layout, but also interesting differences that may suggest alternative ways of organizing the content. The differences between separated and integrated networks also highlights the prominence of certain key concepts.</description>

      <title>Simple and exact nonlinear pendulum motion for all possible initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16816v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simple and formally exact solutions of nonlinear pendulum are derived for all three classes of motion: swinging, stopping, and spinning. Their unique simplicity should be useful in a theoretical development that requires trackable mathematical framework or in an introductory physics course that aims to discuss nonlinear pendulum. A simple formula for the complete elliptical integral of the first kind is also proposed. It reproduces the exact analytical forms both in the zero and asymptotic limits, while in the midrange maintains average error of 0.06% and maximum error of 0.17%. The accuracy should be sufficient for typical engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Beyond Robertson-Schr\"odinger: A General Uncertainty Relation Unveiling Hidden Noncommutative Trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a universal strengthening of the Robertson-Schr\''odinger uncertainty relation, revealing a previously overlooked trade-off of genuinely quantum origin, particularly as the state becomes more mixed. Remarkably, this generalized bound supplements the standard commutator term and the covariance term with an additional positive contribution that depends on the commutator of observables. The relation also rigorously proves and extends a conjectured uncertainty relation previously proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 062215 (2024)]. For two-level quantum systems, the inequality becomes an exact equality for any state and any pair of observables, establishing that the bound is tight in the strongest possible sense.</description>
