      <title>In vivo imaging of central nervous system fluid spaces using synchrotron radiation-based micro computed tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current approaches to in vivo imaging of the mouse central nervous system (CNS) do not offer a combination of micrometer resolution and a whole-brain field of view. To address this limitation, we introduce an approach based on synchrotron radiation-based hard X-ray micro computed tomography (SR$\mu$CT). We performed intravital SR$\mu$CT acquisitions of mouse CNS fluid spaces at three synchrotron radiation facilities. Imaging was conducted on both anesthetized free-breathing and ventilated animals, with and without retrospective cardiac gating. We achieved whole-brain imaging at 6.3 $\mu$m uniform voxel size, observed the distribution of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contrast agent over time and quantified choroid plexus movement. SR$\mu$CT bridges the gap between multiphoton microscopy and magnetic resonance imaging, offering dynamic imaging with micrometer-scale resolution and whole-organ field of view. Intravital SR$\mu$CT will play a crucial role in validating and integrating hypotheses on CSF dynamics and solute transport by providing unique data that cannot be acquired otherwise.</description>

      <title>Emerging Frameworks for Objective Task-based Evaluation of Quantitative Medical Imaging Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative imaging (QI) is demonstrating strong promise across multiple clinical applications. For clinical translation of QI methods, objective evaluation on clinically relevant tasks is essential. To address this need, multiple evaluation strategies are being developed. In this paper, based on previous literature, we outline four emerging frameworks to perform evaluation studies of QI methods. We first discuss the use of virtual imaging trials (VITs) to evaluate QI methods. Next, we outline a no-gold-standard evaluation framework to clinically evaluate QI methods without ground truth. Third, a framework to evaluate QI methods for joint detection and quantification tasks is outlined. Finally, we outline a framework to evaluate QI methods that output multi-dimensional parameters, such as radiomic features. We review these frameworks, discussing their utilities and limitations. Further, we examine future research areas in evaluation of QI methods. Given the recent advancements in PET, including long axial field-of-view scanners and the development of artificial-intelligence algorithms, we present these frameworks in the context of PET.</description>

      <title>Clinical test cases for model-based dose calculation algorithm commissioning, QA and benchmarking, for 192Ir HDR brachytherapy of gynecologic cancers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop clinically relevant test cases for commissioning Model-Based Dose Calculation Algorithms (MBDCAs) for 192Ir High Dose Rate (HDR) gynecologic brachytherapy following the workflow proposed by the TG-186 report and the WGDCAB report 372. Acquisition and Validation Methods: Two cervical cancer intracavitary HDR brachytherapy patient models were created, using either uniformly structured regions or realistic segmentation. The computed tomography (CT) images of the models were converted to DICOM CT images via MATLAB and imported into two Treatment Planning Systems (TPSs) with MBDCA capability. The clinical segmentation was expanded to include additional organs at risk. The actual clinical treatment plan was generally maintained, with the source replaced by a generic 192Ir HDR source. Dose to medium in medium calculations were performed using the MBDCA option of each TPS, and three different Monte Carlo (MC) simulation codes. MC results agreed within statistical uncertainty, while comparisons between MBDCA and MC dose distributions highlighted both strengths and limitations of the studied MBDCAs, suggesting potential approaches to overcome the challenges. Data Format and Usage Notes: The datasets for the developed cases are available online at http://doi.org/ 10.5281/zenodo.15720996. The DICOM files include the treatment plan for each case, TPS, and the corresponding reference MC dose data. The package also contains a TPS- and case-specific user guide for commissioning the MBDCAs, and files needed to replicate the MC simulations. Potential Applications: The provided datasets and proposed methodology offer a commissioning framework for TPSs using MBDCAs, and serve as a benchmark for brachytherapy researchers using MC methods. They also facilitate intercomparisons of MBDCA performance and provide a quality assurance resource for evaluating future TPS software updates.</description>

      <title>Cancer cytoplasm segmentation in hyperspectral cell image with data augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E)-stained images are commonly used to detect nuclear or cancerous regions in cells from images captured by a microscope. Identifying cancer cytoplasm is crucial for determining the type of cancer; hence, obtaining accurate cancer cytoplasm regions in cell images is important. While CMOS images often lack detailed information necessary for diagnosis, hyperspectral images provide more comprehensive cell information. Using a deep learning model, we propose a method for detecting cancer cell cytoplasm in hyperspectral images. Deep learning models require large datasets for learning; however, capturing a large number of hyperspectral images is difficult. Additionally, hyperspectral images frequently contain instrumental noise, depending on the characteristics of the imaging devices. We propose a data augmentation method to account for instrumental noise. CMOS images were used for data augmentation owing to their visual clarity, which facilitates manual annotation compared to original hyperspectral images. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed data augmentation method both quantitatively and qualitatively.</description>

      <title>UltraDfeGAN: Detail-Enhancing Generative Adversarial Networks for High-Fidelity Functional Ultrasound Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functional ultrasound (fUS) is a neuroimaging technique known for its high spatiotemporal resolution, enabling non-invasive observation of brain activity through neurovascular coupling. Despite its potential in clinical applications such as neonatal monitoring and intraoperative guidance, the development of fUS faces challenges related to data scarcity and limitations in generating realistic fUS images. This paper explores the use of a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework tailored for fUS image synthesis. The proposed method incorporates architectural enhancements, including feature enhancement modules and normalization techniques, aiming to improve the fidelity and physiological plausibility of generated images. The study evaluates the performance of the framework against existing generative models, demonstrating its capability to produce high-quality fUS images under various experimental conditions. Additionally, the synthesized images are assessed for their utility in downstream tasks, showing improvements in classification accuracy when used for data augmentation. Experimental results are based on publicly available fUS datasets, highlighting the framework's effectiveness in addressing data limitations.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing for genomics: conceptual challenges and practical perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We assess the potential of quantum computing to accelerate computation of central tasks in genomics, focusing on often-neglected theoretical limitations. We discuss state-of-the-art challenges of quantum search, optimization, and machine learning algorithms. Examining database search with Grover's algorithm, we show that the expected speedup vanishes under realistic assumptions. For combinatorial optimization prevalent in genomics, we discuss the limitations of theoretical complexity in practice and suggest carefully identifying problems genuinely suited for quantum acceleration. Given the competition from excellent classical approximate solvers, quantum computing could offer a speedup in the near future only for a specific subset of hard enough tasks in assembly, gene selection, and inference. These tasks need to be characterized by core optimization problems that are particularly challenging for classical methods while requiring relatively limited variables. We emphasize rigorous empirical validation through runtime scaling analysis to avoid misleading claims of quantum advantage. Finally, we discuss the problem of trainability and data-loading in quantum machine learning. This work advocates for a balanced perspective on quantum computing in genomics, guiding future research toward targeted applications and robust validation.</description>

      <title>Eikonal phase retrieval: Unleashing the fourth generation sources potential for enhanced propagation based tomography on biological samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14745v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of synchrotrons towards higher brilliance beams has increased the possible sample-to-detector propagation distances for which the source confusion circle does not lead to geometrical blurring. This makes it possible to push near-field propagation driven phase contrast enhancement to the limit, revealing low contrast features which would otherwise remain hidden under an excessive noise. Until today this possibility was hindered, in many objects of scientific interest, by the simultaneous presence of strong phase gradient regions and low contrast features. The strong gradients, when enhanced with the now possible long propagation distances, induce such strong phase effects that the linearisation assumptions of current state-of-the-art single-distance phase retrieval filters are broken, and the resulting image quality is jeopardized. Here, we introduce a new iterative phase-retrieval algorithm and compare it with the Paganin phase-retrieval algorithm, in both the monochromatic and polychromatic cases, obtaining superior image quality. In the polychromatic case the comparison was done with an extrapolated Paganin algorithm obtained by reintroducing, into our phase retrieval algorithm, the linearization approximations underlying the Paganin forward model. Our work provides an innovative algorithm which efficiently performs the phase retrieval task over the entire near-field range, producing images of exceptional quality for mixed attenuation objects.</description>

      <title>Label-free evaluation of lung and heart transplant biopsies using tissue autofluorescence-based virtual staining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Organ transplantation serves as the primary therapeutic strategy for end-stage organ failures. However, allograft rejection is a common complication of organ transplantation. Histological assessment is essential for the timely detection and diagnosis of transplant rejection and remains the gold standard. Nevertheless, the traditional histochemical staining process is time-consuming, costly, and labor-intensive. Here, we present a panel of virtual staining neural networks for lung and heart transplant biopsies, which digitally convert autofluorescence microscopic images of label-free tissue sections into their brightfield histologically stained counterparts, bypassing the traditional histochemical staining process. Specifically, we virtually generated Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E), Masson's Trichrome (MT), and Elastic Verhoeff-Van Gieson (EVG) stains for label-free transplant lung tissue, along with H&amp;E and MT stains for label-free transplant heart tissue. Subsequent blind evaluations conducted by three board-certified pathologists have confirmed that the virtual staining networks consistently produce high-quality histology images with high color uniformity, closely resembling their well-stained histochemical counterparts across various tissue features. The use of virtually stained images for the evaluation of transplant biopsies achieved comparable diagnostic outcomes to those obtained via traditional histochemical staining, with a concordance rate of 82.4% for lung samples and 91.7% for heart samples. Moreover, virtual staining models create multiple stains from the same autofluorescence input, eliminating structural mismatches observed between adjacent sections stained in the traditional workflow, while also saving tissue, expert time, and staining costs.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive characterization and validation of a fast-resolving (1000 Hz) plastic scintillator for ultra-high dose rate electron dosimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: The normal tissue sparing effect of ultra-high dose rate irradiation (&gt;40 Gy/s, UHDR), as compared to conventional dose rate (CONV), has attracted significant research interest for FLASH radiotherapy (RT). Accurate, dose rate independent, fast-responding dosimeters capable of resolving the spatiotemporal characteristics of UHDR beams are urgently needed to facilitate FLASH research and support its clinical translation. Tissue-equivalent scintillators, with millimeter-level spatial resolution and millisecond-level temporal resolution, possess these required characteristics and show strong potential for use in UHDR dosimetry. Purpose: We investigated the performance of the HYPERSCINT RP-FLASH scintillator system at up to 1000 Hz sampling frequency (fs) for UHDR electron beam dosimetry. Methods: The scintillator was exposed to CONV and UHDR electron irradiation using a LINAC-based FLASH platform. Its spectral characteristics were delineated with a four-component calibration, followed by a signal-to-dose calibration using 18 MeV CONV electron beam. The dose linearity and dosimetric accuracy in response to CONV and UHDR irradiation at 1 and 1000 Hz fs were quantified against ion chamber and EBT-XD film measurements. The response of the scintillator system was investigated as a function of beam energy (6 and 18 MeV), field size (2x2 to 25x25 cm2), dose per pulse (DPP, 0.8 to 2.3 Gy/pulse), and pulse repetition frequency (PRF, 30 to 180 Hz). Relative signal sensitivity was quantified against accumulated dose to account for the scintillator's radiation degradation. Pulse-resolved dose measurements at 18 MeV UHDR, obtained using the scintillator with 1000 Hz fs for a train of 10 pulses at 180 Hz PRF, were validated with a PMT-fiber optic scattered radiation detector.</description>

      <title>Signal-to-noise and spatial resolution in in-line imaging. 2. Phase-contrast tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20277v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the first part of this paper, quantitative aspects of propagation-based phase-contrast imaging (PBI) were investigated using theoretical and numerical approaches, as well as experimental two-dimensional PBI images collected with plane monochromatic X-rays at a synchrotron beamline. In this second part, signal-to-noise ratio, spatial resolution and contrast are studied in connection with the radiation dose in three-dimensional PBI images of breast tissue samples obtained using propagation-based phase-contrast computed tomography (PB-CT) with energy-integrating and photon-counting detectors. The analysis is based on the theory of PBI and PB-CT using the homogeneous Transport of Intensity equation (Paganin's method). A biomedical image quality characteristic, suitable for quantitative assessment of X-ray images of biological samples, is introduced and applied. The key factors leading to high values of the biomedical imaging quality in PBI and to relatively low values of the same quality metric in CT imaging are identified and discussed in detail. This study is aimed primarily at developing tools for quantitative assessment and optimization of medical PB-CT imaging, initially at synchrotron facilities, with the prospect of subsequent transfer of the technology to medical clinics.</description>

      <title>A Novel Automatic Real-time Motion Tracking Method in MRI-guided Radiotherapy Using Enhanced Tracking-Learning-Detection Framework with Automatic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07503v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background and Purpose: Accurate motion tracking in MRI-guided Radiotherapy (MRIgRT) is essential for effective treatment delivery. This study aimed to enhance motion tracking precision in MRIgRT through an automatic real-time markerless tracking method using an enhanced Tracking-Learning-Detection (ETLD) framework with automatic segmentation. Materials and Methods: We developed a novel MRIgRT motion tracking and segmentation method by integrating the ETLD framework with an improved Chan-Vese model (ICV), named ETLD+ICV. The ETLD framework was upgraded for real-time cine MRI, including advanced image preprocessing, no-reference image quality assessment, an enhanced median-flow tracker, and a refined detector with dynamic search region adjustments. ICV was used for precise target volume coverage, refining the segmented region frame by frame using tracking results, with key parameters optimized. The method was tested on 3.5D MRI scans from 10 patients with liver metastases. Results: Evaluation of 106,000 frames across 77 treatment fractions showed sub-millimeter tracking errors of less than 0.8mm, with over 99% precision and 98% recall for all subjects in the Beam Eye View(BEV)/Beam Path View(BPV) orientation. The ETLD+ICV method achieved a dice global score of more than 82% for all subjects, demonstrating the method's extensibility and precise target volume coverage. Conclusion: This study successfully developed an automatic real-time markerless motion tracking method for MRIgRT that significantly outperforms current methods. The novel method not only delivers exceptional precision in tracking and segmentation but also shows enhanced adaptability to clinical demands, making it an indispensable asset in improving the efficacy of radiotherapy treatments.</description>
