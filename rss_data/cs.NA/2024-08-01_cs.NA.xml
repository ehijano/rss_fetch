      <title>Sampling strategies for expectation values within the Herman--Kluk approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When computing quantum-mechanical observables, the ``curse of dimensionality'' limits the naive approach that uses the quantum-mechanical wavefunction. The semiclassical Herman--Kluk propagator mitigates this curse by employing a grid-free ansatz to evaluate the expectation values of these observables. Here, we investigate quadrature techniques for this high-dimensional and highly oscillatory propagator. In particular, we analyze Monte Carlo quadratures using three different initial sampling approaches. The first two, based either on the Husimi density or its square root, are independent of the observable whereas the third approach, which is new, incorporates the observable in the sampling to minimize the variance of the Monte Carlo integrand at the initial time. We prove sufficient conditions for the convergence of the Monte Carlo estimators and provide convergence error estimates. The analytical results are validated by numerical experiments in various dimensions on a harmonic oscillator and on a Henon-Heiles potential with an increasing degree of anharmonicity.</description>

      <title>Well-conditioned dipole-type method of fundamental solutions: derivation and its mathematical analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the dipole-type method of fundamental solutions, which can be conceptualized as a discretization of the "singularity-removed" double-layer potential. We present a method for removing the ill-conditionality, which was previously considered a significant challenge, and provide a mathematical analysis in the context of disk regions. Moreover, we extend the proposed method to the general Jordan region using conformal mapping, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed method through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Constraint Energy Minimizing Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method for Convection Diffusion Equations with Inhomogeneous Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the constraint energy minimizing generalized multiscale finite element method (CEM-GMsFEM) for convection-diffusion equations with inhomogeneous Dirichlet, Neumann and Robin boundary conditions, along with high-contrast coefficients. For time independent problems, boundary correctors $\mathcal{D}^m$ and $\mathcal{N}^{m}$ for Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin conditions are designed. For time dependent problems, a scheme to update the boundary correctors is formulated. Error analysis in both cases is given to show the first-order convergence in energy norm with respect to the coarse mesh size $H$ and second-order convergence in $L^2-$norm, as verified by numerical examples, with which different finite difference schemes are compared for temporal discretization. Nonlinear problems are also demonstrated in combination with Strang splitting.</description>

      <title>Polynomial quasi-Trefftz DG for PDEs with smooth coefficients: elliptic problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trefftz schemes are high-order Galerkin methods whose discrete spaces are made of elementwise exact solutions of the underlying PDE. Trefftz basis functions can be easily computed for many PDEs that are linear, homogeneous, and have piecewise-constant coefficients. However, if the equation has variable coefficients, exact solutions are generally unavailable. Quasi-Trefftz methods overcome this limitation relying on elementwise "approximate solutions" of the PDE, in the sense of Taylor polynomials.
  We define polynomial quasi-Trefftz spaces for general linear PDEs with smooth coefficients and source term, describe their approximation properties and, under a non-degeneracy condition, provide a simple algorithm to compute a basis. We then focus on a quasi-Trefftz DG method for variable-coefficient elliptic diffusion-advection-reaction problems, showing stability and high-order convergence of the scheme. The main advantage over standard DG schemes is the higher accuracy for comparable numbers of degrees of freedom. For non-homogeneous problems with piecewise-smooth source term we propose to construct a local quasi-Trefftz particular solution and then solve for the difference. Numerical experiments in 2 and 3 space dimensions show the excellent properties of the method both in diffusion-dominated and advection-dominated problems.</description>

      <title>Analysis of continuous data assimilation with large (or even infinite) nudging parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers continuous data assimilation (CDA) in partial differential equation (PDE) discretizations where nudging parameters can be taken arbitrarily large. We prove that long-time optimally accurate solutions are obtained for such parameters for the heat and Navier-Stokes equations (using implicit time stepping methods), with error bounds that do not grow as the nudging parameter gets large. Existing theoretical results either prove optimal accuracy but with the error scaled by the nudging parameter, or suboptimal accuracy that is independent of it. The key idea to the improved analysis is to decompose the error based on a weighted inner product that incorporates the (symmetric by construction) nudging term, and prove that the projection error from this weighted inner product is optimal and independent of the nudging parameter. We apply the idea to BDF2 - finite element discretizations of the heat equation and Navier-Stokes equations to show that with CDA, they will admit optimal long-time accurate solutions independent of the nudging parameter, for nudging parameters large enough. Several numerical tests are given for the heat equation, fluid transport equation, Navier-Stokes, and Cahn-Hilliard that illustrate the theory.</description>

      <title>Space-Time Isogeometric Method for a Nonlocal Parabolic Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we focus on the space-time isogeometric discretization of a parabolic problem with a nonlocal diffusion coefficient. The use of a space-time discretization with smooth basis functions yields advantages in the approximation of the solution. The existence of the unique solution for continuous and discrete space-time variational formulations is proven. We also establish the a priori error estimate for the space-time isogeometric scheme. The non-linear system is linearized through Picard's method and a suitable preconditioner for the linearized system is provided. Finally, to confirm the theoretical findings, results of some numerical experiments are presented.</description>

      <title>Absolute-value based preconditioner for complex-shifted Laplacian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex-shifted Laplacian systems arising in a wide range of applications. In this work, we propose an absolute-value based preconditioner for solving the complex-shifted Laplacian system. In our approach, the complex-shifted Laplacian system is equivalently rewritten as a $2\times 2$ block real linear system. With the Toeplitz structure of uniform-grid discretization of the constant-coefficient Laplacian operator, the absolute value of the block real matrix is fast invertible by means of fast sine transforms. For more general coefficient function, we then average the coefficient function and take the absolute value of the averaged matrix as our preconditioner. With assumptions on the complex shift, we theoretically prove that the eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrix in absolute value are upper and lower bounded by constants independent of matrix size, indicating a matrix-size independent linear convergence rate of MINRES solver. Interestingly, numerical results show that the proposed preconditioner is still efficient even if the assumptions on the complex shift are not met. The fast invertibility of the proposed preconditioner and the robust convergence rate of the preconditioned MINRES solver lead to a linearithmic (nearly optimal) complexity of the proposed solver. The proposed preconditioner is compared with several state-of-the-art preconditioners via several numerical examples to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed preconditioner.</description>

      <title>A note about high-order semi-implicit differentiation: application to a numerical integration scheme with Taylor-based compensated error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this brief, we discuss the implementation of a third order semi-implicit differentiator as a complement of the recent work by the author that proposes an interconnected semi-implicit Euler double differentiators algorithm through Taylor expansion refinement. The proposed algorithm is dual to the interconnected approach since it offers alternative flexibility to be tuned and to be implemented in real-time processes. In particular, an application to a numerical integration scheme is presented as the Taylor refinement can be of interest to improve the global convergence. Numerical results are presented to support the rightness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Predicting nonlinear-flow regions in highly heterogeneous porous media using adaptive constitutive laws and neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a porous medium featuring heterogeneous permeabilities, a wide range of fluid velocities may be recorded, so that significant inertial and frictional effects may arise in high-speed regions. In such parts, the link between pressure gradient and velocity is typically made via Darcy's law, which may fail to account for these effects; instead, the Darcy Forchheimer law, which introduces a nonlinear term, may be more adequate. Applying the Darcy Forchheimer law globally in the domain is very costly numerically and, rather, should only be done where strictly necessary. The question of finding a prori the subdomain where to restrict the use of the Darcy Forchheimer law was recently answered in FP23 by using an adaptive model: given a threshold on the flow velocity, the model locally selects the more appropriate law as it is being solved. At the end of the resolution, each mesh cell is flagged as being in the Darcy or Darcy Forchheimer subdomain. Still, this model is nonlinear itself and thus relatively expensive to run. In this paper, to accelerate the subdivision of the domain into low and high speed regions, we instead exploit the adaptive model from FP23 to generate partitioning data given an array of different input parameters, such as boundary conditions and inertial coefficients, and then train neural networks on these data classifying each mesh cell as Darcy or not. Two test cases are studied to illustrate the results, where cost functions, parity plots, precision-recall plots and receiver operating characteristic curves are analyzed.</description>

      <title>AMFR-W numerical methods for solving high dimensional SABR/LIBOR PDE models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we mainly develop a new numerical methodology to solve a PDE model recently proposed in the literature for pricing interest rate derivatives. More precisely, we use high order in time AMFR-W methods, which belong to a class of W-methods based on Approximate Matrix Factorization (AMF) and are especially suitable in the presence of mixed spatial derivatives. High-order convergence in time allows larger time steps which combined with the splitting of the involved operators, highly reduces the computational time for a given accuracy. Moreover, the consideration of a large number of underlying forward rates makes the PDE problem high dimensional in space, so the use of AMFR-W methods with a sparse grids combination technique represents another innovative aspect, making AMFR-W more efficient than with full grids and opening the possibility of parallelization. Also the consideration of new homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions provides another original feature to avoid the difficulties associated to the presence of boundary layers when using Dirichlet ones, especially in advection-dominated regimes. These Neumann boundary conditions motivate the introduction of a modified combination technique to overcome a decrease in the accuracy of the standard combination technique.</description>

      <title>Dimension reduction for large-scale stochastic systems with non-zero initial states and controlled diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish new strategies to reduce the dimension of large-scale controlled stochastic differential equations with non-zero initial states. The first approach transforms the original setting into a stochastic system with zero initial states. This transformation naturally leads to equations with controlled diffusion. A detailed analysis of dominant subspaces and bounds for the reduction error is provided in this controlled diffusion framework. Subsequently, we introduce a reduced system for the original framework and prove an a-priori error bound for the first ansatz. This bound involves so-called Hankel singular values that are linked to a new pair of Gramians. A second strategy is presented that is based on the idea of reducing control and initial state dynamics separately. Here, different Gramians are used in order to derive a reduced model and their relation to dominant subspaces are pointed out. We also show an a posteriori error bound for the second approach involving two types of Hankel singular values.</description>

      <title>Factorization of a prime matrix in even blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a matrix is said to be prime if the row and column of this matrix are both prime numbers. We establish various necessary and sufficient conditions for developing matrices into the sum of tensor products of prime matrices. For example, if the diagonal of a matrix blocked evenly are pairwise commutative, it yields such a decomposition. The computational complexity of multiplication of these algorithms is shown to be $O(n^{5/2})$. In the section 5, a decomposition is proved to hold if and only if every even natural number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers.</description>

      <title>Absorbing Boundary Conditions for Variable Potential Schr\"odinger Equations via Titchmarsh-Weyl Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to simulate the solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation with a general variable potential. The key idea is to approximate the Titchmarsh-Weyl m-function (exact Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator) by a rational function with respect to an appropriate spectral parameter. By using this method, we overcome the usual high-frequency restriction associated with absorbing boundary conditions in general variable potential problems. The resulting fast computational algorithm for absorbing boundary conditions ensures accuracy over the entire frequency range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this paper is to understand the superlinear convergence behavior of the inner-iteration preconditioned GMRES method. In order to understand the phenomenon, we analyze the convergence using the Vandermonde matrix which is defined using the eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix. Although eigenvalues alone cannot explain the convergence, they may provide an upper bound of the residual, together with the right hand side vector and the eigenvectors. For the diagonalizable case, if the eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix are clustered, the upper bound of the convergence curve shows superlinear convergence, when the norm of the matrix obtained by decomposing the right hand side vector into the eigenvector components is not so large. We especially analyze the effect of inner-iteration preconditioning for least squares problems, where the eigenvalues cluster towards 1.</description>

      <title>Solving cluster moment relaxation with hierarchical matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convex relaxation methods are powerful tools for studying the lowest energy of many-body problems. By relaxing the representability conditions for marginals to a set of local constraints, along with a global semidefinite constraint, a polynomial-time solvable semidefinite program (SDP) that provides a lower bound for the energy can be derived. In this paper, we propose accelerating the solution of such an SDP relaxation by imposing a hierarchical structure on the positive semidefinite (PSD) primal and dual variables. Furthermore, these matrices can be updated efficiently using the algebra of the compressed representations within an augmented Lagrangian method. We achieve quadratic and even near-linear time per-iteration complexity. Through experimentation on the quantum transverse field Ising model, we showcase the capability of our approach to provide a sufficiently accurate lower bound for the exact ground-state energy.</description>

      <title>The virtual element method on polygonal pixel-based tessellations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.03449v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze and validate the virtual element method combined with a boundary correction similar to the one in [1,2], to solve problems on two dimensional domains with curved boundaries approximated by polygonal domains. We focus on the case of approximating domains obtained as the union of squared elements out of a uniform structured mesh, such as the one that naturally arises when the domain is issued from an image. We show, both theoretically and numerically, that resorting to polygonal elements allows the assumptions required for stability to be satisfied for any polynomial order. This allows us to fully exploit the potential of higher order methods. Efficiency is ensured by a novel static condensation strategy acting on the edges of the decomposition.</description>

      <title>Sketched and truncated polynomial Krylov methods: Evaluation of matrix functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06481v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among randomized numerical linear algebra strategies, so-called sketching procedures are emerging as effective reduction means to accelerate the computation of Krylov subspace methods for, e.g., the solution of linear systems, eigenvalue computations, and the approximation of matrix functions. While there is plenty of experimental evidence showing that sketched Krylov solvers may dramatically improve performance over standard Krylov methods, many features of these schemes are still unexplored. We derive a new sketched Arnoldi-type relation that allows us to obtain several different new theoretical results. These lead to an improvement of our understanding of sketched Krylov methods, in particular by explaining why the frequently occurring sketched Ritz values far outside the spectral region of A do not negatively influence the convergence of sketched Krylov methods for f (A)b. Our findings also help to identify, among several possible equivalent formulations, the most suitable sketched approximations according to their numerical stability properties. These results are also employed to analyze the error of sketched Krylov methods in the approximation of the action of matrix functions, significantly contributing to the theory available in the current literature.</description>

      <title>A second-order structure-preserving discretization for the Cahn-Hilliard/Allen-Cahn system with cross-kinetic coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the numerical solution of a Cahn-Hilliard/Allen-Cahn system with strong coupling through state and gradient dependent non-diagonal mobility matrices. A fully discrete approximation scheme in space and time is proposed which preserves the underlying gradient flow structure and leads to dissipation of the free-energy on the discrete level. Existence and uniqueness of the discrete solution is established and relative energy estimates are used to prove optimal convergence rates in space and time under minimal smoothness assumptions. Numerical tests are presented for illustration of the theoretical results and to demonstrate the viability of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Proper Implicit Discretization of Arbitrary-Order Robust Exact Differentiators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the implicit Euler discretization of Levant's arbitrary order robust exact differentiator in presence of sampled measurements. Existing implicit discretizations of that differentiator are shown to exhibit either unbounded bias errors or, surprisingly, discretization chattering despite the use of the implicit discretization. A new, proper implicit discretization that exhibits neither of these two detrimental effects is proposed by computing the differentiator's outputs as appropriately designed linear combinations of its state variables. A numerical differentiator implementation is discussed and closed-form stability conditions for arbitrary differentiation orders are given. The influence of bounded measurement noise and numerical approximation errors is formally analyzed. Numerical simulations confirm the obtained results.</description>

      <title>Annealing approach to root-finding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Newton-Raphson method is a fundamental root-finding technique with numerous applications in physics. In this study, we propose a parameterized variant of the Newton-Raphson method, inspired by principles from physics. Through analytical and empirical validation, we demonstrate that this novel approach offers increased robustness and faster convergence during root-finding iterations. Furthermore, we establish connections to the Adomian series method and provide a natural interpretation within a series framework. Remarkably, the introduced parameter, akin to a temperature variable, enables an annealing approach. This advancement sets the stage for a fresh exploration of numerical iterative root-finding methodologies.</description>

      <title>Computing the Action of the Generating Function of Bernoulli Polynomials on a Matrix with An Application to Non-local Boundary Value Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with efficient numerical methods for computing the action of the generating function of Bernoulli polynomials, say $q(\tau,w)$, on a typically large sparse matrix. This problem occurs when solving some non-local boundary value problems. Methods based on the Fourier expansion of $q(\tau,w)$ have already been addressed in the scientific literature. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we place these methods in the classical framework of Krylov-Lanczos (polynomial-rational) techniques for accelerating Fourier series. This allows us to apply the convergence results developed in this context to our function. Second, we design a new acceleration scheme. Some numerical results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>A hierarchical dynamical low-rank algorithm for the stochastic description of large reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stochastic description of chemical reaction networks with the kinetic chemical master equation (CME) is important for studying biological cells, but it suffers from the curse of dimensionality: The amount of data to be stored grows exponentially with the number of chemical species and thus exceeds the capacity of common computational devices for realistic problems. Therefore, time-dependent model order reduction techniques such as the dynamical low-rank approximation are desirable. In this paper we propose a dynamical low-rank algorithm for the kinetic CME using binary tree tensor networks. The dimensionality of the problem is reduced in this approach by hierarchically dividing the reaction network into partitions. Only reactions that cross partitions are subject to an approximation error. We demonstrate by two numerical examples (a 5-dimensional lambda phage model and a 20-dimensional reaction cascade) that the proposed method drastically reduces memory consumption and shows improved computational performance and better accuracy compared to a Monte Carlo method.</description>

      <title>Rapidly convergent series expansions for a class of resolvents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following advances in the abstract theory of composites, we develop rapidly converging series expansions about $z=\infty$ for the resolvent ${\bf R}(z)=[z{\bf I}-{\bf P}^\dagger{\bf Q}{\bf P}]^{-1}$ where ${\bf Q}$ is an orthogonal projection and ${\bf P}$ is such that ${\bf P}{\bf P}^\dagger$ is an orthogonal projection. It is assumed that the spectrum of ${\bf P}^\dagger{\bf Q}{\bf P}$ lies within the interval $[z^-,z^+]$ for some known $z^+\leq 1$ and $z^-\geq 0$ and that the actions of the projections ${\bf Q}$ and ${\bf P}{\bf P}^\dagger$ are easy to compute. The series converges in the entire $z$-plane excluding the cut $[z^-,z^+]$. It is obtained using subspace substitution, where the desired resolvent is tied to a resolvent in a larger space and ${\bf Q}$ gets replaced by a projection $\underline{{\bf Q}}$ that is no longer orthogonal. When $z$ is real the rate of convergence of the new method matches that of the conjugate gradient method.</description>

      <title>Assessment of Diagnostic Capabilities of Methods of Recreation of Voltage Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Voltage fluctuations are one of the most common low-frequency disturbances of power quality. Diagnostics of these disturbances are a complex process because voltage fluctuations affect different loads in different ways. Therefore, there is no measure of power quality that allows for the complementary assessment of severity of this disturbance, allow for the identification of sources of voltage fluctuations, and post-factum investigation of their effects. Among the currently used measures of voltage fluctuations, voltage fluctuation indices have the greatest diagnostic capabilities. Many preliminary studies also show the potential possibility of recreation of voltage fluctuations, including: based on voltage fluctuation indices. This paper presents the results of research on methods of recreation of voltage fluctuations from voltage fluctuation indices. The research carried out included a set of data obtained in a real power grid. Moreover, the impact of the discrimination period on the accuracy of recreation of voltage fluctuations has been assessed. The presented research results show, on the one hand, the usefulness of voltage fluctuation indices in the process of recreation of voltage fluctuations and, on the other hand, further challenges in the recreation of voltage fluctuations.</description>

      <title>A Correlation-induced Finite Difference Estimator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05638v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite difference (FD) approximation is a classic approach to stochastic gradient estimation when only noisy function realizations are available. In this paper, we first provide a sample-driven method via the bootstrap technique to estimate the optimal perturbation, and then propose an efficient FD estimator based on correlated samples at the estimated optimal perturbation. Furthermore, theoretical analyses of both the perturbation estimator and the FD estimator reveal that, {\it surprisingly}, the correlation enables the proposed FD estimator to achieve a reduction in variance and, in some cases, a decrease in bias compared to the traditional optimal FD estimator. Numerical results confirm the efficiency of our estimators and align well with the theory presented, especially in scenarios with small sample sizes. Finally, we apply the estimator to solve derivative-free optimization (DFO) problems, and numerical studies show that DFO problems with 100 dimensions can be effectively solved.</description>

      <title>Volume-preserving physics-informed geometric shape optimization of the Dirichlet energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the numerical solution of geometric shape optimization problems using neural network-based approaches. This involves minimizing a numerical criterion that includes solving a partial differential equation with respect to a domain, often under geometric constraints like constant volume. Our goal is to develop a proof of concept using a flexible and parallelizable methodology to tackle these problems. We focus on a prototypal problem: minimizing the so-called Dirichlet energy with respect to the domain under a volume constraint, involving a Poisson equation in $\mathbb R^2$. We use physics-informed neural networks (PINN) to approximate the Poisson equation's solution on a given domain and represent the shape through a neural network that approximates a volume-preserving transformation from an initial shape to an optimal one. These processes are combined in a single optimization algorithm that minimizes the Dirichlet energy. One of the significant advantages of this approach is its parallelizable nature, which makes it easy to handle the addition of parameters. Additionally, it does not rely on shape derivative or adjoint calculations. Our approach is tested on Dirichlet and Robin boundary conditions, parametric right-hand sides, and extended to Bernoulli-type free boundary problems. The source code for solving the shape optimization problem is open-source and freely available.</description>
