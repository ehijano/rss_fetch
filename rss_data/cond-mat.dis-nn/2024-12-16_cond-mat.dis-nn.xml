      <title>Neural Vector Tomography for Reconstructing a Magnetization Vector Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discretized techniques for vector tomographic reconstructions are prone to producing artifacts in the reconstructions. The quality of these reconstructions may further deteriorate as the amount of noise increases. In this work, we instead model the underlying vector fields using smooth neural fields. Owing to the fact that the activation functions in the neural network may be chosen to be smooth and the domain is no longer pixelated, the model results in high-quality reconstructions, even under presence of noise. In the case where we have underlying global continuous symmetry, we find that the neural network substantially improves the accuracy of the reconstruction over the existing techniques.</description>

      <title>Programmable polyaniline nano neural network. A simple physical model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we report a working physical model of a programmable neural nanonetwork based on a nanostructured conductive polymer - polyaniline. The device can be programmed owing to controlled growth of nanowires, a method developed in our laboratory. The response (output signal) of the network depends on the activated input line, but also on the amplitude of the input signals. The system is able to analyze multiple input signals in parallel and in real time. This is still considered as a challenge.</description>

      <title>Glassy dynamics near the learnability transition in deep recurrent networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine learning dynamics in deep recurrent networks, focusing on the behavior near the learnability transition. The training data are Bach chorales in 4-part harmony, and the learning is by stochastic gradient descent. The negative log-likelihood exhibits power-law decay at long learning times, with a power that depends on depth (the number of layers) d and width (the number of hidden units per of layer) w. When the network is underparametrized (too small to learn the data), the power law approach is to a positive asymptotic value. We find that, for a given depth, the learning time appears to diverge proportional to 1/(w - w_c) as w approaches a critical value w_c from above. w_c is a decreasing function of the number of layers and the number of hidden units per layer. We also study aging dynamics (the slowing-down of fluctuations as the time since the beginning of learning grows). We consider a system that has been learning for a time tau_w and measure the fluctuations of the weight values in a time interval of length tau after tau_w. In the underparametrized phase, we find that they are well-described by a single function of tau/tau_w, independent of tau_w, consistent with the weak ergodicity breaking seen frequently in glassy systems. This scaling persists for short times in the overparametrized phase but breaks down at long times.</description>

      <title>Density-dependent stochastic resetting: a large deviations framework for achieving target distributions over networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for designing density-dependent stochastic resetting protocols to regulate distributions of random walkers on networks. Resetting mechanisms that depend on local densities induce correlations in otherwise non-interacting walkers. Our framework allows for the study of both transient trajectories and stationary properties and identifies resetting protocols that maximise the likelihood of homogeneous and, more generally, rare configurations of random walkers.</description>

      <title>Excitable response of a noisy adaptive network of spiking lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze experimentally and theoretically the response of a network of spiking nodes to external perturbations. The experimental system consists of an array of semiconductor lasers that are adaptively coupled through an optoelectronic feedback signal. This coupling signal can be tuned from one to all to globally coupled and makes the network collectively excitable. We relate the excitable response of the network to the existence of a separatrix in phase space and analyze the effect of noise close to this separatrix. We find numerically that larger networks are more robust to uncorrelated noise sources in the nodes than small networks, in contrast to the experimental observations. We remove this discrepancy considering the impact of a global noise term in the adaptive coupling signal and discuss our observations in relation to the network structure.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric simple exclusion process on the percolation cluster: Waiting time distribution in side-branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15508v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the simplest model of transport of interacting particles in a disordered medium, we consider the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) in which particles with hard-core interactions perform biased random walks, on the supercritical percolation cluster. In this process, the long time trajectory of a marked particle consists of steps on the backbone, punctuated by time spent in side-branches. We study the probability distribution in the steady state of the waiting time $T_w$ of a randomly chosen particle, in a side-branch since its last step along the backbone. Exact numerical evaluation of this on a single side-branch of length $L=$ $1$ to $9$ shows that for large fields, the probability distribution of $\log T_w $ has multiple well separated peaks. We extend this result to a regular comb, and to the ASEP on the percolation cluster. We show that in the steady state, the fractional number of particles that have been in the same side-branch for a time interval greater than $T_w$ varies as $exp( - c \sqrt{\log T_w})$ for large $T_w$, where $c$ depends only on the bias field. However, these long timescales are not reflected in the eigenvalue spectrum of the Markov evolution matrix. The system shows dynamical heterogeneity, with particles segregating into pockets of high and low mobilities.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium steady-state dynamics of Markov processes on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an analytic approach for the steady-state dynamics of Markov processes on locally tree-like graphs. It is based on the definition of a probability distribution for infinite edge trajectories in terms of infinite matrix products. For homogeneous ensembles on regular graphs, the distribution is parametrized by a single $d\times d\times r^2$ tensor, where $r$ is the number of states per variable and $d$ is the matrix-product bond dimension. While the approach becomes exact in the large-$d$ limit, it usually produces extremely accurate results even for small $d$. The $d^2r^2$ parameters are found by solving a fixed point equation, for which we provide an efficient belief-propagation procedure. We apply it to a variety of models, including Ising-Glauber dynamics with symmetric and asymmetric couplings and the SIS model. Even for small $d$, the results are compatible with Monte Carlo estimates and accurately reproduce known exact solutions. The method gives access to accurate temporal correlations which, in some regimes, may be virtually impossible to estimate by sampling.</description>
