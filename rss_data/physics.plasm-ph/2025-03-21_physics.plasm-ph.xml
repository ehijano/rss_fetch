      <title>Simulations of self-magnetization in expanding high-energy-density plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding plasma self-magnetization is one of the fundamental challenges in both laboratory and astrophysical plasmas. Self-magnetization can modify the plasma transport properties, altering the dynamical evolution of plasmas. Most high energy density (HED) laser experiments on magnetic reconnection and unmagnetized collisionless shocks rely on either Biermann or Weibel mechanisms to self-consistently generate the magnetic fields of interest. Multiple HED experiments have observed the formation of ion-scale magnetic filaments of megagauss strength, though their origin remains debated. Models based on Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations have been proposed to explain magnetization, including plasma interpenetration-driven Weibel, temperature gradient-driven Weibel, and adiabatic expansion-driven Weibel. Here, we conducted 2D collisional PIC simulations with a laser ray-tracing module to simulate plasma ablation, expansion, and subsequent magnetization. The simulations use a planar geometry, effectively suppressing the Biermann magnetic fields, to focus on anisotropy-driven instabilities. The laser intensity is varied between $10^{13}$-$10^{14}$ W/cm$^2$, which is relevant to HED and ICF experiments where collisions must be considered. We find that above a critical intensity, the plasma rapidly self-magnetizes via an expansion-driven Weibel process, generating plasma beta of 100 ($\beta = 2k_B n_eT_e/B^2$) with the Hall parameter $\omega_{\rm ce}\tau_{e}&gt;1$ within the first few hundreds of picoseconds. Implications of plasma magnetization for heat transport are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary-velocity laser pulses in plasma waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-time structured laser pulses feature an intensity peak that can travel at an arbitrary velocity while maintaining a near-constant profile. These pulses can propagate in uniform media, where their frequencies are correlated with continuous transverse wavevectors, or in structured media, such as a waveguide, where their frequencies are correlated with discrete mode numbers. Here, we demonstrate the formation and propagation of arbitrary-velocity laser pulses in a plasma waveguide where the intensity can be orders of magnitude higher than in a solid-state waveguide. The flexibility to control the velocity of the peak intensity in a plasma waveguide enables new configurations for plasma-based sources of radiation and energetic particles, including THz generation, laser wakefield acceleration, and direct laser acceleration.</description>

      <title>Turnstile area as a measure for chaotic transport in magnetic confinement fusion devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze stochasticity in the magnetic fields of magnetic confinement fusion reactors by calculating the lobe areas of turnstiles - a method developed for characterizing transport into and out of resonance zones in Hamiltonian dynamical systems. We develop an efficient algorithm based on an action principle to calculate this quantity directly from the magnetic field, including stellarator magnetic fields which are sourced by a complicated set of three-dimensional coils. In the analyzed devices, the turnstile area on the inboard (plasma-facing) manifolds is much smaller than the turnstile area on the outboard (wall-facing) manifolds. The application of the turnstile area calculation for the design of future reactors will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Fusion in a nanoshell: Harnessing plasmonic fields for nuclear reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surface of metal nanoparticles can support plasmonic excitations. These excitations dramatically amplify the electric field of incident light (by several orders of magnitude), potentially ionizing the irradiated nanoparticles in a strong field regime. Under specific conditions, a resonant enhancement of the electric field \textit{inside} a hollow nanoshell can be achieved with a laser pulse. We propose high-intensity laser irradiation of heavy water (${\rm D_2 O}$)-filled metal nanoshells to induce nuclear fusion via this enhancement. In this ``plasmonic confinement'' setup, deuteron nuclei are accelerated by the oscillating electric field within the nanoshell. We estimate that the characteristic momenta of the colliding deuterons reach approximately 10 MeV. This corresponds to an effective kinetic energy equivalent to that of deuterons in a thermonuclear plasma at temperatures around 25 keV (approximately $10^8$K). A laser with a peak pulse intensity of roughly 1 atomic unit is sufficient to generate the strong electric fields required for this plasmonic acceleration. We estimate the expected fusion rate and discuss the feasibility of a fusion reactor based on this proposed scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectra of vibrational overtone and combination bands from vibrational ground state of HCNH+ were measured using an action spectroscopy technique with active background suppression in a cryogenic 22 pole radio frequency ion trap apparatus. Spectroscopic constants for the upper vibrational levels of the transitions were determined with vibrational band origins being 6846.77981(90) $\text{cm}^{-1}$ ($2\nu_1$ , NH stretch), 6640.47624(43) $\text{cm}^{-1}$ ($\nu_1 + \nu_2$), 6282.03578(63) $\text{cm}^{-1}$ ($2\nu_2$, CH stretch), and 6588.4894(20) $\text{cm}^{-1}$ ($\nu_2 + \nu_3 + 2\nu_5^0$). State of the art ab initio VCI calculations up to 10000 $\text{cm}^{-1}$ complement the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Formulations and verification of gyrokinetic simulation of kinetic-MHD processes in toroidal plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.08873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A set of electromagnetic formulations with gyrokinetic ions and drift kinetic electrons for global gyrokinetic simulations has been formulated and verified in the framework of Gyrokinetic Toroidal Code (GTC), which is particularly suitable for the low-frequency electromagnetic modes including drift waves, Alv\'{e}n Eigenmodes and MHD modes. This gyrokinetic simulation model can reduce to the ideal MHD model in the long wavelength limit, and recover the well-known MHD dispersion relation. Especially, the magnetic compression perturbation and the equilibrium current are carefully treated in this model. Furthermore, the detailed implementation of the equations in Boozer coordinate system is provided. The internal kink mode simulations in DIII-D and ITER tokamaks using this model have been successfully bench-marked with other kinetic and MHD codes. The physical model has also been used to generate a database to train the machine learning surrogate model of GTC.</description>

      <title>Effects of Artificial Collisions, Filtering, and Nonlocal Closure Approaches on Hermite-based Vlasov-Poisson Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07073v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kinetic simulations of collisionless plasmas are computationally challenging due to phase space mixing and filamentation, resulting in fine-scale velocity structures. This study compares three methods developed to reduce artifacts related to limited velocity resolution in Hermite-based Vlasov-Poisson simulations: artificial collisions, filtering, and nonlocal closure approaches. We evaluate each method's performance in approximating the linear kinetic response function and suppressing recurrence in linear and nonlinear regimes. Numerical simulations of Landau damping demonstrate that artificial collisions, particularly higher orders of the Lenard-Bernstein collisional operator, most effectively recover the correct damping rate across a range of wavenumbers. Moreover, Hou-Li filtering and nonlocal closures underdamp high wavenumber modes in linear simulations, and the Lenard- Bernstein collisional operator overdamps low wavenumber modes in both linear and nonlinear simulations. This study demonstrates that hypercollisions offer a robust approach to kinetic simulations, accurately capturing collisionless dynamics with limited velocity resolution.</description>

      <title>Implementation of an ITER-relevant QP-based Current Limit Avoidance algorithm in the TCV tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of avoiding saturation of the coil currents is critical in large tokamaks with superconducting coils like ITER. Indeed, if the current limits are reached, a loss of control of the plasma may lead to a major disruption. Therefore, a Current Limit Avoidance (CLA) system is essential to operate safely. This paper provides the first experimental evidence that the online solution of a constrained quadratic optimization problem can offer a valid methodology to implement a CLA. Experiments are carried out on the Tokamak \`a Configuration Variable (TCV) at the Swiss Plasma Center, showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its suitability for real-time application in view of future reactors such as ITER.</description>

      <title>Symplectic integration of guiding-center equations in canonical coordinates for general toroidal fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symplectic integrators with long-term preservation of integrals of motion are introduced for the guiding-center model of plasma particles in toroidal magnetic fields of general topology. An efficient transformation to canonical coordinates from cylindrical and flux-like coordinates is discussed and applied using one component of the magnetic vector potential as a spatial coordinate. This choice is efficient in both, theoretical and numerical developments and marks a generalization of magnetic flux coordinates. The transformation enables the application of conventional symplectic integration schemes formulated in canonical coordinates, as well as variational integrators on the guiding-center system, without requiring magnetic flux coordinates. Symplectic properties and superior efficiency of the implicit midpoint scheme compared to conventional non-symplectic methods are demonstrated on perturbed tokamak fields with magnetic islands and stochastic regions. The presented results mark a crucial step towards gyrokinetic models that conserve physical invariants.</description>
