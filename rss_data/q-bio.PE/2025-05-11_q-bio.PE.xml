      <title>Evolutionary ecology of words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model for the evolutionary ecology of words as one attempt to extend evolutionary game theory and agent-based models by utilizing the rich linguistic expressions of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our model enables the emergence and evolution of diverse and infinite options for interactions among agents. Within the population, each agent possesses a short word (or phrase) generated by an LLM and moves within a spatial environment. When agents become adjacent, the outcome of their interaction is determined by the LLM based on the relationship between their words, with the loser's word being replaced by the winner's. Word mutations, also based on LLM outputs, may occur. We conducted preliminary experiments assuming that ``strong animal species" would survive. The results showed that from an initial population consisting of well-known species, many species emerged both gradually and in a punctuated equilibrium manner. Each trial demonstrated the unique evolution of diverse populations, with one type of large species becoming dominant, such as terrestrial animals, marine life, or extinct species, which were ecologically specialized and adapted ones across diverse extreme habitats. We also conducted a long-term experiment with a large population, demonstrating the emergence and coexistence of diverse species.</description>

      <title>Modeling the 2022 Mpox Outbreak with a Mechanistic Network Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We implemented a dynamic agent-based network model to simulate the spread of mpox in a United States-based MSM population. This model allowed us to implement data-informed dynamic network evolution to simulate realistic disease spreading and behavioral adaptations. We found that behavior change, the reduction in one-time partnerships, and widespread vaccination are effective in preventing the transmission of mpox and that earlier intervention has a greater effect, even when only a high-risk portion of the population participates. With no intervention, 16% of the population was infected (25th percentile, 75th percentiles of simulations: 15.3%, 16.6%). With vaccination and behavior change in only the 25% of individuals most likely to have a one-time partner, cumulative infections were reduced by 30%, or a total reduction in nearly 500 infections. Earlier intervention further reduces cumulative infections; beginning vaccination a year before the outbreak results in only 5.5% of men being infected, averting 950 infections or nearly 10% of the total population in our model. We also show that sustained partnerships drive the early outbreak, while one-time partnerships drive transmission after the first initial weeks. The median effective reproductive number, Rt, at t = 0 days is 1.30 for casual partnerships, 1.00 for main, and 0.6 for one-time. By t = 28, the median Rt for one-time partnerships has more than doubled to 1.48, while it decreased for casual and main partnerships: 0.46 and 0.29, respectively. With the ability to model individuals' behavior, mechanistic networks are particularly well suited to studying sexually transmitted infections, the spread and control of which are often governed by individual-level action. Our results contribute valuable insights into the role of different interventions and relationship types in mpox transmission dynamics.</description>

      <title>Galled Perfect Transfer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03935v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting horizontal gene transfers often requires comparative sequence data, but recent work has shown that character-based approaches could also be useful for this task. Notably, perfect transfer networks (PTN) explain the character diversity of a set of taxa for traits that are gained once, rarely lost, but that can be transferred laterally. Characterizing the structure of such characters is an important step towards understanding more complex characters. Although efficient algorithms can infer such networks from character data, they can sometimes predict overly complicated transfer histories. With the goal of recovering the simplest possible scenarios in this model, we introduce galled perfect transfer networks, which are PTNs that are galled trees. Such networks are useful for characters that are incompatible in terms of tree-like evolution, but that do fit in an almost-tree scenario. We provide polynomial-time algorithms for two problems: deciding whether one can add transfer edges to a tree to transform it into a galled PTN, and deciding whether a set of characters are galled-compatible, that is, they can be explained by some galled PTN. We also analyze a real dataset comprising of a bacterial species trees and KEGG functions as characters, and derive several conclusions on the difficulty of explaining characters in a galled tree, which provide several directions for future research.</description>

      <title>A Thermodynamic Model for the Emergence of Natural Selection in Prebiotic Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simplified thermodynamic model for the emergence of natural selection in prebiotic systems, grounded in the dynamics of energy flow through reaction chains. The model captures the persistence or collapse of chemical systems as a function of environmental energy input, internal energy use, and stored energy buffering. We formalize this through a reaction viability inequality and extend it to incorporate entropy export and diffusion constraints, yielding a general framework for prebiotic persistence under non-equilibrium conditions. A thermal cycling scenario on early Earth is used to illustrate how energy-aligned systems can survive fluctuating input, while less compatible systems collapse. This framework offers a physically grounded precursor to Darwinian selection, suggesting that abiogenesis may emerge not as a rare event, but as a statistically favored outcome in environments where energy and entropy dynamics permit structural persistence.</description>
