      <title>Generalized BKT Transitions and Persistent Order on the Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BKT transition in low-dimensional systems with a $U(1)$ global symmetry separates a gapless conformal phase from a trivially gapped, disordered phase, and is driven by vortex proliferation. Recent developments in modified Villain discretizations provide a class of lattice models which have a $\mathbb{Z}_W$ global symmetry that counts vortices mod W, mixed 't Hooft anomalies, and persistent order even at finite lattice spacing. While there is no fully-disordered phase (except in the original BKT limit $W=1$) there is still a phase boundary which separates gapped ordered phases from gapless phases. I'll describe a numerical Monte Carlo exploration of these phenomena.</description>

      <title>Gribov copy effects in the maximal Abelian gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study effects of Gribov copies in the Maximal Abelian gauge in $SU(3)$ lattice gluodynamics. We confirm earlier results that with effective gauge fixing algorithm one finds Gribov copies of the maximal Abelian gauge which produce about 90\% of the nonabelian string tension after Abelian projection. At the same time using much less effective relaxation algorithm one finds Gribov copies with nice Abelian dominance for the string tension.</description>

      <title>The two-pion contribution to the hadronic vacuum polarization with staggered quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from the first lattice QCD calculation of the two-pion contributions to the light-quark connected vector-current correlation function obtained from staggered-quark operators. We employ the MILC collaboration's gauge-field ensemble with $2+1+1$ flavors of highly improved staggered sea quarks at a lattice spacing of $a\approx 0.15$ fm with a light sea-quark mass at its physical value. The two-pion contributions allow for a refined determination of the noisy long-distance tail of the vector-current correlation function, which we use to compute the light-quark connected contribution to HVP with improved statistical precision. We compare our results with traditional noise-reduction techniques used in lattice QCD calculations of the light-quark connected HVP, namely the so-called fit and bounding methods. We observe a factor of roughly three improvement in the statistical precision in the determination of the HVP contribution to the muon's anomalous magnetic moment over these approaches. We also lay the group theoretical groundwork for extending this calculation to finer lattice spacings with increased numbers of staggered two-pion taste states.</description>

      <title>Lattice artifacts of local fermion bilinears up to $\mathrm{O}(a^2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently the asymptotic lattice spacing dependence of spectral quantities in lattice QCD has been computed to $\mathrm{O}(a^2)$ using Symanzik Effective theory [1,2]. Here, we extend these results to matrix elements and correlators of local fermion bilinears, namely the scalar, pseudo-scalar, vector, axial-vector, and tensor. This resembles the typical current insertions for the effective Hamiltonian of electro-weak or BSM contributions, but is only a small fraction of the local fields typically considered. We again restrict considerations to lattice QCD actions with Wilson or Ginsparg-Wilson quarks and thus lattice formulations of QCD without flavour-changing interactions realising at least $\mathrm{SU}(N_\mathrm{f})_\mathrm{V}\times\mathrm{SU}(N_\mathrm{b}|N_\mathrm{b})_\mathrm{V}$ flavour symmetries for $N_\mathrm{f}$ sea-quarks and $N_\mathrm{b}$ quenched valence-quarks respectively in the massless limit. Overall we find only few cases $\hat{\Gamma}$, which worsen the asymptotic lattice spacing dependence $a^n[2b_0\bar{g}^2(1/a)]^{\hat{\Gamma}}$ compared to the classically expected $a^n$-scaling. Other than for trivial flavour quantum numbers, only the axial-vector and much milder the tensor may cause some problems at $\mathrm{O}(a)$, strongly suggesting to use at least tree-level Symanzik improvement of those local fields.</description>

      <title>Impact of extreme magnetic fields on the QCD topological susceptibility in the vicinity of the crossover region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first determination of the topological susceptibility from lattice QCD in the presence of strong background magnetic fields. Our simulations employ 2+1 flavours of stout improved staggered quarks with physical masses and cover a broad range of temperatures and magnetic field values. The results are extrapolated to the continuum limit using four different lattice spacings and an eigenvalue reweighting technique to reduce discretisation errors. For low temperatures, our calculations show an enhancement of the topological susceptibility due to the magnetic field, compatible with predictions from chiral perturbation theory. At high temperatures, we observe the impact of inverse magnetic catalysis on the susceptibility.</description>

      <title>Extreme softening of QCD phase transition under weak acceleration: first principle Monte Carlo results for gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the properties of gluon plasma subjected to a weak acceleration using first-principle numerical Monte Carlo simulations. We use the Luttinger (Tolman-Ehrenfest) correspondence between temperature gradient and gravitational field to impose acceleration in imaginary time formalism. Under acceleration, the system resides in global thermal equilibrium. Our results indicate that even the weakest acceleration up to $a \simeq 27$ MeV drastically softens the deconfinement phase transition, converting the first-order phase transition of a static system to a soft crossover for accelerating gluons. The accelerating environment can be relevant to the first moments of the early Universe and the initial glasma regime of relativistic heavy ion collisions. In particular, our results imply that the acceleration, if present, may also inhibit the detection of the thermodynamic phase transition from quark-gluon plasma to the hadronic phase.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Mass Generation with four SU(2) doublet fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a single exactly massless staggered fermion in the fundamental representation of an $SU(2)$ gauge group. We utilize an nHYP-smeared fermion action supplemented with additional heavy Pauli-Villars fields which serve to decrease lattice artifacts. The phase diagram exhibits a clear two-phase structure with a conformal phase at weak coupling and a novel new phase, the Symmetric Mass Generation (SMG) phase, appearing at strong coupling. The SMG phase is confining with all states gapped and chiral symmetry unbroken. Our finite size scaling analysis provides strong evidence that the phase transition between these two phases is continuous, which would allow for the existence of a continuum SMG phase. Furthermore, the RG flows are consistent with a $\beta$-function that vanishes quadratically at the new fixed point suggesting that the $N_f=4$ flavor SU(2) gauge theory lies at the opening of the conformal window.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the semileptonic decay $ \Xi^{++}_{cc}\rightarrow \Xi^+_{c} \bar{\ell}\nu_{\ell}$ within QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the semileptonic decay of the doubly heavy baryon $ \Xi^{++}_{cc} $ into the singly heavy baryon $ \Xi^+_{c}$ within the three point QCD sum rule approach in two possible lepton channels. Our analysis includes perturbative as well as nonperturbative condensation contributions up to dimension five. We evaluate the form factors of this semileptonic decay entering the amplitude described by the vector and axial vector transition currents. The fit functions of the form factors with respect to the transferred momentum squared are utilized to predict the decay widths and branching ratios of the $ \Xi^{++}_{cc}\rightarrow \Xi^+_{c} \bar{\ell}\nu_{\ell}$ channels. We compare our findings with other predictions in the literature. Our outcomes can be useful for experimental groups in their search for the weak decays of doubly heavy baryons and may be checked via future experiments such as LHCb.</description>

      <title>Probing heavy meson lightcone distribution amplitudes with heavy quark spin symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on a previous work~\cite{Han:2024min}, we illustrate that the leading-twist light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) defined in heavy-quark effective theory (HQET) can be determined through lattice simulations of quasi-distribution amplitudes (quasi-DAs) with a large momentum component $P^z$. Exploiting heavy-quark spin symmetry, we show that the LCDAs for a heavy pseudoscalar and vector meson in the context of HQET exhibit degeneracy, and the degeneracy allows for the utilization of quasi DAs for both pseudoscalar and vector mesons on the lattice. We then derive the relevant short-distance coefficients for the matching between LCDAs defined with QCD fields and HQET LCDAs at the one-loop level. The incorporation of these three quasi DAs can not only confirm the methodology introduced in Ref.~\cite{Han:2024min} but also provides possible insight into power corrections. Discrepancies between the corresponding results offer a valuable perspective for estimating power corrections within the system which are imperative for precise investigations into heavy-meson LCDAs in the future particularly in the context of lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Non-stabilizerness in U(1) lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a thorough investigation of non-stabilizerness - a fundamental quantum resource that quantifies state complexity within the framework of quantum computing - in a one-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theory. We show how non-stabilizerness is always extensive with volume, and has no direct relation to the presence of critical points. However, its derivatives typically display discontinuities across the latter: This indicates that non-stabilizerness is strongly sensitive to criticality, but in a manner that is very different from entanglement (that, typically, is maximal at the critical point). Our results indicate that error-corrected simulations of lattice gauge theories close to the continuum limit have similar computational costs to those at finite correlation length and provide rigorous lower bounds for quantum resources of such quantum computations.</description>

      <title>Dualization of ingappabilities through Hilbert-space extensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Duality in various dimensions is understood through a Hilbert-space extension method. We rigorously dualize the quantum ingappabilities to discrete height model in one dimension which is inaccessible by earlier work such as flux-insertion arguments. It turns out that the ingappabilities of quantum discrete height model is protected by an exotic ``modulating'' translation symmetry, which is a combination of modulating internal symmetry transformation and the conventional lattice translation. It can be also generalize to higher-form gauge fields in arbitrary dimensions, e.g., $\mathbb{Z}$-gauge theory in two dimensions with $\mathbb{Z}$ one-form symmetry and a modulating translation symmetry.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Scars for Arbitrary Integer Spin in 2+1D Abelian Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08892v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of Quantum Many-Body Scars, which prevents thermalization from certain initial states after a long time, has been established across different quantum many-body systems. These include gauge theories corresponding to spin-1/2 quantum link models. Establishing quantum scars in gauge theories with high spin is not accessible with existing numerical methods, which rely on exact diagonalization. We systematically identify scars for pure gauge theories with arbitrarily large integer spin $S$ in $2+1$D, where the electric field is restricted to $2S+1$ states per link. Through an explicit analytic construction, we show that the presence of scars is widespread in $2+1$D gauge theories for arbitrary integer spin. We confirm these findings numerically for small truncated spin and $S=1$ quantum link models. Our analytic construction establishes the presence of scars far beyond volumes and spins that can be probed with existing numerical methods and can guide quantum simulation experiments toward interesting non-equilibrium phenomena, inaccessible otherwise.</description>

      <title>The $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ twisted gradient flow strong coupling without topological freezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the role of topology on the lattice determination of the $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ strong coupling renormalized via gradient flow. To deal with the topological freezing of standard local algorithms, the definition of the coupling is usually projected onto the zero topological sector. However, it is not obvious that this definition is not biased by the loss of ergodicity. We instead avoid the topological freezing using a novel algorithm, the Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions. The comparison with a standard algorithm shows that, even in the case where the latter is severely frozen, one obtains the same projected coupling. Moreover, we show that the two definitions of the coupling, projected and non-projected, lead to the same flow of the renormalization scale. Our results imply that projecting the coupling does not affect the determination of the dynamically-generated scale of the theory $\Lambda$, as obtained through the step-scaling method.</description>

      <title>Full QCD with milder topological freezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We simulate $N_f=2+1$ QCD at the physical point combining open and periodic boundary conditions in a parallel tempering framework, following the original proposal by M. Hasenbusch for $2d$ $\mathrm{CP}^{N-1}$ models, which has been recently implemented and widely employed in $4d$ $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ pure Yang-Mills theories too. We show that using this algorithm it is possible to achieve a sizable reduction of the auto-correlation time of the topological charge in dynamical fermions simulations both at zero and finite temperature, allowing to avoid topology freezing down to lattice spacings as fine as $a \sim 0.02$ fm. Therefore, this implementation of the Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions algorithm has the potential to substantially push forward the investigation of the QCD vacuum properties by means of lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Higgs-Confinement Transitions in QCD from Symmetry Protected Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In gauge theories with fundamental matter there is typically no sharp way to distinguish confining and Higgs regimes, e.g. using generalized global symmetries acting on loop order parameters. It is standard lore that these two regimes are continuously connected, as has been explicitly demonstrated in certain lattice and continuum models. We point out that Higgsing and confinement sometimes lead to distinct symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases -- necessarily separated by a phase transition -- for ordinary global symmetries. We present explicit examples in 3+1 dimensions, obtained by adding elementary Higgs fields and Yukawa couplings to QCD while preserving parity P and time reversal T. In a suitable scheme, the confining phases of these theories are trivial SPTs, while their Higgs phases are characterized by non-trivial P- and T-invariant theta-angles $\theta_f, \theta_g = \pi$ for flavor or gravity background gauge fields, i.e. they are topological insulators or superconductors. Finally, we consider conventional three-flavor QCD (without elementary Higgs fields) at finite $U(1)_B$ baryon-number chemical potential $\mu_B$, which preserves P and T. At very large $\mu_B$, three-flavor QCD is known to be a completely Higgsed color superconductor that also spontaneously breaks $U(1)_B$. We argue that this high-density phase is in fact a gapless SPT, with a gravitational theta-angle $\theta_g = \pi$ that safely co-exists with the $U(1)_B$ Nambu-Goldstone boson. We explain why this SPT motivates unexpected transitions in the QCD phase diagram, as well as anomalous surface modes at the boundary of quark-matter cores inside neutron stars.</description>

      <title>A discrete formulation for three-dimensional winding number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05291v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a smooth map \(g: X \to U(N)\), where \(X\) is three-dimensional, oriented, and closed manifold, the winding number is defined as \(W_3 = \frac{1}{24\pi^2} \int_{X} \mathrm{Tr}\left[(g^{-1}dg)^3\right]\). We introduce a method to compute \(W_3\) using a discrete approximation of \(X\) that manifestly ensures the quantization of \(W_3\).</description>

      <title>A better space of generalized connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a base manifold $M$ and a Lie group $G$, we define $\bar{\cal A}^H_M$ a space of generalized $G$-connections on $M$ with the following properties:
  - The space of smooth connections ${\cal A}^\infty_M = \sqcup_\pi {\cal A}^\infty_\pi$ is densely embedded in $\bar{\cal A}^H_M = \sqcup_\pi \bar{\cal A}^H_{cc(\pi)}$; moreover, in contrast with the usual space of generalized connections, the embedding preserves topological sectors.
  - It is a homogeneous covering space for the standard space of generalized connections of loop quantization $\bar{\cal A}_M$.
  - It is a measurable space constructed as an inverse limit of of spaces of connections with a cutoff, much like $\bar{\cal A}_M$. At each level of the cutoff, a Haar measure, a BF measure and heat kernel measures can be defined.
  - The topological charge of generalized connections on closed manifolds $Q= \int Tr(F)$ in 2d, $Q= \int Tr(F \wedge F)$ in 4d, etc, is defined.
  - On a subdivided manifold, it can be calculated in terms of the spaces of generalized connections associated to its pieces. Thus, spaces of boundary connections can be computed from spaces associated to faces.
  - The soul of our generalized connections is a notion of higher homotopy parallel transport defined for smooth connections. We recover standard generalized connections by forgetting its higher levels.
  - The kth level of our higher gauge fields is trivial if and only if $\pi_{k-1} G$ is trivial. Then $\bar{\cal A}^H_\Sigma \neq \bar{\cal A}_\Sigma$ if the gauge group is not simply connected and $d \geq 2$. For $G=SL(2, {\mathbb C})$ or $G=SU(2)$ and $\dim \Sigma = 3$, however, we get $\bar{\cal A}^H_\Sigma = \bar{\cal A}_\Sigma$: Boundary data for loop quantum gravity is consistent with our space of generalized connections, but a path integral for quantum gravity would be sensitive to homotopy data.</description>
