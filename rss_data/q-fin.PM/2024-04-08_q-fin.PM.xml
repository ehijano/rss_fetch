      <title>StockGPT: A GenAI Model for Stock Prediction and Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces StockGPT, an autoregressive "number" model pretrained directly on the history of daily U.S. stock returns. Treating each return series as a sequence of tokens, the model excels at understanding and predicting the highly intricate stock return dynamics. Instead of relying on handcrafted trading patterns using historical stock prices, StockGPT automatically learns the hidden representations predictive of future returns via its attention mechanism. On a held-out test sample from 2001 to 2023, a daily rebalanced long-short portfolio formed from StockGPT predictions earns an annual return of 119% with a Sharpe ratio of 6.5. The StockGPT-based portfolio completely explains away momentum and long-/short-term reversals, eliminating the need for manually crafted price-based strategies and also encompasses most leading stock market factors. This highlights the immense promise of generative AI in surpassing human in making complex financial investment decisions and illustrates the efficacy of the attention mechanism of large language models when applied to a completely different domain.</description>

      <title>The PEAL Method: a mathematical framework to streamline securitization structuring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Securitization is a financial process where the cash flows of income-generating assets are sold to institutional investors as securities, liquidating illiquid assets. This practice presents persistent challenges due to the absence of a comprehensive mathematical framework for structuring asset-backed securities. While existing literature provides technical analysis of credit risk modeling, there remains a need for a definitive framework detailing the allocation of the inbound cash flows to the outbound positions. To fill this gap, we introduce the PEAL Method: a 10-step mathematical framework to streamline the securitization structuring across all time periods.
  The PEAL Method offers a rigorous and versatile approach, allowing practitioners to structure various types of securitizations, including those with complex vertical positions. By employing standardized equations, it facilitates the delineation of payment priorities and enhances risk characterization for both the asset and the liability sides throughout the securitization life cycle.
  In addition to its technical contributions, the PEAL Method aims to elevate industry standards by addressing longstanding challenges in securitization. By providing detailed information to investors and enabling transparent risk profile comparisons, it promotes market transparency and enables stronger regulatory oversight.
  In summary, the PEAL Method represents a significant advancement in securitization literature, offering a standardized framework for precision and efficiency in structuring transactions. Its adoption has the potential to drive innovation and enhance risk management practices in the securitization market.</description>
