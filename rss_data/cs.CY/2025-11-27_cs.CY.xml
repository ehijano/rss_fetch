      <title>PropensityBench: Evaluating Latent Safety Risks in Large Language Models via an Agentic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked concerns over their potential to acquire and misuse dangerous or high-risk capabilities, posing frontier risks. Current safety evaluations primarily test for what a model \textit{can} do - its capabilities - without assessing what it $\textit{would}$ do if endowed with high-risk capabilities. This leaves a critical blind spot: models may strategically conceal capabilities or rapidly acquire them, while harboring latent inclinations toward misuse. We argue that $\textbf{propensity}$ - the likelihood of a model to pursue harmful actions if empowered - is a critical, yet underexplored, axis of safety evaluation. We present $\textbf{PropensityBench}$, a novel benchmark framework that assesses the proclivity of models to engage in risky behaviors when equipped with simulated dangerous capabilities using proxy tools. Our framework includes 5,874 scenarios with 6,648 tools spanning four high-risk domains: cybersecurity, self-proliferation, biosecurity, and chemical security. We simulate access to powerful capabilities via a controlled agentic environment and evaluate the models' choices under varying operational pressures that reflect real-world constraints or incentives models may encounter, such as resource scarcity or gaining more autonomy. Across open-source and proprietary frontier models, we uncover 9 alarming signs of propensity: models frequently choose high-risk tools when under pressure, despite lacking the capability to execute such actions unaided. These findings call for a shift from static capability audits toward dynamic propensity assessments as a prerequisite for deploying frontier AI systems safely. Our code is available at https://github.com/scaleapi/propensity-evaluation.</description>

      <title>InvisibleBench: A Deployment Gate for Caregiving Relationship AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: InvisibleBench is a deployment gate for caregiving-relationship AI, evaluating 3-20+ turn interactions across five dimensions: Safety, Compliance, Trauma-Informed Design, Belonging/Cultural Fitness, and Memory. The benchmark includes autofail conditions for missed crises, medical advice (WOPR Act), harmful information, and attachment engineering. We evaluate four frontier models across 17 scenarios (N=68) spanning three complexity tiers. All models show significant safety gaps (11.8-44.8 percent crisis detection), indicating the necessity of deterministic crisis routing in production systems. DeepSeek Chat v3 achieves the highest overall score (75.9 percent), while strengths differ by dimension: GPT-4o Mini leads Compliance (88.2 percent), Gemini leads Trauma-Informed Design (85.0 percent), and Claude Sonnet 4.5 ranks highest in crisis detection (44.8 percent). We release all scenarios, judge prompts, and scoring configurations with code. InvisibleBench extends single-turn safety tests by evaluating longitudinal risk, where real harms emerge. No clinical claims; this is a deployment-readiness evaluation.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models' Complicit Responses to Illicit Instructions across Socio-Legal Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now deployed at unprecedented scale, assisting millions of users in daily tasks. However, the risk of these models assisting unlawful activities remains underexplored. In this study, we define this high-risk behavior as complicit facilitation - the provision of guidance or support that enables illicit user instructions - and present four empirical studies that assess its prevalence in widely deployed LLMs. Using real-world legal cases and established legal frameworks, we construct an evaluation benchmark spanning 269 illicit scenarios and 50 illicit intents to assess LLMs' complicit facilitation behavior. Our findings reveal widespread LLM susceptibility to complicit facilitation, with GPT-4o providing illicit assistance in nearly half of tested cases. Moreover, LLMs exhibit deficient performance in delivering credible legal warnings and positive guidance. Further analysis uncovers substantial safety variation across socio-legal contexts. On the legal side, we observe heightened complicity for crimes against societal interests, non-extreme but frequently occurring violations, and malicious intents driven by subjective motives or deceptive justifications. On the social side, we identify demographic disparities that reveal concerning complicit patterns towards marginalized and disadvantaged groups, with older adults, racial minorities, and individuals in lower-prestige occupations disproportionately more likely to receive unlawful guidance. Analysis of model reasoning traces suggests that model-perceived stereotypes, characterized along warmth and competence, are associated with the model's complicit behavior. Finally, we demonstrate that existing safety alignment strategies are insufficient and may even exacerbate complicit behavior.</description>

      <title>Scoping Electronic Communication Privacy Rules: Data, Services and Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use electronic communication networks for more than simply traditional telecommunications: we access the news, buy goods online, file our taxes, contribute to public debate, and more. As a result, a wider array of privacy interests is implicated for users of electronic communications networks and services. This development calls into question the scope of electronic communications privacy rules. This paper analyses the scope of these rules, taking into account the rationale and the historic background of the European electronic communications privacy framework. We develop a framework for analysing the scope of electronic communications privacy rules using three approaches: (i) a service-centric approach, (ii) a data-centric approach, and (iii) a value-centric approach. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. The current e-Privacy Directive contains a complex blend of the three approaches, which does not seem to be based on a thorough analysis of their strengths and weaknesses. The upcoming review of the directive announced by the European Commission provides an opportunity to improve the scoping of the rules.</description>

      <title>Personal Data Processing for Behavioural Targeting: Which Legal Basis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights only allows personal data processing if a data controller has a legal basis for the processing. This paper argues that in most circumstances the only available legal basis for the processing of personal data for behavioural targeting is the data subject's unambiguous consent. Furthermore, the paper argues that the cookie consent requirement from the ePrivacy Directive does not provide a legal basis for the processing of personal data. Therefore: even if companies could use an opt-out system to comply with the e-Privacy Directive's consent requirement for using a tracking cookie, they would generally have to obtain the data subject's unambiguous consent if they process personal data for behavioural targeting.</description>

      <title>A review on data fusion in multimodal learning analytics and educational data mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The new educational models such as smart learning environments use of digital and context-aware devices to facilitate the learning process. In this new educational scenario, a huge quantity of multimodal students' data from a variety of different sources can be captured, fused, and analyze. It offers to researchers and educators a unique opportunity of being able to discover new knowledge to better understand the learning process and to intervene if necessary. However, it is necessary to apply correctly data fusion approaches and techniques in order to combine various sources of multimodal learning analytics (MLA). These sources or modalities in MLA include audio, video, electrodermal activity data, eye-tracking, user logs, and click-stream data, but also learning artifacts and more natural human signals such as gestures, gaze, speech, or writing. This survey introduces data fusion in learning analytics (LA) and educational data mining (EDM) and how these data fusion techniques have been applied in smart learning. It shows the current state of the art by reviewing the main publications, the main type of fused educational data, and the data fusion approaches and techniques used in EDM/LA, as well as the main open problems, trends, and challenges in this specific research area.</description>

      <title>The Need for Benchmarks to Advance AI-Enabled Player Risk Detection in Gambling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence-based systems for player risk detection have become central to harm prevention efforts in the gambling industry. However, growing concerns around transparency and effectiveness have highlighted the absence of standardized methods for evaluating the quality and impact of these tools. This makes it impossible to gauge true progress; even as new systems are developed, their comparative effectiveness remains unknown. We argue the critical next innovation is developing a framework to measure these systems. This paper proposes a conceptual benchmarking framework to support the systematic evaluation of player risk detection systems. Benchmarking, in this context, refers to the structured and repeatable assessment of artificial intelligence models using standardized datasets, clearly defined tasks, and agreed-upon performance metrics. The goal is to enable objective, comparable, and longitudinal evaluation of player risk detection systems. We present a domain-specific framework for benchmarking that addresses the unique challenges of player risk detection in gambling and supports key stakeholders, including researchers, operators, vendors, and regulators. By enhancing transparency and improving system effectiveness, this framework aims to advance innovation and promote responsible artificial intelligence adoption in gambling harm prevention.</description>

      <title>When LLMs Can't Help: Real-World Evaluation of LLMs in Nutrition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing trust in large language models (LLMs), especially in the form of chatbots, is often undermined by the lack of their extrinsic evaluation. This holds particularly true in nutrition, where randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard, and experts demand them for evidence-based deployment. LLMs have shown promising results in this field, but these are limited to intrinsic setups. We address this gap by running the first RCT involving LLMs for nutrition. We augment a rule-based chatbot with two LLM-based features: (1) message rephrasing for conversational variety and engagement, and (2) nutritional counselling through a fine-tuned model. In our seven-week RCT (n=81), we compare chatbot variants with and without LLM integration. We measure effects on dietary outcome, emotional well-being, and engagement. Despite our LLM-based features performing well in intrinsic evaluation, we find that they did not yield consistent benefits in real-world deployment. These results highlight critical gaps between intrinsic evaluations and real-world impact, emphasising the need for interdisciplinary, human-centred approaches.\footnote{We provide all of our code and results at: \\ \href{https://github.com/saeshyra/diet-chatbot-trial}{https://github.com/saeshyra/diet-chatbot-trial}}</description>

      <title>Exploropleth: exploratory analysis of data binning methods in choropleth maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When creating choropleth maps, mapmakers often bin (i.e., group, classify) quantitative data values into groups to help show that certain areas fall within a similar range of values. For instance, a mapmaker may divide counties into groups of high, middle, and low life expectancy (measured in years). It is well known that different binning methods (e.g., natural breaks, quantile) yield different groupings, meaning the same data can be presented differently depending on how it is divided into bins. To help guide a wide variety of users, we present a new, open source, web-based, geospatial visualization tool, Exploropleth, that lets users interact with a catalog of established data binning methods, and subsequently compare, customize, and export custom maps. This tool advances the state of the art by providing multiple binning methods in one view and supporting administrative unit reclassification on-the-fly. We interviewed 16 cartographers and geographic information systems (GIS) experts from 13 government organizations, non-government organizations (NGOs), and federal agencies who identified opportunities to integrate Exploropleth into their existing mapmaking workflow, and found that the tool has potential to educate students as well as mapmakers with varying levels of experience. Exploropleth is open-source and publicly available at https://exploropleth.github.io.</description>

      <title>AssurAI: Experience with Constructing Korean Socio-cultural Datasets to Discover Potential Risks of Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative AI necessitates robust safety evaluations. However, current safety datasets are predominantly English-centric, failing to capture specific risks in non-English, socio-cultural contexts such as Korean, and are often limited to the text modality. To address this gap, we introduce AssurAI, a new quality-controlled Korean multimodal dataset for evaluating the safety of generative AI. First, we define a taxonomy of 35 distinct AI risk factors, adapted from established frameworks by a multidisciplinary expert group to cover both universal harms and relevance to the Korean socio-cultural context. Second, leveraging this taxonomy, we construct and release AssurAI, a large-scale Korean multimodal dataset comprising 11,480 instances across text, image, video, and audio. Third, we apply the rigorous quality control process used to ensure data integrity, featuring a two-phase construction (i.e., expert-led seeding and crowdsourced scaling), triple independent annotation, and an iterative expert red-teaming loop. Our pilot study validates AssurAI's effectiveness in assessing the safety of recent LLMs. We release AssurAI to the public to facilitate the development of safer and more reliable generative AI systems for the Korean community.</description>

      <title>A Brief History of Digital Twin Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging from NASA's spacecraft simulations in the 1960s, digital twin technology has advanced through industrial adoption to spark a healthcare transformation. A digital twin is a dynamic, data-driven virtual counterpart of a physical system, continuously updated through real-time data streams and capable of bidirectional interaction. In medicine, digital twin integrates imaging, biosensors, and computational models to generate patient-specific simulations that support diagnosis, treatment planning, and drug development. Representative applications include cardiac digital twin for predicting arrhythmia treatment outcomes, oncology digital twin for tracking tumor progression and optimizing radiotherapy, and pharmacological digital twin for accelerating drug discovery. Despite rapid progress, major challenges, including interoperability, data privacy, and model fidelity, continue to limit widespread clinical integration. Emerging solutions such as explainable AI, federated learning, and harmonized regulatory frameworks offer promising pathways forward. Looking ahead, advances in multi-organ digital twin, genomics integration, and ethical governance will be essential to ensure that digital twin shifts healthcare from reactive treatment to predictive, preventive, and truly personalized medicine.</description>

      <title>A Taxonomy of Pix Fraud in Brazil: Attack Methodologies, AI-Driven Amplification, and Defensive Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a review of attack methodologies targeting Pix, the instant payment system launched by the Central Bank of Brazil in 2020. The study aims to identify and classify the main types of fraud affecting users and financial institutions, highlighting the evolution and increasing sophistication of these techniques. The methodology combines a structured literature review with exploratory interviews conducted with professionals from the banking sector. The results show that fraud schemes have evolved from purely social engineering approaches to hybrid strategies that integrate human manipulation with technical exploitation. The study concludes that security measures must advance at the same pace as the growing complexity of attack methodologies, with particular emphasis on adaptive defenses and continuous user awareness.</description>

Abstract: Millions of users across the globe turn to AI chatbots for their creative needs, inviting widespread interest in understanding how such chatbots represent diverse cultures. At the same time, evaluating cultural representations in open-ended tasks remains challenging and underexplored. In this work, we present TALES, an evaluation of cultural misrepresentations in LLM-generated stories for diverse Indian cultural identities. First, we develop TALES-Tax, a taxonomy of cultural misrepresentations by collating insights from participants with lived experiences in India through focus groups (N=9) and individual surveys (N=15). Using TALES-Tax, we evaluate 6 models through a large-scale annotation study spanning 2,925 annotations from 108 annotators with lived cultural experience from across 71 regions in India and 14 languages. Concerningly, we find that 88\% of the generated stories contain one or more cultural inaccuracies, and such errors are more prevalent in mid- and low-resourced languages and stories based in peri-urban regions in India. Lastly, we transform the annotations into TALES-QA, a standalone question bank to evaluate the cultural knowledge of foundational models. Through this evaluation, we surprisingly discover that models often possess the requisite cultural knowledge despite generating stories rife with cultural misrepresentations.</description>

      <title>From Prediction to Foresight: The Role of AI in Designing Responsible Futures</title>

Abstract: In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and complex global challenges, responsible foresight has emerged as an essential framework for policymakers aiming to navigate future uncertainties and shape the future. Responsible foresight entails the ethical anticipation of emerging opportunities and risks, with a focus on fostering proactive, sustainable, and accountable future design. This paper coins the term "responsible computational foresight", examining the role of human-centric artificial intelligence and computational modeling in advancing responsible foresight, establishing a set of foundational principles for this new field and presenting a suite of AI-driven foresight tools currently shaping it. AI, particularly in conjunction with simulations and scenario analysis, enhances policymakers' ability to address uncertainty, evaluate risks, and devise strategies geared toward sustainable, resilient futures. However, responsible foresight extends beyond mere technical forecasting; it demands a nuanced understanding of the interdependencies within social, environmental, economic and political systems, alongside a commitment to ethical, long-term decision-making that supports human intelligence. We argue that AI will play a role as a supportive tool in responsible, human-centered foresight, complementing rather than substituting policymaker judgment to enable the proactive shaping of resilient and ethically sound futures. This paper advocates for the thoughtful integration of AI into foresight practices to empower policymakers and communities as they confront the grand challenges of the 21st century.</description>

      <title>Meursault as a Data Point</title>

Abstract: In an era dominated by datafication, the reduction of human experiences to quantifiable metrics raises profound philosophical and ethical questions. This paper explores these issues through the lens of Meursault, the protagonist of Albert Camus' The Stranger, whose emotionally detached existence epitomizes the existential concept of absurdity. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques including emotion detection (BERT), sentiment analysis (VADER), and named entity recognition (spaCy)-this study quantifies key events and behaviors in Meursault's life. Our analysis reveals the inherent limitations of applying algorithmic models to complex human experiences, particularly those rooted in existential alienation and moral ambiguity. By examining how modern AI tools misinterpret Meursault's actions and emotions, this research underscores the broader ethical dilemmas of reducing nuanced human narratives to data points, challenging the foundational assumptions of our data-driven society. The findings presented in this paper serve as a critique of the increasing reliance on data-driven narratives and advocate for incorporating humanistic values in artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>How Do Companies Manage the Environmental Sustainability of AI? An Interview Study About Green AI Efforts and Regulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the ever-growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), AI-based software and its negative impact on the environment are no longer negligible, and studying and mitigating this impact has become a critical area of research. However, it is currently unclear which role environmental sustainability plays during AI adoption in industry and how AI regulations influence Green AI practices and decision-making in industry. We therefore aim to investigate the Green AI perception and management of industry practitioners. To this end, we conducted a total of 11 interviews with participants from 10 different organizations that adopted AI-based software. The interviews explored three main themes: AI adoption, current efforts in mitigating the negative environmental impact of AI, and the influence of the EU AI Act and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). Our findings indicate that 9 of 11 participants prioritized business efficiency during AI adoption, with minimal consideration of environmental sustainability. Monitoring and mitigation of AI's environmental impact were very limited. Only one participant monitored negative environmental effects. Regarding applied mitigation practices, six participants reported no actions, with the others sporadically mentioning techniques like prompt engineering, relying on smaller models, or not overusing AI. Awareness and compliance with the EU AI Act are low, with only one participant reporting on its influence, while the CSRD drove sustainability reporting efforts primarily in larger companies. All in all, our findings reflect a lack of urgency and priority for sustainable AI among these companies. We suggest that current regulations are not very effective, which has implications for policymakers. Additionally, there is a need to raise industry awareness, but also to provide user-friendly techniques and tools for Green AI practices.</description>

      <title>Rigor in AI: Doing Rigorous AI Work Requires a Broader, Responsible AI-Informed Conception of Rigor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In AI research and practice, rigor remains largely understood in terms of methodological rigor -- such as whether mathematical, statistical, or computational methods are correctly applied. We argue that this narrow conception of rigor has contributed to the concerns raised by the responsible AI community, including overblown claims about the capabilities of AI systems. Our position is that a broader conception of what rigorous AI research and practice should entail is needed. We believe such a conception -- in addition to a more expansive understanding of (1) methodological rigor -- should include aspects related to (2) what background knowledge informs what to work on (epistemic rigor); (3) how disciplinary, community, or personal norms, standards, or beliefs influence the work (normative rigor); (4) how clearly articulated the theoretical constructs under use are (conceptual rigor); (5) what is reported and how (reporting rigor); and (6) how well-supported the inferences from existing evidence are (interpretative rigor). In doing so, we also provide useful language and a framework for much-needed dialogue about the AI community's work by researchers, policymakers, journalists, and other stakeholders.</description>

      <title>Human Experts' Evaluation of Generative AI for Contextualizing STEAM Education in the Global South</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates how human experts evaluate the capacity of Generative AI (GenAI) to contextualize STEAM education in the Global South, with a focus on Ghana. Using a convergent mixed-methods design, four STEAM specialists assessed GenAI-generated lesson plans created with a customized Culturally Responsive Lesson Planner (CRLP) and compared them to standardized lesson plans from the Ghana National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NaCCA). Quantitative ratings were based on a validated 25-item Culturally Responsive Pedagogy Rubric measuring bias awareness, cultural representation, contextual relevance, linguistic responsiveness, and teacher agency. Qualitative reflections provided additional insight into how GenAI handles cultural and pedagogical appropriateness.
  Findings show that GenAI, when paired with the CRLP tool, can support contextualized STEAM instruction by linking abstract curriculum standards to learners' cultural knowledge, community practices, and everyday experiences. Experts rated GenAI-assisted lessons as more culturally grounded and pedagogically responsive than NaCCA plans, integrating Indigenous knowledge, bilingual elements, and locally relevant examples. However, GenAI struggled to represent Ghana's cultural pluralism, often offering surface-level references to language, history, and identity. These weaknesses were most evident in Mathematics and Computing, where cultural nuance was limited. The results highlight the need for continued teacher mediation, community involvement, and culturally attuned refinement of AI outputs. Future work should include classroom trials, expanded expert participation, and model fine-tuning using Indigenous language corpora to strengthen cultural fidelity in Global South contexts.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Prediction Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03401v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a prediction algorithm serves a collection of users, disparities in prediction quality are likely to emerge. If users respond to accurate predictions by increasing engagement, inviting friends, or adopting trends, repeated learning creates a feedback loop that shapes both the model and the population of its users. In this work, we introduce evolutionary prediction games, a framework grounded in evolutionary game theory which models such feedback loops as natural-selection processes among groups of users. Our theoretical analysis reveals a gap between idealized and real-world learning settings: In idealized settings with unlimited data and computational power, repeated learning creates competition and promotes competitive exclusion across a broad class of behavioral dynamics. However, under realistic constraints such as finite data, limited compute, or risk of overfitting, we show that stable coexistence and mutualistic symbiosis between groups becomes possible. We analyze these possibilities in terms of their stability and feasibility, present mechanisms that can sustain their existence, and empirically demonstrate our findings.</description>

      <title>Facilitating the Integration of LLMs Into Online Experiments With Simple Chat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, understanding human-LLM interactions is emerging as a central priority in psychological research. Online experiments offer an efficient means to study human-LLM interactions, yet integrating LLMs into established survey platforms remains technically demanding, particularly when aiming for ecologically valid, real-time conversational experiences with strong experimental control. We introduce Simple Chat, an open-source, research-focused chat interface that streamlines LLM integration for platforms such as Qualtrics, oTree, and LimeSurvey, while presenting a unified participant experience across conditions. Simple Chat connects to both commercial providers and open-weights models, supports streaming responses to preserve conversational flow, and offers an administrative interface for fine-grained control of prompts and interface features. By reducing technical barriers, standardizing interfaces, and improving participant experience, Simple Chat helps advance the study of human-LLM interaction. In this article, we outline Simple Chat's key features, provide a step-by-step tutorial, and demonstrate its utility through two illustrative case studies.</description>
