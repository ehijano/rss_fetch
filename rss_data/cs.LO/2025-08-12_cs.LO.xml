      <title>On the fault diameter and wide diameter of the exchanged 3-ary $n$-cube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault diameter and wide diameter are two critical parameters for evaluating communication performance in interconnection networks. They measure the fault tolerance and transmission efficiency of networks. The exchanged 3-ary $n$-cube is a recently proposed variant of the hypercube, denoted by $E3C(r, s, t)$. In this work, we obtain that the $(2r + 1)$-fault diameter and $(2r + 2)$-wide diameter of $E3C(r, s, t)$ are bounded between $n + 3$ and $n + 5$ for $1 \leq r \leq s \leq t$.</description>

      <title>Presburger Functional Synthesis: Complexity and Tractable Normal Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a relational specification between inputs and outputs as a logic formula, the problem of functional synthesis is to automatically synthesize a function from inputs to outputs satisfying the relation. Recently, a rich line of work has emerged tackling this problem for specifications in different theories, from Boolean to general first-order logic. In this paper, we launch an investigation of this problem for the theory of Presburger Arithmetic, that we call Presburger Functional Synthesis (PFnS). We show that PFnS can be solved in EXPTIME and provide a matching exponential lower bound. This is unlike the case for Boolean functional synthesis (BFnS), where only conditional exponential lower bounds are known. Further, we show that PFnS for one input and one output variable is as hard as BFnS in general. We then identify a special normal form, called PSyNF, for the specification formula that guarantees poly-time and poly-size solvability of PFnS. We prove several properties of PSyNF, including how to check and compile to this form, and conditions under which any other form that guarantees poly-time solvability of PFnS can be compiled in poly-time to PSyNF. Finally, we identify a syntactic normal form that is easier to check but is exponentially less succinct than PSyNF.</description>

      <title>From Knowledge to Conjectures: A Modal Framework for Reasoning about Hypotheses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new family of cognitive modal logics designed to formalize conjectural reasoning: a modal system in which cognitive contexts extend known facts with hypothetical assumptions to explore their consequences. Unlike traditional doxastic and epistemic systems, conjectural logics rely on a principle, called Axiom C ($\varphi \rightarrow \Box\varphi$), that ensures that all established facts are preserved across hypothetical layers. While Axiom C was dismissed in the past due to its association with modal collapse, we show that the collapse only arises under classical and bivalent assumptions, and specifically in the presence of Axiom T. Hence we avoid Axiom T and adopt a paracomplete semantic framework, grounded in Weak Kleene logic or Description Logic, where undefined propositions coexist with modal assertions. This prevents the modal collapse and guarantees a layering to distinguish between factual and conjectural statements. Under this framework we define new modal systems, e.g., KC and KDC, and show that they are complete, decidable, and robust under partial knowledge. Finally, we introduce a dynamic operation, $\mathsf{settle}(\varphi)$, which formalizes the transition from conjecture to accepted fact, capturing the event of the update of a world's cognitive state through the resolution of uncertainty.</description>

      <title>A Rule-Based Approach to Specifying Preferences over Conflicting Facts and Querying Inconsistent Knowledge Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Repair-based semantics have been extensively studied as a means of obtaining meaningful answers to queries posed over inconsistent knowledge bases (KBs). While several works have considered how to exploit a priority relation between facts to select optimal repairs, the question of how to specify such preferences remains largely unaddressed. This motivates us to introduce a declarative rule-based framework for specifying and computing a priority relation between conflicting facts. As the expressed preferences may contain undesirable cycles, we consider the problem of determining when a set of preference rules always yields an acyclic relation, and we also explore a pragmatic approach that extracts an acyclic relation by applying various cycle removal techniques. Towards an end-to-end system for querying inconsistent KBs, we present a preliminary implementation and experimental evaluation of the framework, which employs answer set programming to evaluate the preference rules, apply the desired cycle resolution techniques to obtain a priority relation, and answer queries under prioritized-repair semantics.</description>

      <title>Runtime Verification for LTL in Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Runtime verification encompasses several lightweight techniques for checking whether a system's current execution satisfies a given specification. We focus on runtime verification for Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). Previous work describes monitors which produce, at every time step one of three outputs - true, false, or inconclusive - depending on whether the observed execution prefix definitively determines satisfaction of the formula. However, for many LTL formulas, such as liveness properties, satisfaction cannot be concluded from any finite prefix. For these properties traditional monitors will always output inconclusive. In this work, we propose a novel monitoring approach that replaces hard verdicts with probabilistic predictions and an associated confidence score. Our method guarantees eventual correctness of the prediction and ensures that confidence increases without bound from that point on.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Circuits for Knowledge Graph Completion with Reduced Rule Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rule-based methods for knowledge graph completion provide explainable results but often require a significantly large number of rules to achieve competitive performance. This can hinder explainability due to overwhelmingly large rule sets. We discover rule contexts (meaningful subsets of rules that work together) from training data and use learned probability distribution (i.e. probabilistic circuits) over these rule contexts to more rapidly achieve performance of the full rule set. Our approach achieves a 70-96% reduction in number of rules used while outperforming baseline by up to 31$\times$ when using equivalent minimal number of rules and preserves 91% of peak baseline performance even when comparing our minimal rule sets against baseline's full rule sets. We show that our framework is grounded in well-known semantics of probabilistic logic, does not require independence assumptions, and that our tractable inference procedure provides both approximate lower bounds and exact probability of a given query. The efficacy of our method is validated by empirical studies on 8 standard benchmark datasets where we show competitive performance by using only a fraction of the rules required by AnyBURL's standard inference method, the current state-of-the-art for rule-based knowledge graph completion. This work may have further implications for general probabilistic reasoning over learned sets of rules.</description>

      <title>GLIDR: Graph-Like Inductive Logic Programming with Differentiable Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentiable inductive logic programming (ILP) techniques have proven effective at finding approximate rule-based solutions to link prediction and node classification problems on knowledge graphs; however, the common assumption of chain-like rule structure can hamper the performance and interpretability of existing approaches. We introduce GLIDR, a differentiable rule learning method that models the inference of logic rules with more expressive syntax than previous methods. GLIDR uses a differentiable message passing inference algorithm that generalizes previous chain-like rule learning methods to allow rules with features like branches and cycles. GLIDR has a simple and expressive rule search space which is parameterized by a limit on the maximum number of free variables that may be included in a rule. Explicit logic rules can be extracted from the weights of a GLIDR model for use with symbolic solvers. We demonstrate that GLIDR can significantly outperform existing rule learning methods on knowledge graph completion tasks and even compete with embedding methods despite the inherent disadvantage of being a structure-only prediction method. We show that rules extracted from GLIDR retain significant predictive performance, and that GLIDR is highly robust to training data noise. Finally, we demonstrate that GLIDR can be chained with deep neural networks and optimized end-to-end for rule learning on arbitrary data modalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify all Mal'cev clones over a three-element set up to minion homomorphisms. This is another step toward the complete classification of three-element relational structures up to pp-constructability. We furthermore provide an alternative proof of Bulatov's result that all Mal'cev clones over a three-element set have an at most 4-ary relational basis.</description>

      <title>Proof-theoretic Semantics for Second-order Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a proof-theoretic semantics (P-tS) for second-order logic (S-oL), providing an inferentialist alternative to both full and Henkin model-theoretic interpretations. Our approach is grounded in base-extension semantics (B-eS), a framework in which meaning is determined by inferential roles relative to atomic systems -- collections of rules that encode an agent's pre-logical inferential commitments. We show how both classical and intuitionistic versions of S-oL emerge from this set-up by varying the class of atomic systems. These systems yield modular soundness and completeness results for corresponding Hilbert-style calculi, which we prove equivalent to Henkin's account of S-oL. In doing so, we reframe second-order quantification as systematic substitution rather than set-theoretic commitment, thereby offering a philosophically lightweight yet expressive semantics for higher-order logic. This work contributes to the broader programme of grounding logical meaning in use rather than reference and offers a new lens on the foundations of logic and mathematics.</description>

      <title>Best-Effort Policies for Robust Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the common generalization of Markov decision processes (MDPs) with sets of transition probabilities, known as robust MDPs (RMDPs). A standard goal in RMDPs is to compute a policy that maximizes the expected return under an adversarial choice of the transition probabilities. If the uncertainty in the probabilities is independent between the states, known as s-rectangularity, such optimal robust policies can be computed efficiently using robust value iteration. However, there might still be multiple optimal robust policies, which, while equivalent with respect to the worst-case, reflect different expected returns under non-adversarial choices of the transition probabilities. Hence, we propose a refined policy selection criterion for RMDPs, drawing inspiration from the notions of dominance and best-effort in game theory. Instead of seeking a policy that only maximizes the worst-case expected return, we additionally require the policy to achieve a maximal expected return under different (i.e., not fully adversarial) transition probabilities. We call such a policy an optimal robust best-effort (ORBE) policy. We prove that ORBE policies always exist, characterize their structure, and present an algorithm to compute them with a small overhead compared to standard robust value iteration. ORBE policies offer a principled tie-breaker among optimal robust policies. Numerical experiments show the feasibility of our approach.</description>

      <title>Neural Logic Networks for Interpretable Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional neural networks have an impressive classification performance, but what they learn cannot be inspected, verified or extracted. Neural Logic Networks on the other hand have an interpretable structure that enables them to learn a logical mechanism relating the inputs and outputs with AND and OR operations. We generalize these networks with NOT operations and biases that take into account unobserved data and develop a rigorous logical and probabilistic modeling in terms of concept combinations to motivate their use. We also propose a novel factorized IF-THEN rule structure for the model as well as a modified learning algorithm. Our method improves the state-of-the-art in Boolean networks discovery and is able to learn relevant, interpretable rules in tabular classification, notably on an example from the medical field where interpretability has tangible value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14494v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce monoidal streams. Monoidal streams are a generalization of causal stream functions, which can be defined in cartesian monoidal categories, to arbitrary symmetric monoidal categories. In the same way that streams provide semantics to dataflow programming with pure functions, monoidal streams provide semantics to dataflow programming with theories of processes represented by a symmetric monoidal category. Monoidal streams also form a feedback monoidal category. In the same way that we can use a coinductive stream calculus to reason about signal flow graphs, we can use coinductive string diagrams to reason about feedback monoidal categories. As an example, we study syntax for a stochastic dataflow language, with semantics in stochastic monoidal streams.</description>

Abstract: Using Isabelle/HOL, we verify a union-find data structure with an explain operation due to Nieuwenhuis and Oliveras. We devise a simpler, more naive version of the explain operation whose soundness and completeness is easy to verify. Then, we prove the original formulation of the explain operation to be equal to our version. Finally, we refine this data structure to Imperative HOL, enabling us to export efficient imperative code. The formalisation provides a stepping stone towards the verification of proof-producing congruence closure algorithms which are a core ingredient of Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers.</description>

      <title>Interpolation for the two-way modal mu-calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12899v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two-way modal mu-calculus is the extension of the (standard) one-way mu-calculus with converse (backward-looking) modalities. For this logic we introduce two new sequent-style proof calculi: a non-wellfounded system admitting infinite branches and a finitary, cyclic version of this that employs annotations. As is common in sequent systems for two-way modal logics, our calculi feature an analytic cut rule. What distinguishes our approach is the use of so-called trace atoms, which serve to apply Vardi's two-way automata in a proof-theoretic setting. We prove soundness and completeness for both systems and subsequently use the cyclic calculus to show that the two-way mu-calculus has the (local) Craig interpolation property, with respect to both propositions and modalities. Our proof uses a version of Maehara's method adapted to cyclic proof systems. As a corollary we prove that the two-way mu-calculus also enjoys Beth's definability property.</description>

      <title>Runtime Monitoring and Enforcement of Conditional Fairness in Generative AIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16663v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deployment of generative AI (GenAI) models raises significant fairness concerns, addressed in this paper through novel characterization and enforcement techniques specific to GenAI. Unlike standard AI performing specific tasks, GenAI's broad functionality requires ``conditional fairness'' tailored to the context being generated, such as demographic fairness in generating images of poor people versus successful business leaders. We define two fairness levels: the first evaluates fairness in generated outputs, independent of prompts and models; the second assesses inherent fairness with neutral prompts. Given the complexity of GenAI and challenges in fairness specifications, we focus on bounding the worst case, considering a GenAI system unfair if the distance between appearances of a specific group exceeds preset thresholds. We also explore combinatorial testing for assessing relative completeness in intersectional fairness. By bounding the worst case, we develop a prompt injection scheme within an agent-based framework to enforce conditional fairness with minimal intervention, validated on state-of-the-art GenAI systems.</description>

      <title>The Scott space of lattice of closed subsets with supremum operator as a topological semilattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present several equivalent conditions of the continuity of the supremum function from the square of the Scott space of $C(X)$ to itself under mild assumptions, where $C(X)$ denotes the lattice of closed subsets of a $\mathbf{T_0}$ topological space.
  We also show that a $\mathbf{T_0}$ space is quasicontinuous (quasialgebraic) iff the lattice of its closed subsets is a quasicontinuous (quasialgebraic) domain by using $n$-approximation. Furthermore, we provide a necessary condition for when a topological space possesses a Scott completion. This allows us to give more examples which do not have Scott completions.</description>

Abstract: We continue our analysis of Yablo's coding of the liar paradox by infinite acyclic graphs. The present notes are based on and continue the author's previous results on the problem. In particular, our approach is often more systematic than before.</description>
