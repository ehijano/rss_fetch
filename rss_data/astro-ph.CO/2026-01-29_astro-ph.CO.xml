      <title>An X-ray-Emitting Proto-Cluster at $z\approx5.7$ Reveals Rapid Structure Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters are the most massive gravitationally bound structures in the universe and serve as tracers of the assembly of large-scale structure. Studying their progenitors, proto-clusters, sheds light on the earliest stages of cluster formation. Yet, detecting proto-clusters is demanding: their member galaxies are loosely bound and the emerging hot intracluster medium (ICM) may only be in the initial stages of virialization. Recent JWST observations located several proto-cluster candidates by identifying overdensities of $z\gtrsim5$ galaxies. However, none of these candidates was detected by X-ray observations, which offer a powerful way to unveil the hot ICM. Here, we report the combined Chandra and JWST detection of a proto-cluster, JADES-ID1, at $z\approx5.68$, merely one billion years after the Big Bang. We measure a bolometric X-ray luminosity of $L_{\rm bol} = (1.5^{+0.5}_{-0.6}) \times10^{44} \ \rm{erg \ s^{-1}}$ and infer a total gravitating mass of $M_{500}= (1.8^{+0.6}_{-0.7}) \times 10^{13} \ \rm{M_{\odot}}$, making this system a progenitor of today's most massive galaxy clusters. The detection of extended, shock-heated gas indicates that substantial ICM heating can occur in massive halos as early as $z\approx5.7$. In addition, given the limited survey volume, the discovery of such a massive cluster is statistically unlikely, implying that the formation of the large-scale structure must have occurred more rapidly in some regions of the early universe than standard cosmological models predict.</description>

      <title>A dynamical systems approach to studying the equivalence principle in dilaton gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a string-inspired dilaton cosmology in the Damour--Polyakov (DP) regime using dynamical-systems methods, aiming to make explicit how cosmological relaxation controls deviations from the equivalence principle. Working in the Einstein frame, we consider a spatially flat FLRW universe filled with pressureless matter and a universally coupled dilaton. Expanding the conformal coupling function and the scalar potential around the least-coupling point, we obtain a closed and self-consistent autonomous system governing the late-time evolution of the scalar-matter sector. The resulting phase space contains a stable fixed point associated with least coupling, approached only asymptotically along cosmological trajectories. Therefore, at any finite epoch the solution typically retains a small displacement from the fixed point. In the DP regime this finite-epoch displacement sets the ambient coupling, and thus determines the magnitude of fifth-force effects and deviations from the equivalence principle in the nonrelativistic limit. By linearising the system around a finite-epoch reference state, we show that the damping of the displacement is controlled by the Jacobian eigenvalues of the DP fixed point. This yields a direct dynamical estimate of how rapidly deviations from the equivalence principle are reduced during cosmological evolution. The mechanism is global and cosmological in origin, and is conceptually distinct from local environmental screening as in chameleon or symmetron scenarios. Overall, our results illustrate how phase-space techniques provide a clear bridge between cosmological dynamics and weak-field departures from General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Model independent test of the FLRW metric and the curvature in light of DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a data-driven test of the FLRW metric and the flatness of the Universe, independently of any Dark Energy model, and in light of the latest DESI DR2 results. We use Pantheon+ and DESY5 SNIa data to reconstruct the distance modulus, dimensionless comoving distance and Hubble parameter, using an iterative smoothing algorithm. Then, combining the various reconstructions with the recent BAO measurements from DESI DR2, we perform the $\mathcal{O}_k$ diagnostic, a litmus test of the FLRW metric and the flatness of the Universe. We obtain robust results that do not depend on Dark Energy models and test some of the underlying hypotheses of the concordance model. We find that when the reconstructed $\mathcal{O}_k$ diagnostic is consistent with the FLRW metric, then the median value of $\Oko$ over all reconstructions that provide an improved fit relative to the flat $\Lambda$CDM model are: ${\Omega}_{k,0}^\text{med} = 0.035 ^{+0.046}_{-0.079}\pm 0.037$ for the Pantheon+ \&amp; DESI DR2 data combination, ${\Omega}_{k,0}^\text{med} = 0.092 ^{+0.055}_{-0.132} \pm 0.064$ for the same data but with the Pantheon+ SNIa cut at redshift $z=1.13$, which is the maximum redshift of the DES~Y5 data, and ${\Omega}_{k,0}^\text{med} = -0.119^{+0.113}_{-0.047}\pm 0.043$ for DES~Y5 \&amp; DESI DR2. The first uncertainties correspond to the spread in $\Oko$ over all reconstructions, followed by the median 1$\sigma$ error.</description>

      <title>SPT-3G D1: A Measurement of Secondary Cosmic Microwave Background Anisotropy Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report new measurements of millimeter-wave temperature power spectra in the angular multipole range $1700 \le \ell \le 11,000$ (wavelengths $13^\prime \gtrsim \lambda \gtrsim 2^\prime$). We use two years of data in three observing bands centered near 95, 150, and 220 GHz from the SPT-3G receiver on the South Pole Telescope that cover a 1646 deg$^2$ region of the Southern sky. Using the measured power spectra, we present constraints on the thermal and kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effects, radio galaxies, and cosmic infrared background (CIB). We find that inferred SZ powers are dependent on the detailed modeling of the thermal SZ-CIB correlation, and to a lesser extent on the assumed angular dependence of the SZ spectra. We report constraints for simulation-based model templates as well as fits where the angular dependencies of the SZ and CIB power spectra are allowed to vary. In the latter case at $\ell=3000$, we find thermal SZ power at 143 GHz of $D_{3000}^{\rm tSZ} = 4.91\pm0.37\, \mu{\rm K}^2$ and kinematic SZ power of $D_{3000}^{\rm kSZ} =1.75\pm0.86\, \mu{\rm K}^2$. We use the measured kinematic SZ power to estimate the duration of reionization, noting that the reionization inferences are sensitive to the model choices and assumed level of homogeneous kinematic SZ power from the late-time universe. We find a 95% limit on the duration from an ionization fraction of 25% to 75% of $\Delta^{50} z_{\rm re} &lt;\,3.8$ based on a semi-analytic model, or a limit on the duration from an ionization fraction of 5% to 95% of $\Delta^{90} z_{\rm re} &lt;\,6.1$ based on the AMBER simulations.</description>

      <title>Apparent Dark-Energy Evolution from Cosmic Inhomogeneities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mildly inhomogeneous universe with a cosmological constant may look like it contains evolving dark energy. We show that could be the case by modelling the inhomogeneities and their effects in three different ways: as clumped matter surrounded by voids, as back-reaction of small-scale structure on the overall expansion of the Universe, and, finally, as a large-scale curvature inhomogeneity. In all of these cases, the propagation of light is affected, and differs from that in a homogeneous and isotropic universe. The net result is that cosmological observables, such as angular diameter and luminosity distances, become distorted. We find, in all three models, that the inclusion of these effects pushes the distance-redshift relation towards closer agreement with recent data from both supernovae Ia from the Dark Energy Survey, and from baryon acoustic oscillations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. The amount of inhomogeneity in these models might not be enough to explain the entirety of the deviation from a cosmological constant, but is found to be of a similar order of magnitude, hinting that these data may be consistent with a universe dominated by a cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Replicating weak-lensing summary-statistic covariances with normalizing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the ability of normalizing flow (NF) generative models to reproduce weak-lensing summary statistics when trained on a set of cosmological simulations. Our analysis focuses on how accurately NF models recover the mean, standard deviation, and covariance of key statistics derived from convergence ($\kappa$) maps: The angular power spectrum $C_{\ell}$, probability density function, and Minkowski functionals of weak lensing convergence $\kappa$-maps. We test two scenarios for training: (1) on the data vectors and (2) on the full $\kappa$-maps. In both cases, the NF models reproduce the mean and variance of the target statistics within percent-level accuracy. However, the accuracy of the off-diagonal elements of the covariance matrix is underestimated by up to $\sim25\%$. We study several mitigation strategies and find that data augmentation and training with noisy fields help improve covariance recovery to $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$. Our study demonstrates that while the means and variances of weak lensing statistics can be well modeled by NF, covariances can be significantly underestimated if mitigation strategies are not applied.</description>

      <title>How well is the local Large Scale Structure of the Universe known? CosmicFlows vs. Biteau's Galaxy Catalog with Cloning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge of the actual density distribution of matter in the local universe is needed for a variety of purposes -- for instance, as a baseline model for ultrahigh energy cosmic ray sources in the continuum limit and for predicting the diffuse Dark Matter annihilation signal. Determining the local mass density and velocity distribution is the aim of the CosmicFlows project. An alternate approach is based on catalogs of galaxies, supplemented with some scheme for filling in for unseen galaxies. Here, we compare the density field proposed by Biteau (2021) with the quasi-linear density field of CosmicFlows2 (Hoffman et al. 2018) and the mean posterior field of CosmicFlows4 (Valade 2026). We find factor-two level differences in some regions and even greater in regions toward the Galactic center zone of avoidance (ZoA) (|l| &lt; 30{\deg}, |b| &lt; 20{\deg}) as filled by Biteau using "cloning". Within 11 Mpc the density field is well-determined by the Local Volume catalog (Karachentsev et al. 2018) which Biteau directly incorporates; at larger distances, Biteau (2021) should not be used in the ZoA where "galaxies" are entirely fictitious but otherwise is to be preferred over CosmicFlows emphasizing the direction and integrated mass of structures; the radial distribution of mass in Biteau (2021) is less robust due to line-of-sight peculiar velocities. The angular positions of structures in CosmicFlows are sometimes not congruent with evidence in the galaxy catalog.</description>

      <title>Euclid preparation. Galaxy power spectrum modelling in redshift space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modelling of redshift-space distortions (RSD) is essential for maximizing the cosmological information extracted from large galaxy redshift surveys. In preparation for the forthcoming analysis of the Euclid spectroscopic data, we investigate three approaches to modelling RSD effects on the power spectrum multipoles of mock H$\alpha$ emission line galaxies. We focus on two one-loop perturbation theory models -- the effective field theory (EFT) and velocity difference generator (${\rm VDG_ \infty}$) -- which differ in their treatment of the real-to-redshift space mapping on small scales, and a third approach, the BACCO emulator, which adopts a hybrid strategy combining perturbation theory with high-resolution N-body simulations. We assess the ability of these models to recover key cosmological parameters, including the expansion rate $h$, the cold dark matter density parameter $\omega_{\rm c}$, and the scalar amplitude $A_{\rm s}$, across four redshift bins spanning $0.9 \leq z \leq 1.8$. In each bin, we find that ${\rm VDG_ \infty}$ and BACCO outperform the EFT model across all scales up to $k_{max} \lesssim 0.35 h\,Mpc^{-1} $. While BACCO saturates in constraining power at intermediate scales and higher redshift, the ${\rm VDG_ \infty}$ model continues to improve parameter constraints beyond $k_{max} \gtrsim 0.30 h\,Mpc^{-1}$. The EFT model, although robust on large scales, exhibits significant parameter biases for $k_{max} \gtrsim 0.25 h\,Mpc^{-1}$, limiting its applicability to Euclid-like H$\alpha$ samples. Among the full perturbation theory-based models, the enhanced treatment of small-scale RSD effects in ${\rm VDG_ \infty}$ improves cosmological parameter constraints by up to a factor of two.</description>

      <title>General Scalar Field Inflation ACT Attractors: Utilizing the $n_s(r)$ relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ACT data have severely constrained the single scalar field models. Known models of inflation, like the Starobinsky model, the Higgs model and the $a$-attractors are at least $2\sigma$ off the ACT data. In this work we aim to provide a top-to-bottom approach in single scalar field inflationary cosmology compatible with the ACT data. Specifically, inspired by the fact that the Starobinsky model, the Higgs model and the $a$-attractors, all being plateau potentials, result to the same attractor relation between the spectral index of scalar perturbations and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, which is of the form $n_s(r)=1-\alpha r^{1/2}$, in this work we seek for attractors of the form $n_s(r)=f(r)$ that may lead to ACT-compatible inflation. Specifically, we fix the function $f(r)$ to have a specific desirable form and then solve the differential equation $n_s(r)=f(r)$ to find the potential which results to the relation $n_s(r)=f(r)$. We discovered analytically three classes of potentials which are variants of the general form $n_s(r)=\gamma \pm \beta r \pm r^{1/2}$ and all these models are found to be compatible with the ACT data.</description>

      <title>A Remedy of the Trans-Planckian Censorship Problem with Smooth Slow-roll to Power-law Inflation Transitions in Scalar Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that if the standard slow-roll inflation is followed by a power-law inflationary regime, then the trans-Planckian modes may be safely be contained in the Hubble horizon and never exit it during inflation. In this work we investigate how to realize a smooth transition between a slow-roll and a power-law inflationary regime in the context of single scalar field inflation. As we show it is possible to realize such a smooth transition by generalizing the kinetic energy of single scalar field in the form $\dot{\phi}^2=\beta(\phi)V(\phi)$, where $\beta(\phi)$ is some appropriate function of the scalar field. Using two distinct approaches we show that it is possible to realize a smooth transition from a slow-roll to a power-law inflationary regime, and the two approaches produce identical results regarding the slow-roll regime. Also we show that the slow-roll regime is quite short, about $N\sim 30$ $e$-foldings, with the flatness and horizon problems being solved with the synergistic effect of the two inflationary patches. The slow-roll era is found to be compatible with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope data.</description>

      <title>An Analytic Scale-dependent Dark Matter Profile and the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we use the recently introduced concept of self-interacting dark matter with scale-dependent equation of state, and we provide an analytic model of dark matter that can produce viable rotation curves even for low-surface-brightness galaxies, irregular galaxies, low-luminosity spirals and dwarf galaxies, all known to challenge the cold dark matter description. The radius dependent effective equation of state of the self-interacting dark matter model we shall introduce is assumed to be an isothermal equation of state of the form $P(r)=K(r)\left(\frac{\rho(r)}{\rho_{\star}}\right)$, where the energy density will have the form $\rho(r)=\frac{\rho_0}{\left( 1+\frac{r^2}{\alpha^2}\right)^{5/2}}$, while the entropy function $K(r)$ is $K(r)=\frac{K_0}{\left( 1+\frac{r^2}{\alpha^2}\right)^{1/2}}$. The resulting model is confronted in detail with the SPARC galaxy data and 175 galaxies are used and tested. It proves that the analytic model can successfully produce the rotation curves of 116 galaxies, most of which are small mass spirals, irregular galaxies, low-surface-brightness and low-luminosity spirals and dwarf galaxies. On the other hand, 59 galaxies cannot be successfully described by our analytic model. We tested statistically the correlation between the parameter $K_0$ of the entropy function corresponding to the viable galaxies, and the flat rotation velocity $V_{flat}$ and the maximum rotation velocity $V_{max}$ of the galaxies from the SPARC data. We also examined the baryon mass $M_b$-$K_0$ relation and the luminosity $L$-$K_0$ relation. We have been able to produce the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation for the viable galaxies, directly from the correlation $K_0$-$M_b$ and $K_0$-$V_{flat}$, with the resulting relation being $M_b\sim V_{flat}^{4.026 \pm 0.371}$, however we failed to produce the canonical Tully-Fisher relation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cosmology as a Hydrogen atom: Discrete $\Lambda$ and cyclic Universes from Wheeler-DeWitt quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building upon our recently established correspondence between quantum cosmology and the hydrogen atom [1], we investigate the specific sector of a negative cosmological constant ($\Lambda &lt; 0$) in a flat FLRW universe with dust. While the positive $\Lambda$ sector [1] yields a continuous spectrum and a single bounce, we show here that the negative $\Lambda$ sector leads to a discrete spectrum of energy eigenvalues, effectively quantizing the cosmological constant. Within this dual description, the operator-ordering ambiguity parameter appears as the azimuthal quantum number of the hydrogen atom. A skewed Bohr correspondence emerges for the bound states, matching classical evolution at large volumes but deviating near the bounce. By constructing wave packets from these bound states, we demonstrate that the classical Big Bang and Big Crunch singularities are resolved, and the universe oscillates between quantum bounces and classical turnaround points. The expectation values of the observables indicate a cyclic universe -- with vanishing Hubble parameter at turnarounds -- undergoing quantum bounces. This exactly solvable model offers a tractable setting to explore quantum gravitational effects in cosmology. We analyze the properties of this cyclic universe, contrasting its bound-state dynamics with the scattering states of the de Sitter case.</description>

Abstract: Axion, the goldstone boson arising from the spontaneous breaking of a global $U(1)$ Peccei-Quinn symmetry, provides a dynamical solution to the strong CP problem and is an excellent dark matter candidate. Various experiments are designed to search for the axion, however no confirmative signal has been observed. On the other hand, there are also hypothetical heavy particles in axion models, such as the heavy scalar $s$, which is the CP-even component of the complex scalar that carries $U(1)_{PQ}$ charge, and the vector-like heavy quark (VLQ) in the Kim-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov~(KSVZ) axion model. Studying signals induced by them are helpful for axion searches. In this paper, we calculate the graviton bremsstrahlung energy spectrum arising from the decay of the heavy scalar or VLQ in the KSVZ model. The result shows that these heavy particles can emit ultrahigh-frequency gravitational waves (GWs), with the peak frequency depending on the model's parameter inputs. In addition, the graviton spectrum is distinguished from the thermal GW background at high frequencies if there is an early matter-dominated era induced by these heavy particles. Future measurements of ultrahigh-frequency GWs may provide indirect evidence for the KSVZ axion.</description>

      <title>Formation of trapped vacuum bubbles during inflation, and consequences for PBH scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09990v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A class of inflationary scenarios for primordial black hole (PBH) formation include a small barrier in the slope of the potential. There, the inflaton slows down, generating an enhancement of primordial perturbations. Moreover, the background solution overcomes the barrier at a very low speed, and large backward quantum fluctuations can prevent certain regions from overshooting the barrier. This leads to localized bubbles where the field remains trapped behind the barrier. In such models, therefore, we have two distinct channels for PBH production: the standard adiabatic density perturbation channel and the bubble channel. Here, we perform numerical simulations of bubble formation, addressing the issues of initial conditions, critical amplitude and bubble expansion. Further, we explore the scaling behaviour of the co-moving size of bubbles with the initial amplitude of the field fluctuation. We find that for small to moderate non-Gaussianity $f_{\rm NL}\lesssim 2.6$, the threshold for the formation of vacuum bubbles agrees with previous analytical estimates arXiv:1908.11357 to $5\%$ accuracy or so. We also show that the mass distribution for the two channels is different, leading to a slightly broader range of PBH masses. The bubble channel is subdominant for small $f_{\rm NL}$, and becomes dominant for $f_{\rm NL}\gtrsim 2.6$. We find that the mass of PBHs in the bubble channel is determined by an adiabatic overdensity surrounding the bubble at the end of inflation. Remarkably, the profile of this overdensity turns out to be of type-II. This represents a first clear example showing that overdensities of type-II can be dominant relative to the standard type-I. We also comment on exponential tails and on the fact that in models with local type non-Gaussianity (such as the one considered here), the occurrence of alternative channels can easily be inferred from unitarity considerations.</description>

      <title>Unified reconstruction of the Lyman-alpha power spectrum with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complex geometry of the Ly$\alpha$ forest data has motivated the use of various two-point statistics as alternatives to the three-dimensional power spectrum ($P_{\mathrm{3D}}$), which carries cosmological information in Fourier space. On large scales, the three-dimensional correlation function ($\xi_\mathrm{3D}$) has provided robust measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale at 150~Mpc. On smaller scales, the one-dimensional power spectrum, $P_{\mathrm{1D}}(k_\|)$, has been the primary tool for extracting information. At the same time, the cross-spectrum, $P_\times(\theta, k_\|)$, has been introduced to incorporate angular information without the complications caused by survey window functions. We propose an analytical forward-modeling framework to reconstruct $P_{\mathrm{3D}}$ from all these observables, based on the mathematical relation between them and $P_{\mathrm{3D}}$. We demonstrate the performance of our method using a hypothetical mock data vector representative of future Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) measurements. We show that the monopole of $P_{\mathrm{3D}}$ can be reconstructed in 25 $k$ bins between $0.07~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $1.8~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, achieving an average precision of $\sigma_P/P=13\%$ across the bins. Our method can serve as an intermediary for consistency checks, though it is not intended to replace direct $P_{\mathrm{3D}}$ estimation.</description>

      <title>Clustering properties of the CatWISE2020 quasar catalogue and their impact on the cosmic dipole anomaly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmic dipole anomaly -- the observation of a significant mismatch between the dipole observed in the matter distribution and that expected given the kinematic interpretation of the cosmic microwave background dipole -- poses a serious challenge to the Cosmological Principle upon which the standard model of cosmology rests. Measurements of the dipole ($\ell=1$) in a given sample crucially depend on having control over other large-scale power ($\ell &gt; 1$) so as to avoid biases, in particular those potentially caused by correlations among multipoles during fitting, and those by local source clustering. Currently, the most powerful catalogue that exhibits the cosmic dipole anomaly is the sample of 1.6~million mid-infrared quasars derived from CatWISE2020. We therefore analyse clustering properties of this catalogue by performing an inference analysis of large-scale multipoles in real space, and by computing its angular power spectrum on small scales to test for convergence with $\Lambda$CDM. After accounting for the known trend of the quasar number counts with ecliptic latitude, we find that any other large-scale power is consistent with noise, find no evidence for the presence of an octupole ($\ell=3$) in the data, and quantify the clustering dipole's proportion to be marginal. Our results therefore reaffirm the anomalously high dipole in the distribution of quasars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a local-to-global cosmological framework in which cosmic acceleration emerges from structure formation in an inhomogeneous Einstein-de Sitter (iEdS) universe, without dark energy. The model exhibits a quasilinear coasting evolution toward an effective Milne state driven by growing inhomogeneities. We test the iEdS model with ${H_0=72.5\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}}$ and ${\Omega_{\mathrm{m},0}=0.272}$ using CMB, BAO, and SN Ia data. The iEdS model fits the data comparably to $\Lambda$CDM and resolves the $H_0$ tension, while yielding a cosmic age ${t_0\simeq 13.67\ \mathrm{Gyr}}$ consistent with globular-cluster estimates.</description>

      <title>The Origins of the Bulk flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the origin of the large-scale bulk flow using the CosmicFlows-4 (CF4) peculiar-velocity catalog. We decompose the observed motions into internal components, generated by mass fluctuations within 200 Mpc/h, and external ones arising from structures beyond this volume. A weighted-average technique is developed to test the model's self-consistency while minimizing the impact of non-Gaussian distance errors. The CF4 velocities show excellent agreement with the predicted internal field, yielding beta = 0.31 pm 0.01. We also determine that the value of the Hubble constant that should be used for calculating peculiar velocities from the CF4 to be H0 = 75.0 pm 0.1 km/s/Mpc, consistent with CF4 calibrations. Using the minimum-variance formalism, we further separate the bulk flow into its internal and external contributions and find that the observed large-scale bulk flow is dominated by sources beyond 200 Mpc/h. The amplitude of this externally driven flow increases monotonically with scale, consistent with the influence of a distant, massive overdensity. These findings reinforce the reliability of the CF4 velocity field while calling into question the assumption of a spatially uniform flow generated by external sources. Our results challenge the commonly made hypothesis that the flow in our local volume due to external mass concentrations can be modeled as being spatially uniform.</description>

      <title>Inflationary relics from an Ultra-Slow-Roll plateau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in inflationary scenarios featuring an ultra-slow-roll (USR) plateau with a sharp transition to slow roll. We focus on two coexisting production channels: PBHs originating from relic vacuum bubbles where the inflaton got trapped on the plateau, and PBHs arising from standard adiabatic density perturbations. From detailed numerical simulations we find that the bubbles are generically surrounded by type-II curvature fluctuations. Special attention is given to the distribution of initial conditions, including the relevant mean profiles and shape dispersion around them. For the adiabatic channel, we extend the logarithmic template formula $\zeta[\zeta_G]$, which maps the Gaussian curvature perturbation to the fully non-Gaussian one while incorporating mode evolution, and we compare this with numerical results obtained using the $\delta N$ formalism. While the template departs from numerical results near its logarithmic divergence, it still provides accurate threshold values for PBH formation in the parameter range relevant to our analysis. Finally, we compute the PBH mass functions for both channels. We find that the adiabatic channel dominates over the bubble-induced channel by a factor $\sim \mathcal{O}(10-10^{2})$, and that both contributions are largely dominated by the mean profiles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the latest observational data, we constrain the inflationary dynamics and the subsequent reheating epoch. Predictions for both phases can be significantly improved by employing numerically computed results compared to the slow-roll approximations. These results enable a more accurate reassessment of the observational viability of inflationary models, provide tighter constraints on the reheating history, and help lift the degeneracies in the predictions of inflation and reheating dynamics. Given current observational bounds, this enables a more accurate understanding of the early universe physics.</description>

      <title>Inflationary dynamics of non-minimally coupled $f(R)$ matter-curvature theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines how inflationary dynamics are affected by $f(R)$ theories with a non-minimal coupling between matter and curvature. Both positive and negative corrections to the minimal coupling of General Relativity are considered, and a robust numerical method is developed that evolves the metric and the inflaton field in this modified theory beyond slow-roll. Through a stability analysis, we find that positive models are inherently unstable during slow-roll, whereas negative ones can accommodate a stable attractor de Sitter solution. Using the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum from the latest data releases, we constrain the scale of the non-minimal coupling to be above $10^{13}$ GeV. In light of the 2018 Planck, BICEP/Keck and the recent Atacama Cosmology Telescope data for the scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio, strong constraints on the coupling strength force the effects of these modified theories to be, at most, slightly above the perturbative level. Furthermore, we determine that the choice of the perfect fluid matter Lagrangian does not impact the inflationary observables at the pivot scale. Finally, we present the predicted observables for different inflationary potentials and show that even though classical gravity is still preferred by the data, there are areas of the parameter space that are viable for non-minimally coupled inflationary models.</description>

      <title>Consistent Four-derivative Heterotic Truncations and the Kerr-Sen Solution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Four-derivative heterotic supergravity (without gauge fields) reduced on a $p$-dimensional torus leads to half-maximal supergravity coupled to $p$ vector multiplets, and it is known that removing the vector multiplets is a consistent truncation of the theory. We find a new consistent truncation of four-derivative heterotic supergravity on a torus that keeps the vector multiplets and precisely reproduces the bosonic action of heterotic supergravity (with heterotic gauge fields). We show that both truncations have an $O(d+p,d)$ symmetry when reduced on a $d$-dimensional torus and demonstrate how this embeds in the $O(d+p,d+p)$ symmetry that one gets from reducing on a $(d+p)$-dimensional torus without truncation. We then use our new truncation to obtain four-derivative corrections to the Kerr-Sen solution and compute thermodynamic quantities and multipole moments. Finally, we compare the Kerr-Sen solutions of the actions corresponding to the two different choices of truncation with the Kerr solution, the Kerr-Newman solution, and each other, and show that they have distinct four-derivative multipole structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates a singularity-free early Universe within the paradigm of quantum cosmology. We develop a bouncing model where the singularity is resolved via the de Broglie--Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics, which provides a deterministic trajectory for the scale factor through a quantum bounce. The primordial power spectrum for scalar perturbations is derived, incorporating a characteristic modulation (distortion function) imprinted by the nonstandard quantum gravitational dynamics near the bounce. We confront this model with the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background data, establishing its strong compatibility with observations. Our analysis places a stringent upper bound on the fundamental scale of the bounce $k_B$, constraining the parameter space of such quantum cosmological scenarios. {}Furthermore, the model's specific scale-dependent anticorrelation between the spectral index and amplitude of perturbations offers a potential mechanism for mitigating the $H_0$-$\sigma_8$ tension, presenting a testable signature for future cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>The Carousel Lens I: A Spectroscopic Survey of the Carousel Lens Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a spectroscopic survey of field galaxies and lensed sources in the vicinity of the strong lensing galaxy cluster known as the Carousel lens at z=0.49. Using both Gemini/GMOS slitmask spectra and deep VLT/MUSE observations, we bring the total number of lensed sources up to 13, including three which were not previously known from imaging observations but are apparent in the MUSE data as emission-line sources. Of these sources, 10 have confident redshifts, and an additional 2 have tentative redshifts from likely Ly$\alpha$ emission (including seven new redshifts determined here adding to those presented previously in Sheu et al. (2024)). The lensed sources span a redshift range from z=0.96 to 4.09 with most of them showing 3-5 images, including four sources displaying central or radial images. In total, we identify 43 images of these 13 sources. This lens system is remarkably symmetric and well-modeled by a simpler lens model than typical cluster lenses, and the large number of sources and their large range of redshifts make this cluster ideal for constraining cosmological parameters such as $w$ and $\Omega_m$ as well as the cluster density profile. Additionally, we present a catalog of 57 unlensed field galaxies with confident redshifts, of which 49 are associated with the cluster. We measure a cluster velocity dispersion of about 1100 km s$^{-1}$ from which we estimate a halo mass $M_{200c} \approx 1.2 \times 10^{15} M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Probing dark matter interactions with a RES-NOVA prototype cryogenic detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the operation of a 13 g PbWO$_4$ crystal, grown from archaeological Pb and operated as a cryogenic calorimeter in an underground environment. Read out with a Ge thermistor, the detector achieves a low energy threshold and, for the first time, enables the derivation of a dark matter exclusion limit using PbWO$_4$ as target material, for both spin-dependent interactions on neutrons and spin-independent interactions. Although limited in mass and not representative of the final RES-NOVA detector design, this prototype demonstrates effective control of mechanical vibrations and low-energy noise in a cryogenic system, which is a key requirement for rare-event searches. The experiment therefore provides a proof of principle for the RES-NOVA detection concept, validating the use of archaeological Pb-based PbWO$_4$ crystals, low-background operation, and robust data-analysis procedures.
