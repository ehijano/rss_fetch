      <title>Error estimates for deterministic empirical approximations of probability measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question of approximating an arbitrary probability measure in the Wasserstein distance by a discrete one with uniform weights is considered. Estimates are obtained for the rate of convergence as the number of points tends to infinity, depending on the moment parameter, the parameter in the Wasserstein distance, and the dimension. In certain low-dimensional regimes and for measures with unbounded support, the rates are improvements over those obtained through other methods, including through random sampling. Except for some critical cases, the rates are shown to be optimal.</description>

      <title>Non-negative diffusion bridge of the McKean-Vlasov type: analysis of singular diffusion and application to fish migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MVSDEs) have broad potential applications in science and engineering, but remain insufficiently explored. We consider a non-negative McKean-Vlasov diffusion bridge, a diffusion process pinned at both initial and terminal times, motivated by diurnal fish migration phenomena. This type of MVSDEs has not been previously studied. Our particular focus is on a singular diffusion coefficient that blows up at the terminal time, which plays a role in applications of the proposed MVSDE to real fish migration data. We prove that the well-posedness of the MVSDE depends critically on the strength of the singularity in the diffusion coefficient. We present a sufficient condition under which the MVSDE admits a unique strong solution that is continuous and non-negative. We also apply the MVSDE to the latest fine fish count data with a 10-\-min time interval collected from 2023 to 2025 and computationally investigate these models. Thus, this study contributes to the formulation of a new non-negative diffusion bridge along with an application study.</description>

      <title>Infinite-time Mean Field FBSDEs and Viscosity Solutions to Elliptic Master Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a further investigation of the properties of infinite-time mean field FBSDEs and elliptic master equations, which were introduced in \cite{yang2025discounted} as mathematical tools for solving discounted infinite-time mean field games. By establishing the continuous dependence of the FBSDE solutions on their initial values, we prove the flow property of the mean field FBSDEs. Furthermore, we prove that, at the Nash equilibrium, the value function of the representative player constitutes a viscosity solution to the corresponding elliptic master equation. Our work extends the classical theory of finite-time mean field games and parabolic master equations to the infinite-time setting.</description>

      <title>The critical curve of long-range percolation on oriented trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a long-range percolation model on homogeneous oriented trees with several lengths. We obtain the critical surface as the set of zeros of a specific polynomial with coefficients depending explicitly on the lengths and the degree of the tree. Restricting to the case of two lengths, we obtain new bounds on the critical parameters, monotonicity properties, as well as continuity of the critical curve, plus some partial results concerning its convexity. Our proofs rely on the study of the properties of the characteristic polynomial of the transition matrix of a multi-step Markov chain related to the model.</description>

      <title>Local criteria for global connectivity comparisons: beyond stochastic domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a site-wise domination criterion for local percolation models, which enables the comparison of one-arm probabilities even in the absence of stochastic domination. The method relies on a local-to-global principle: if, at each site, one model is more likely than the other to connect to a subset of its neighbors, for all nontrivial such subsets, then this advantage propagates to connectivity events at all scales. In this way, we obtain a robust alternative to stochastic domination, applicable in all cases where the latter works and in many where it does not. As a main application, we compare classical Bernoulli bond percolation with degree-constrained models, showing that degree constraints enhance percolation, and obtain asymptotically optimal bounds on critical parameters for degree-constrained models.</description>

      <title>A Transience Criterion for Uniformly Bounded Markov Chains with Asymptotically Zero Mean Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give an overview of mean drift conditions for the state-space classification of discrete-time Markov Chains and we present a new transience criterion for uniformly bounded Markov Chains with asymptotically zero drift. The criterion does not need a condition on the second-moment drifts and can be applied to certain chains for which other criteria fail.</description>

      <title>Global weak martingale solutions to a stochastic two-sidedly degenerate aggregation-diffusion equation issued from biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to establish the well-posedness of martingale (probabilistic weak) solutions to stochastic degenerate aggregation--diffusion equations arising in biological and public health contexts. The studied equation is of a stochastic degenerate parabolic type, featuring a nonlinear two-sidedly degenerate diffusion term accounting for repulsion, a locally Lipschitz reaction term representing competitive interactions, and a stochastic perturbation term capturing environmental noise and uncertainty in biological systems. The existence of martingale solutions is proved via an auxiliary nondegenerate stochastic system combined with the Faedo--Galerkin method. Convergence of approximate solutions is established through Prokhorov's compactness and Skorokhod's representation theorems, and uniqueness is obtained using a duality approach. Finally, numerical simulations are given to illustrate the impact of environmental noise on aggregation dynamics and the long-term behavior of the system, offering insights that may inspire medical innovation and predictive modeling in public health.</description>

      <title>Convergence in probability of numerical solutions of a highly non-linear delayed stochastic interest rate model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine a delayed stochastic interest rate model with super-linearly growing coefficients and develop several new mathematical tools to establish the properties of its true and truncated EM solutions. Moreover, we show that the true solution converges to the truncated EM solutions in probability as the step size tends to zero. Further, we support the convergence result with some illustrative numerical examples and justify the convergence result for the Monte Carlo evaluation of some financial quantities.</description>

      <title>Averaging principle for slow-fast fractional stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the averaging principle for a class of stochastic systems. The slow component is solution to a fractional differential equation, which is coupled with a fast component considered as solution to an ergodic stochastic differential equation driven by a standard Brownian motion. We establish the convergence of the slow component when the time-scale separation vanishes to the solution of the so-called averaged equation, which is an autonomous fractional differential equation, in the mean-square sense. Moreover, when the fast component does not depend on the slow component, we provide a rate of convergence depending on the order of the fractional derivative.</description>

      <title>A Note on the instability of equilibria for distribution dependent SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the existence of multiple stationary distributions, we study the stability and instability of a stationary distribution for distribution dependent stochastic differential equations. This note is devoted to the instability of a stationary distribution, and links the instability to a spectral property of the generator of the corresponding linearized semigroup to the stochastic equation. Concrete examples, such as the granular media equation with double-wells landscapes, are given to illustrate our main result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2020, F.Cesi introduced a random walk on the hyperoctahedral group $B_n$ and analysed its spectral gap when the allowed generators are transpositions and diagonal elements corresponding to singletons. In this paper we extend the allowed generators to transpositions and any diagonal elements, and characterise completely the set of representations from which the spectral gap arises. This settles a conjecture posed in Cesi's paper.</description>

      <title>Does the Convex Order Between the Distributions of Linear Functionals Imply the Convex Order Between the Probability Distributions Over $\mathbb R^d$?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04269v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that the convex order between the distributions of linear functionals does not imply the convex order between the probability distributions over $\mathbb R^d$ if $d\ge2$. This stands in contrast with the well-known fact that any probability distribution in $\mathbb R^d$, for any $d\ge1$, is determined by the corresponding distributions of linear functionals. By duality, it follows that, for any $d\ge2$, not all convex functions from $\mathbb R^d$ to $\mathbb R$ can be represented as the limits of sums $\sum_{i=1}^k g_i\circ \ell_i$ of convex functions $g_i$ of linear functionals $\ell_i$ on $\mathbb R^d$.</description>

      <title>Perspectives on Stochastic Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We survey different perspectives on the stochastic localization process of [Eld13], a powerful construction that has had many exciting recent applications in high-dimensional probability and algorithm design. Unlike prior surveys on this topic, our focus is on giving a self-contained presentation of all known alternative constructions of Eldan's stochastic localization, with an emphasis on connections between different constructions. Our hope is that by collecting these perspectives, some of which had primarily arisen within a particular community (e.g., probability theory, theoretical computer science, information theory, or machine learning), we can broaden the accessibility of stochastic localization, and ease its future use.</description>

Abstract: In this note we provide a short proof of the distributional equality between last passage percolation with geometric weights along a general down-right path and Schur processes. We do this in both the full-space and half-space settings, and for general parameters. The main inputs for our arguments are generalizations of the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence and Greene's theorem due to Krattenthaler, which are based on Fomin's growth diagrams.</description>

      <title>On the Feinberg-Piunovskiy Theorem and its extension to chattering policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Feinberg-Piunovskiy Theorem established in [14, Theorem 3.8] asserts that for a discrete-time uniformly absorbing and atomless Markov Decision Process (MDP) with Borel state space and multiple criteria, the family of deterministic stationary policies is a sufficient class of policies. In this paper, we study some related problems and some extensions. In particular dropping the atomless hypothesis, we establish that the set of chattering stationary policies is a sufficient class of policies for uniformly absorbing MDPs with measurable state space and multiple criteria. We also prove the Feinberg-Piunovskiy Theorem in the context of a measurable state space in two different ways that differ from \cite{piunovskiy19}. In particular, we show that the sufficiency of chattering stationary policies directly yields the sufficiency of deterministics stationary policies for atomless models. Our approach is partially based on the analysis of extreme points of certain convex sets of occupation measures satisfying integral type constraints. We show that for a uniformly absorbing model an extreme point of such sets is necessarily given by occupation measures induced by chattering stationary policies of order $d+1$ where $d$ is the dimension of the vector of constraints. When in addition the model $\mathsf{M}$ is atomless, then the extreme points of this constrained set of occupation measures are precisely the occupation measures generated by deterministic stationary policies satisfying these constraints.</description>

      <title>Mean-field limits \`a la Tanaka and large deviations for particle systems with network interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a unified framework to study non-exchangeable mean-field particle systems with some general interaction mechanisms. The starting point is a fixed-point formulation of particle systems originally due to Tanaka that allows us to prove mean-field limit and large deviation results in an abstract setting. While it has been recently shown that such formulation encompasses a large class of exchangeable particle systems, we propose here a setting for the non-exchangeable case, including the case of adaptive interaction networks. We introduce sufficient conditions on the network structure that imply the mean-field limit and a new large deviations principle for the interaction measure. Finally, we formally highlight important models for which it is possible to derive a closed PDE characterization of the limit.</description>

Abstract: This paper establishes quantitative limit theorems for two classes of Cox point processes, quantifying their convergence to a Poisson point process (PPP). We employ Stein's method for PPP aproximation, leveraging the generator approach and the Stein-Dirichlet representation formula associated with the Glauber dynamics. First, we investigate a Cox-Poisson process constructed by placing one-dimensional PPPs on the lines of a Poisson line process in $\mathbb{R}^2. We derive an explicit bound on the convergence rate to a homogeneous PPP as the line intensity grows and the point intensity on each line diminishes. Second, we analyze a Cox-Binomial process on the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$, modeling a system of satellites. This process is generated by placing PPPs on great-circle orbits, whose positions are determined by a Binomial point process. For this model, we establish a convergence rate of order $O(1/n)$ to a uniform PPP on the sphere, where n is the number of orbits. The derived bounds provide precise control over the approximation error in both models, with applications in stochastic geometry and spatial statistics.</description>

      <title>A Tauberian approach to metric scaling limits of random discrete structures, with an application to random planar maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05078v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove sandwich theorems and a Tauberian theorem in the space of compact metric measure spaces, endowed with the Gromov-Hausdorff-Prokhorov (GHP) topology. These results hold with respect to a close relative of Gromov's Lipschitz order. As a proof-of-concept of a general method to prove metric scaling limits of random discrete structures, we give an application to the theory of random planar maps: the Brownian sphere is the scaling limit in the GHP topology of irreducible quandrangulations. Our main inputs are (i) the convergence of general quadrangulations to the Brownian sphere (Le Gall, 2013; Miermont, 2013); and (ii) couplings where irreducible quadrangulations of the hexagon are "grown" by face-openings (Addario-Berry, 2014).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The game show Lucky 13 differs from other television game shows in that contestants are required to place a bet on their own knowledge of trivia by selecting a range that contains the number of questions that they answered correctly. We present a model for this game show using binomial random variables and generate tables outlining the optimal range the player should select based on maximization of two different utility functions. After analyzing the decisions made by some actual contestants on this show, we present a numerical simulation for how many questions an average player is expected to answer correctly based on question categories observed for two sample contestants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by optimal re-balancing of a portfolio, we formalize an optimal transport problem in which the transported mass is scaled by a mass-change factor depending on the source and destination. This allows direct modeling of the creation or destruction of mass. We discuss applications and position the framework alongside unbalanced, entropic, and unnormalized optimal transport. The existence of optimal transport plans and strong duality are established. The existence of optimal maps are deduced in two central regimes, i.e., perturbative mass-change and quadratic mass-loss. For $\ell_p$ costs we derive the analogue of the Benamou-Brenier dynamic formulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(\mathcal{A},\mathrm{tr})$ be a von Neumann algebra with a faithful, normal trace $\mathrm{tr}:\mathcal{A}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}.$ For each $a\in\mathcal{A},$ define \[ S(\lambda,\varepsilon)=\mathrm{tr}[\log((a-\lambda)^{\ast}(a-\lambda )+\varepsilon)],\quad\lambda\in\mathbb{C},~\varepsilon&gt;0, \] so that the limit as $\varepsilon\rightarrow0^{+}$ of $S$ is the log potential of the Brown measure of $a.$ Suppose that for a fixed $\lambda\in\mathbb{C},$ the function% \[ \varepsilon\mapsto\frac{\partial S}{\partial\varepsilon}(\lambda ,\varepsilon)=\mathrm{tr}[\log((a-\lambda)^{\ast}(a-\lambda)+\varepsilon )^{-1}] \] admits a real analytic extension to a neighborhood of $0$ in $\mathbb{R}.$ Then we will show that $\lambda$ is outside the spectrum of $a.$
  We will apply this result to several examples involving circular and elliptic elements, as well as free multiplicative Brownian motions. In most cases, we will show that the spectrum of the relevant element $a$ coincides with the support of its Brown measure.</description>

      <title>Fully discrete finite element methods for the stochastic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation with multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03670v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a fully discrete finite element approximation for the stochastic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, combining the standard finite element methods in spatial discretization with the implicit Euler-Maruyama scheme in time. Rigorous error estimates are established for two distinct noise regimes. In the case of bounded multiplicative noise, we prove optimal strong convergence rates in full expectation. The analysis relies crucially on a stochastic Gronwall inequality and an exponential stability estimate for the PDE solution, which together control the interplay between the nonlinear drift and the multiplicative stochastic forcing. For general multiplicative noise, where boundedness no longer holds, we derive sub-optimal convergence rates in probability by introducing a localization technique based on carefully constructed subsets of the sample space. This dual framework demonstrates that the proposed fully discrete scheme achieves strong convergence under bounded noise and probabilistic convergence under general multiplicative noise, thus providing the first comprehensive error analysis for numerical approximations of the stochastic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fifteen years ago, then-Carleton-undergrad Isaac Hodes, proved that the Golden Ratio is evil. In this modest contribution to human knowledge, we show that in fact, every fifth real number is evil, and we present lots of other interesting numbers that are evil. We also show (in addition to many other fascinating facts), that the expected evil-location of a random evil number is 148.185185185185185... . It follows that the Golden Ratio is a fairly average evil real number, since, as first computed by Hodes, the evil location of the Golden Ratio is 146.</description>

      <title>Analysis of kinetic Langevin Monte Carlo under the stochastic exponential Euler discretization from underdamped all the way to overdamped</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03949v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating the kinetic Langevin dynamics is a popular approach for sampling from distributions, where only their unnormalized densities are available. Various discretizations of the kinetic Langevin dynamics have been considered, where the resulting algorithm is collectively referred to as the kinetic Langevin Monte Carlo (KLMC) or underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo. Specifically, the stochastic exponential Euler discretization, or exponential integrator for short, has previously been studied under strongly log-concave and log-Lipschitz smooth potentials via the synchronous Wasserstein coupling strategy. Existing analyses, however, impose restrictions on the parameters that do not explain the behavior of KLMC under various choices of parameters. In particular, all known results fail to hold in the overdamped regime, suggesting that the exponential integrator degenerates in the overdamped limit. In this work, we revisit the synchronous Wasserstein coupling analysis of KLMC with the exponential integrator. Our refined analysis results in Wasserstein contractions and bounds on the asymptotic bias that hold under weaker restrictions on the parameters, which assert that the exponential integrator is capable of stably simulating the kinetic Langevin dynamics in the overdamped regime, as long as proper time acceleration is applied.</description>

      <title>Dimension dependence of critical phenomena in long-range percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical mechanical systems at and near their points of phase transition are expected to exhibit rich, fractal-like behaviour that is independent of the small-scale details of the system but depends strongly on the dimension in which the model is defined. Moreover, many models are conjectured to have an upper critical dimension with important quantitative and qualitative differences between critical behaviour at, above, and below the upper critical dimension. For models with long-range interactions, one expects additional transitions between effectively long-range and effectively short-range regimes, with further marginal effects on the boundary of these two regimes, leading to (at least) eight qualitatively distinct forms of critical behaviour in total for each given model. We give a broad overview of these conjectures aimed at a general mathematical audience before surveying the significant recent progress that has been made towards understanding them in the context of long-range percolation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that, for $\alpha \in (0,2)$, the $C^{1, \rm Dini}$ regularity assumption on an open set $D\subset \mathbb R^d$ is optimal for the standard boundary decay property for nonnegative $\alpha$-harmonic functions in $D$ and for the standard boundary decay property of the heat kernel $p^D(t,x,y)$ of the Dirichlet fractional Laplacian $\Delta^{\alpha/2}|_D$ by proving the following: (i) If $D$ is a $C^{1, \rm Dini}$ open set and $h$ is a non-negative function which is $\alpha$-harmonic in $D$ and vanishes near a portion of $\partial D$, then the rate at which $h(x)$ decays to 0 near that portion of $\partial D$ is ${\rm dist} (x, D^c)^{\alpha/2}$. (ii) If $D$ is a $C^{1, \rm Dini}$ open set, then, as $x\to \partial D$, the rate at which $p^D(t,x,y)$ tends to 0 is ${\rm dist} (x, D^c)^{\alpha/2}$. (iii) For any non-Dini modulus of continuity $\ell$, there exist non-$C^{1, \rm Dini}$ open sets $D$, with $\partial D$ locally being the graph of a $C^{1, \ell}$ function, such that the standard boundary decay properties above do not hold for $D$.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations Principle for Isoperimetry and Its Equivalence to Nonlinear Log-Sobolev Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the large deviations principle (which concerns sequences of exponentially small sets) for the isoperimetric problem on product Riemannian manifolds $M^{n}$ equipped with product probability measures $\nu^{\otimes n}$, where $M$ is a Riemannian manifold satisfying curvature-dimension bound $\mathrm{CD}(0,\infty)$. When the probability measure ${\nu}$ satisfies a specific light-tail condition, we establish an exact characterization of the large deviations asymptotics for the isoperimetric profile, which shows a precise equivalence between these asymptotic isoperimetric inequalities and nonlinear log-Sobolev inequalities. It is observed that the product of two relative entropy typical sets or their one-sided versions (or the product of two empirically typical sets) forms an asymptotically optimal solution to the isoperimetric problem. The proofs in this paper rely on tools from information theory, optimal transport, and geometric measure theory.</description>

Abstract: The probability folder of Mathlib, Lean's mathematical library, makes a heavy use of Markov kernels. We present their definition and properties and describe the formalization of the disintegration theorem for Markov kernels. That theorem is used to define conditional probability distributions of random variables as well as posterior distributions. We then explain how Markov kernels are used in a more unusual way to get a common definition of independence and conditional independence and, following the same principles, to define sub-Gaussian random variables. Finally, we also discuss the role of kernels in our formalization of entropy and Kullback-Leibler divergence.</description>

Abstract: We consider random linear continuous operators $\Omega \to \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{H}, \mathcal{H})$ on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$. For example, such random operators may be random quantum channels. The Central Limit Theorem is known for the sums of i.i.d. random operators. Instead of the sum, there may be considered the composition of random exponents $e^{A_i/n}$. We obtain the Central Limit Theorem in the Weak Operator Topology for centralized and normalized random exponents of i.i.d. linear continuous operators on a Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Why Cannot Neural Networks Master Extrapolation? Insights from Physical Laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the remarkable success of Foundation Models (FMs) in language modeling, there has been growing interest in developing FMs for time series prediction, given the transformative power such models hold for science and engineering. This culminated in significant success of FMs in short-range forecasting settings. However, extrapolation or long-range forecasting remains elusive for FMs, which struggle to outperform even simple baselines. This contrasts with physical laws which have strong extrapolation properties, and raises the question of the fundamental difference between the structure of neural networks and physical laws. In this work, we identify and formalize a fundamental property characterizing the ability of statistical learning models to predict more accurately outside of their training domain, hence explaining performance deterioration for deep learning models in extrapolation settings. In addition to a theoretical analysis, we present empirical results showcasing the implications of this property on current deep learning architectures. Our results not only clarify the root causes of the extrapolation gap but also suggest directions for designing next-generation forecasting models capable of mastering extrapolation.</description>

      <title>Short-rate models with stochastic discontinuities: a PDE approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the reform of interest rate benchmarks, interbank offered rates (IBORs) like LIBOR have been replaced by risk-free rates (RFRs), such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) in the U.S. and the Euro Short-Term Rate (\euro STR) in Europe. These rates exhibit characteristics like jumps and spikes that correspond to specific market events, driven by regulatory and liquidity constraints. To capture these characteristics, this paper considers a general short-rate model that incorporates discontinuities at fixed times with random sizes. Within this framework, we introduce a PDE-based approach for pricing interest rate derivatives and establish, under suitable assumptions, a Feynman-Ka\v{c} representation for the solution. For affine models, we derive (quasi) closed-form solutions, while for the general case, we develop numerical methods to solve the resulting PDEs.</description>

      <title>Results on long twins in random words and permutations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study long $r$-twins in random words and permutations. Motivated by questions posed in works of Dudek-Grytczuk-Ruci\'nski, we obtain the following. For a uniform word in $[k]^n$ we prove sharp one-sided tail bounds showing that the maximum $r$-power length (the longest contiguous block that can be partitioned into $r$ identical subblocks) is concentrated around $\frac{\log n}{(r-1)\log k}$. For random permutations, we prove that for fixed $k$ and $r\to\infty$, a uniform permutation of $[rk]$ a.a.s. contains $r$ disjoint increasing subsequences of length $k$, generalizing a previous result that proves this for $k=2$. Finally, we use a computer-aided pattern count to improve the best known lower bound on the length of alternating twins in a random permutation to $\alpha_n \ge \left(\tfrac{1}{3}+0.0989-o(1)\right)n$, strengthening the previous constant.</description>

Abstract: Masked diffusion models have shown promising performance in generating high-quality samples in a wide range of domains, but accelerating their sampling process remains relatively underexplored. To investigate efficient samplers for masked diffusion, this paper theoretically analyzes the MaskGIT sampler for image modeling, revealing its implicit temperature sampling mechanism. Through this analysis, we introduce the "moment sampler," an asymptotically equivalent but more tractable and interpretable alternative to MaskGIT, which employs a "choose-then-sample" approach by selecting unmasking positions before sampling tokens. In addition, we improve the efficiency of choose-then-sample algorithms through two key innovations: a partial caching technique for transformers that approximates longer sampling trajectories without proportional computational cost, and a hybrid approach formalizing the exploration-exploitation trade-off in adaptive unmasking. Experiments in image and text domains demonstrate our theory as well as the efficiency of our proposed methods, advancing both theoretical understanding and practical implementation of masked diffusion samplers.</description>

      <title>Constrained Dikin-Langevin diffusion for polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04582v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interior-point geometry offers a straightforward approach to constrained sampling and optimization on polyhedra, eliminating reflections and ad hoc projections. We exploit the Dikin log-barrier to define a Dikin--Langevin diffusion whose drift and noise are modulated by the inverse barrier Hessian. In continuous time, we establish a boundary no-flux property; trajectories started in the interior remain in $U$ almost surely, so feasibility is maintained by construction. For computation, we adopt a discretize-then-correct design: an Euler--Maruyama proposal with state-dependent covariance, followed by a Metropolis--Hastings correction that targets the exact constrained law and reduces to a Dikin random walk when $f$ is constant.
  Numerically, the unadjusted diffusion exhibits the expected first-order step size bias, while the MH-adjusted variant delivers strong convergence diagnostics on anisotropic, box-constrained Gaussians (rank-normalized split-$\hat{R}$ concentrated near $1$) and higher inter-well transition counts on a bimodal target, indicating superior cross-well mobility. Taken together, these results demonstrate that coupling calibrated stochasticity with interior-point preconditioning provides a practical, reflection-free approach to sampling and optimization over polyhedral domains, offering clear advantages near faces, corners, and in nonconvex landscapes.</description>

      <title>Deconvolution of Arbitrary Distribution Functions and Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we recover the distribution function (and possible density) of an arbitrary random variable that is subject to an additive measurement error. This problem is also known as deconvolution and has a long tradition in mathematics. We show that the model under consideration always can be transformed to a model with a symmetric error variable, whose characteristic function has its values in the unit interval. As a consequence, the characteristic function of the target variable turns out as the limit of a geometric series. By truncation of this series, an approximation for the associated distribution function (and density) is established. The convergence properties of these approximations are examined in detail across diverse setups.</description>

      <title>When Do Credal Sets Stabilize? Fixed-Point Theorems for Credal Set Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many machine learning algorithms rely on iterative updates of uncertainty representations, ranging from variational inference and expectation-maximization, to reinforcement learning, continual learning, and multi-agent learning. In the presence of imprecision and ambiguity, credal sets -- closed, convex sets of probability distributions -- have emerged as a popular framework for representing imprecise probabilistic beliefs. Under such imprecision, many learning problems in imprecise probabilistic machine learning (IPML) may be viewed as processes involving successive applications of update rules on credal sets. This naturally raises the question of whether this iterative process converges to stable fixed points -- or, more generally, under what conditions on the updating mechanism such fixed points exist, and whether they can be attained. We provide the first analysis of this problem and illustrate our findings using Credal Bayesian Deep Learning as a concrete example. Our work demonstrates that incorporating imprecision into the learning process not only enriches the representation of uncertainty, but also reveals structural conditions under which stability emerges, thereby offering new insights into the dynamics of iterative learning under imprecision.</description>

      <title>Pivotal CLTs for Pseudolikelihood via Conditional Centering in Dependent Random Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study fluctuations of conditionally centered statistics of the form $$N^{-1/2}\sum_{i=1}^N c_i(g(\sigma_i)-\mathbb{E}_N[g(\sigma_i)|\sigma_j,j\neq i])$$ where $(\sigma_1,\ldots ,\sigma_N)$ are sampled from a dependent random field, and $g$ is some bounded function. Our first main result shows that under weak smoothness assumptions on the conditional means (which cover both sparse and dense interactions), the above statistic converges to a Gaussian \emph{scale mixture} with a random scale determined by a \emph{quadratic variance} and an \emph{interaction component}. We also show that under appropriate studentization, the limit becomes a pivotal Gaussian. We leverage this theory to develop a general asymptotic framework for maximum pseudolikelihood (MPLE) inference in dependent random fields. We apply our results to Ising models with pairwise as well as higher-order interactions and exponential random graph models (ERGMs). In particular, we obtain a joint central limit theorem for the inverse temperature and magnetization parameters via the joint MPLE (to our knowledge, the first such result in dense, irregular regimes), and we derive conditionally centered edge CLTs and marginal MPLE CLTs for ERGMs without restricting to the ``sub-critical" region. Our proof is based on a method of moments approach via combinatorial decision-tree pruning, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1905.00802v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how to extend several basic concentration inequalities for simple random tensors $X = x_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes x_d$ where all $x_k$ are independent random vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with independent coefficients. The new results have optimal dependence on the dimension $n$ and the degree $d$. As an application, we show that random tensors are well conditioned: $(1-o(1)) n^d$ independent copies of the simple random tensor $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n^d}$ are far from being linearly dependent with high probability. We prove this fact for any degree $d = o(\sqrt{n/\log n})$ and conjecture that it is true for any $d = O(n)$.</description>

      <title>The giant in random graphs is almost local</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.11733v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local convergence techniques have become a key methodology to study sparse random graphs. However, convergence of many random graph properties does not directly follow from local convergence. A notable, and important, such random graph property is the size and uniqueness of the giant component.
  We provide a simple criterion that guarantees that local convergence of a random graph implies the convergence of the proportion of vertices in the maximal connected component. We further show that, when this condition holds, the local properties of the giant, as well as its complement, are also described by the local limit. We give several examples where this method gives rise to a novel law of large numbers for the giant, based on results proved in the literature. Aside from these examples, we apply our method to the classical problem of giants in the configuration model as a proof of concept, reproving a well-established result. As a side result of this proof, we give an extremely simple proof of the small-world nature of the configuration model.</description>

      <title>Where do (random) trees grow leaves?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a model of random binary trees grown "by the leaves" in the style of Luczak and Winkler. If $\tau_n$ is a uniform plane binary tree of size $n$, Luczak and Winkler, and later explicitly Caraceni and Stauffer, constructed a measure $\nu_{\tau_n}$ such that the tree obtained by adding a cherry on a leaf sampled according to $\nu_{\tau_n}$ is still uniformly distributed on the set of all plane binary trees with size $n+1$. It turns out that the measure $\nu_{\tau_n}$, which we call the leaf-growth measure, is noticeably different from the uniform measure on the leaves of the tree $\tau_n$. In fact, we prove that, as $n \to \infty$, with high probability it is almost entirely supported by a subset of only $n^{3 ( 2 - \sqrt{3})+o(1)} \approx n^{0.8038...}$ leaves. In the continuous setting, we construct the scaling limit of this measure, which is a probability measure on the Brownian Continuum Random Tree supported by a fractal set of dimension $ 6 (2 - \sqrt{3})$. We also compute the full (discrete) multifractal spectrum. This work is a first step towards understanding the diffusion limit of the discrete leaf-growth procedure.</description>

      <title>Limit profile for the transpose top-2 with random shuffle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19878v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transpose top-$2$ with random shuffle (J. Theoret. Probab., 2020) is a lazy random walk on the alternating group $A_n$ generated by $3$-cycles of the form $(\star,n-1,n)$ and $(\star,n,n-1)$. We obtain the limit profile of this random walk by comparing it with the random walk on $A_n$ generated by all $3$-cycles. Our method employs a non-commutative Fourier analysis analogue of the comparison method introduced by Nestoridi (Electron. J. Probab., 2024). We also give the complete spectrum of the alternating group graph, thus answering a question of Huang and Huang (J. Algebraic Combin., 2019).</description>

Abstract: We establish a new Bernstein-type deviation inequality for general (non-reversible) discrete-time Markov chains via an elementary approach. More robust than existing works in the literature, our result only requires the Markov chain to satisfy an iterated Poincar\'e inequality. Moreover, our method can be readily generalized to continuous-time Markov processes.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Bounds and Online Algorithms for Average-Case Matrix Discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the matrix discrepancy problem in the average-case setting. Given a sequence of $m \times m$ symmetric matrices $A_1,\ldots,A_n$, its discrepancy is defined as the minimal spectral norm over all signed sums $\sum_{i=1}^n x_iA_i$ with $x_1,\ldots,x_n \in \{\pm1\}$. Our contributions are twofold. First, we study the asymptotic discrepancy of random matrices. When the matrices belong to the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble, we provide a sharp characterization of the asymptotic discrepancy and show that the limiting distribution is concentrated around $\Theta(\sqrt{nm}4^{-(1 + o(1))n/m^2})$, under the assumption $m^2 \ll n/\log{n}$. We observe that the trivial bound $O(\sqrt{nm})$ cannot be improved when $n \ll m^2$ and show that this phenomenon occurs for a broad class of random matrices. In the case $n = \Omega(m^2)$, we provide a matching upper bound. Second, we analyse the matrix hyperbolic cosine algorithm, an online algorithm for matrix discrepancy minimization due to Zouzias (2011), in the average-case setting. We show that the algorithm achieves with high probability a discrepancy of $O(m\log{m})$ for a broad class of random matrices, including Wigner matrices with entries satisfying a hypercontractive inequality and Gaussian Wishart matrices.</description>

      <title>Growing conditioned BGW trees with log-concave offspring distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03065v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that given a log-concave offspring distribution, the corresponding sequence of Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson trees conditioned to have $n\geq 1$ vertices admits a realization as a Markov process $(T_n)_{n\geq1}$ which adds a new "right-leaning" leaf at each step. This applies for instance to offspring distributions which are Poisson, binomial, geometric, or any convolution of those. By a negative result of Janson, the log-concavity condition is optimal in the restricted case of offspring distributions supported in $\{0,1,2\}$. We then prove a generalization to the case of an offspring distribution supported on an arithmetic progression, if we assume log-concavity along that progression.
  As an application, we deduce the existence of increasing couplings in an inhomogeneous model of random subtrees of the Ulam--Harris tree. This is equivalent to the statement that, in a corresponding inhomogeneous Bernouilli percolation model on a regular tree, the root cluster is stochastically increasing in its size.
  These results generalize a construction of Luczak and Winkler which applies to uniformly sampled subtrees with $n$ vertices of the infinite complete $d$-ary trees. Our proofs are elementary and we tried to make them as self-contained as possible.</description>

Abstract: We study the gaps between consecutive singular values of random rectangular matrices. Specifically, if $M$ is an $n \times p$ random matrix with independent and identically distributed entries and $\Sigma$ is a $n \times n$ deterministic positive definite matrix, then under some technical assumptions we give lower bounds for the gaps between consecutive singular values of $\Sigma^{1/2} M$. As a consequence, we show that sample covariance matrices have simple spectrum with high probability. Our results resolve a conjecture of Vu [{\em Probab. Surv.}, 18:179--200, 2021]. We also discuss some applications, including a bound on the spacings of eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of random bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Gradient-flow SDEs have unique transient population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying the drift and diffusion of an SDE from its population dynamics is a notoriously challenging task. Researchers in machine learning and single cell biology have only been able to prove a partial identifiability result: for potential-driven SDEs, the gradient-flow drift can be identified from temporal marginals if the Brownian diffusivity is already known. Existing methods therefore assume that the diffusivity is known a priori, despite it being unknown in practice. We dispel the need for this assumption by providing a complete characterization of identifiability: the gradient-flow drift and Brownian diffusivity are jointly identifiable from temporal marginals if and only if the process is observed outside of equilibrium. Given this fundamental result, we propose nn-APPEX, the first Schr\"odinger Bridge-based inference method that can simultaneously learn the drift and diffusion of gradient-flow SDEs solely from observed marginals. Extensive numerical experiments show that nn-APPEX's ability to adjust its diffusion estimate enables accurate inference, while previous Schr\"odinger Bridge methods obtain biased drift estimates due to their assumed, and likely incorrect, diffusion.</description>

      <title>On the Voigt profile and its dual</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Voigt profile is the density obtained from the convolution of a Gaussian and a Cauchy and it is widely used in atomic and molecular spectroscopy. We show that the Voigt profile is a scale mixture of Gaussian distributions, with mixing Levy distribution. A consequence of this result is that there exists a dual of the Voigt distribution, which is itself a normal scale mixture. Both the Dual Voigt and its mixing are transformations, via truncation and reflection, of the Normal and Levy random variables. We discuss the dual Voigt characteristics, propose algorithms for parameter estimation and outline further developments.</description>

      <title>Boolean and Free Symmetrization of Bernoulli Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17112v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate variance bounds under symmetry constraints in classical, free, and Boolean probability, focusing on Bernoulli distributions and their noncommutative analogues, projections with trace \(p\). We show that symmetrizers under classical, free, and Boolean convolution satisfy a sharp variance bound of \(pq\), with equality for the reflection law. Additionally, we highlight phenomena specific to Boolean convolution, demonstrating that non-symmetric measures can produce symmetric convolutions and that symmetrizers may be non-unique for certain measures. These results unify variance inequalities across probabilistic frameworks and offer insights for quantum information and noncommutative stochastic modeling.</description>

      <title>Permuton and local limits for the Luce model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic properties of permutations drawn from the Luce model, a natural probabilistic framework in which permutations are generated sequentially by sampling without replacement, with selection probabilities proportional to prescribed positive weights. These permutations arise in applications such as ranking models, the Tsetlin library, and related Markov processes. Under minimal assumptions on the weights, we establish a permuton limit theorem describing the global behavior of Luce-distributed permutations and derive an explicit density of the limiting permuton. We further compute limiting pattern densities and analyze the differences between exact Luce permutations and their permuton approximations. We also study the local convergence of these permutations, proving a quenched Benjamini--Schramm limit and a central limit theorem for consecutive pattern occurrences. Finally, we prove a central limit theorem for the number of inversions.</description>

      <title>A Poisson representation of the positive sojourn time of L\'evy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the distribution of the positive sojourn time $$ A_t:= \int_0^t \mathbf 1\{ X_s&gt;0 \}ds $$ of an arbitrary L\'evy process $X:= (X_t)_{t\geq 0}$. For an exponential random variable $E^{(q)}$ of rate $q&gt;0$ independent of $X$ we show the representation in law \begin{align*}
  A_{E^{(q)}} =_d \sum_{T\in \Pi} T \end{align*} as the sum of points of a Poisson process $\Pi$ with intensity given explicitely in terms of the positivity $t\mapsto \mathbb P\{X_t&gt;0\}$. This representation raises some fundamental questions, not least because $\Pi$ turns out to be intimately connected to the celebrated Poisson-Dirichlet distribution. Moreover, we characterise $A_t$ by working out its double Laplace transform, and thus complement a recent result in which the distribution of $A_t$ was characterised via its higher moments. As a Corollary of the Poisson representation, in the special cases where $X$ is Brownian motion, a symmetric stable process, a L\'evy process with constant positivity, we obtain an extension and new derivation of classical (generalised) arcsine laws going back to L\'evy (1939), Kac (1951), and Getoor and Sharpe (1994), respectively. Even in these cases the Poisson representation is new.
  As an application, if $X$ is the $(1/2)$-stable subordinator with drift, we obtain both the Laplace transform of $A_t$ and the density of its distribution. This is the second example of a L\'evy process whose occupation time distribution is known explicitely but is not generalized arcsine, the first example being Brownian motion with drift that was studied earlier in the context of option prizing.</description>

      <title>A family of non-uniform distributions on the set of parking functions generated by random permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a rather natural family of non-uniform distributions on $PF_n$, $n\in\mathbb{N}$, the set of parking functions of length $n$. One of the motivations for this comes from a similar situation in the context of integer partitions. For a permutation $\sigma\in S_n$ and for $j\in[n]$, let $I_{n,&lt;j}(\sigma)$ denote the number of inversions in $\sigma$ that involve the number $j$ and a number less than $j$. Let $\tilde I_{n,&lt;j}(\sigma)=I_{n,&lt;j}(\sigma)+1$. The map $(\sigma,\tau)\to\left(\tilde I_{n,&lt;\tau_1}(\sigma),\cdots, \tilde I_{n,&lt; \tau_n}(\sigma)\right)$ maps $S_n\times S_n$ onto $PF_n$. Consider the family of distributions $P_n^{(q)}\times P_n$, $q\in(0,\infty)$, on $S_n\times S_n$, where $P_n$ is the uniform distribution on $S_n$ and $P_n^{(q)}$ is the Mallows distribution with parameter $q$ on $S_n$. The Mallows distributions are defined by exponential tilting via the inversion statistic. For each $q&gt;0$, the above map along with the distribution $P_n^{(q)}\times P_n$ induces an exchangeable distribution $\mathcal{P}_n^{(q)}$ on $PF_n$. We study the asymptotic behavior of two fundamental statistics of parking functions under the family of distributions $\mathcal{P}_n^{(q)}$.</description>

      <title>The Fisher metric as a metric on the cotangent bundle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fisher metric on a manifold of probability distributions is usually treated as a metric on the tangent bundle. In this paper, we focus on the metric on the cotangent bundle induced from the Fisher metric with calling it the Fisher co-metric. We show that the Fisher co-metric can be defined directly without going through the Fisher metric by establishing a natural correspondence between cotangent vectors and random variables. This definition clarifies a close relation between the Fisher co-metric and the variance/covariance of random variables, whereby the Cram\'{e}r-Rao inequality is trivialized. We also discuss the monotonicity and the invariance of the Fisher co-metric with respect to Markov maps, and present a theorem characterizing the co-metric by the invariance, which can be regarded as a cotangent version of \v{C}encov's characterization theorem for the Fisher metric. The obtained theorem can also viewed as giving a characterization of the variance/covariance.</description>

      <title>New global Carleman estimates and null controllability for forward/backward semi-linear parabolic SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13455v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the null controllability for parabolic SPDEs involving both the state and the gradient of the state. To start with, an improved global Carleman estimate for linear forward (resp. backward) parabolic SPDEs with general random coefficients and square-integrable source terms is derived. Based on this, we further develop a new global Carleman estimate for linear forward (resp. backward) parabolic SPDEs with source terms in the Sobolev space of negative order, which enables us to deal with the global null controllability for linear backward (resp. forward) parabolic SPDEs with gradient terms. As a byproduct, a special weighted energy-type estimate for the controlled system that explicitly depends on the parameters $\lambda,\mu$ and the weighted function $\theta$ is obtained, which makes it possible to extend the previous linear null controllability to semi-linear backward (resp. forward) parabolic SPDEs by applying the fixed-point argument in an appropriate Banach space.</description>

      <title>Synchronization in random networks of identical phase oscillators: A graphon approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Networks of coupled nonlinear oscillators have been used to model circadian rhythms, flashing fireflies, Josephson junction arrays, high-voltage electric grids, and many other kinds of self-organizing systems. Recently, several authors have sought to understand how coupled oscillators behave when they interact according to a random graph. Here we consider interaction networks generated by a graphon model known as a $W$-random network, and examine the dynamics of an infinite number of identical phase oscillators. We show that with sufficient regularity on $W$, the solution to the dynamical system over a $W$-random network of size $n$ converges in the $L^{\infty}$ norm to the solution of the infinite graphon system, with high probability as $n\rightarrow\infty$. We leverage this convergence result to explore synchronization for two classes of identical phase oscillators on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs. This result suggests a framework for studying synchronization properties in large but finite random networks.</description>

      <title>Robust dividend policy: Equivalence of Epstein-Zin and Maenhout preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12305v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a continuous-time economy, this paper formulates the Epstein-Zin preference for discounted dividends received by an investor as an Epstein-Zin singular control utility. We introduce a backward stochastic differential equation with an aggregator integrated with respect to a singular control, prove its well-posedness, and show that it coincides with the Epstein-Zin singular control utility. We then establish that this formulation is equivalent to a robust dividend policy chosen by the firm's executive under the Maenhout's ambiguity-averse preference. In particular, the robust dividend policy takes the form of a threshold strategy on the firm's surplus process, where the threshold level is characterized as the free boundary of a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman variational inequality. Therefore, dividend-caring investors can choose firms that match their preferences by examining stock's dividend policies and financial statements, whereas executives can make use of dividend to signal their confidence, in the form of ambiguity aversion, on realizing the earnings implied by their financial statements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we contribute two results to the theory of the $2D$ Euler equations in vorticity form on the full plane. First, we establish a generalized Lagrangian representation of weak (in general measure-valued) solutions, which includes and extends classical results on the Lagrangianity of weak solutions. Second, we construct nonlinear Markov processes which are uniquely determined by a selection of weak solutions from initial data in $L^1\cap L^p$, $p \geq 2$, and related spaces such as the classical and uniformly localized Yudovich space. It is well-known that for $p &lt;\infty$ weak solutions are in general not unique, which renders a suitable selection nontrivial.</description>

      <title>Universality of Kernel Random Matrices and Kernel Regression in the Quadratic Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel ridge regression (KRR) is a popular class of machine learning models that has become an important tool for understanding deep learning. Much of the focus thus far has been on studying the proportional asymptotic regime, $n \asymp d$, where $n$ is the number of training samples and $d$ is the dimension of the dataset. In the proportional regime, under certain conditions on the data distribution, the kernel random matrix involved in KRR exhibits behavior akin to that of a linear kernel. In this work, we extend the study of kernel regression to the quadratic asymptotic regime, where $n \asymp d^2$. In this regime, we demonstrate that a broad class of inner-product kernels exhibits behavior similar to a quadratic kernel. Specifically, we establish an operator norm approximation bound for the difference between the original kernel random matrix and a quadratic kernel random matrix with additional correction terms compared to the Taylor expansion of the kernel functions. The approximation works for general data distributions under a Gaussian-moment-matching assumption with a covariance structure. This new approximation is utilized to obtain a limiting spectral distribution of the original kernel matrix and characterize the precise asymptotic training and test errors for KRR in the quadratic regime when $n/d^2$ converges to a non-zero constant. The generalization errors are obtained for (i) a random teacher model, (ii) a deterministic teacher model where the weights are perfectly aligned with the covariance of the data. Under the random teacher model setting, we also verify that the generalized cross-validation (GCV) estimator can consistently estimate the generalization error in the quadratic regime for anisotropic data. Our proof techniques combine moment methods, Wick's formula, orthogonal polynomials, and resolvent analysis of random matrices with correlated entries.</description>

      <title>A Martingale-Free Introduction to Conditional Gaussian Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conditional Gaussian nonlinear system (CGNS) is a broad class of nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems. Given the trajectories for a subset of state variables, the remaining follow a Gaussian distribution. Despite the conditionally linear structure, the CGNS exhibits strong nonlinearity, thus capturing many non-Gaussian characteristics observed in nature through its joint and marginal distributions. Desirably, it enjoys closed analytic formulae for the time evolution of its conditional Gaussian statistics, which facilitate the study of data assimilation and other related topics. In this paper, we develop a martingale-free approach to improve the understanding of CGNSs. This methodology provides a tractable approach to proving the time evolution of the conditional statistics by deriving results through time discretization schemes, with the continuous-time regime obtained via a formal limiting process as the discretization time-step vanishes. This discretized approach further allows for developing analytic formulae for optimal posterior sampling of unobserved state variables with correlated noise. These tools are particularly valuable for studying extreme events and intermittency and apply to high-dimensional systems. Moreover, the approach improves the understanding of different sampling methods in characterizing uncertainty. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through a physics-constrained, triad-interaction climate model with cubic nonlinearity and state-dependent cross-interacting noise.</description>

      <title>Rough Stochastic Pontryagin Maximum Principle and an Indirect Shooting Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06726v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive first-order Pontryagin optimality conditions for stochastic optimal control with deterministic controls for systems modeled by rough differential equations (RDE) driven by Gaussian rough paths. This Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) applies to systems following stochastic differential equations (SDE) driven by Brownian motion, yet it does not rely on forward-backward SDEs and involves the same Hamiltonian as the deterministic PMP. The proof consists of first deriving various integrable error bounds for solutions to nonlinear and linear RDEs by leveraging recent results on Gaussian rough paths. The PMP then follows using standard techniques based on needle-like variations. As an application, we propose the first indirect shooting method for nonlinear stochastic optimal control and show that it converges 10x faster than a direct method on a stabilization task.</description>

Abstract: This note examines the implications of randomly selecting vectors from an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space on linear independence, assuming that for all $k$, the first $k$ vectors follow an absolutely continuous law with respect to a probability measure. It demonstrates that no constraints on the random dimension of their span are necessary, provided that all finite-dimensional vector subspaces are considered negligible with respect to the Hilbert space probability measure.</description>

      <title>Graph Alignment via Birkhoff Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the graph alignment problem, wherein the objective is to find a vertex correspondence between two graphs that maximizes the edge overlap. The graph alignment problem is an instance of the quadratic assignment problem (QAP), known to be NP-hard in the worst case even to approximately solve. In this paper, we analyze Birkhoff relaxation, a tight convex relaxation of QAP, and present theoretical guarantees on its performance when the inputs follow the Gaussian Wigner Model. More specifically, the weighted adjacency matrices are correlated Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble with correlation $1/\sqrt{1+\sigma^2}$. Denote the optimal solutions of the QAP and Birkhoff relaxation by $\Pi^\star$ and $X^\star$ respectively. We show that $\|X^\star-\Pi^\star\|_F^2 = o(n)$ when $\sigma = o(n^{-1.25})$ and $\|X^\star-\Pi^\star\|_F^2 = \Omega(n)$ when $\sigma = \Omega(n^{-0.5})$. Thus, the optimal solution $X^\star$ transitions from a small perturbation of $\Pi^\star$ for small $\sigma$ to being well separated from $\Pi^\star$ as $\sigma$ becomes larger than $n^{-0.5}$. This result allows us to guarantee that simple rounding procedures on $X^\star$ align $1-o(1)$ fraction of vertices correctly whenever $\sigma = o(n^{-1.25})$. This condition on $\sigma$ to ensure the success of the Birkhoff relaxation is state-of-the-art.</description>

Abstract: This work investigates the expected number of critical points of random neural networks with different activation functions as the depth increases in the infinite-width limit. Under suitable regularity conditions, we derive precise asymptotic formulas for the expected number of critical points of fixed index and those exceeding a given threshold. Our analysis reveals three distinct regimes depending on the value of the first derivative of the covariance evaluated at 1: the expected number of critical points may converge, grow polynomially, or grow exponentially with depth. The theoretical predictions are supported by numerical experiments. Moreover, we provide numerical evidence suggesting that, when the regularity condition is not satisfied (e.g. for neural networks with ReLU as activation function), the number of critical points increases as the map resolution increases, indicating a potential divergence in the number of critical points.</description>

      <title>M-estimation for Gaussian processes with time-inhomogeneous drifts from high-frequency data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01164v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a contrast-based estimation method for Gaussian processes with time-inhomogeneous drifts, observed under high-frequency sampling. The process is modeled as the sum of a deterministic drift function and a stationary Gaussian component with a parametric kernel. Our method constructs a local contrast function from adjacent increments, which avoids inversion of large covariance matrices and allows for efficient computation. We prove consistency and asymptotic normality of the resulting estimators under general ergodicity conditions. A distinctive feature of our approach is that the drift estimator attains a nonstandard convergence rate, stemming from the direct Riemann integrability of the drift density. This highlights a fundamental difference from standard estimation regimes. Furthermore, when the local contrast fails to identify all parameters in the covariance kernel, moment-based corrections can be incorporated to recover identifiability. The proposed framework is simple, flexible, and particularly well suited for high-frequency inference with time-inhomogeneous structure.</description>

      <title>Functional Liftings of Restricted Geometric Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate what we term "generalized sup-convolutions". We show that functional inequalities that enjoy an interpretation as sup-convolution inequalities can be deduced from the special case of indicator functions corresponding to a geometric inequality. As consequences we derive a Borell-Brascamp Lieb inequality for the Gaussian Brunn-Minkowski inequality and give a functional analog of the log-Brunn Minkowski conjecture. Though we focus on Euclidean applications, our results are general and can be directly applied in more abstract settings, like groups or even topological measure spaces without algebraic structure, we instantiate this claim with a Borell-Brascamp-Lieb type inequality for nilpotent Lie groups.</description>
