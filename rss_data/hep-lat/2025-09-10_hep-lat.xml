      <title>Is it worth the effort to find Lefschetz thimbles? Integration contours with numerically optimal signal-to-noise ratios in simple fermionic toy models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a detailed analysis of the fermionic sign problem in a series of one dimensional integrals, that are achieved as extreme (one-site) limits of genuine physics models. Altogether we studied a Hubbard-like, a Gross-Neveu-like, a Thirring-like and a Chern-Simons-like integral. We compare the Lefschetz-thimble structure for these integrals with contours obtained with the holomorphic flow equations at different flow-times and with numerically optimized continuous integration contours, defined by a maximal value of the expectation values of the phases. With the holomorphic flow equation, we perform the large flow-time limit, so that the average phase corresponds to its value on the thimbles. In some of these integrals (the Hubbard-, Gross-Neveu-, and Chern-Simons-like integrals), we observe that the convergence to this value is not monotonic, meaning that there is an optimal flow-time where the sign problem is weaker than it is on the thimbles. Furthermore, we find that for all of these toy models, numerical optimization can find continuous contours on which the sign problem is considerably weaker than it is both on the thimbles and at flowed integration contours at the optimal flow-time.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Casimir energy in the Curci-Ferrari model through a functional approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using functional integral methods, we investigate the non-Abelian Casimir energy in the Curci-Ferrari model, which offers an effective description of the infrared regime of Yang-Mills theory. We consider a 3+1D (resp.\ 2+1D) system of two infinite parallel plates (resp.\ wires) at a fixed distance from each other, with either perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) or perfect electric conductor (PEC) boundary conditions. Imposing the boundary conditions directly in the functional integral by the introduction of suitable auxiliary fields that act as Lagrange multipliers, we obtain a boundary effective action that captures the dynamics of this system. The Casimir energy is then computed both directly from the functional integral and via the energy-momentum tensor, providing equivalent results. We find that the Casimir energy for PEC and PMC conditions differs by a constant factor, which can be traced back to a van Dam--Veltman--Zakharov-like discontinuity (both in 3+1D and 2+1D). Lastly, we show that our analytical results are compatible with a variety of recent numerical lattice simulations of the non-perturbative Yang-Mills Casimir energy, in which a novel non-perturbative mass scale emerges.</description>

      <title>QCD Lambda Parameter from Gradient Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from the running coupling in the gradient flow scheme, the QCD Lambda parameter $\Lambda_{\,\overline{\!\rm MS\!}\;}$ is determined analytically with respect to the reference scale $w_0$ in the pure gauge theory. A key element is the gluon condensate, which, being invariant under RG transformations, establishes a formal relationship between $\Lambda_{\,\overline{\!\rm MS\!}\;}$ and $w_0$. Good agreement with numerical estimates is found.</description>

      <title>Strong decays of $P_{\psi}^N(4440)^+$ and $P_\psi^N(4457)^+$ within the Bethe-Salpeter framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08440v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By combining the effective Lagrangian and Bethe-Salpeter framework, we studied the mass spectra, wave functions, and strong decay widths of the two pentaquark states $P_\psi^N(4440)^+$ and $P_\psi^N(4457)^+$ reported by LHCb in 2019. Taking into account both the mass ordering and the decay widths, our results favor the interpretation of $P_\psi^N(4440)^+$ and $P_\psi^N(4457)^+$ as the isospin-$\frac12$ $[\bar D^*\Sigma_c]$ molecular states with $J^P$ configuration $(\frac{3}{2})^-$ and $(\frac12)^-$, respectively. We first calculate the one-boson-exchange interaction kernel of $[\bar D^*\Sigma_c]$ in the isospin-$\frac12$ configuration. Then we present the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) and wave functions for the bound states of a vector meson and a $\frac12$ baryon with $J^P={\frac12}^-$ and ${\frac32}^-$. The obtained mass results for the $(\frac32)^-$ and $(\frac12)^-$ are $4.442$ and $4.457$ GeV, respectively. Combining the effective Lagrangians and the BS wave functions, we further calculate the strong decay channels $\bar D^{(*)0}\Lambda_c^+$, $J/\psi(\eta_c) p$, and $\bar D\Sigma_c^{(*)}$ for the two $P_\psi^N$ states. In the favored $\frac32^-$ and $\frac12^-$ configuration, the obtained total widths are $21.8$ MeV and $13.0$ MeV, respectively, which are substantially consistent with the LHCb data. Our results suggest that $\bar D^{0}\Lambda_c^+$ and $\bar D^{(*)0}\Lambda_c^+$ are the dominant decay channels to detect $P_\psi^N(4440)^+$ and $P_\psi^N(4457)^+$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo study on Heisenberg model with local dipolar interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15874v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aharony and Fisher showed that non-local dipolar effects in magnetism destabilize the Heisenberg fixed point in real ferromagnets, leading to a new fixed point, called the dipolar fixed point. The non-perturbative nature of the new fixed point, however, has not been uncovered for many decades. Inspired by the recent understanding that the dipolar fixed point is scale-invariant but not conformal invariant, we perform the Monte Carlo simulation of the local Heisenberg-dipolar model on the lattice of $40^3$ by introducing the local cost function parameterized by a parameter $\lambda$ and study its critical exponents, which should become identical to the dipolar fixed point of Aharony and Fisher in the infinite coupling limit $\lambda = \infty$. We find that the critical exponents become noticeably different from those of the Heisenberg fixed point for a finite coupling constant $\lambda=8$ (e.g. $\nu=0.601(2)(^{+0}_{-2})$ in the local Heisenberg-dipolar model while $\nu=0.712(1)(^{+3}_{-0})$ in the Heisenberg model), and the spin correlation function has a feature that it becomes divergence-free, implying the lack of conformal invariance.</description>
