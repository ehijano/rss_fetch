      <title>Revisiting the Unicity Distance through a Channel Transmission Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper revisits the classical notion of unicity distance from an enlightening perspective grounded in information theory, specifically by framing the encryption process as a noisy transmission channel. Using results from reliable communication theory, we derive a simple information-theoretic proof of the same unicity distance formula as in Shannon's classical result and a channel transmission interpretation of the unicity distance.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Analysis of Hybrid GEO-LEO Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the number of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites rapidly increases, the consideration of frequency sharing or cooperation between geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) and LEO satellites is gaining attention. In this paper, we consider a hybrid GEO-LEO satellite network where GEO and LEO satellites are distributed according to independent Poisson point processes (PPPs) and share the same frequency resources. Based on the properties of PPPs, we first analyze satellite-visible probabilities, distance distributions, and association probabilities. Then, we derive an analytical expression for the network's coverage probability. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we verify the analytical results and demonstrate the impact of system parameters on coverage performance. The analytical results effectively estimate the coverage performance in scenarios where GEO and LEO satellites cooperate or share the same resource.</description>

      <title>Infinite families of almost MDS codes holding 3-designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a close relationship between linear codes and $t$-designs. Through their research on a class of narrow-sense BCH codes, Ding and Tang made a breakthrough by presenting the first two infinite families of near MDS codes holding $t$-designs with $t=2$ or 3. In this paper, we present an infinite family of MDS codes over $\mathbb{F}_{2^s}$ and two infinite families of almost MDS codes over $\mathbb{F}_{p^s}$ for any prime $p$, by investigating the parameters of the dual codes of two families of BCH codes. Notably, these almost MDS codes include two infinite families of near MDS codes over $\mathbb{F}_{3^s}$, resolving a conjecture posed by Geng et al. in 2022. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both of these almost AMDS codes and their dual codes hold infinite families of $3$-designs over \(\mathbb{F}_{p^s}\) for any prime $p$. Additionally, we study the subfield subcodes of these families of MDS and near MDS codes, and provide several binary, ternary, and quaternary codes with best known parameters.</description>

      <title>Soft-Output Fast Successive-Cancellation List Decoder for Polar Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The soft-output successive cancellation list (SOSCL) decoder provides a methodology for estimating the a-posteriori probability log-likelihood ratios by only leveraging the conventional SCL decoder for polar codes. However, the sequential nature of SCL decoding leads to a high decoding latency for the SO-SCL decoder. In this paper, we propose a soft-output fast SCL (SO-FSCL) decoder by incorporating node-based fast decoding into the SO-SCL framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SO-FSCL decoder significantly reduces the decoding latency without loss of performance compared with the SO-SCL decoder.</description>

      <title>On the size of error ball in DNA storage channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of storing digital information in macromolecules such as DNA and protein. However, the DNA storage channel is prone to errors such as deletions, insertions, and substitutions. During the synthesis and reading phases of DNA strings, many noisy copies of the original string are generated. The problem of recovering the original string from these noisy copies is known as sequence reconstruction. A key concept in this problem is the error ball, which is the set of all possible sequences that can result from a limited number of errors applied to the original sequence. Levenshtein showed that the minimum number of noisy copies required for a given channel to recover the original sequence is equal to one plus the maximum size of the intersection of two error balls. Therefore, deriving the size of the error ball for any channel and any sequence is essential for solving the sequence reconstruction problem. In DNA storage systems, multiple types of errors such as deletion, insertion and substitution in a string could occur simultaneously. In this work, we aim to derive the size of the error ball for channels with multiple types of errors and at most three edits. Specifically, we consider the channels with single-deletion double-substitution, single-deletion double-insertion and single-insertion single-substitution errors.</description>

      <title>Multiset Combinatorial Gray Codes with Application to Proximity Sensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate coding schemes that map source symbols into multisets of an alphabet set. Such a formulation of source coding is an alternative approach to the traditional framework and is inspired by an object tracking problem over proximity sensor networks. We define a \textit{multiset combinatorial Gray code} as a mulitset code with fixed multiset cardinality that possesses combinatorial Gray code characteristic. For source codes that are organized as a grid, namely an integer lattice, we propose a solution by first constructing a mapping from the grid to the alphabet set, the codes are then defined as the images of rectangular blocks in the grid of fixed dimensions. We refer to the mapping as a \textit{color mapping} and the code as a \textit{color multiset code}. We propose the idea of product multiset code that enables us to construct codes for high dimensional grids based on 1-dimensional (1D) grids. We provide a detailed analysis of color multiset codes on 1D grids, focusing on codes that require the minimal number of colors. To illustrate the application of such a coding scheme, we consider an object tracking problem on 2D grids and show its efficiency, which comes from exploiting transmission parallelism. Some numerical results are presented to conclude the paper.</description>

      <title>Improved Explicit Near-Optimal Codes in the High-Noise Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study uniquely decodable codes and list decodable codes in the high-noise regime, specifically codes that are uniquely decodable from $\frac{1-\varepsilon}{2}$ fraction of errors and list decodable from $1-\varepsilon$ fraction of errors. We present several improved explicit constructions that achieve near-optimal rates, as well as efficient or even linear-time decoding algorithms. Our contributions are as follows.
  1. Explicit Near-Optimal Linear Time Uniquely Decodable Codes: We construct a family of explicit $\mathbb{F}_2$-linear codes with rate $\Omega(\varepsilon)$ and alphabet size $2^{\mathrm{poly} \log(1/\varepsilon)}$, that are capable of correcting $e$ errors and $s$ erasures whenever $2e + s &lt; (1 - \varepsilon)n$ in linear-time.
  2. Explicit Near-Optimal List Decodable Codes: We construct a family of explicit list decodable codes with rate $\Omega(\varepsilon)$ and alphabet size $2^{\mathrm{poly} \log(1/\varepsilon)}$, that are capable of list decoding from $1-\varepsilon$ fraction of errors with a list size $L = \exp\exp\exp(\log^{\ast}n)$ in polynomial time.
  3. List Decodable Code with Near-Optimal List Size: We construct a family of explicit list decodable codes with an optimal list size of $O(1/\varepsilon)$, albeit with a suboptimal rate of $O(\varepsilon^2)$, capable of list decoding from $1-\varepsilon$ fraction of errors in polynomial time. Furthermore, we introduce a new combinatorial object called multi-set disperser, and use it to give a family of list decodable codes with near-optimal rate $\frac{\varepsilon}{\log^2(1/\varepsilon)}$ and list size $\frac{\log^2(1/\varepsilon)}{\varepsilon}$, that can be constructed in probabilistic polynomial time and decoded in deterministic polynomial time.
  We also introduce new decoding algorithms that may prove valuable for other graph-based codes.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Hybrid Precoding for Massive MU-MIMO ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a very promising technology designed to provide both high rate communication capabilities and sensing capabilities. However, in Massive Multi User Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (Massive MU MIMO-ISAC) systems, the dense user access creates a serious multi-user interference (MUI) problem, leading to degradation of communication performance. To alleviate this problem, we propose a decentralized baseband processing (DBP) precoding method. We first model the MUI of dense user scenarios with minimizing Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) as an objective function.Hybrid precoding is an attractive ISAC technique, and hybrid precoding using Partially Connected Structures (PCS) can effectively reduce hardware cost and power consumption. We mitigate the MUI between dense users based on ThomlinsonHarashima Precoding (THP). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through simulation experiments. Compared with the existing methods, it can effectively improve the communication data rates and energy efficiency in dense user access scenario, and reduce the hardware complexity of Massive MU MIMO-ISAC systems. The experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of our method for improving the MUI problem in ISAC systems for dense user access scenarios.</description>

      <title>What is an inductive mean?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An inductive mean is a mean defined as a limit of a convergence sequence of other means. Historically, this notion of inductive means obtained as limits of sequences was pioneered independently by Lagrange and Gauss for defining the arithmetic-geometric mean. In this note, we first explain several generalizations of the scalar geometric mean to symmetric positive-definite matrices, and then present several inductive mean mechanisms for sets of symmetric positive-definite matrices.</description>

      <title>Support-Guessing Decoding Algorithms in the Sum-Rank Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sum-rank metric generalizes the Hamming and rank metric by partitioning vectors into blocks and defining the total weight as the sum of the rank weights of these blocks, based on their matrix representation.
  In this work, we explore support-guessing algorithms for decoding sum-rank-metric codes. Support-guessing involves randomly selecting candidate supports and attempting to decode the error under the assumption that it is confined to these supports. While previous works have focused on worst-case scenarios, we analyze the average case and derive an optimal support-guessing distribution in the asymptotic regime. We show that this distribution also performs well for finite code lengths. Our analysis provides exact complexity estimates for unique decoding scenarios and establishes tighter bounds beyond the unique decoding radius.
  Additionally, we introduce a randomized decoding algorithm for Linearized Reed--Solomon (LRS) codes. This algorithm extends decoding capabilities beyond the unique decoding radius by leveraging an efficient error-and-erasure decoder. Instead of requiring the entire error support to be confined to the guessed support, the algorithm succeeds as long as there is sufficient overlap between the guessed support and the actual error support. As a result, the proposed method improves the success probability and reduces computational complexity compared to generic decoding algorithms.
  Our contributions offer more accurate complexity estimates than previous works, which are essential for understanding the computational challenges involved in decoding sum-rank-metric codes. This improved complexity analysis, along with optimized support-guessing distributions, provides valuable insights for the design and evaluation of code-based cryptosystems using the sum-rank metric. This is particularly important in the context of quantum-resistant cryptography.</description>

      <title>Covering Codes as Near-Optimal Quantizers for Distributed Testing Against Independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the problem of distributed Hypothesis Testing (DHT) against independence, focusing specifically on Binary Symmetric Sources (BSS). Our investigation aims to characterize the optimal quantizer among binary linear codes, with the objective of identifying optimal error probabilities under the Neyman-Pearson (NP) criterion for short code-length regime. We define optimality as the direct minimization of analytical expressions of error probabilities using an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. Additionally, we provide lower and upper bounds on error probabilities, leading to the derivation of error exponents applicable to large code-length regime. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate that, with the proposed algorithm, binary linear codes with an optimal covering radius perform near-optimally for the independence test in DHT.</description>

      <title>Singular Detection in Noncoherent Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a general analysis of codeword detection in noncoherent communications. Motivated by the existence of error floors in various regimes, fundamental characteristics of signal design are investigated. In particular, the necessary and sufficient conditions for asymptotically singular detection (i.e. error-free in the limit) are derived from classical results in detection theory. By leveraging tools from linear algebra and the theory of Hilbert spaces, we are able to characterize asymptotic singularity in two main scenarios: the large array and high SNR regimes. The results generalize previous works and extend the notion of unique identification, as well as recontextualize the geometry of Grassmannian constellations from an alternative perspective.</description>

      <title>A Deep Unfolding-Based Scalarization Approach for Power Control in D2D Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing network utility in device-to-device networks is typically formulated as a non-convex optimization problem. This paper addresses the scenario where the optimization variables are from a bounded but continuous set, allowing each device to perform power control. The power at each link is optimized to maximize a desired network utility. Specifically, we consider the weighted-sum-rate. The state of the art benchmark for this problem is fractional programming with quadratic transform, known as FPLinQ. We propose a scalarization approach to transform the weighted-sum-rate, developing an iterative algorithm that depends on step sizes, a reference, and a direction vector. By employing the deep unfolding approach, we optimize these parameters by presenting the iterative algorithm as a finite sequence of steps, enabling it to be trained as a deep neural network. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the unfolded algorithm performs comparably to the benchmark in most cases while exhibiting lower complexity. Furthermore, the unfolded algorithm shows strong generalizability in terms of varying the number of users, the signal-to-noise ratio and arbitrary weights. The weighted-sum-rate maximizer can be integrated into a low-complexity fairness scheduler, updating priority weights via virtual queues and Lyapunov Drift Plus Penalty. This is demonstrated through experiments using proportional and max-min fairness.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Multistatic Target Detection in Cell-Free Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the target detection problem in a multistatic integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scenario characterized by the cell-free MIMO communication network deployment, where multiple radio units (RUs) in the network cooperate with each other for the sensing task. By exploiting the angle resolution from multiple arrays deployed in the network and the delay resolution from the communication signals, i.e., orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals, we formulate a cooperative sensing problem with coherent data fusion of multiple RUs' observations and propose a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL)-based method, where the global coordinates of target locations are directly detected. Intensive numerical results indicate promising target detection performance of the proposed SBL-based method. Additionally, a theoretical analysis of the considered cooperative multistatic sensing task is provided using the pairwise error probability (PEP) analysis, which can be used to provide design insights, e.g., illumination and beam patterns, for the considered problem.</description>

      <title>Photonic Simulation of Localization Phenomena Using Boson Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation in its current state faces experimental overhead in terms of physical space and cooling. We propose boson sampling as an alternative compact synthetic platform performing at room temperature. Identifying the capability of estimating matrix permanents, we explore the applicability of boson sampling for tackling the dynamics of quantum systems without having access to information about the full state vector. By mapping the time-evolution unitary of a Hamiltonian onto an interferometer via continuous-variable gate decompositions, we present proof-of-principle results of localization characteristics of a single particle. We study the dynamics of one-dimensional tight-binding systems in the clean and quasiperiodic-disordered limits to observe Bloch oscillations and dynamical localization, and the delocalization-to-localization phase transition in the Aubry- Andre-Harper model respectively. Our computational results obtained using boson sampling are in complete agreement with the dynamical and static results of non-interacting tight-binding systems obtained using conventional numerical calculations. Additionally, our study highlights the role of number of sampling measurements or shots for simulation accuracy.</description>

      <title>A New Adaptive Balanced Augmented Lagrangian Method with Application to ISAC Beamforming Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a class of convex programming problems with linear equality constraints, which finds broad applications in machine learning and signal processing. We propose a new adaptive balanced augmented Lagrangian (ABAL) method for solving these problems. The proposed ABAL method adaptively selects the stepsize parameter and enjoys a low per-iteration complexity, involving only the computation of a proximal mapping of the objective function and the solution of a linear equation. These features make the proposed method well-suited to large-scale problems. We then custom-apply the ABAL method to solve the ISAC beamforming design problem, which is formulated as a nonlinear semidefinite program in a previous work. This customized application requires careful exploitation of the problem's special structure such as the property that all of its signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR) constraints hold with equality at the solution and an efficient computation of the proximal mapping of the objective function. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed ABAL method.</description>

      <title>Attempting the impossible: enumerating extremal submodular functions for n=6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enumerating the extremal submodular functions defined on subsets of a fixed base set has only been done for base sets up to five elements. This paper reports the results of attempting to generate all such functions on a six-element base set. Using improved tools from polyhedral geometry, we have computed 360 billion of them, and provide the first reasonable estimate of their total number, which is expected to be between 1,000 and 10,000 times this number. The applied Double Description and Adjacency Decomposition methods require an insertion order of the defining inequalities. We introduce two novel orders, which speed up the computations significantly, and provide additional insight into the highly symmetric structure of submodular functions. We also present an improvement to the combinatorial test used as part of the Double Description method, and use statistical analyses to estimate the degeneracy of the polyhedral cone used to describe these functions. The statistical results also highlight the limitations of the applied methods.</description>

      <title>Improved Contact Graph Routing in Delay Tolerant Networks with Capacity and Buffer Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Satellite communications present challenging characteristics. Continuous end-to-end connectivity may not be available due to the large distances between satellites. Moreover, resources such as link capacity and buffer memory may be limited. Routing in satellite networks is therefore both complex and crucial to avoid packet losses and long delays. The Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) paradigm has emerged as an efficient solution for managing these challenging networks. Contact Graph Routing (CGR), a deterministic routing algorithm, is one of the most popular DTN algorithms. CGR is compatible with the ``store, carry, and forward" principle, whereby a node receives a message and stores it in its buffer until a transmission opportunity becomes available. However, CGR relies on simplified models to incorporate potential constraints in the route search. For instance, the linear volume assumption is often used to consider capacity constraints. Moreover, capacity management and buffer management are mostly performed during the forwarding phase, once an issue has occurred. In this paper, we propose to take measures before or during the route search in order to find routes that respect both contact-capacity limits and node-buffer limits. We introduce the contact splitting and edge pruning operations to effectively account for the routing constraints. This ensures that CGR outputs the optimal solution among the subset of valid solutions. The proposed approach can also be used to book resources to be used in case of issues during the forwarding step.</description>

      <title>Solovay reducibility via translation functions on rationals and on reals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solovay reducibility $\redsolovay$ was introduced by Robert M. Solovay in 1975 via translation functions on rationals. In 2022, its totalized version $\redsolovaytotal$ (i.e., Solovay reducibility via a total function on rationals) has been examined by Merkle and Titov (arXiv:2407.14869).
  In 2020, Kumabe, Miyabe, Mizusawa and Suzuki (arXiv:1903.08625) have discovered that Solovay reducibility can be characterized on left-c.e.\ reals using the notion of a translation function on reals. In 2024, Kumabe, Miyabe, and Suzuki (DOI: 10.3233/COM-230486) have introduced a new reducibility $\redclopen$ on all reals, that uses the notion of a translation function on reals, and its totalized version $\redcllocal$. %They have also shown that $\redcllocal$ implies $\redclopen$, wherein the converse is not true even for left-c.e. reals.
  In this work, we show that $\redsolovayreal$ implies $\redclopen$ and $\redsolovaytotal$ implies $\redcllocal$ on all reals.</description>

      <title>Conditional Dependence via U-Statistics Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of measuring conditional dependence between two random phenomena arises when a third one (a confounder) has a potential influence on the amount of information shared by the original pair. A typical issue in this challenging problem is the inversion of ill-conditioned autocorrelation matrices. This paper presents a novel measure of conditional dependence based on the use of incomplete unbiased statistics of degree two, which allows to re-interpret independence as uncorrelatedness on a finite-dimensional feature space. This formulation enables to prune data according to the observations of the confounder itself, thus avoiding matrix inversions altogether. Moreover, the proposed approach is articulated as an extension of the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion, which becomes expressible through kernels that operate on 4-tuples of data.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Minimax Regret Bounds for Reinforcement Learning based on Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study agents acting in an unknown environment where the agent's goal is to find a robust policy. We consider robust policies as policies that achieve high cumulative rewards for all possible environments. To this end, we consider agents minimizing the maximum regret over different environment parameters, leading to the study of minimax regret. This research focuses on deriving information-theoretic bounds for minimax regret in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with a finite time horizon. Building on concepts from supervised learning, such as minimum excess risk (MER) and minimax excess risk, we use recent bounds on the Bayesian regret to derive minimax regret bounds. Specifically, we establish minimax theorems and use bounds on the Bayesian regret to perform minimax regret analysis using these minimax theorems. Our contributions include defining a suitable minimax regret in the context of MDPs, finding information-theoretic bounds for it, and applying these bounds in various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware and Reliable Neural MIMO Receivers via Modular Bayesian Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02436v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning is envisioned to play a key role in the design of future wireless receivers. A popular approach to design learning-aided receivers combines deep neural networks (DNNs) with traditional model-based receiver algorithms, realizing hybrid model-based data-driven architectures. Such architectures typically include multiple modules, each carrying out a different functionality dictated by the model-based receiver workflow. Conventionally trained DNN-based modules are known to produce poorly calibrated, typically overconfident, decisions. Consequently, incorrect decisions may propagate through the architecture without any indication of their insufficient accuracy. To address this problem, we present a novel combination of Bayesian deep learning with hybrid model-based data-driven architectures for wireless receiver design. The proposed methodology, referred to as modular Bayesian deep learning, is designed to yield calibrated modules, which in turn improves both accuracy and calibration of the overall receiver. We specialize this approach for two fundamental tasks in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) receivers - equalization and decoding. In the presence of scarce data, the ability of modular Bayesian deep learning to produce reliable uncertainty measures is consistently shown to directly translate into improved performance of the overall MIMO receiver chain.</description>

      <title>Limiting Moments of Autocorrelation Demerit Factors of Binary Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14566v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various problems in engineering and natural science demand binary sequences that do not resemble translates of themselves, that is, the sequences must have small aperiodic autocorrelation at every nonzero shift. If $f$ is a sequence, then the demerit factor of $f$ is the sum of the squared magnitudes of the autocorrelations at all nonzero shifts for the sequence obtained by normalizing $f$ to unit Euclidean norm. The demerit factor is the reciprocal of Golay's merit factor, and low demerit factor indicates low self-similarity of a sequence under translation. We endow the $2^\ell$ binary sequences of length $\ell$ with uniform probability measure and consider the distribution of their demerit factors. Earlier works used combinatorial techniques to find exact formulas for the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the distribution as a function of $\ell$. These revealed that for $\ell \geq 4$, the $p$th central moment of this distribution is strictly positive for every $p \geq 2$. This article shows that for every $p$, the $p$th central moment is $\ell^{-2 p}$ times a quasi-polynomial function of $\ell$ with rational coefficients. It also shows that, in the limit as $\ell$ tends to infinity, the $p$th standardized moment is the same as that of the standard normal distribution.</description>

      <title>Design and Optimization of Heterogeneous Coded Distributed Computing with Nonuniform File Popularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies MapReduce-based heterogeneous coded distributed computing (CDC) where, besides different computing capabilities at workers, input files to be accessed by computing jobs have nonuniform popularity. We propose a file placement strategy that can handle an arbitrary number of input files. Furthermore, we design a nested coded shuffling strategy that can efficiently manage the nonuniformity of file popularity to maximize the coded multicasting opportunity. We then formulate the joint optimization of the proposed file placement and nested shuffling design variables to optimize the proposed CDC scheme. To reduce the high computational complexity in solving the resulting mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, we propose a simple two-file-group-based file placement approach to obtain an approximate solution. Numerical results show that the optimized CDC scheme outperforms other alternatives. Also, the proposed two-file-group-based approach achieves nearly the same performance as the conventional branch-and-cut method in solving the MILP problem but with substantially lower computational complexity that is scalable over the number of files and workers. For computing jobs with aggregate target functions that commonly appear in machine learning applications, we propose a heterogeneous compressed CDC (C-CDC) scheme to further improve the shuffling efficiency. The C-CDC scheme uses a local data aggregation technique to compress the data to be shuffled for the shuffling load reduction. We again optimize the proposed C-CDC scheme and explore the two-file-group-based low-complexity approach for an approximate solution. Numerical results show the proposed C-CDC scheme provides a considerable shuffling load reduction over the CDC scheme, and also, the two-file-group-based file placement approach maintains good performance.</description>

      <title>Fourier Analysis of Signals on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) Using Graph Zero-Padding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01073v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are used for modeling causal relationships, dependencies, and flows in various systems. However, spectral analysis becomes impractical in this setting because the eigendecomposition of the adjacency matrix yields all eigenvalues equal to zero. This inherent property of DAGs results in an inability to differentiate between frequency components of signals on such graphs. This problem can be addressed by {alternating the Fourier basis or adding edges in a DAG}. However, these approaches change the physics of the considered problem. To address this limitation, we propose a \textit{graph zero-padding} approach. This approach involves augmenting the original DAG with additional vertices that are connected to the existing structure. The added vertices are characterized by signal values set to zero. The proposed technique enables the spectral evaluation of system outputs on DAGs (in almost all cases), that is the computation of vertex-domain convolution without the adverse effects of aliasing due to changes in a graph structure, { with the ultimate goal of preserving the output of the system on a graph as if the changes in the graph structure were not performed}.</description>

      <title>Covariance-Based Activity Detection in Cooperative Multi-Cell Massive MIMO: Scaling Law and Efficient Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15299v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the covariance-based activity detection problem in a multi-cell massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. In this system, active devices transmit their signature sequences to multiple base stations (BSs), and the BSs cooperatively detect the active devices based on the received signals. While the scaling law for the covariance-based activity detection in the single-cell scenario has been extensively analyzed in the literature, this paper aims to analyze the scaling law for the covariance-based activity detection in the multi-cell massive MIMO system. Specifically, this paper demonstrates a quadratic scaling law in the multi-cell system, under the assumption that the path-loss exponent of the fading channel $\gamma &gt; 2.$ This finding shows that, in the multi-cell massive MIMO system, the maximum number of active devices that can be correctly detected in each cell increases quadratically with the length of the signature sequence and decreases logarithmically with the number of cells (as the number of antennas tends to infinity). Moreover, in addition to analyzing the scaling law for the signature sequences randomly and uniformly distributed on a sphere, the paper also establishes the scaling law for signature sequences based on a finite alphabet, which are easier to generate and store. Finally, this paper proposes two efficient accelerated coordinate descent (CD) algorithms with a convergence guarantee for solving the device activity detection problem. The first algorithm reduces the complexity of CD by using an inexact coordinate update strategy. The second algorithm avoids unnecessary computations of CD by using an active set selection strategy. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms exhibit excellent performance in terms of computational efficiency and detection error probability.</description>

Abstract: Semantic communication is a new paradigm for information transmission that integrates the essential meaning (semantics) of the message into the communication process. However, like in classic wireless communications, the open nature of wireless channels poses security risks for semantic communications. In this paper, we characterize information-theoretic limits for the secure transmission of a semantic source over a wiretap channel. Under separate secrecy and distortion constrains for semantics and observed data, we present general inner and outer bounds on the rate-distortion-equivocation region. We also reduce the general region to the case of Gaussian source and Gaussian wiretap channel and provide numerical evaluations.</description>

      <title>On Stochastic Fundamental Limits in a Downlink Integrated Sensing and Communication Network</title>

Abstract: This paper aims to analyze the stochastic performance of a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system in a downlink scenario, where a base station (BS) transmits a dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) signal matrix, serving the purpose of transmitting communication data to the user while simultaneously sensing the angular location of a target. The channel between the BS and the user is modeled as a random channel with Rayleigh fading distribution, and the azimuth angle of the target is assumed to follow a uniform distribution. Due to the randomness inherent in the network, the challenge is to consider suitable performance metrics for this randomness. To address this issue, for users, we employ the user's rate outage probability (OP) and ergodic rate, while for target, we propose using the OP of the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the angle of arrival and the ergodic CRLB. We have obtained the expressions of these metrics for scenarios where the BS employs two different beamforming methods. Our approach to deriving these metrics involves computing the probability density function (PDF) of the signal-to-noise ratio for users and the CRLB for the target. We have demonstrated that the central limit theorem provides a viable approach for deriving these PDFs. In our numerical results, we demonstrate the trade-off between sensing and communication (S \&amp; C) by characterizing the region of S \&amp; C metrics and by obtaining the Pareto optimal boundary points, confirmed with simulations.</description>

Abstract: Secure aggregation is concerned with the task of securely uploading the inputs of multiple users to an aggregation server without letting the server know the inputs beyond their summation. It finds broad applications in distributed machine learning paradigms such as federated learning (FL) where multiple clients, each having access to a proprietary dataset, periodically upload their locally trained models (abstracted as inputs) to a parameter server which then generates an aggregate (e.g., averaged) model that is sent back to the clients as an initializing point for a new round of local training. To enhance the data privacy of the clients, secure aggregation protocols are developed using techniques from cryptography to ensure that the server infers no more information of the users' inputs beyond the desired aggregated input, even if the server can collude with some users. Although laying the ground for understanding the fundamental utility-security trade-off in secure aggregation, the simple star client-server architecture cannot capture more complex network architectures used in practical systems. Motivated by hierarchical federated learning, we investigate the secure aggregation problem in a $3$-layer hierarchical network consisting of clustered users connecting to an aggregation server through an intermediate layer of relays. Besides the conventional server security which requires that the server learns nothing beyond the desired sum of inputs, relay security is also imposed so that the relays infer nothing about the users' inputs and remain oblivious. For such a hierarchical secure aggregation (HSA) problem, we characterize the optimal multifaceted trade-off between communication (in terms of user-to-relay and relay-to-server communication rates) and secret key generation efficiency (in terms of individual key and source key rates).</description>

      <title>Secure Collaborative Computation Offloading and Resource Allocation in Cache-Assisted Ultra-Dense IoT Networks With Multi-Slope Channels</title>

Abstract: Cache-assisted ultra-dense mobile edge computing (MEC) networks are a promising solution for meeting the increasing demands of numerous Internet-of-Things mobile devices (IMDs). To address the complex interferences caused by small base stations (SBSs) deployed densely in such networks, this paper explores the combination of orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and base station (BS) clustering. Additionally, security measures are introduced to protect IMDs' tasks offloaded to BSs from potential eavesdropping and malicious attacks. As for such a network framework, a computation offloading scheme is proposed to minimize IMDs' energy consumption while considering constraints such as delay, power, computing resources, and security costs, optimizing channel selections, task execution decisions, device associations, power controls, security service assignments, and computing resource allocations. To solve the formulated problem efficiently, we develop a further improved hierarchical adaptive search (FIHAS) algorithm, giving some insights into its parallel implementation, computation complexity, and convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can achieve lower total energy consumption and delay compared to other algorithms when strict latency and cost constraints are imposed.</description>

      <title>Wireless Human-Machine Collaboration in Industry 5.0</title>

Abstract: Wireless Human-Machine Collaboration (WHMC) represents a critical advancement for Industry 5.0, enabling seamless interaction between humans and machines across geographically distributed systems. As the WHMC systems become increasingly important for achieving complex collaborative control tasks, ensuring their stability is essential for practical deployment and long-term operation. Stability analysis certifies how the closed-loop system will behave under model randomness, which is essential for systems operating with wireless communications. However, the fundamental stability analysis of the WHMC systems remains an unexplored challenge due to the intricate interplay between the stochastic nature of wireless communications, dynamic human operations, and the inherent complexities of control system dynamics. This paper establishes a fundamental WHMC model incorporating dual wireless loops for machine and human control. Our framework accounts for practical factors such as short-packet transmissions, fading channels, and advanced HARQ schemes. We model human control lag as a Markov process, which is crucial for capturing the stochastic nature of human interactions. Building on this model, we propose a stochastic cycle-cost-based approach to derive a stability condition for the WHMC system, expressed in terms of wireless channel statistics, human dynamics, and control parameters. Our findings are validated through extensive numerical simulations and a proof-of-concept experiment, where we developed and tested a novel wireless collaborative cart-pole control system. The results confirm the effectiveness of our approach and provide a robust framework for future research on WHMC systems in more complex environments.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Model Based Posterior Sampling for Noisy Linear Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12343v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of diffusion models and flow-based generative models, there has been a surge of interests in solving noisy linear inverse problems, e.g., super-resolution, deblurring, denoising, colorization, etc, with generative models. However, while remarkable reconstruction performances have been achieved, their inference time is typically too slow since most of them rely on the seminal diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) framework and thus to approximate the intractable likelihood score, time-consuming gradient calculation through back-propagation is needed. To address this issue, this paper provides a fast and effective solution by proposing a simple closed-form approximation to the likelihood score. For both diffusion and flow-based models, extensive experiments are conducted on various noisy linear inverse problems such as noisy super-resolution, denoising, deblurring, and colorization. In all these tasks, our method (namely DMPS) demonstrates highly competitive or even better reconstruction performances while being significantly faster than all the baseline methods.</description>

      <title>A physics-informed neural network framework for modeling obstacle-related equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has been highly successful in some applications. Nevertheless, its use for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) has only been of recent interest with current state-of-the-art machine learning libraries, e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are an attractive tool for solving partial differential equations based on sparse and noisy data. Here extend PINNs to solve obstacle-related PDEs which present a great computational challenge because they necessitate numerical methods that can yield an accurate approximation of the solution that lies above a given obstacle. The performance of the proposed PINNs is demonstrated in multiple scenarios for linear and nonlinear PDEs subject to regular and irregular obstacles.</description>

      <title>Learning Capacity: A Measure of the Effective Dimensionality of a Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a formal correspondence between thermodynamics and inference, where the number of samples can be thought of as the inverse temperature, to study a quantity called ``learning capacity'' which is a measure of the effective dimensionality of a model. We show that the learning capacity is a useful notion of the complexity because (a) it correlates well with the test loss and it is a tiny fraction of the number of parameters for many deep networks trained on typical datasets, (b) it depends upon the number of samples used for training, (c) it is numerically consistent with notions of capacity obtained from PAC-Bayes generalization bounds, and (d) the test loss as a function of the learning capacity does not exhibit double descent. We show that the learning capacity saturates at very small and very large sample sizes; the threshold that characterizes the transition between these two regimes provides guidelines as to when one should procure more data and when one should search for a different architecture to improve performance. We show how the learning capacity can be used to provide a quantitative notion of capacity even for non-parametric models such as random forests and nearest neighbor classifiers.</description>

      <title>Joint Sensing and Semantic Communications with Multi-Task Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the integration of deep learning techniques for joint sensing and communications, with an extension to semantic communications. The integrated system comprises a transmitter and receiver operating over a wireless channel, subject to noise and fading. The transmitter employs a deep neural network (DNN), namely an encoder, for joint operations of source coding, channel coding, and modulation, while the receiver utilizes another DNN, namely a decoder, for joint operations of demodulation, channel decoding, and source decoding to reconstruct the data samples. The transmitted signal serves a dual purpose, supporting communication with the receiver and enabling sensing. When a target is present, the reflected signal is received, and another DNN decoder is utilized for sensing. This decoder is responsible for detecting the target's presence and determining its range. All these DNNs, including one encoder and two decoders, undergo joint training through multi-task learning, considering data and channel characteristics. This paper extends to incorporate semantic communications by introducing an additional DNN, another decoder at the receiver, operating as a task classifier. This decoder evaluates the fidelity of label classification for received signals, enhancing the integration of semantics within the communication process. The study presents results based on using the CIFAR-10 as the input data and accounting for channel effects like Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading. The results underscore the effectiveness of multi-task deep learning in achieving high-fidelity joint sensing and semantic communications.</description>

      <title>Automatic AI Model Selection for Wireless Systems: Online Learning via Digital Twinning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In modern wireless network architectures, such as O-RAN, artificial intelligence (AI)-based applications are deployed at intelligent controllers to carry out functionalities like scheduling or power control. The AI "apps" are selected on the basis of contextual information such as network conditions, topology, traffic statistics, and design goals. The mapping between context and AI model parameters is ideally done in a zero-shot fashion via an automatic model selection (AMS) mapping that leverages only contextual information without requiring any current data. This paper introduces a general methodology for the online optimization of AMS mappings. Optimizing an AMS mapping is challenging, as it requires exposure to data collected from many different contexts. Therefore, if carried out online, this initial optimization phase would be extremely time consuming. A possible solution is to leverage a digital twin of the physical system to generate synthetic data from multiple simulated contexts. However, given that the simulator at the digital twin is imperfect, a direct use of simulated data for the optimization of the AMS mapping would yield poor performance when tested in the real system. This paper proposes a novel method for the online optimization of AMS mapping that corrects for the bias of the simulator by means of limited real data collected from the physical system. Experimental results for a graph neural network-based power control app demonstrate the significant advantages of the proposed approach.</description>
