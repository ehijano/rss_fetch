      <title>Higher-order phase reduction for delay-coupled oscillators beyond the phase-shift approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network interactions between dynamical units are often subject to time delay. We develop a phase reduction method for delay-coupled oscillator networks. The method is based on rewriting the delay-differential equation as an ordinary differential equation coupled with a transport equation, expanding in the coupling strength, and solving the resulting equations order-by-order. This approach yields an approximation of the finite-dimensional phase dynamics to arbitrary order. While in the first-order approximation the time delay acts as a phase shift as expected, the higher-order phase reduction generally displays a less trivial dependence on the delay. In particular, exploiting second-order phase reduction, we prove the existence of a region of bistability in the synchronization dynamics of two delay-coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators.</description>

      <title>Pregnancy as a dynamical paradox: robustness, control and birth onset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The timing of human labor is among the most critical determinants of neonatal survival, yet the mechanisms that govern the transition from uterine quiescence to coordinated contractions remain elusive. Here we present a dynamical-systems framework that models the pregnant uterus as a spatially extended network of electrically excitable cells regulated by sparse adaptive feedback mimicking hormonal and mechanical influences. This approach reveals how stability during gestation and sensitivity near parturition can be simultaneously maintained through the interplay of control, network structure, and noise. Our analysis shows that spontaneous contractions such as Braxton-Hicks and Alvarez waves are not epiphenomena, but functional components that reduce control effort and preserve responsiveness. Moreover, we identify preterm labor as a boundary-crossing phenomenon arising when control fails to correctly interpret early-warning signals. These results establish a unifying mechanistic theory for labor onset, yield testable predictions, and suggest new therapeutic strategies to mitigate preterm birth risk.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Objective-Driven Dynamical Stochastic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fields offer a versatile approach for describing complex systems composed of interacting and dynamic components. In particular, some of these dynamical and stochastic systems may exhibit goal-directed behaviors aimed at achieving specific objectives, which we refer to as $\textit{intelligent fields}$. However, due to their inherent complexity, it remains challenging to develop a formal theoretical description of such systems and to effectively translate these descriptions into practical applications. In this paper, we propose three fundamental principles to establish a theoretical framework for understanding intelligent fields: complete configuration, locality, and purposefulness. Moreover, we explore methodologies for designing such fields from the perspective of artificial intelligence applications. This initial investigation aims to lay the groundwork for future theoretical developments and practical advances in understanding and harnessing the potential of such objective-driven dynamical stochastic fields.</description>

      <title>Does higher influence mean more information transferred? A case study using the Vicsek Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the flow of information among individuals in a complex system is critical to our understanding of its dynamics. The concept of influence is often used to correlate with information transfer, as quantified by various information-theoretical tools. However, influence has not been explicitly and quantitatively defined. Here, we propose an intuitive and quantifiable definition of influence and use the Vicsek model as an example to investigate the quantitative relations between influence and information transfer. We identify quantitative relations between influence and information transfer in pairwise interactions and collective interactions. Significantly, we uncover the dual effect of noise. Finally, we use partial information decomposition methods to reveal the unique and synergistic nature of influence and information transfer in a collective. The insights gained in our model will contribute to our understanding of other natural and artificial complex systems.</description>
