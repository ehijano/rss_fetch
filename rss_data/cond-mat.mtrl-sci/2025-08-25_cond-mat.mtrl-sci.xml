      <title>Wiener Hopf Analysis of Transient Mode-I/Mode-II Fracture in Rotating Heterogeneous Magnetoelastic Orthotropic Media under Initial Stresses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the fracture behavior under both opening (Mode I) and in-plane sliding (Mode II) conditions for a semi-infinite crack in a rotating, spatially graded magnetoelastic orthotropic strip with combined horizontal and vertical initial normal stresses. The strip is assumed infinite in extent, with the crack aligned along its longitudinal axis and parallel to the rotation axis. The governing field equations are reduced to an analytically tractable form by employing the Fourier transform in the spatial domain and the Laplace transform in the temporal domain. The effect of a sudden application of traction, represented by a Heaviside step function, is analyzed for both normal and shear loading conditions. The resulting boundary-value problem is addressed through the Wiener Hopf method, yielding analytical representations of the stress intensity factors (SIFs). The near tip asymptotic stress fields are evaluated to derive explicit SIF representations for each loading configuration. Laplace inversion is performed using the generalized Chebyshev Laguerre polynomial method. Numerical simulations are conducted for Uranium and Graphite--Epoxy, with isotropic materials considered for comparison to assess the role of anisotropy. The temporal evolution of the SIFs is investigated for varying material gradation parameters, rotation rates, magnetoelastic coupling, and initial stresses. Results reveal that functional grading significantly influences both the magnitude and time evolution of the SIFs, rotation introduces a stabilizing effect, and magnetoelasticity exhibits mode-dependent impacts. These findings provide valuable insight into fracture behavior in advanced magnetoelastic composites, with relevance to high-performance rotating structures such as surface acoustic wave devices, aircraft wings, and helicopter blades.</description>

      <title>Modeling Energy- and Momentum-dependent Scattering Relaxation Times in a Semi-Classical Model of Charge Transport using the Self-Scattering Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improvement of numerical methods for calculating charge transport quantities of materials from the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) is important for prediction of material properties. In particular, techniques which allow for more accurate models of scattering rates and band structures while remaining less computationally involved are valuable. The self-scattering technique is one such technique for implementing energy- and momentum-dependent scattering relaxation times in Monte Carlo simulations of charge transport or iterative techniques for solving the BTE. While the technique initially uses a constant relaxation time in the simulation algorithm, we found, upon analysis of the technique, that the energy and momentum total scattering relaxation time may be recovered. To show this, we preformed self-scattering Monte Carlo simulations of electron transport for both energy-dependent and independent relaxation times. The relaxation times and the fraction of scattering type selected in the simulation matched the full rates implemented in the simulation. In order to understand these results, we developed the theory behind the technique, demonstrating that the probability distribution function of free-flight times created using the self-scattering algorithm produces the analytical probability distribution function expression generated by full energy, momentum and time dependent relaxation times and probabilities. However, certain forms of relaxation times may cause the simulation to fail, depending on implementation. Clarity about such techniques is important for improvement of charge transport simulation models and implementation of ab initio scattering rates and band structures.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Monte Carlo Metadynamics (hybridMC-MetaD)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the powerful integration of the Hybrid Monte Carlo (hybridMC) algorithm and Well-Tempered Metadynamics. This new algorithm, hybridMC-MetaD, enhances the flexibility and applicability of metadynamics by allowing for the utilization of a wider range of collective variables (CVs), namely non-differentiable CVs. We demonstrate the usage of hybridMC-MetaD through five examples of rare events in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, including a rare transition in a model potential system, condensation of the argon system, crystallization in a nearly-hard sphere system, a nearly-hard bipyramid system and a colloidal suspension. By taking advantage of hybridMC, which combines molecular dynamics (MD) and MC, we are able to bias the transitions along non-differentiable CVs for all five cases, which would be unfeasible with conventional MD simulations. Enabled by metadynamics, we observed significant acceleration of the phase transitions and calculated free energy barriers using the hybridMC-MetaD simulation data. For the nearly-hard bipyramid system whose crystallization is primarily driven by entropy, we report the free energy surface for the first time. Through our case studies, we show that our hybridMC-MetaD scheme reduces the complexity of using metadynamics and increases its accessibility. We believe the hybridMC-MetaD algorithm will stimulate greater interest in, and foster broader applications of metadynamics.</description>

      <title>High temporal stability of niobium superconducting resonators by surface passivation with organophosphonate self-assembled monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One main limiting factor towards achieving high coherence times in superconducting circuits is two level system (TLS) losses. Mitigating such losses requires controlling the formation of native oxides at the metal-air interface. Here, we report the growth of alkyl-phosphonate self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on Nb thin films following oxide removal. The impact of passivation was evaluated via the performance of coplanar waveguide resonators at 10mK, in terms of quality factor and resonant frequency, over six days of air exposure. Un-passivated resonators exhibited an ~80% increase in loss at single-photon power levels, whereas SAM-passivated resonators maintained excellent temporal stability, attributed to suppressed oxide regrowth. By employing a two-component TLS model, we discern distinct prominent loss channels for each resonator type and quantified the characteristic TLS loss of the SAMs to be ~5x10^-7. We anticipate our passivation methodology to offer a promising route toward industrial-scale qubit fabrication, particularly where long-term device stability is critical.</description>

      <title>A simulation-based training framework for machine-learning applications in ARPES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has advanced significantly in its ability to probe more observables and simultaneously generate multi-dimensional datasets. These advances present new challenges in data acquisition, processing, and analysis. Machine learning (ML) models can drastically reduce the workload of experimentalists; however, the lack of training data for ML -- and in particular deep learning -- is a significant obstacle. In this work, we introduce an open-source synthetic ARPES spectra simulator - aurelia - for the purpose of generating the large datasets necessary to train ML models. As a demonstration, we train a convolutional neural network to evaluate ARPES spectra quality -- a critical task performed during the initial sample alignment phase of the experiment. We benchmark the simulation-trained model against actual experimental data and find that it can assess the spectra quality more accurately than human analysis, and swiftly identify the optimal measurement region with high precision. Thus, we establish that simulated ARPES spectra can be an effective proxy for experimental spectra in training ML models.</description>

      <title>FIRE-GNN: Force-informed, Relaxed Equivariance Graph Neural Network for Rapid and Accurate Prediction of Surface Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work function and cleavage energy of a surface are critical properties that determine the viability of materials in electronic emission applications, semiconductor devices, and heterogeneous catalysis. While first principles calculations are accurate in predicting these properties, their computational expense combined with the vast search space of surfaces make a comprehensive screening approach with density functional theory (DFT) infeasible. Here, we introduce FIRE-GNN (Force-Informed, Relaxed Equivariance Graph Neural Network), which integrates surface-normal symmetry breaking and machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP)-derived force information, achieving a twofold reduction in mean absolute error (down to 0.065 eV) over the previous state-of-the-art for work function prediction. We additionally benchmark recent invariant and equivariant architectures, analyze the impact of symmetry breaking, and evaluate out-of-distribution generalization, demonstrating that FIRE-GNN consistently outperforms competing models for work function predictions. This model enables accurate and rapid predictions of the work function and cleavage energy across a vast chemical space and facilitates the discovery of materials with tuned surface properties</description>

      <title>Enhanced thermopower in a magnetic semiconductor EuTe4 with multiple charge-density-wave instabilities/</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the layered magnetic semiconductor EuTe4, focusing on its intricate charge-density wave (CDW) states near and above room temperature through single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD), magnetic, and thermoelectric measurements.The XRD measurement revealed that the CDW state inducing the polar lattice distortion persists even at 650 K, demonstrating its remarkable thermal stability. Notably, the Seebeck coefficient near room temperature reaches values exceeding 500 uVK-1. This large Seebeck coefficient, not fully captured by a simple band calculation, is comparable to those observed in heavy-electron semiconducting oxides, suggesting the importance of electron correlation and spin/lattice instabilities. Furthermore, potentially reflecting the competition of two types of CDW states, the thermal conductivity near room temperature is as low as 0.02 Wcm-1K-1. As a result, the thermoelectric figure of merit zT reaches 0.22 at 460 K. These findings establish EuTe4 as a compelling platform to explore novel types of thermoelectric materials with multiple electronic instability.</description>

      <title>Ball milling enables phase-pure synthesis of a temperature sensitive ternary chloride, MgZrCl$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ball milling is a powerful synthetic tool for discovering new inorganic materials. Inspired by the high ionic conductivity in Li$_2$ZrCl$_6$ synthesized via mechanochemistry, we synthesized MgZrCl$_6$ with a similar method. High resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction shows that MgZrCl$_6$ is poorly crystalline after ball milling, but crystallizes in a layered hexagonal structure ($P31c$) after heat treatment. In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction reveals a narrow temperature window around 400 {\deg}C in which crystallization occurs. At higher temperatures the phase decomposes. Pair distribution function analysis shows 2D sheets of MgZrCl$_6$ form after milling, with heating driving 3D crystallization. Raman spectroscopy also shows evidence of MgZrCl$_6$ after milling. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy does not reveal ionic conductivity in MgZrCl$_6$ (limit of detection ca. $1.4 \times 10^{-8}$ S/cm). In addition to supporting existing design rules for Mg-based solid electrolytes, this work shows the power of ball milling to synthesize temperature-sensitive inorganic compounds with high yield.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Strain-Driven Topological Evolution in SrRuO3 via Flexural Strain Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strain engineering offers a powerful route to tailor topological electronic structures in correlated oxides, yet conventional epitaxial strain approaches introduce extrinsic factors such as substrate-induced phase transitions and crystalline quality variations, which makes the unambiguous identification of the intrinsic strain effects challenging. Here, we develop a flexural strain platform based on van der Waals epitaxy and flexible micro-fabrication, enabling precise isolation and quantification of intrinsic strain effects on topological electronic structures in correlated oxides without extrinsic interference. Through strain-dependent transport measurements of the Weyl semimetal SrRuO3, we observed a significant enhancement of anomalous Hall conductivity by 21% under a tiny strain level of 0.2%, while longitudinal resistivity remains almost constant -- a hallmark of intrinsic topological response. First-principles calculations reveal a distinct mechanism where strain-driven non-monotonic evolution of Weyl nodes across the Fermi level, exclusively governed by lattice constant modulation, drives the striking AHC behavior. Our work not only highlights the pivotal role of pure lattice strain in topological regulation but also establishes a universal platform for designing flexible topological oxide devices with tailored functionalities.</description>

      <title>On the nature and charge state of the X-Defect, a radiation-induced Silicon defect with field-enhanced charge carrier emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The elusive X-Defect, a defect found in low-resistivity $p$-type Silicon after irradiation, observed as a low-temperature shoulder of the $\mathrm{B}_\mathrm{i}\mathrm{O}_\mathrm{i}$ defect (Boron-interstitial-Oxygen-interstitial complex) in Thermally Stimulated Current (TSC) measurements, was investigated to determine its properties, matching them with those of a previously identified defect. Through a combination of TSC, Deep-Level Transient Spectroscopy (DLTS), Difference-DLTS (DDLTS), numerical simulations of field-enhanced charge carrier emissions in TSC measurements and a comparison to literature, the X-Defect was identified as the singly positively charged Silicon di-vacancy $\mathrm{V}_2(+/0)$. This assignment is supported by an agreement in activation energy, capture cross-section, trap type and charge emission process, as well as simulations comparing the effects of phonon-assisted tunnelling (PAT) and Poole-Frenkel (PF) mechanisms on TSC spectra. DDTLS measurements revealed a quadratic dependence of the activation energy on the electric field strength, confirming PAT as the prevailing mechanism over PF in the case of the radiation-induced X-Defect. Assigning the X-Defect to an electrically neutral defect in the space charge region resolves previous contradictions regarding its deficiency in impacting on the effective doping concentration.</description>

      <title>Do 1-dimensional metals prefer to form even-numbered van der Waals clusters ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parallel quasi-one-dimensional metals are known to experience strong dispersion (van der Waals, vdW) interactions that fall off unusually slowly with separation between the metals. Examples include nanotube brushes, nano-wire arrays, and also common biological structures. In a many-stranded bundle, there are potentially strong multi-strand vdW interactions that go beyond a simple sum of negative (attractive) pairwise inter-strand energies. Perturbative analysis showed that these contributions alternate in sign, with the odd (triplet, quintuplet, ...) terms being positive (repulsive). The triplet case leds to the intriguing speculation that these strands may prefer to coalesce into even-numbered bundles, which could have implications for the formation kinetics of DNA, for example. Here we use a non-perturbative vdW energy analysis to show that this conjecture is not true in general. As our counter-example we consider 6 strands and show that 2 well-separated bundles of 3 strands have a more negative total vdW energy than 3 well-separated bundles of 2 strands ( i.e. an odd-number preference). We also discuss a bundle of 6 strands and explore the relative contributions beyond pairwise interactions.</description>

      <title>First-principles many-body study for electronic, optical, and excitonic properties of RbTlCl3 perovskite for solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed many-body ab initio study of the valence-skipper RbTlCl$_{3}$ perovskite compound for photovoltaic (PV) applications. The electronic and optical properties, both with and without spin-orbit coupling, have been calculated using density functional theory (DFT) and many-body excited-state calculations. The band gap, which is indirect in nature, is found to be 0.95 eV and 0.89 eV from PBE and PBEsol, respectively. The optical properties have been computed using four different approximations: independent particle approximation (IPA), IPA with scissor correction (IQPA), random phase approximation for local-field effects (LFEs), and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). The estimated highest value of the imaginary part of the dielectric function using IQPA is 7 at 2 eV, which slightly decreases to 5.7 due to LFEs. Within BSE, the peak value is obtained to be maximum at 1.6 eV with a magnitude of 10.8, which indicates the strong excitonic effect below the optical gap. Large number of bright and dark bound excitons are found, where the binding energies of four main bound bright excitons are found in the range of 299-350 meV. The exciton amplitude in both reciprocal and real space is analyzed. The main bound bright exciton is localized in the reciprocal space, while this exhibits a delocalized nature in real space. The BSE predicts a highest absorption coefficient of 3.6 $\times$ $10^{6}$ cm$^{-1}$ at 1.7 eV, while a minimum reflectivity in the active region of the solar energy spectrum is obtained to be around 2.7\%. Finally, the solar efficiency has been estimated using the spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency approach and obtained highest value is 15.5% at a thickness of 0.5 $\mu$m. These findings reveal a significant excitonic effect in the absorption spectra of RbTlCl$_{3}$ and highlight its potential as a promising material for single-junction thin-film solar cells.</description>

      <title>Deformation mechanisms of L-PBF-processed Ti-6Al-4V investigated using a combined experimental and simulation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the significant application potential of laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) processed Ti-6Al-4V components, a detailed understanding of their deformation mechanisms remains limited. This study investigates the deformation behavior of the {\alpha^\prime} and {\alpha} phases in the as-built and heat-treated specimens, respectively, using in-situ high-energy X-ray diffraction (HEXRD) combined with crystal plasticity modeling. Both phases exhibited similar elastic anisotropy, with the highest modulus along \{00.2\} and the lowest along \{10.0\}, although the {\alpha} phase consistently showed higher directional moduli than the {\alpha^\prime} phase. Their plastic deformation responses differed markedly: in the as-built {\alpha^\prime} phase, slip activation followed the sequence prismatic \rightarrow basal \rightarrow pyramidal I \langle c+a \rangle, whereas in the heat-treated {\alpha} phase, the sequence was basal \rightarrow prismatic \rightarrow pyramidal I \langle c+a \rangle. Analyses of full width at half maximum (FWHM) and diffraction peak intensities further supported these observations. Finally, inverse modeling within a crystal plasticity framework was employed to determine slip family--specific critical resolved shear stresses (CRSS), revealing higher CRSS values in the {\alpha^\prime} phase for all slip systems except the prismatic family.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio investigation of the interfacial structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of Co$_{2}$MnAl/X (X = MgO and GaAs) heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of (100)-oriented Co$_{2}$MnAl/MgO and Co$_{2}$MnAl/GaAs heterostructures are investigated using plane-wave pseudopotential density functional theory. For the Co$_{2}$MnAl/MgO, CoCo-MgMg, CoCo-OO, MnAl-MgMg, and MnAl-OO interfaces in top-to-top configurations are studied, while for Co$_{2}$MnAl/GaAs, both top-to-top (Co-Ga, Co-As, Mn-Ga, Mn-As, Al-Ga, Al-As) and bridge-site (CoCo-Ga, CoCo-As, MnAl-Ga, MnAl-As) interfaces are considered. The interfacial geometries featuring Co- or CoCo-atomic terminations for the Co2MnAl slab exhibit larger adhesion energies compared to those terminated with Mn-, Al-, or MnAl-atomic terminations. This indicates their greater interfacial stability. In contrast, MnAl-, Mn-, or Al-terminated interfaces preserve near half-metallicity, whereas Co- and CoCo-terminated geometries display a strongly metallic character. All studied interfaces show enhanced magnetic moments relative to their bulk counterparts, primarily arising from interfacial atoms and their nearest neighbours. These findings offer valuable insights for optimizing Co2MnAl-based heterostructures in spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Symmetries in zero and finite center-of-mass momenta excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a symmetry-based framework for the analysis of excitonic states, incorporating both time-reversal and space-group symmetries. We demonstrate the use of time-reversal and space-group symmetries to obtain exciton eigenstates at symmetry-related center-of-mass momenta in the entire Brillouin zone from eigenstates calculated for center-of-mass momenta in the irreducible Brillouin zone. Furthermore, by explicitly calculating the irreducible representations of the little groups, we classify excitons according to their symmetry properties across the Brillouin zone. Using projection operators, we construct symmetry-adapted linear combinations of electron-hole product states, which block-diagonalize the Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) Hamiltonian at both zero and finite exciton center-of-mass momenta. This enables a transparent organization of excitonic states and provides direct access to their degeneracies, selection rules, and symmetry-protected features. As a demonstration, we apply this formalism to monolayer MoS$_{2}$, where the classification of excitonic irreducible representations and the block structure of the BSE Hamiltonian show excellent agreement with compatibility relations derived from group theory. Beyond this material-specific example, the framework offers a general and conceptually rigorous approach to the symmetry classification of excitons, enabling significant reductions in computational cost for optical spectra, exciton-phonon interactions, and excitonic band structure calculations across a wide range of materials.</description>

      <title>Getting the manifold right: The crucial role of orbital resolution in DFT+U for mixed d-f electron compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately modeling compounds with partially filled $d$ and $f$ shells remains a hard challenge for density-functional theory, due to large self-interaction errors stemming from local or semi-local exchange-correlation functionals. Hubbard $U$ corrections can mitigate such errors, but are often detrimental to the description of hybridized states, leading to spurious force contributions and wrong lattice structures. Here, we show that careful disentanglement of localized and delocalized states leads to accurate predictions of electronic states and structural distortions in ternary monouranates (AUO$_4$, where A represents Mn, Co, or Ni), for which standard $U$ corrections generally fail. Crucial to achieving such accuracy is a minimization of the mismatch between the spatial extension of the projector functions and the true coordination geometry. This requires Wannier-like alternatives to atomic-orbital projector functions, or corrections of Hubbard manifolds exclusively comprised of the most localized A-$3d$, U-$5f$ and O-$2p$ orbitals. These findings open up the computational prediction of fundamental properties of actinide solids of critical technological importance.</description>

      <title>Phonon studies of the phase transition sequence in antiferroelectric single crystal of Pb(Hf0.83Sn0.17)O3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sequence of phase transitions in PbHf0.83Sn0.17O3 has been studied by THz, far infrared and Raman spectroscopies, revealing the complementary behaviour of both, polar and non-polar phonons and their impact on the transition lattice dynamics. Pb atom is sensitive to all phase transitions, changing its dynamics with temperature. As temperature decreases, the crystal undergoes a sequence of three phase transitions. The first one to an intermediate (IM) phase, in which polar fluctuations are detected by THz and IR spectroscopy at frequencies below 100 cm-1 contributing to the maximum of permittivity and revealing important softening. Additional antipolar Pb fluctuations and softening were detected by Raman spectroscopy. At lower temperature, another transition to an antiferroelectric (AFE2) phase is revealed by nonpolar soft modes (antipolar and antiferrodistortive ones), and by an important drop of the dielectric strength of polar phonons. The final transition to the antiferroelectric phase (AFE1) is revealed by the appearance of new modes and a sudden change in the frequency of the soft modes when the antipolar shifts become larger. Using symmetry analysis and optical observation to study how the domain pattern changes with temperature, we identified a path for the cubic-AFE2 transition throughout the IM phase, of plausible tetragonal symmetry, driven by an instability from the center of the Brillouin zone. This mechanism coexists with antiferrodistortive instabilities that eventually drive the material into the AFE2 phase. The final phase transition to the AFE1 phase naturally follows from a mode outside the center of the Brillouin zone and a further doubling of the unit cell.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Influence of Dopants on the Properties of Fluorite Structure Ferroelectrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluorite structure ferroelectrics, especially hafnium oxide, are widely investigated for their application in non-volatile memories, sensors, actuators, RF devices and energy harvesters. Due to the metastable nature of the ferroelectric phase in these materials, dopants and process parameters need to be optimized for its stabilization. Here, we present clear evidence of how dopants affect the properties in this material system and solutions to achieve improved reliability, desired crystallization behavior and polarization hysteresis shape/position through co-doping. Finally, the benefits of co-doping in a variety of application fields are demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Time Propagators for Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is a widely used method to investigate electron dynamics under external time-dependent perturbations such as laser fields. In this work, we present a novel approach to accelerate electron dynamics simulations based on real time TDDFT using autoregressive neural operators as time-propagators for the electron density. By leveraging physics-informed constraints and featurization, and high-resolution training data, our model achieves superior accuracy and computational speed compared to traditional numerical solvers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a class of one-dimensional diatomic molecules under the influence of a range of laser parameters. This method has potential in enabling real-time, on-the-fly modeling of laser-irradiated molecules and materials with varying experimental parameters.</description>

      <title>Interpretability of linear regression models of glassy dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven models can accurately describe and predict the dynamical properties of glass-forming liquids from structural data. Accurate predictions, however, do not guarantee an understanding of the underlying physical phenomena and the key factors that control them. In this paper, we illustrate the merits and limitations of linear regression models of glassy dynamics built on high-dimensional structural descriptors. By analyzing data for a two-dimensional glass model, we show that several descriptors commonly used in glass-transition studies display multicollinearity, which hinders the interpretability of linear models. Ridge regression suppresses some of the shortcomings of multicollinearity, but its solutions are not succinct enough to be physically interpretable. Only by using dimensional reduction techniques we eventually obtain linear models that strike a balance between prediction accuracy and interpretability. Our analysis points to a key role of local packing and composition fluctuations in the glass model under study.</description>

      <title>Dual Topology as a Fingerprint of Relativistic Altermagnetism in AgF$_2$ Monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets have emerged as a fertile ground for quantum phenomena, but topological phases unifying different quasiparticles remain largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that monolayer AgF$_2$ hosts a dual topological state, driven by a single ferroelastic distortion. This polar transition breaks inversion symmetry and unleashes relativistic spin-orbit effects, simultaneously imparting non-trivial topology to electrons and magnons. The result is valence bands with opposite Chern numbers, $C^E=\pm3$, and a magnon spectrum with a full topological gap and chiral bands, $C^M=\pm1$. This work realizes topological altermagnonics in a tangible material platform, with a clear experimental fingerprint in the transverse thermal Hall effect. The coexistence of fermionic and bosonic topology in AgF$_2$ opens new directions for designing intrinsically hybrid quantum matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting chiral domains associated with a time-reversal symmetry-breaking order parameter have garnered significant attention in Kagome systems. In this work, we demonstrate both the intrinsic direct-current and alternating-current Josephson effects in the nanoplates of the vanadium-based Kagome material CsV3Sb5, as evidenced by Fraunhofer-like patterns and Shapiro steps. Moreover, both the Fraunhofer-like patterns and Shapiro steps are modulated by thermal cycling, suggesting that the Josephson effects arise from dynamic superconducting domains. These findings may provide new insights into chiral superconductivity in CsV3Sb5 and highlight the potential of these intrinsic Josephson junctions for applications in chiral superconductor based quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Vibrational Spectra of Materials and Molecules from Partially-Adiabatic Elevated-Temperature Centroid Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) incorporates nuclear quantum statistics into the calculation of vibrational spectra. However, when performed in Cartesian coordinates, CMD shows serious unphysical artifacts in certain vibrational bands, known as the curvature problem. Recent work showed that CMD spectra can be freed from the curvature problem by evolving the ring-polymer centroid on a potential of mean force (PMF) calculated at an elevated temperature ($T_e$-CMD). Here we present a partially-adiabatic implementation of $T_e$-CMD (PA-$T_e$-CMD), which eliminates the need for precomputed PMFs and instead yields the centroid force \textit{on-the-fly}. We introduce a two-temperature path-integral Langevin thermostat to achieve a temperature separation between centroid and internal modes of the ring-polymer. Because it is paramount that the elevated temperature be chosen as low as possible for a given physical temperature in this formulation, we present a general scheme for its determination. We benchmark PA-$T_e$-CMD against exact vibrational spectra for the isolated water monomer and discuss its performance for challenging anharmonic systems: the carbonic acid fluoride molecule (CAF) and the methylammonium lead iodide perovskite (MAPI). We conclude that PA-$T_e$-CMD mitigates the curvature problem and eliminates the steep increase in computational cost with decreasing temperature of conventional path-integral methods. We observe some energy leakage from the hot internal modes to high-frequency centroid modes at low physical temperatures. Nevertheless, compared to other imaginary path-integral approximate methods, the PA-$T_e$-CMD spectra show more accurate lineshapes. While a fully adiabatic setup based on a coarse-grained centroid PMF is still preferable when a good pre-trained PMF can be easily obtained, PA-$T_e$-CMD presents a low-barrier single-shot setup for any system.</description>

      <title>Double excitations in molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Double excitations in organic molecules have garnered significant interest as a result of their importance in singlet fission and photophysics. These excitations play a crucial role in understanding the photoexcitation processes in polyenes. To describe photoexcited states with both single and double excitation character, we use a first-principles many-body theory that combines the GW / Bethe-Salpeter equation and the configuration interaction (CI) methods. Specifically, we develop and employ two CI-based methods: screened configuration interaction singles and doubles (scrCISD) and screened configuration interaction singles with perturbative doubles (scrCIS(D)), applied to an effective many-body Hamiltonian that incorporates screening. We apply these methods to Thiel's set of molecules, which exhibit excited states predominantly characterized by single excitations with a partial double excitation character. Our results indicate that the scrCISD method systematically underestimates the excitation energies compared to the best theoretical estimates, while the scrCIS(D) method shows good agreement with these estimates. Furthermore, we used the scrCISD method to calculate the binding energies of the dominantly doubly excited correlated triplet pair states, $\mathrm{TT^1}$, in pentacene dimers, finding that the $\mathrm{TT^1}$ binding energies agree well with empirical calculations.</description>

      <title>Extreme magnetic field-boosted superconductivity in a high-temperature superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields typically suppress superconductivity through Pauli and orbital limiting effects. However, there are rare instances of magnetic-field-induced superconductivity, as seen in Chevrel phase compounds [1], organic conductors [2], uranium-based heavy-fermion systems [3, 4], and moire graphene [5], though these materials possess inherently low superconducting transition temperatures (Tc). Here, we demonstrate high field-stabilized superconductivity in a class of materials with a significantly higher Tc (up to 40 K): the infinite-layer nickelates [6]. Both low-field and high-field superconducting states can be plausibly explained by a compensation mechanism akin to the Jaccarino-Peter effect. These findings demonstrate the possibility of achieving substantially enhanced upper critical fields in high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Observation of negative orbital torque from Vanadium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present systematic investigations of orbital torques generated from the light metal $V$, revealing a negative orbital torque. We observe that the damping-like torque (DLT) per unit electric field depends on the choice of the ferromagnetic layer, with approximately seven times higher torque efficiency in $Ni/V$ as compared to $Fe_{60}Co_{20}B_{20}/V$. We find the sign of DLT per unit electric field from $V$ is opposite to that from $Pt$. These results collectively confirm the existence of negative orbital Hall effect (OHE) in $V$. Furthermore, the DLT per unit electric field increases with the $V$ layer thickness, maintaining the negative sign at all thicknesses. We also note that the DLT per unit electric field exceeds that of the $Pt$ reference samples at higher $V$ thicknesses. Through fitting using the drift-diffusion equation, we extract a high effective orbital Hall conductivity of $-(1.46 \pm 0.09)\,\frac{\hbar}{2e}\,\times 10^{5}\,\Omega^{-1}\,\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ and a long orbital diffusion length of $(13.7 \pm 0.9)\,\mathrm{nm}$ in $V$. .</description>

      <title>Termination-Driven Control over BIC Q-Factors and Frequencies in Plasmonic Double Net Metamaterials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interlaced metallic wire meshes are 3D metamaterials consisting of two intertwined metallic networks. These plasmonic double nets give rise to otherwise unobserved longitudinal, weakly dispersive and broadband electron acoustic modes from the effective plasma frequency of the double net down to arbitrarily low frequencies. These modes have recently been shown to generate confined slab modes with extremely long lifetimes (high quality factors), so-called quasi-bound states in the continuum. This work reveals the central role of the double net termination in determining the mode's resonant frequency and quality factor. We compare two limiting cases, a tennis net termination recently studied experimentally by others and a protruding column array with a much lower quality factor, as demonstrated by microwave transmission experiments and full-wave simulations. Our work thus vividly demonstrates the failure of a homogenisation approach to explain and quantify the physics of terminated plasmonic network materials. We introduce a new approach, in which additional evanescent bulk states are included in the scattering problem, yielding a qualitative understanding of the slab's optical response. The resulting engineering principles pave the way for the design and exploitation of these materials for applications such as coherent light generation.</description>

      <title>Universal Multistate Kinetic Models for the In-Silico Discovery of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters exhibit complex photophysical behaviors that cannot be fully captured by the conventional three state model (S0, S1, T1). The lack of kinetic models that incorporate vibronic coupling effects and high lying excited states has long limited the systematic understanding and rational design of these materials. To address this, we developed KinLuv, an extended multistate kinetic model that not only includes higher lying excited states (S2, T2) but also accounts for the Herzberg Teller (HT) vibronic coupling in the rate constant calculations. Applied to two representative TADF emitters, i.e., DOBNA and DiKTa, KinLuv successfully predicts photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and prompt/delayed fluorescence lifetimes in good agreement with reported experimental results. These findings highlight that incorporating HT vibronic coupling effects and higher lying excited states is essential for quantitatively modeling TADF mechanisms and guiding the design of high performance emitters.</description>

      <title>Tracking flat bands via phonon-mediated interband scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat-band (FB) materials have emerged as promising platforms for exploring exotic quantum phases. While numerous candidates have recently been identified through spectroscopic techniques such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, central challenges remain on how to tune FBs towards the Fermi level $E_F$ and to understand their impact on low-energy excitations probed in electronic transport experiments. Here, we show that, by attributing the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity at elevated temperatures to electron-phonon interband scattering, one can infer the position of FBs near $E_F$ across diverse material classes. As charge carriers scatter off phonons, interband transitions into FB states lead to distinctive sub- or superlinear resistivity at elevated temperatures, governed by the proximity of the FB to $E_F$. Our phenomenological model captures these universal transport behaviors observed across several recently studied FB compounds and offers a simple, broadly applicable method for detecting flat bands.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Optical Spectroscopy of Nodal-Line Semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intense laser-driven nonlinear optical phenomena in two-dimensional (2D) nodal-line semimetals (NLS) exhibit complex mechanisms, particularly in the NbSi$_{x}$Te$_{2}$ material systems characterized by nonsymmorphic symmetry-protected band degeneracy. Our findings reveal how nonsymmorphic symmetry-protected band degeneracy fundamentally influences the material's nonlienar optical responses. Notably, the nonsymmorphic glide-mirror symmetry leads to the exclusive generation of odd-order harmonics from inversion-symmetry-broken NLS. Moreover, harmonics are emitted parallel and perpendicular to the driving laser's polarization. We demonstrate distinct generation mechanisms arise from intrachain and interchain processes, with their relative contributions varying significantly with the polarization of the driving laser pulse. The polarization-dependence exhibits two-fold anisotropy, with each harmonic order showing characteristic angular distributions of maximum yield. Additionally, our analysis of the ellipticity-dependence reveals an intricate interplay between interband and intraband mechanisms. These insights open new possibilities for controlling harmonic generation through precise tuning parameters of the driving laser and highlight the potentials of NLS materials to fabricate lightwave-based photonics, optoelectronic and quantum devices operating on ultrafast timescales.</description>

      <title>Chemical and Conformational Control of the Spectroscopic Properties of Multi-Layer and Multi-Defect Carbon Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon dots (CDs) are renowned for their bright and tunable photoluminescence (PL), stability, and biocompatibility, yet it remains challenging to link their heterogeneous structures to their spectroscopic properties. This study utilizes density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) to systematically investigate how the spectroscopic properties of CDs of complex CDs with multiple layers and multiples defects are determined by their structures and compositions. Calculations reveal that strongly oxidizing groups, such as carbonyl and carbonyl acetate, significantly redshift absorption and emission spectra. In contrast, less oxidizing groups, such as hydroxyl, behave as spectators with minimal impact on absorption and emission, except when they interact strongly with more oxidizing groups. We find that not only the excitation energy, but also the excitation character itself is impacted by the presence of specific groups, and the pH-dependence of the spectroscopic properties can be attributed to their protonation state-dependent excitation character. We show that the twisting, sliding, and linker-mediated folding of surface-functionalized layers in CDs markedly alter excitation energies and characters, offering a molecular explanation for experimentally observed emission intermittency and polarization fluctuations. These insights provide strategies for optimizing CDs for various applications, including bioimaging, photocatalysis, and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Chiral charge density wave in 4Hb- and 1T-TaS$_2$: The Role of interlayer coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use micro-angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (micro-ARPES) to investigate chiral charge density waves (CDWs) in 4Hb-TaS$_2$ with micron-scale spatial resolution. In the 1T layers of 4Hb-TaS$_2$, we uncover coexisting left- and right-handed CDW domains and resolve four distinct spectral patterns arising from the interplay of chirality and rotational stacking. In contrast, bulk 1T-TaS$_2$ exhibits a uniform chirality. In addition, 4Hb-TaS$_2$ shows negligible out-of-plane dispersion of the 1T-derived bands, in contrast to the pronounced interlayer coupling observed in bulk 1T-TaS$_2$. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations corroborate this picture, revealing that the interlayer interaction of the chiral order in 4Hb-TaS$_2$ is nearly two orders of magnitude weaker than in the 1T polytype. Our findings establish 4Hb-TaS$_2$ as a quasi-two-dimensional platform for exploring tunable chiral CDW phenomena.</description>

      <title>Theoretical issues in the accurate computation of the electron-phonon interaction contribution to the total energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04279v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the computation of the Standard Hamiltonian of a coupled electron-phonon system by accurately computing the electron-phonon interaction (EPI) contribution to the total energy. This gives the most accurate ab initio total energy till date. However, our results show that the per-atom EPI energy is unit-cell-size dependent due to the partial-Fan-Migdal term that arises from the antisymmetric nature of the crystal wavefunction. Due to this, only energy differences between polytypes, in supercells with identical number of atoms, are meaningful, rather than per-atom total energy. This violates our understanding of Quantum Mechanics applied to periodic solids and raises serious theoretical questions. In his original (1951) paper, Fan suggested, without specifying any reason, that second-order perturbation theory applied to the whole crystal is of questionable validity. Our results support Fan's suggestion for the reason that the partial-FM term makes the per-atom total energy unit-cell-size dependent. This leads to a new fundamental problem in condensed matter physics, viz. second-order perturbation theory is invalid for whole crystals, an entire class. It is essential to resolve this problem, especially because it causes the standard Hamiltonian, the starting point of EPI studies and the most accurate ab initio total energy, to be of questionable validity.</description>

      <title>Adjudicating Conduction Mechanisms in High Performance Carbon Nanotube Fibers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20481v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of carbon nanotube (CNT) cables, a contender for copper-wire replacement, is tied to its metallic and semi-conducting-like conductivity responses with temperature; the origin of the semi-conducting-like response however is an underappreciated incongruity in literature. With controlled aspect-ratio and doping-degree, over 61 unique cryogenic experiments including anisotropy and Hall measurements, CNT cable performance is explored at extreme temperatures (65 mK) and magnetic fields (60 T). A semi-conducting-like conductivity response with temperature becomes temperature-independent approaching absolute-zero, uniquely demonstrating the necessity of heterogeneous fluctuation induced tunneling; complete de-doping leads to localized hopping, contrasting graphite's pure metallic-like response. High-field magneto-resistance (including +22% longitudinal magneto-resistance near room-temperature) is analyzed with hopping and classical two-band models, both similarly yielding a parameter useful for conductor development. Varying field-orientation angle uncovers two-and four-fold symmetries from Aharonov-Bohm-like corrections to curvature-induced bandgap. Tight-binding calculations using Green's Function formalism model large-scale, coherent transport in commensurate CNT bundles in magnetic field, revealing non-uniform transmission across bundle cross-sections with doping restoring uniformity; independent of doping, transport in bundle-junction-bundle systems are predominantly from CNTs adjacent to the other bundle. The final impact is predicting the ultimate conductivity of heterogeneous CNT cables using temperature and field-dependent transport, surpassing conductivity of traditional metals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets exhibit a spin-split band structure despite having zero net magnetization, leading to special magnonic properties such as anisotropic magnon lifetimes and field-free spin transport. Here, we present a direct experimental demonstration of non-local magnon transport in the \textit{d}-wave altermagnet \ch{LuFeO3}, using both spin Seebeck and spin Hall effect-based injection and detection. We observe a non-local spin signal at zero magnetic field when the transport is along an altermagnetic direction, but not for transport along other directions. The observed sign reversal between two distinct altermagnetic directions in the spin Seebeck response demonstrates the altermagnetic nature of the magnon transport. In contrast, when transport is aligned along or perpendicular to the easy axis, both the first-harmonic signal and the sign-reversal effect vanish, consistent with symmetry-imposed suppression. These findings are supported by atomistic spin dynamics simulations, as well as linear spin wave theory calculations, which explain how our altermagnetic system hosts anisotropic spin Seebeck transport. Our results provide direct evidence of direction-dependent magnon splitting in altermagnets and highlight their potential for field-free magnonic spin transport, offering a promising pathway for low-power spintronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ occurs when the interlayer Ni-O-Ni bond angle becomes straight under pressure, suggesting a strong relationship between the crystal structure and the emergence of superconductivity. In this study, we theoretically propose a way to control the crystal structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ toward the tetragonal symmetry via light irradiation instead of pressure using the idea of nonlinear phononics. Here, resonant optical excitation of an infrared-active (IR) lattice vibration induces a nonlinear Raman-mode displacement through the anharmonic phonon-phonon coupling. We calculate the light-induced phonon dynamics on the anharmonic lattice potential determined by first-principles calculation. We find that the interlayer Ni-O-Ni bond angle gets slightly closer to straight when an appropriate IR mode is selectively excited. Our study suggests that light irradiation can be a promising way for structural control of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (tTMDs) provide a highly tunable platform to explore the interplay between strong correlation and topology. Among them, the properties involving the charge degree of freedom have been extensively studied, while those related to spin are much less investigated. Motivated by the recent discovery of integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects in tMoTe$_2$, where the flat-band ferromagnetism is one of the essential prerequisites, we investigate theoretically the spin excitations out of the flat-band ferromagnetic ground state in tMoTe$_2$. Remarkably, we identify the itinerant magnons and spin excitons with nontrivial topology. We elaborate that the topology of these itinerant spin excitations, which are described as particle-hole bound states, inherits directly from that of the underlying electrons and is essentially different from that in local spin systems. Thus, we establish a direct relationship of the topology between the many-body excitations and their fundamental constituents. We further demonstrate that by tuning the displacement field, a topological transition for both the magnon and spin exciton happens, leading to a step-like change and bifurcation in the thermal Hall conductance, which could serve as unique and compelling evidence to be tested experimentally.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous magnon decays from nonrelativistic time-reversal symmetry breaking in altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasiparticles are central to condensed matter physics, but their stability can be undermined by quantum many-body interactions. Magnons, quasiparticles in quantum magnets, are particularly intriguing because their properties are governed by both real and spin space. While crystal symmetries may be low, spin interactions often remain approximately isotropic, limiting spontaneous magnon decay. Textbook wisdom holds that collinear Heisenberg magnets follow a dichotomy: ferromagnets host stable magnons, while antiferromagnetic magnons may decay depending on dispersion curvature. Up to now, relativistic spin-orbit coupling and noncollinear order that connect spin space to real space, were shown to introduce more complex magnon instability mechanisms. Here, we show that even in nonrelativistic isotropic collinear systems, this conventional dichotomy is disrupted in altermagnets. Altermagnets, a newly identified class of collinear magnets, exhibit compensated spin order with nonrelativistic time-reversal symmetry breaking and even-parity band splitting. Using kinematic analysis, nonlinear spin-wave theory, and quantum simulations, we reveal that even weak band splitting opens a decay phase space, driving quasiparticle breakdown. Additionally, d-wave altermagnets form a rare ``island of stability'' at the Brillouin zone center. Our findings establish a quasiparticle stability trichotomy in collinear Heisenberg magnets and position altermagnets as a promising platform for unconventional spin dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fracture behavior in architected materials can be influenced by heterogeneities, yet the mechanisms by which imperfections affect crack propagation remain poorly understood. In this study, we introduce well-controlled, localized defects in the form of isolated missing struts to evaluate their impact on crack growth in brittle lattice specimens. Using mechanical testing combined with digital image correlation (DIC), we track crack propagation and identify failure processes at the scale of individual lattice cells. While the imperfections do not alter the location of crack initiation or the peak load, they consistently lead to an increase in work to failure when the crack path is tortuous or crack bridging occurs. These findings demonstrate how small, targeted modifications to an otherwise regular lattice can significantly influence fracture resistance in brittle architected materials.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Paradox and Non-Hermitian Topological Singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unidirectional modes in magnetically biased electromagnetic systems have long been associated with a thermodynamic paradox: the absence of counter-propagating channels may produce field "hotspots" that can act as unphysical sinks of thermal radiation. Here we revisit this problem and show that, surprisingly, material dissipation alone cannot fully regularize the singular behavior of the normal modes of a nonreciprocal cavity. We demonstrate that the paradox is resolved by nonlocal effects, which suppress the material response at short wavelengths and eliminate field singularities altogether. Our analysis reveals a fundamental link between nonlocality, topology, and thermodynamic consistency, showing that real-space singularities and ill-defined topologies go hand in hand, even in strongly dissipative platforms. These findings clarify the physical origin of the paradox and establish nonlocality as a natural and robust mechanism for its resolution, opening new avenues to explore the intertwined roles of topology and nonlocality in passive nonreciprocal photonics.</description>

Abstract: Superconductivity and ferromagnetism are naturally competing, while their interplay can give rise to exotic quantum phases, such as triplet pairing, exemplified by heavy-fermion compounds like UTe$_2$, where magnetic fluctuations stabilise multiple superconducting states. However, such phenomena have remained elusive in high-temperature superconductors. Here we report the discovery of robust field-induced re-entrant superconductivity in heavily Eu-doped infinite-layer nickelate Sm$_{0.95-x}$Ca$_{0.05}$Eu$_x$NiO$_2$. In the heavily over-doped regime, we observe a remarkable superconducting state that emerges under high magnetic fields ($&gt;$ 6 Tesla) after the initial suppression of zero-field superconductivity. Both zero-resistance transport and Meissner diamagnetic effect confirm the superconducting nature of this high-field phase, which persists up to at least 45 Tesla. This re-entrant behaviour is featured by the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity on distinct sublattices -- magnetic Eu$^{2+}$ ions and the Ni-O planes, respectively. Such an exotic state may arise from the compensation between external and internal exchange fields (Jaccarino-Peter effect) combined with magnetic fluctuation-enhanced pairing near quantum criticality. Our findings establish infinite-layer nickelates as a unique platform for high-temperature ferromagnetic superconductivity, opening new avenues for discovering and manipulating unconventional quantum phases in strongly correlated materials.</description>
