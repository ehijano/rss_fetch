      <title>Subsuming Complex Networks by Node Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of node walk in graphs and complex networks has been addressed, consisting of one or more nodes that move into adjacent nodes, henceforth incorporating the respective connections. This type of dynamics is then applied to subsume complex networks. Three types of networks (Erd\'os- R\'eny, Barab\'asi-Albert, as well as a geometric model) are considered, while three node walks heuristics (uniformly random, largest degree, and smallest degree) are taken into account. Several interesting results are obtained and described, including the identification that the subsuming dynamics depend strongly on both the specific topology of the networks as well as the criteria controlling the node walks. The use of node walks as a model for studying the relationship between network topology and dynamics is motivated by this result. In addition, relatively high correlations between the initial node degree and the accumulated strength of the walking node were observed for some combinations of network types and dynamic rules, allowing some of the properties of the subsumption to be roughly predicted from the initial topology around the waking node which has been found, however, not to be enough for full determination of the subsumption dynamics. Another interesting result regards the quite distinct signatures (along the iterations) of walking node strengths obtained for the several considered combinations of network type and subsumption rules.</description>

      <title>Beyond a binary theorizing of prosociality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A stylized experiment, the public goods game, has taught us the peculiar reproducible fact that humans tend to contribute more to shared resources than expected from economically rational assumptions. There have been two competing explanations for this phenomenon: either contributing to the public good is an innate human trait (the prosocial preference hypothesis) or a transitory effect while learning the game (the confused learner hypothesis). We use large-scale experimental data from a novel experimental design to distinguish between these two hypotheses. By monitoring the effects of zealots (persistently cooperating bots) and varying the participants' awareness of them, we find a considerably more complex scenario than previously reported. People indeed have a prosocial bias, but not to the degree that they always forego taking action to increase their profit. While our findings end the simplistic theorizing of prosociality in the public goods game, an observed positive, cooperative response to zealots has actionable policy implications.</description>

      <title>The impact of nodes of information dissemination on epidemic spreading in dynamic multiplex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epidemic spreading processes on dynamic multiplex networks provide a more accurate description of natural spreading processes than those on single layered networks. To describe the influence of different individuals in the awareness layer on epidemic spreading, we propose a two-layer network-based epidemic spreading model, including some individuals who neglect the epidemic, and we explore how individuals with different properties in the awareness layer will affect the spread of epidemics. The two-layer network model is divided into an information transmission layer and a disease spreading layer. Each node in the layer represents an individual with different connections in different layers. Individuals with awareness will be infected with a lower probability compared to unaware individuals, which corresponds to the various epidemic prevention measures in real life. We adopt the micro-Markov chain approach to analytically derive the threshold for the proposed epidemic model, which demonstrates that the awareness layer affects the threshold of disease spreading. We then explore how individuals with different properties would affect the disease spreading process through extensive Monte Carlo numerical simulations. We find that individuals with high centrality in the awareness layer would significantly inhibit the transmission of infectious diseases. Additionally, we propose conjectures and explanations for the approximately linear effect of individuals with low centrality in the awareness layer on the number of infected individuals.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and triggers of misinformation on vaccines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.12264v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Covid-19 pandemic has sparked renewed attention on the prevalence of misinformation online, whether intentional or not, underscoring the potential risks posed to individuals' quality of life associated with the dissemination of misconceptions and enduring myths on health-related subjects. In this study, we analyze 6 years (2016-2021) of Italian vaccine debate across diverse social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube), encompassing all major news sources - both questionable and reliable. We first use the symbolic transfer entropy analysis of news production time-series to dynamically determine which category of sources, questionable or reliable, causally drives the agenda on vaccines. Then, leveraging deep learning models capable to accurately classify vaccine-related content based on the conveyed stance and discussed topic, respectively, we evaluate the focus on various topics by news sources promoting opposing views and compare the resulting user engagement. Aside from providing valuable resources for further investigation of vaccine-related misinformation, particularly in a language (Italian) that receives less attention in scientific research compared to languages like English, our study uncovers misinformation not as a parasite of the news ecosystem that merely opposes the perspectives offered by mainstream media, but as an autonomous force capable of even overwhelming the production of vaccine-related content from the latter. While the pervasiveness of misinformation is evident in the significantly higher engagement of questionable sources compared to reliable ones, our findings underscore the importance of consistent and thorough pro-vax coverage. This is especially crucial in addressing the most sensitive topics where the risk of misinformation spreading and potentially exacerbating negative attitudes toward vaccines among the users involved is higher.</description>
