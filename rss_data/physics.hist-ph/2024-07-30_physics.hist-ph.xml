      <title>The Time in Thermal Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preparing general relativity for quantization in the Hamiltonian approach leads to the `problem of time,' rendering the world fundamentally timeless. One proposed solution is the `thermal time hypothesis,' which defines time in terms of states representing systems in thermal equilibrium. On this view, time is supposed to emerge thermodynamically even in a fundamentally timeless context. Here, I develop the worry that the thermal time hypothesis requires dynamics -- and hence time -- to get off the ground, thereby running into worries of circularity.</description>

      <title>An examination of 'Atri's Eclipse' as described in the Rig Veda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The earliest written reference in Indian astronomy to a total solar eclipse is in the Rig Veda where Rishi Atri is said to have demolished the asura Swarbhanu to liberate the Sun from a total solar eclipse. The Rig Veda describes the occurrence of the eclipse, how the Sun suddenly disappeared in the daytime under the spell of the Asura. The people and gods were scared but the Great Sage Atri saved the Sun and restored his full glory. While discussing the eclipse, Tilak refers to the eclipse as having occurred when the Vernal Equinox was in Orion and three days before the Autumnal Equinox. Based on these data, we identify Atris eclipse as the one that occurred on 22 October 4202 BC or on 19 October 3811 BC.</description>

      <title>Julian Hirniak, an early proponent of periodic chemical reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we present and discuss the work and scientific legacy of Julian Hirniak, the Ukrainian chemist and physicist who published two articles in 1908 and 1911 about periodic chemical reactions. Over the last 110+ years, his theoretical work has often been cited favorably in connection with Alfred Lotka's theoretical model of an oscillating reaction system. Other authors have pointed out thermodynamic problems in Hirniak's reaction scheme. Based on English translations of his 1908 Ukrainian and 1911 German articles, we show that Hirniak's claim (that a cycle of inter-conversions of three chemical isomers in a closed reaction vessel can show damped periodic behavior) violates the \textit{Principle of Detailed Balance} (i.e., the Second Law of Thermodynamics), and that Hirniak was aware of this Principle. We also discuss his results in relation to Lotka's first model of damped oscillations in an open system of chemical reactions involving an auto-catalytic reaction operating far from equilibrium. Taking hints from both Hirniak and Lotka, we show that the mundane case of a kinase enzyme catalyzing the phosphorylation of a sugar can satisfy Hirniak's conditions for damped oscillations to its steady state flux (i.e., the Michaelis--Menten rate law), but that the oscillations are so highly damped as to be unobservable. Finally, we examine historical and factual misunderstandings related to Julian Hirniak and his publications.</description>

      <title>Deriving Ontological Statements from the Unnatural Higgs Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide novel, metatheoretical arguments strengthening the position that the naturalness problem of the light Higgs mass is a pseudo-problem: No physics beyond the standard model of particle physics is needed to explain the small value of the Higgs boson. By evaluating previous successes of the guiding principle of technical naturalness, we restrict its applicability to non-fundamental phenomena in the realm of provisional theories within limited energy scales. In view of further breaches of autonomy of scales in apparently fundamental phenomena outside particle physics, the hierarchy problem of the Higgs mass is instead reinterpreted as an indication of the ontologically fundamental status of the Higgs boson. Applying the concept of Selective Realism justifies this seemingly contradictory attribution within the effective theories of the standard model of particle physics. Moreover, we argue that the ongoing naturalness debate about the Higgs mass is partly based on the adherence to the methodology of effective theories (often claimed to be universally applicable), for which there is no justification when dealing with presumably fundamental phenomena such as the Higgs mechanism, even if it is embedded into an effective theory.</description>
