      <title>A note on the geodesic normal distribution on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an alternative formulation of the geodesic normal distribution on the sphere, building on the work of Hauberg (2018). While the isotropic version of this distribution is naturally defined on the sphere, the anisotropic version requires projecting points from the hypersphere onto the tangent space. In contrast, our approach removes the dependence on the tangent space and defines the geodesic normal distribution directly on the sphere. Moreover, we demonstrate that the density contours of this distribution are exactly ellipses on the sphere, providing intriguing alternative characterizations for describing this locus of points.</description>

      <title>Iterative Reweighted Framework Based Algorithms for Sparse Linear Regression with Generalized Elastic Net Penalty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The elastic net penalty is frequently employed in high-dimensional statistics for parameter regression and variable selection. It is particularly beneficial compared to lasso when the number of predictors greatly surpasses the number of observations. However, empirical evidence has shown that the $\ell_q$-norm penalty (where $0 &lt; q &lt; 1$) often provides better regression compared to the $\ell_1$-norm penalty, demonstrating enhanced robustness in various scenarios. In this paper, we explore a generalized elastic net model that employs a $\ell_r$-norm (where $r \geq 1$) in loss function to accommodate various types of noise, and employs a $\ell_q$-norm (where $0 &lt; q &lt; 1$) to replace the $\ell_1$-norm in elastic net penalty. Theoretically, we establish the computable lower bounds for the nonzero entries of the generalized first-order stationary points of the proposed generalized elastic net model. For implementation, we develop two efficient algorithms based on the locally Lipschitz continuous $\epsilon$-approximation to $\ell_q$-norm. The first algorithm employs an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), while the second utilizes a proximal majorization-minimization method (PMM), where the subproblems are addressed using the semismooth Newton method (SNN). We also perform extensive numerical experiments with both simulated and real data, showing that both algorithms demonstrate superior performance. Notably, the PMM-SSN is efficient than ADMM, even though the latter provides a simpler implementation.</description>

      <title>Dimension-independent rates for structured neural density estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that deep neural networks achieve dimension-independent rates of convergence for learning structured densities such as those arising in image, audio, video, and text applications. More precisely, we demonstrate that neural networks with a simple $L^2$-minimizing loss achieve a rate of $n^{-1/(4+r)}$ in nonparametric density estimation when the underlying density is Markov to a graph whose maximum clique size is at most $r$, and we provide evidence that in the aforementioned applications, this size is typically constant, i.e., $r=O(1)$. We then establish that the optimal rate in $L^1$ is $n^{-1/(2+r)}$ which, compared to the standard nonparametric rate of $n^{-1/(2+d)}$, reveals that the effective dimension of such problems is the size of the largest clique in the Markov random field. These rates are independent of the data's ambient dimension, making them applicable to realistic models of image, sound, video, and text data. Our results provide a novel justification for deep learning's ability to circumvent the curse of dimensionality, demonstrating dimension-independent convergence rates in these contexts.</description>

      <title>Joint Probability Estimation of Many Binary Outcomes via Localized Adversarial Lasso</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we consider estimating the probability of many (possibly dependent) binary outcomes which is at the core of many applications, e.g., multi-level treatments in causal inference, demands for bundle of products, etc. Without further conditions, the probability distribution of an M dimensional binary vector is characterized by exponentially in M coefficients which can lead to a high-dimensional problem even without the presence of covariates. Understanding the (in)dependence structure allows us to substantially improve the estimation as it allows for an effective factorization of the probability distribution. In order to estimate the probability distribution of a M dimensional binary vector, we leverage a Bahadur representation that connects the sparsity of its coefficients with independence across the components. We propose to use regularized and adversarial regularized estimators to obtain an adaptive estimator with respect to the dependence structure which allows for rates of convergence to depend on this intrinsic (lower) dimension. These estimators are needed to handle several challenges within this setting, including estimating nuisance parameters, estimating covariates, and nonseparable moment conditions. Our main results consider the presence of (low dimensional) covariates for which we propose a locally penalized estimator. We provide pointwise rates of convergence addressing several issues in the theoretical analyses as we strive for making a computationally tractable formulation. We apply our results in the estimation of causal effects with multiple binary treatments and show how our estimators can improve the finite sample performance when compared with non-adaptive estimators that try to estimate all the probabilities directly. We also provide simulations that are consistent with our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Huber-energy measure quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08162v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a measure quantization procedure i.e., an algorithm which finds the best approximation of a target probability law (and more generally signed finite variation measure) by a sum of $Q$ Dirac masses ($Q$ being the quantization parameter). The procedure is implemented by minimizing the statistical distance between the original measure and its quantized version; the distance is built from a negative definite kernel and, if necessary, can be computed on the fly and feed to a stochastic optimization algorithm (such as SGD, Adam, ...). We investigate theoretically the fundamental questions of existence of the optimal measure quantizer and identify what are the required kernel properties that guarantee suitable behavior. We propose two best linear unbiased (BLUE) estimators for the squared statistical distance and use them in an unbiased procedure, called HEMQ, to find the optimal quantization. We test HEMQ on several databases: multi-dimensional Gaussian mixtures, Wiener space cubature, Italian wine cultivars and the MNIST image database. The results indicate that the HEMQ algorithm is robust and versatile and, for the class of Huber-energy kernels, matches the expected intuitive behavior.</description>

      <title>Testing Convex Truncation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the basic statistical problem of testing whether normally distributed $n$-dimensional data has been truncated, i.e. altered by only retaining points that lie in some unknown truncation set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$. As our main algorithmic results,
  (1) We give a computationally efficient $O(n)$-sample algorithm that can distinguish the standard normal distribution $N(0,I_n)$ from $N(0,I_n)$ conditioned on an unknown and arbitrary convex set $S$.
  (2) We give a different computationally efficient $O(n)$-sample algorithm that can distinguish $N(0,I_n)$ from $N(0,I_n)$ conditioned on an unknown and arbitrary mixture of symmetric convex sets.
  These results stand in sharp contrast with known results for learning or testing convex bodies with respect to the normal distribution or learning convex-truncated normal distributions, where state-of-the-art algorithms require essentially $n^{\sqrt{n}}$ samples. An easy argument shows that no finite number of samples suffices to distinguish $N(0,I_n)$ from an unknown and arbitrary mixture of general (not necessarily symmetric) convex sets, so no common generalization of results (1) and (2) above is possible.
  We also prove that any algorithm (computationally efficient or otherwise) that can distinguish $N(0,I_n)$ from $N(0,I_n)$ conditioned on an unknown symmetric convex set must use $\Omega(n)$ samples. This shows that the sample complexity of each of our algorithms is optimal up to a constant factor.</description>

      <title>Rank-adaptive covariance testing with applications to genomics and neuroimaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In biomedical studies, testing for differences in covariance offers scientific insights beyond mean differences, especially when differences are driven by complex joint behavior between features. However, when differences in joint behavior are weakly dispersed across many dimensions and arise from differences in low-rank structures within the data, as is often the case in genomics and neuroimaging, existing two-sample covariance testing methods may suffer from power loss. The Ky-Fan(k) norm, defined by the sum of the top Ky-Fan(k) singular values, is a simple and intuitive matrix norm able to capture signals caused by differences in low-rank structures between matrices, but its statistical properties in hypothesis testing have not been studied well. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of the Ky-Fan(k) norm in two-sample covariance testing. Ultimately, we propose a novel methodology, Rank-Adaptive Covariance Testing (RACT), which is able to leverage differences in low-rank structures found in the covariance matrices of two groups in order to maximize power. RACT uses permutation for statistical inference, ensuring an exact Type I error control. We validate RACT in simulation studies and evaluate its performance when testing for differences in gene expression networks between two types of lung cancer, as well as testing for covariance heterogeneity in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data taken on two different scanner types.</description>

      <title>On estimation and order selection for multivariate extremes via clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the estimation of multivariate extreme models with a discrete spectral measure using spherical clustering techniques. The primary contribution involves devising a method for selecting the order, that is, the number of clusters. The method consistently identifies the true order, i.e., the number of spectral atoms, and enjoys intuitive implementation in practice. Specifically, we introduce an extra penalty term to the well-known simplified average silhouette width, which penalizes small cluster sizes and small dissimilarities between cluster centers. Consequently, we provide a consistent method for determining the order of a max-linear factor model, where a typical information-based approach is not viable. Our second contribution is a large-deviation-type analysis for estimating the discrete spectral measure through clustering methods, which serves as an assessment of the convergence quality of clustering-based estimation for multivariate extremes. Additionally, as a third contribution, we discuss how estimating the discrete measure can lead to parameter estimations of heavy-tailed factor models. We also present simulations and real-data studies that demonstrate order selection and factor model estimation.</description>

      <title>A Modified Satterthwaite (1941,1946) Effective Degrees of Freedom Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14606v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a correction to the approximation of effective degrees of freedom as proposed by Satterthwaite (1941, 1946), specifically addressing scenarios where component degrees of freedom are small. The correction is grounded in analytical results concerning the moments of standard normal random variables. This modification is applicable to complex variance estimates that involve both small and large degrees of freedom, offering an enhanced approximation of the higher moments required by Satterthwaite's framework. Additionally, this correction extends and partially validates the empirically derived adjustment by Johnson &amp; Rust (1992), as it is based on theoretical foundations rather than simulations used to derive empirical transformation constants.</description>
