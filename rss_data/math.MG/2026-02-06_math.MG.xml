      <title>Generalized Perfect Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize Voronoi's theory of perfect quadratic forms to generalized copositive matrices over a closed convex and full-dimensional cone K. We introduce a notion of a K-copositive minimum and of perfect K-copositive matrices. We consider a key feature of a given cone, which we call Interior Ryshkov (IR) property. Under this property the classical theory and its applications generalize nicely and we prove that rationally generated cones possess this IR property. For contrast, we give a detailed example of a simple cone without the IR property, showing various differences to the classical case. Moreover, this example yields connections to questions of number theory, in particular to Diophantine approximation and the Pell Equation. Finally, as an application, we give inner and outer polyhedral approximations for the generalized completely positive cone and a method to find rational certificates for (non-)membership in this cone.</description>

      <title>Regions surrounded by parabolas in the plane and trees representing their shapes respecting their natural projection to the line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The author has been interested in regions surrounded by real algebraic curves of degree $1$ or $2$ in the plane. The author is mainly interested in their shapes and combinatorics. This is a fundamental and natural problem in mathematics being also elementary and connected to various fields. The shapes are understood via graphs the regions collapsing to respecting the canonical projection onto the 1st component.
  Our main result is the following: each tree is realized by regions surrounded by parabolas of two types, here.
  Related studies are elementary and interesting and surprisingly, this explicit field is started very recently, by Bodin, Popescu-Pampu and Sorea in the 2020s. After that, this is developing, due to the author. The author also investigates this motivated by studies on explicit construction of real algebraic maps onto the regions locally so-called moment maps: this comes from singularity theory of differentiable maps and real algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>On the Resistance Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an affirmative answer to the resistance conjecture on characterization of parabolic Harnack inequalities in terms of volume doubling, upper capacity bounds and a Poincar\'e inequalities. The key step is to show that these three assumptions imply the so called cutoff Sobolev inequality, an important inequality in the study of anomalous diffusions, Dirichlet forms and re-scaled energies in fractals. This implication is shown in the general setting of $p$-Dirichlet Spaces introduced by the author and Murugan, and thus a unified treatment becomes possible to proving Harnack inequalities and stability phenomena in both analysis on metric spaces and fractals and for graphs and manifolds for all exponents $p\in (1,\infty)$. As an application, we also show that a Dirichlet space satisfying volume doubling, Poincar\'e and upper capacity bounds has finite martingale dimension and admits a type of differential structure similar to the work of Cheeger. In the course of the proof, we establish methods of extension and characterizations of Sobolev functions by Poincar\'e-inequalities, and extend the methods of Jones and Koskela to the general setting of $p$-Dirichlet spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the structure of Busemann spaces with measures satisfying the measure contraction property (MCP). The main results are rigidity theorems and structure theorems under the assumption of geodesic completeness or non-collapse. The appendix contains some observations on the tangent cones of geodesically complete Busemann spaces.</description>

      <title>Metric pairs and tuples in theory and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present theoretical properties of the space of metric pairs equipped with the Gromov--Hausdorff distance. First, we establish the classical metric separability and the geometric geodesicity of this space. Second, we prove an Arzel\`a--Ascoli-type theorem for metric pairs. Third, extending a result by Cassorla, we show that the set of pairs consisting of a $2$-dimensional compact Riemannian manifold and a $2$-dimensional submanifold with boundary that can be isometrically embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is dense in the space of compact metric pairs. Finally, to broaden the scope of potential applications, we describe scenarios where the Gromov--Hausdorff distance between metric pairs or tuples naturally arises.</description>

      <title>Geometry and Dress groups with non-symmetric cost functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A metric relation by definition is symmetric. Since many data sets are non-symmetric, in this paper we develop a systematic theory of non-symmetric cost functions. Betweenness relations play an important role. We also introduce the notion of a Dress group in the non-symmetric setting and indicate a notion of curvature.</description>

      <title>Continuous invariant-based asymmetries of periodic crystals quantify deviations from higher symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13746v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ideal symmetry is known to break down under almost any noise. One measure of asymmetry in a periodic crystal is the relative multiplicity Z' of geometrically non-equivalent units. However, Z' discontinuously changes under almost any displacement of atoms, which can arbitrarily scale up a primitive cell. This discontinuity was recently resolved by a hierarchy of invariant descriptors that continuously change under all small perturbations.
  We introduce a Continuous Invariant-based Asymmetry (CIA) to quantify (in physically meaningful Angstroms) the deviation of a periodic crystal from a higher symmetry form. Our experiments on several Crystal Structure Prediction datasets show that about a half of simulated crystals have high values of CIA, while all experimental structures in these datasets have CIA=0. On another hand, many crystals with high values Z' in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) turned out to be close to more symmetric forms with Z'&lt;=1 due to low values of CIAs.</description>

      <title>Exparabolas of a Triangle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among a triangle's exparabolas (parabolas escribed to the triangle), three are distinguished by having locally maximal parameter. They are determined by a simple cubic equation and characterized by having axes that contain the triangle's centroid. More generally, there are three (not necessarily real) exparabolas with axes through a given point $X$. Their focal points determine another triangle which we call the $X$-focal triangle. It shares the circumcircle with the original triangle and its orthocenter is $X$. The sequence of iterated focal triangles with respect to the centroids splits into an even and an odd sub-sequence that both converge to equilateral triangles.</description>

      <title>Cheeger inequalities on simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01069v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cheeger-type inequalities in which the decomposability of a graph and the spectral gap of its Laplacian mutually control each other play an important role in graph theory and network analysis, in particular in the context of expander theory. The natural problem to extend such inequalities to simplicial complexes and their higher order Eckmann Laplacians has been open for a long time. Before proving any inequality, however, one needs to identify the right Cheeger-type constant for which such an inequality can hold. Here, we solve this problem. Our solution involves and combines constructions from simplicial topology, signed graphs, Gromov filling radii and an interpolation between the standard 2-Laplacians and the analytically more difficult 1-Laplacians, for which, however, the inequalities become equalities. It is then natural to develop a general theory for $p$-Laplacians on simplicial complexes and investigate the related Cheeger-type inequalities.</description>
