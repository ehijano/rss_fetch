      <title>Modeling, Inference, and Prediction in Mobility-Based Compartmental Models for Epidemiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical compartmental models in epidemiology often struggle to accurately capture real-world dynamics due to their inability to address the inherent heterogeneity of populations. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that incorporates heterogeneity through a mobility variable, transforming the traditional ODE system into a system of integro-differential equations that describe the dynamics of population densities across different compartments. Our results show that, for the same basic reproduction number, our mobility-based model predicts a smaller final pandemic size compared to classic compartmental models, whose population densities are represented as Dirac delta functions in our density-based framework. This addresses the overestimation issue common in many classical models. Additionally, we demonstrate that the time series of the infected population is sufficient to uniquely identify the mobility distribution. We reconstruct this distribution using a machine-learning-based framework, providing both theoretical and algorithmic support to effectively constrain the mobility-based model with real-world data.</description>

      <title>Vegetation clustering and self-organization in inhomogeneous environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to climatic changes, excessive grazing, and deforestation, semi-arid and arid ecosystems are vulnerable to desertification and land degradation. Adversely affected biological productivity has a negative impact on social, economic, and environmental factors. The term 'arid ecosystems' refers not only to water-scarce landscapes but also to nutrient-poor environments. Specifically, the vegetation cover loses spatial homogeneity as aridity increases, and the self-organized heterogeneous vegetation patterns developed could eventually collapse into a bare state. It is still unclear whether this transition would be gradual or abrupt, leading to the often-called catastrophic shift of ecosystems. Several studies suggest that environmental inhomogeneities in time or space can promote a gradual transition to bare soil, thus avoiding catastrophic shifts. Environmental inhomogeneities include non-uniformities in the spatial distribution of precipitation, spatial irregularities in topography and other external factors. Employing a generic mathematical model including environmental inhomogeneities in space, we show how two branches of vegetation patterns create a hysteresis loop when the effective mortality level changes. These two branches correspond to qualitatively distinct vegetation self-organized responses. In an increasing mortality scenario, one observes an equilibrium branch of high vegetation biomass forming self-organized patterns with a well-defined wavelength. However, reversing the mortality trend, one observes a low biomass branch lacking a wavelength. We call this phenomenon the clustering of vegetation patches. This behavior can be connected to historically significant trends of climate change in arid ecosystems.</description>
