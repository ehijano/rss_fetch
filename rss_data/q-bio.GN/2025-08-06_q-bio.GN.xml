      <title>A Novel cVAE-Augmented Deep Learning Framework for Pan-Cancer RNA-Seq Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pan-cancer classification using transcriptomic (RNA-Seq) data can inform tumor subtyping and therapy selection, but is challenging due to extremely high dimensionality and limited sample sizes. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning framework that uses a class-conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE) to augment training data for pan-cancer gene expression classification. Using 801 tumor RNA-Seq samples spanning 5 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we first perform feature selection to reduce 20,531 gene expression features to the 500 most variably expressed genes. A cVAE is then trained on this data to learn a latent representation of gene expression conditioned on cancer type, enabling the generation of synthetic gene expression samples for each tumor class. We augment the training set with these cVAE-generated samples (doubling the dataset size) to mitigate overfitting and class imbalance. A two-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier is subsequently trained on the augmented dataset to predict tumor type. The augmented framework achieves high classification accuracy (~98%) on a held-out test set, substantially outperforming a classifier trained on the original data alone. We present detailed experimental results, including VAE training curves, classifier performance metrics (ROC curves and confusion matrix), and architecture diagrams to illustrate the approach. The results demonstrate that cVAE-based synthetic augmentation can significantly improve pan-cancer prediction performance, especially for underrepresented cancer classes.</description>

      <title>On the (In)Significance of Feature Selection in High-Dimensional Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensive research has been done on feature selection (FS) algorithms for high-dimensional datasets aiming to improve model performance, reduce computational cost and identify features of interest. We test the null hypothesis of using randomly selected features to compare against features selected by FS algorithms to validate the performance of the latter. Our results show that FS on high-dimensional datasets (in particular gene expression) in classification tasks is not useful. We find that (1) models trained on small subsets (0.02%-1% of all features) of randomly selected features almost always perform comparably to those trained on all features, and (2) a "typical"- sized random subset provides comparable or superior performance to that of top-k features selected in various published studies. Thus, our work challenges many feature selection results on high dimensional datasets, particularly in computational genomics. It raises serious concerns about studies that propose drug design or targeted interventions based on computationally selected genes, without further validation in a wet lab.</description>
