      <title>One-point functions for doubly-holographic BCFTs and backreacting defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive one-point functions in 4d $\mathcal N=4$ SYM with $\tfrac{1}{2}$-BPS boundaries, defects and interfaces which host large numbers of defect degrees of freedom. The theories are engineered by Gaiotto-Witten D3/D5/NS5 brane setups with large numbers of D5 and NS5 branes, and have holographic duals with fully backreacted 5-branes. They include BCFTs with 3d SCFTs on the boundary which allow for the notion of double holography, as well as D3/D5 defects and interfaces with large numbers of D5-branes. Through a combination of supersymmetric localization and holography we derive one-point functions for 4d chiral primary operators.</description>

      <title>Relating flat connections and polylogarithms on higher genus Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we relate two recent constructions that generalize classical (genus-zero) polylogarithms to higher-genus Riemann surfaces. A flat connection valued in a freely generated Lie algebra on a punctured Riemann surface of arbitrary genus produces an infinite family of homotopy-invariant iterated integrals associated to all possible words in the alphabet of the Lie algebra generators. Each iterated integral associated to a word is a higher-genus polylogarithm. Different flat connections taking values in the same Lie algebra on a given Riemann surface may be related to one another by the composition of a gauge transformation and an automorphism of the Lie algebra, thus producing closely related families of polylogarithms. In this paper we provide two methods to explicitly construct this correspondence between the meromorphic multiple-valued connection introduced by Enriquez in e-Print 1112.0864 and the non-meromorphic single-valued and modular-invariant connection introduced by D'Hoker, Hidding and Schlotterer, in e-Print 2306.08644.</description>

      <title>Primordial Non-Gaussianity from Light Compact Scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the non-Gaussianities generated by light axions, or compact scalar fields, during inflation. To correctly calculate their impact on primordial statistics, we will argue that it is necessary to account for the periodicity, or gauge symmetry, of the compact scalars. We illustrate this point by comparing the predictions for the squeezed kinematic limit of the primordial bispectrum generated by two cases: a non-compact scalar $\sigma$ and a compact scalar $\varphi$. We demonstrate that while a light non-compact scalar predicts a bispectrum of the so-called local shape, the light compact scalar predicts a qualitatively different shape characterised by the ratio of the Hubble scale to its field-space circumference. In doing so, we show that ignoring the gauge symmetry of the compact scalar during inflation leads to spurious infrared enhancements which are softened by working with appropriate gauge-invariant operators. In addition, we connect our results for the primordial bispectrum with late-time cosmological observables and show that it is possible to measure the decay constant of the compact scalar using galaxy clustering measurements.</description>

      <title>Self-similar inverse cascade from generalized symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of generalized symmetries in driving non-equilibrium and non-linear phenomena, specifically focusing on turbulent systems. While conventional turbulence studies have revealed inverse cascades driven by conserved quantities integrated over the entire space, such as helicity in three spatial dimensions, the influence of higher-form symmetries, whose conserved charges are defined by integration over subspaces, remains largely unexplored. We demonstrate a novel mechanism where higher-form symmetries naturally induce a self-similar inverse cascade. Taking axion electrodynamics with non-linear topological interaction as a paradigmatic example, we show that the conserved charge associated with its 1-form symmetry drives the system toward large-scale coherent structures through a universal scaling behavior characterized by analytically determined scaling exponents. Our findings suggest that higher-form symmetries can provide a fundamental organizing principle for understanding non-equilibrium phenomena and the emergence of coherent structures in turbulent systems.</description>

      <title>SymSETs and self-dualities under gauging non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-duality defects under discrete gauging in a categorical symmetry $\mathcal{C}$ can be classified by inequivalent ways of enriching the bulk SymTFT of $\mathcal{C}$ with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ 0-form symmetry. The resulting Symmetry Enriched Topological (SET) orders will be referred to as $\textit{SymSETs}$ and are parameterized by choices of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries, as well as symmetry fractionalization classes and discrete torsions. In this work, we consider self-dualities under gauging $\textit{non-invertible}$ $0$-form symmetries in $2$-dim QFTs and explore their SymSETs. Unlike the simpler case of self-dualities under gauging finite Abelian groups, the SymSETs here generally admit multiple choices of fractionalization classes. We provide a direct construction of the SymSET from a given duality defect using its $\textit{relative center}$. Using the SymSET, we show explicitly that changing fractionalization classes can change fusion rules of the duality defect besides its $F$-symbols. We consider three concrete examples: the maximal gauging of $\operatorname{Rep} H_8$, the non-maximal gauging of the duality defect $\mathcal{N}$ in $\operatorname{Rep} H_8$ and $\operatorname{Rep} D_8$ respectively. The latter two cases each result in 6 fusion categories with two types of fusion rules related by changing fractionalization class. In particular, two self-dualities of $\operatorname{Rep} D_8$ related by changing the fractionalization class lead to $\operatorname{Rep} D_{16}$ and $\operatorname{Rep} SD_{16}$ respectively. Finally, we study the physical implications such as the spin selection rules and the SPT phases for the aforementioned categories.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the physics of the spatially random coupling between a Fermi surface and a vector bosonic field in the presence of the magnetic field. We evaluated the propagators of the fermion and vector as well as the self energy and polarization and their dependence on the magnetic field. We also evaluated the temperature dependence of the Hall angle, no strange-metal behaviour is obtained, but the linear-$T$ resistivity is preserved under the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Exotic massive fermionic systems with huge vacuum degeneracy at boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a massive non-relativistic fermionic system exhibiting exotic features. When the mass parameter is set to zero, the system acquires the fermionic subsystem symmetry. Introducing the mass term explicitly breaks this symmetry, resulting in a trivially gapped system in the absence of boundaries. We demonstrate that with the introduction of boundaries, the system remains gapped, but it has a huge vacuum degeneracy. The residual entropy is proportional to the area of the boundary.</description>

      <title>Instanton Corrections to the MSTB Kink Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Montonen-Sarker-Trullinger-Bishop (MSTB) model enjoys two classically degenerate kink solutions in the same topological sector. We construct the instanton that interpolates between them and argue that the two lowest lying Hamiltonian eigenstates in the kink sector of the corresponding quantum theory correspond to symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of coherent states localized at these two solutions. We use the instanton gas approximation to provide a simple, analytic formula for the leading contribution to the mass splitting between these two states.</description>

      <title>Emission of $W$ bosons by electrons and decays of $W$ bosons in the early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the transition rates for the decay of $W^{\pm}$ bosons into leptons in de Sitter spacetime. From the results obtained in the de Sitter geometry we recover the Minkowski limits of the transition rates. We also study the emission of $W^{\pm}$ bosons by leptons, a process which is possible only in the large expansion conditions of the early universe. These results are obtainable due to perturbative methods which allow us to compute the transition amplitudes in the first order of perturbation theory. The resulting probabilities and rates depend on the particle masses and the Hubble parameter. In order to establish finite expressions for the probabilities and transition rates, we make use of dimensional regularization and the minimal substraction method.</description>

      <title>Mixed State Entanglement Entropy in CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How to calculate the entanglement entropy between two subsystems for a mixed state has remained an important problem. In this paper, we provide a straightforward method, namely the subtraction approach, to solve this problem for generic covariant bipartite mixed states, where time dependence is explicitly included. We further demonstrate that the mixed state entanglement entropy $S_\text{vN}$ can be calculated in a more abstract yet powerful way. Within the context of the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ and AdS$_5$/CFT$_4$ correspondences, we show that $S_\text{vN}$ exactly matches the corresponding entanglement wedge cross section in the AdS bulk, respectively.</description>

      <title>Background subtraction method is as applicable as convariant counterterm method, but much simpler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the criterion for the applicability of the background subtraction method, not only the finiteness condition of the resulting Hamiltonian but also the condition for the validity of the first law of black hole thermodynamics can be reduced to the form amenable to analysis at infinity. With this, we further show that the background subtraction method is applicable not only to Einstein's gravity, but also to its higher derivative corrections for black holes in both asympotically flat and AdS spacetimes. This thus corrects the everlasting bias that the background subtraction method is rather restrictive compared to the alternative covariant counterterm method since it was proposed around 50 years ago. As a bonus, we also obtain the corresponding expression of the Gibbs free energy in terms of the Euclidean on-shell action. This can be regarded as the first proof of such a relation, which has been assumed to be also valid beyond Einstein's gravity without derivation before.</description>

      <title>EFT &amp; Species Scale: Friends or foes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently the notion that quantum gravity effects could manifest at scales much lower than the Planck scale has seen an intense Swamplandish revival. Dozens of works have explored how the so-called species scale -- at which an effective description of gravity must break down -- relates to String Theory and the Swampland conjectures. In particular, the interplay between this scale and the abundant towers of states becoming lighter in asymptotic regions of moduli spaces has proved to be key in understanding the real scale of quantum gravity. Nevertheless concerns have been raised regarding the validity of using infinite towers of states when estimating this scale within Effective Field Theory and, more precisely, the consistency of cutting the tower part way through in a framework that relies on a clear separation of scales. In this work we take an EFT point-of-view and provide a detailed perturbative derivation of the species scale -- by computing the 1-loop graviton propagator in the presence of many fields -- thereby clarifying common sources of confusion in the literature. Not only do we clarify the setup, assumptions and regimes of validity of the result, but more importantly apply the same methods to an infinite tower of states. We show how each state in the tower contributes to the species scale and how the procedure of counting only ''light fields'' can be compatible with not cutting the tower, thereby maintaining the harmony between infinite towers and EFTs even in the context of the species scale.</description>

      <title>Soliton Resonances in Four Dimensional Wess-Zumino-Witten Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two kinds of resonance soliton solutions on the Ultrahyperbolic space $\mathbb{U}$ for the G=U(2) Yang equation which is equivalent to the anti-self-dual Yang-Mills (ASDYM) equation. We reveal and illustrate the solitonic behaviors in four-dimensional Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW$_4$) model through the sigma model action densities. The WZW$_4$ model on $\mathbb{U}$ describes a string field theory action of open N=2 string theories and hence our solutions suggest the existence of the corresponding classical objects in the N=2 string theories. Our solutions include multiple-pole solutions and V-shape soliton solutions. The V-shape solitons suggest annihilation and creation process of two solitons and would be building blocks to classify the ASDYM solitons, like the role of Y-shape solitons in classification of the KP (line) solitons.
  We also clarify the relationship between the Cauchy matrix approach and the binary Darboux transformation in terms of quasideterminants. Our formalism can start with a simpler input data for the soliton solutions and hence might give a suitable framework of the classification of the ASDYM solitons.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Corrected Hawking Radiation from Near-Extremal Kerr-Newman Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-extremal black holes have a long AdS$_2$ throat in their near-horizon region. Quantum fluctuations in the throat region are effectively governed by a quantum version of Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity with matter and are strongly coupled at low temperatures. We investigate how these quantum fluctuations affect the spectrum of emission of particles during Hawking radiation. We systematically consider the cases of Kerr and Kerr-Newman black holes for emission of scalar particles and discuss photon and graviton emission from the Kerr background. We find that at very low temperatures the quantum fluctuations radically change the nature of particle emission. Unlike the generic suppression of particle emission in the spherically symmetric Reissner-Nordstr\"om case, we uncover that for particles with non-vanishing angular momentum, the quantum-corrected emission can be substantially enhanced with respect to the standard semiclassical result.</description>

      <title>Fluctuating Ensemble Averages and the BTZ Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work shows fascinating links between ensemble averaging and the Swampland program. In order to break the emerging global symmetries of the ensemble averaging as dictated by the no global symmetries conjecture, one may consider fluctuations away from the average given by deviations in the Siegel-Weil formula. In this work, we investigate the physical interpretation of these fluctuations in the bulk physics and pinpoint the states giving rise to them. For this purpose, we explore an ensemble of generalised Narain CFTs and build the AdS$_{3}$ gravitational dual in the Chern-Simons (CS) framework. We study the associated charged BTZ black hole solution and assess its stability. Using the Swampland weak gravity conjecture, we show that the fluctuations of the ensemble average are below the BTZ threshold and correspond to a sublattice of superextremal states emitted by the black hole. We exploit the logarithmic density of states to derive bounds on the charged vectors of the abelian CS symmetry and introduce a novel formulation of the density function to ensure consistency with the sublattice WGC. We establish bounds that allows to distinguish heavy states contributing to the average from light states generating fluctuations around it.</description>

      <title>Generalized entropy of gravitational fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The corrections to holographic entanglement entropy from bulk quantum fields in a classical gravitational background are now well understood. They lead, in particular, to unitary Page curves for evaporating black holes. However, the correct treatment of quantum fluctuations of the metric, including graviton excitations, is a longstanding problem. We provide a gauge-invariant prescription for the generalized entropy of gravitons in anti-de Sitter space in terms of areas and bulk entanglement entropy, generalizing the quantum extremal surface prescription to accommodate fluctuations in the semiclassical spacetime geometry. This task requires a careful treatment of the area operator on the graviton Hilbert space and the definition of a "quantum extremal gauge" in which the extremal surface is unperturbed. It also requires us to determine the correct vacuum modular Hamiltonian for the graviton field, which we fix by requiring that it doesn't contain a boundary term in extremal gauge. We check our prescription with an explicit computation of the vacuum-subtracted generalized entropy of states containing a graviton in an AdS-Rindler background. Our results exactly match vacuum-subtracted von Neumann entropies for stress-tensor excited states in holographic conformal field theory with $d&gt;2$ dimensions. We also use covariant phase space techniques to give a partial proof of our prescription when the entanglement wedge for the background spacetime has a bifurcate Killing horizon. Along the way, we identify a class of perturbative graviton states that have parametrically larger generalized entropy, in the small $G_N$ expansion, than any low-energy excitations of an ordinary quantum field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A compilation of new results on the asymptotic behaviour of the Humbert functions $\Psi_1$ and $\Psi_2$, and also on the Appell function $F_2$, is presented. As a by-product, we confirm a conjectured limit which appeared recently in the study of the $1D$ Glauber-Ising model. We also propose two elementary asymptotic methods and confirm through some illustrative examples that both methods have great potential and can be applied to a large class of problems of asymptotic analysis. Finally, some directions of future research are pointed out in order to suggest ideas for further study.</description>

      <title>The weak equivalence principle and the Dirac constant: a result from the holographic principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, based on a recent formularization of the holographic principle proposed and investigated by the present author, we show that the weak equivalence principle in general relativity is equivalent to the equivalence between two forms of the Dirac constant, that is, the action of the spin degree of freedom in the two-dimensional Hilbert space and the lower bound in the quantum mechanical uncertainty relations. This result follows from an equation between the Euclidean and Lorentzian world-line actions of a massive particle divided by the Dirac constant, via the Wick rotation, by using the Euclidean and Lorentzian actions of a holographic tensor network, whose quantum state is classicalized by introducing the superselection rule.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we generalize the cloud of strings model originally introduced by Letelier~\cite{Letelier:1979ej} by incorporating a \textit{magnetic-like component}, $\Sigma_{23}$, alongside the \textit{electric-like component}, $\Sigma_{01}$, considered in the original model. This extension yields a uniquely determined stress-energy tensor of the form $\mathrm{diag}(\rho, -\rho, p, p)$, governed by a specific equation of state and parameterized by two constants. The resulting black hole solution exhibits significant modifications, including the presence of \textit{two independent hairs}, distinguishing it from classical no-hair solutions. We analyze the thermodynamic properties of this black hole and demonstrate the existence of a \textit{remnant mass} and finite entropy at the end of the Hawking evaporation process, suggesting a stable end-state. Furthermore, the presence of \textit{two hairs} introduces new features that could influence black hole shadows and gravitational wave signals, offering valuable observational signatures for testing these exotic configurations.</description>

      <title>Relativistic correction to the magnetic moment of the charged lepton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The general Hamiltonian expression up to the first-order relativistic correction was derived by breaking the four-component Dirac equation into the two-component Dirac-Pauli equation. This Hamiltonian incorporates the first-order relativistic correction to the electromagnetic interaction with the spin and orbital magnetic moments of the charged lepton, which distinguishes it differently from other generic Hamiltonians. The first-order relativistic adjustment to the Land\'e g factor, or equivalently to the magnetic moment, was calculated using this generalized Hamiltonian for hydrogen-like atoms in the presence of an external magnetic field. It turns out that when we impose specific states, the formulations produced in the literature match this relativistic correction. Furthermore, we have shown that the relativistic effect-induced energy shift of order $\alpha^2$ is dependent on the square of azimuthal quantum number $m_j^2$, as well as on both principal and total quantum numbers denoted, respectively, by $n$ and $j$, which is different from the case of absence of an external magnetic field where the energy shift depends only on $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae (SNe) provide a unique environment to study Feebly Interacting Particles (FIPs) such as Axion-Like Particles (ALPs), sterile neutrinos, and Dark Photons (DPs). This paper focuses on heavy FIPs produced in SNe, whose decay produces electrons and positrons, generating observable secondary signals during their propagation and annihilation. We focus on the In-flight Annihilation (IA) of positrons, which emerge as the most significant contribution to the resulting gamma-ray spectrum. Using data from COMPTEL and EGRET we derive the most stringent bounds on the FIP-electron couplings for heavy ALPs, sterile neutrinos, and DPs. These results strenghten existing bounds of one or two orders of magnitude, depending on the FIP model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to serve as an introductory resource for disseminating the concept to individuals with interests in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) for hadrons. We discuss several topological aspects of the QCD vacuum and briefly review recent progress on this intuitive unifying framework for the lowlying hadron physics rooted in QCD by introducing the vacuum as a liquid of instantons and anti-instantons. We develop systematic density expansion on the dilute vacuum with diagrammatical Feynman rules to calculate the vacuum expectation values and generalize the calculations to hadronic matrix element (charges), and hadronic form factors using the instanton liquid (IL) ensemble. The IL ensemble prediction are well-consistent with those of recent lattice QCD calculations.</description>

      <title>Covariant analysis of electromagnetic current on the light cone: exposition with scalar Yukawa theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first systematic investigation of the Lorentz covariance of the charge form factor for a strongly coupled scalar theory in (3+1)-dimensions. Our results are based on the non-perturbative solution of the scalar Yukawa theory with a Fock sector expansion including up to thee-particles (one mock nucleon plus two mock pions or two mock nucleons plus one mock anti-nucleon). The light-front Hamiltonian is constructed and renormalized using a Fock sector dependent scheme. The derived eigenvalue equation is then solved non-perturbatively to obtain the wave functions, which are then used to compute the current matrix element.
  We perform a covariant analysis of the current matrix element taking into account possible violation of the Poincar\'e symmetry due to the Fock sector truncation. The physical form factor depends on two boost invariants $\zeta, \Delta^2_\perp$, instead of the single Lorentz invariant $Q^2$. Instead of adopting the conventional Drell-Yan frame $\zeta = 0$, we evaluate the form factor in general frames, and use the frame dependence to quantitatively gauge the loss of the Lorentz covariance. Our numerical result shows that as more Fock sectors are included, the frame dependence reduces dramatically. In particular, the anti-nucleon degree of freedom plays an important role in the reduction of the frame dependence, even though it only takes a small portion within the state vector. We also find that there is no zero-mode contribution to the current for the scalar Yukawa theory.</description>

      <title>Tidal Love Numbers of Neutron Stars in Horndeski Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision measurements of the gravitational wave signal from compact binary inspirals allow us to constrain the internal structure of those objects via physical parameters such as the tidal Love numbers. In scalar-tensor theories, one typically finds new types of Love numbers that are usually not considered or simply absent in General Relativity, which further allows us to constrain deviations from General Relativity. Building upon previous results, we present the linear perturbation equations necessary to calculate static and even-parity tidal Love numbers in Horndeski theories, the most general scalar-tensor theories with second-order field equations of motion. We further focus on the quadrupolar Love numbers and demonstrate how these can be extracted from the asymptotic expansion of the perturbation fields. We find that there is a potential ambiguity in extracting the Love numbers in this way, which we resolve by performing supplementary calculations in the effective field theory framework. We show that, in the case of scalar-tensor theories, the tidal Love numbers are not directly given by the $1/r^3$ term in the asymptotic expansion of the perturbation fields, as there is an additional contribution to this term independent of the Love numbers. We calculate such a contribution for a minimally coupled scalar field and also for the Damour-Esposito-Far\`ese model. For the latter, we find that the Love numbers can differ by $\mathcal{O}(1 \sim 10)\,\%$, if this additional contribution is not taken into account.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The amplituhedron is a semialgebraic set given as the image of the non-negative Grassmannian under a linear map subject to a choice of additional parameters. We define the limit amplituhedron as the limit of amplituhedra by sending one of the parameters, namely the number of particles $n$, to infinity. We study this limit amplituhedron for $m = 2$ and any $k$, relating to the number of negative helcity particles. We determine its algebraic boundary in terms of Chow hypersurfaces. This hypersurface in the Grassmannian is stratified by singularities in terms of higher order secants of the rational normal curve. In conclusion, we show that the limit amplituhedron is a positive geometry with a residual arrangement that is empty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of Chern-Simons gravity, a theory that dynamically violates parity, we analyze the power spectrum of gravitational waves in light of the damping effect due to the free streaming relativistic neutrinos and dark fermions. The power spectrum is expressed terms of right- and left-handed polarizations, and the evolution of the gravitational waves is studied numerically. Birefringence is explicitly shown in the power spectrum, though the difference in the amplitudes is small. Specific features of peaks and dips appear gravitational wave power spectrum mirroring chiral gravitational wave mediated parametric resonance during reheating. Our result represents a useful tool to test Chern-Simons gravity and enables to constrain mechanisms of inflation and reheating related to this theory. We predict a falsifiable pattern of observable peaks and dips in the chiral independent gravitational power spectrum, eventually observable in next space-borne gravitational interferometers, including LISA, Taiji and Tianqin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2004.14466v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supersymmetric D-branes supported on the complex two-dimensional base $S$ of the local Calabi-Yau threefold $K_S$ are described by semi-stable coherent sheaves on $S$. Under suitable conditions, the BPS indices counting these objects (known as generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariants) coincide with the Vafa-Witten invariants of $S$ (which encode the Betti numbers of the moduli space of semi-stable sheaves). For surfaces which admit a strong collection of exceptional sheaves, we develop a general method for computing these invariants by exploiting the isomorphism between the derived category of coherent sheaves and the derived category of representations of a suitable quiver with potential $(Q,W)$ constructed from the exceptional collection. We spell out the dictionary between the Chern class $\gamma$ and polarization $J$ on $S$ vs. the dimension vector $\vec N$ and stability parameters $\vec\zeta$ on the quiver side. For all examples that we consider, which include all del Pezzo and Hirzebruch surfaces, we find that the BPS indices $\Omega_\star(\gamma)$ at the attractor point (or self-stability condition) vanish, except for dimension vectors corresponding to simple representations and pure D0-branes. This opens up the possibility to compute the BPS indices in any chamber using either the flow tree or the Coulomb branch formula. In all cases we find precise agreement with independent computations of Vafa-Witten invariants based on wall-crossing and blow-up formulae. This agreement suggests that i) generating functions of DT invariants for a large class of quivers coming from strong exceptional collections are mock modular functions of higher depth and ii) non-trivial single-centered black holes and scaling solutions do not exist quantum mechanically in such local Calabi-Yau geometries.</description>

Abstract: A new approach is presented to compute entropy for massless scalar quantum fields. By perturbing a skewed correlation matrix composed of field operator correlation functions, the mutual information is obtained for disjoint spherical regions of size $r$ at separation $R$, including an expansion to all orders in $r/R$. This approach also permits a perturbative expansion for the thermal field entropy difference in the small temperature limit ($T \ll 1/r$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the framework of noncommutative (NC) deformation of gauge field theory by the angular twist, we first rederive the NC scalar and gauge field model from our previous papers and then generalize it to the second order in the Seiberg-Witten (SW) map. It turns out that SW expansion is finite and that it ceases at the second order in the deformation parameter, ultimately giving rise to the equation of motion for the scalar field in Reissner--Nordstr\"om (RN) metric that is nonperturbative and exact at the same order. As a further step, we show that the effective metric put forth and constructed in our previous work satisfies the equations of Einstein-Maxwell gravity, but only within the first order of deformation and when the gauge field is fixed by the Coulomb potential of the charged black hole. Thus obtained NC deformation of the Reissner--Nordstr\"om (RN) metric appears to have an additional off-diagonal element which scales linearly with a deformation parameter. We analyze various properties of this metric.</description>

Abstract: Given a homomorphism $\tau$ from a suitable finite group $\mathsf{\Gamma}$ to $\mathsf{SU}(4)$ with image $\mathsf{\Gamma}^\tau$, we construct a cohomological gauge theory on a noncommutative resolution of the quotient singularity $\mathbb{C}^4/\mathsf{\Gamma}^\tau$ whose BRST fixed points are $\mathsf{\Gamma}$-invariant tetrahedron instantons on a generally non-effective orbifold. The partition function computes the expectation values of complex codimension one defect operators in rank $r$ cohomological Donaldson-Thomas theory on a flat gerbe over the quotient stack $[\mathbb{C}^4/\,\mathsf{\Gamma}^\tau]$. We describe the generalized ADHM parametrization of the tetrahedron instanton moduli space, and evaluate the orbifold partition functions through virtual torus localization. If $\mathsf{\Gamma}$ is an abelian group the partition function is expressed as a combinatorial series over arrays of $\mathsf{\Gamma}$-coloured plane partitions, while if $\mathsf{\Gamma}$ is non-abelian the partition function localizes onto a sum over torus-invariant connected components of the moduli space labelled by lower-dimensional partitions. When $\mathsf{\Gamma}=\mathbb{Z}_n$ is a finite abelian subgroup of $\mathsf{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$, we exhibit the reduction of Donaldson-Thomas theory on the toric Calabi-Yau four-orbifold $\mathbb{C}^2/\,\mathsf{\Gamma}\times\mathbb{C}^2$ to the cohomological field theory of tetrahedron instantons, from which we express the partition function as a closed infinite product formula. We also use the crepant resolution correpondence to derive a closed formula for the partition function on any polyhedral singularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work considers a variation of the massive ambitwistor string model presented in arXiv:2301.11227 that describes supergravity and super-Yang-Mills on the Coulomb branch simultaneously with a single Lagrangian. All-multiplicity tree and one-loop amplitudes are evaluated and shown to have proper unitary factorization. The massless limit provides Einstein Yang-Mills Amplitudes including multiple gluon traces. It is argued that the cosmological constant vanishes at all orders of perturbation theory. As application, results for Compton scattering are obtained and compared with ones in the literature.</description>

      <title>On universal splittings of tree-level particle and string scattering amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the newly discovered universal splitting behavior for tree-level scattering amplitudes of particles and strings~\cite{Cao:2024gln}: when a set of Mandelstam variables (and Lorentz products involving polarizations for gluons/gravitons) vanish, the $n$-point amplitude factorizes as the product of two lower-point currents with $n{+}3$ external legs in total. We refer to any such subspace of the kinematic space of $n$ massless momenta as "2-split kinematics", where the scattering potential for string amplitudes and the corresponding scattering equations for particle amplitudes nicely split into two parts. Based on these, we provide a systematic and detailed study of the splitting behavior for essentially all ingredients which appear as integrands for open- and closed-string amplitudes as well as Cachazo-He-Yuan (CHY) formulas, including Parke-Taylor factors, correlators in superstring and bosonic string theories, and CHY integrands for a variety of amplitudes of scalars, gluons and gravitons. These results then immediately lead to the splitting behavior of string and particle amplitudes in a wide range of theories, including bi-adjoint $\phi^3$ (with string extension known as $Z$ and $J$ integrals), non-linear sigma model, Dirac-Born-Infeld, the special Galileon, etc., as well as Yang-Mills and Einstein gravity (with bosonic and superstring extensions). Our results imply and extend some other factorization behavior of tree amplitudes considered recently, including smooth splittings~\cite{Cachazo:2021wsz} and factorizations near zeros~\cite{Arkani-Hamed:2023swr}, to all these theories. A special case of splitting also yields soft theorems for gluons/gravitons as well as analogous soft behavior for Goldstone particles near their Adler zeros.</description>

      <title>A non-local way around the no-global-symmetries conjecture in quantum gravity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The no-global-symmetries conjecture is central to the swampland program that delineates the boundary between effective field theories that can be obtained from a quantum theory of gravity to those that cannot. The conjecture states that virtual black-hole configurations in the path integral generate terms that violate all global symmetries in the effective action for matter. Because of its central role, it is crucial to understand limitations to the validity of this conjecture. In the context of the Lorentzian path integral over spacetime geometries, we explore whether virtual black-hole configurations can be suppressed dynamically. To that end, we work in a spherically symmetric setting and make use of horizon-detecting curvature invariants which vanish on the horizon. By constructing a non-local gravitational action from the inverse of such curvature invariants, we can achieve destructive interference of black-hole configurations in the path integral. Given that non-local gravitational actions appear generically as the result of integrating out matter degrees of freedom from a theory for quantum gravity and matter, our exemplary construction reinforces discussions about the role of non-locality in assessing arguably universal properties of quantum gravity within the framework of path integrals.</description>

      <title>Gravity from Pre-geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational interaction, as described by the Einstein-Cartan theory, is shown to emerge as the by-product of the spontaneous symmetry breaking of a gauge symmetry in a pre-geometric four-dimensional spacetime. Starting from a formulation \`a la Yang-Mills on an SO(1,4) or SO(3,2) principal bundle and not accounting for a spacetime metric, the Einstein-Hilbert action is recovered after the identification of the effective spacetime metric and spin connection for the residual SO(1,3) gauge symmetry of the spontaneously broken phase - i.e. the stabiliser of the SO(1,4) or SO(3,2) gauge group. Thus, the two fundamental tenets of General Relativity, i.e. diffeomorphism invariance and the equivalence principle, can arise from a more fundamental gauge principle. The two mass parameters that characterise Einstein gravity, namely the Planck mass and the cosmological constant, are likewise shown to be emergent, with the correct sign for the cosmological constant depending on whether the fundamental gauge group is taken to be either the de Sitter or the anti-de Sitter group. The phase transition from the unbroken to the spontaneously broken phase is expected to happen close to the Planck temperature. This is conjectured to be dynamically driven by a scalar field that implements a Higgs mechanism, hence providing mass to new particles, with consequences for cosmology and high-energy physics. The couplings of gravity to matter are discussed after drawing up a dictionary that interconnects pre-geometric and effective geometric quantities. In the unbroken phase where the fundamental gauge symmetry is restored, the theory is potentially power-counting renormalisable without matter, offering a novel path towards a UV completion of Einstein gravity.</description>

      <title>Timelike-bounded $dS_4$ holography from a solvable sector of the $T^2$ deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08709v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research has leveraged the tractability of $T\bar T$ style deformations to formulate timelike-bounded patches of three-dimensional bulk spacetimes including $dS_3$. This proceeds by breaking the problem into two parts: a solvable theory that captures the most entropic energy bands, and a tuning algorithm to treat additional effects and fine structure. We point out that the method extends readily to higher dimensions, and does not require factorization of the full $T^2$ operator (the higher dimensional analogue of $T\bar T$ defined in [1]). Focusing on $dS_4$, we first define a solvable theory at finite $N$ via a restricted $T^2$ deformation of the $CFT_3$ on ${S}^2\times \mathbb{R}$, in which $T$ is replaced by the form it would take in symmetric homogeneous states, containing only diagonal energy density $E/V$ and pressure (-$dE/dV$) components. This defines a finite-N solvable sector of $dS_4/\text{deformed-CFT}_3$, capturing the radial geometry and count of the entropically dominant energy band, reproducing the Gibbons-Hawking entropy as a state count. To accurately capture local bulk excitations of $dS_4$ including gravitons, we build a deformation algorithm in direct analogy to the case of $dS_3$ with bulk matter recently proposed in [2]. This starts with an infinitesimal stint of the solvable deformation as a regulator. The full microscopic theory is built by adding renormalized versions of $T^2$ and other operators at each step, defined by matching to bulk local calculations when they apply, including an uplift from $AdS_4/CFT_3$ to $dS_4$ (as is available in hyperbolic compactifications of M theory). The details of the bulk-local algorithm depend on the choice of boundary conditions; we summarize the status of these in GR and beyond, illustrating our method for the case of the cylindrical Dirichlet condition which can be UV completed by our finite quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Quantized axial charge of staggered fermions and the chiral anomaly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12220v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the 1+1D ultra-local lattice Hamiltonian for staggered fermions with a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, there are two conserved, integer-valued charges that flow in the continuum limit to the vector and axial charges of a massless Dirac fermion with a perturbative anomaly. Each of the two lattice charges generates an ordinary U(1) global symmetry that acts locally on operators and can be gauged individually. Interestingly, they do not commute on a finite lattice and generate the Onsager algebra, but their commutator goes to zero in the continuum limit. The chiral anomaly is matched by this non-abelian algebra, which is consistent with the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. We further prove that the presence of these two conserved lattice charges forces the low-energy phase to be gapless, reminiscent of the consequence from perturbative anomalies of continuous global symmetries in continuum field theory. Upon bosonization, these two charges lead to two exact U(1) symmetries in the XX model that flow to the momentum and winding symmetries in the free boson conformal field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Hilbert space factorisation problem of two-sided black holes in high dimensions. We demonstrate that the Hilbert space of two-sided black holes can be factorized into the tensor product of two one-sided bulk Hilbert spaces when the effect of non-perturbative replica wormholes is taken into account. We further interpret the one-sided bulk Hilbert space as the Hilbert space of a one-sided black hole. Therefore, since the Hilbert space of a two-sided black hole can be obtained from the tensor product of two single-sided black hole Hilbert spaces, we consider this as an embodiment of the ER=EPR conjecture, and we show when the entanglement between the two single-sided black holes is sufficiently strong, the (Lorentzian) geometry of a two-sided black hole will emerge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I show that at early times the evaporation process for a stack of NS5-branes at high energy is suppressed in the large-N limit. At much later times, the new saddles in the gravitational action are no longer suppressed at large-N, and evaporation proceeds as usual. This effect is due to the non-invariance of the metric under coordinate parameterisation. This fact introduces a parametric dependence in the thermodynamic quantities, which can lead to quantities that are suppressed in a particular corner of the parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze causality and unitarity constraints in graviton scattering amplitudes, aiming to establish new bounds on theories with $U(1)$-gravitational anomalies, such as axion models or strongly-coupled gauge theories. For this purpose, we show the necessity of coupling these theories to gravity. We obtain a universal scale $\Lambda_{\rm caus}$ at which states with $J\geq 4$ must appear in the theory. We show that this scale can lie below the quantum gravity scale. For axion models, we get $\Lambda_{\rm caus}\sim\sqrt{M_P f_a}$ where $f_a$ is the axion decay constant. In strongly-coupled gauge theories in the large-$N_c$ limit, the presence of glueballs allows to evade these bounds, provided the number of fermions $N_F\ll N_c$ and the 'tHooft coupling is not large. Nevertheless, for models that have a holographic 5D dual (large 'tHooft coupling), $\Lambda_{\rm caus}$ emerges as a new cutoff scale, unless certain conditions on the parameters of the 5D models are satisfied.</description>

The model is then quantized and proven to be conformal invariant at the one-loop level. We conclude by showing how one can relate the supersymmetric description with the Berkovits-Vafa-Witten $\rm AdS_3 \times S^3$ worldsheet action with mixed flux.</description>

Abstract: After extending the six-dimensional hybrid formalism for the superstring by adding $d=6$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ superspace variables and unconstrained bosonic ghosts, a manifestly spacetime supersymmetric vertex operator $U$ is constructed. BRST invariance of $U$ is proven to imply the SYM equations of motion in $d=6$ $N=1$ superspace. It is then shown that spacetime supersymmetric scattering amplitudes can be computed in a similar manner as in the non-minimal pure spinor formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use effective string theory to study mesons with large spin $J$ in large $N_c$ QCD as rotating open strings. In the first part of this work, we formulate a consistent effective field theory (EFT) for open spinning strings with light quarks. Our EFT provides a consistent treatment of the endpoints' singularities that arise in the massless limit. We obtain results, in a systematic $1/J$ expansion, for the spectrum of the leading and daughter Regge trajectories. Interestingly, we find that the redshift factor associated with the quarks' acceleration implies that the applicability regime of the EFT is narrower compared to that of static flux tubes. In the second part of this work, we discuss several extensions of phenomenological interests, including mesons with heavy quarks, the quarks' spin and the daughter Regge trajectories associated with the worldsheet axion, a massive string mode identified in lattice simulations of $4d$ flux tubes. We compare our predictions with $4d$ QCD spectroscopy data, and suggest potential $stringy$ interpretations of the observed mesons. We finally comment on the relation between the EFT spectrum and the Axionic String Ansatz, a recently proposed characterization of the spectrum of Yang-Mills glueballs.</description>

Abstract: Coupling $N$ large rank $m$ minimal models and flowing to IR fixed points is a systematic way to build new classes of compact unitary 2d CFTs which are likely to be irrational, and potentially have a positive Virasoro twist gap above the vaccuum. In this paper, we build on the construction of [1], establishing that, for spins less than 10, additional currents transforming in non-trivial irreducible representations of the permutation symmetry $S_N$ are not conserved at the IR fixed points. Along the way, we develop a finer understanding of the spectrum of these theories, of the special properties of the $N=4$ case and of non-invertible symmetries that constrain them. We also discuss variations of the original setup of [1] some of which can exist for smaller values of the UV central charge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the geodesic dynamics of BPS solitons can be modified by the excitation of Feshbach resonances, or quasi-bound modes, in a toy model of two scalar fields. A mode-generated force emerges, with a strength determined by the spectral flow of the frequency on the moduli space, and weakened by the coupling between the bound and scattering components of the resonance. Notably, spectral walls persist unaffected by the resonant mode's exponential decay, as the decay constant vanishes at the spectral wall. Our motivation comes from the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles, which do not present true bound states but long lived semi-bound excitations. Our findings suggest the existence of spectral walls in the scattering of excited monopoles in three dimensions, whose trajectories may significantly deviate from the geodesic motion in the moduli space of unexcited monopoles.</description>

      <title>The Ooguri-Vafa Space as a Moduli Space of Framed Wild Harmonic Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00261</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.00261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Ooguri-Vafa space is a 4-dimensional incomplete hyperk\"ahler manifold, defined on the total space of a singular torus fibration with one singular nodal fiber. It has been proposed that the Ooguri-Vafa hyperk\"ahler metric should be part of the local model of the hyperk\"ahler metric of the Hitchin moduli spaces, near the most generic kind of singular locus of the Hitchin fibration. In order to relate the Ooguri-Vafa space with the Hitchin moduli spaces, we show that the Ooguri-Vafa space can be interpreted as a set of rank 2, framed wild harmonic bundles over $\mathbb{C}P^1$, with one irregular singularity. Along the way we show that a certain twistor family of holomorphic Darboux coordinates, which describes the hyperk\"ahler geometry of the Ooguri-Vafa space, has an interpretation in terms of Stokes data associated to our framed wild harmonic bundles.</description>

      <title>Definition and evolution of transverse momentum dependent distribution of twist-three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.03856v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an in-depth analysis of transverse momentum dependent (TMD) distributions of twist-three. In particular, we focus on evolution equations, symmetry relations, parameterization, interpretation, small-b asymptotic behaviour and the structure of singularities. The starting point of discussion are the correlators with the definite TMD-twist. By considering suitable combinations of these correlators, we introduce physical TMD distribution of twist-three that can be used for practical applications. We also establish relations with generic TMD distribution of twist-three, and demonstrate that their evolution equations are autonomous in the large-$N_c$ limit.</description>

      <title>Decoding general error correcting codes and the role of complementarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.06661v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among various classes of quantum error correcting codes (QECCs), non-stabilizer codes have rich properties and are of theoretical and practical interest. Decoding non-stabilizer codes is, however, a highly non-trivial task. In this paper, we show that a decoding circuit for Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes can be straightforwardly extended to handle general QECCs. The key to the extension lies in the use of a pair of classical-quantum (CQ) codes associated with the QECC to be decoded. The decoding error of the proposed decoding circuit depends on the classical decoding errors of the CQ codes and their degree of complementarity. We demonstrate the power of the decoding circuit in a toy model of the black hole information paradox, improving decoding errors compared to previous results. In addition, we reveal that black hole dynamics may optimally encode quantum information but poorly encode classical information.</description>

      <title>Higher condensation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified mathematical theory of defect condensations for topological orders in all dimensions based on higher categories, higher algebras and higher representations. A k-codimensional topological defect $A$ in an n+1D (potentially anomalous) topological order $C^{n+1}$ is condensable if it is equipped with the structure of a condensable $E_k$-algebra. Condensing such a defect $A$ amounts to a k-step process. In the first step, we condense the defect $A$ along one of its transversal directions, thus obtaining a (k-1)-codimensional defect $\Sigma A$, which is naturally equipped with the structure of a condensable $E_{k-1}$-algebra. In the second step, we condense the defect $\Sigma A$ in one of the remaining transversal directions, thus obtaining a (k-2)-codimensional defect $\Sigma^2 A$, so on and so forth. In the k-th step, we condense the 1-codimensional defect $\Sigma^{k-1}A$ along the only transversal direction, thus defining a phase transition from $C^{n+1}$ to a new n+1D topological order $D^{n+1}$. We give precise mathematical descriptions of each step in above process, including the precise mathematical characterization of the condensed phase $D^{n+1}$. When $C^{n+1}$ is anomaly-free, the same phase transition can be alternatively defined by replacing the last two steps by a single step of condensing the $E_2$-algebra $\Sigma^{k-2}A$ directly along the remaining two transversal directions. When n=2, this modified last step is precisely a usual anyon condensation in a 2+1D topological order. We derive many new mathematical results physically along the way. Some of them will be proved in a mathematical companion of this paper. We also briefly discuss questions, generalizations and applications that naturally arise from our theory, including higher Morita theory, a theory of integrals and the condensations of liquid-like gapless defects in topological orders.</description>

      <title>A Scotogenic Model as a Prototype for Leptogenesis with One Single Gauge Singlet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of a minimal Scotogenic model with two additional scalar doublets and a single heavy Majorana fermion to explain neutrino masses, dark matter, and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. In this minimal setup, Leptogenesis is purely flavored, and a second Majorana neutrino is not necessary because the Yukawa couplings of the extra doublets yield the necessary $CP$-odd phases. The mechanism we employ can also be applied to a wide range of scenarios with at least one singlet and two gauge multiplets. Despite stringent limits from the dark matter abundance, direct detection experiments, and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe, we find a parametric region consistent with all bounds which could resolve the above shortcomings of the Standard Model of particle physics. Methodically, we improve on the calculation of correlations between the mixing scalar fields given their finite width. We also present an argument to justify the kinetic equilibrium approximation for out-of-equilibrium distribution functions often used in calculations of Baryogenesis and Leptogenesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study vacua of moduli potential consisting of multiple contribution of modular forms in a finite modular symmetry. If the potential is given by a single modular form, the Minkowski vacuum is realized at the fixed point of the modular symmetry. We show that the de Sitter vacuum is realized with a multiple modular form case and obtain a non-trivial vacuum which is away from the fixed point, i.e. a large modulus vacuum expectation value, depending on the choice of the weight and representation of the modular forms. We study these vacua numerically and analytically. It is also found that the vacua obtained in this paper preserve CP symmetry.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Space Diffusion in Systems with Approximate Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19260v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random matrix theory (RMT) universality is the defining property of quantum mechanical chaotic systems, and can be probed by observables like the spectral form factor (SFF). In this paper, we describe systematic deviations from RMT behaviour at intermediate time scales in systems with approximate symmetries. At early times, the symmetries allow us to organize the Hilbert space into approximately decoupled sectors, each of which contributes independently to the SFF. At late times, the SFF transitions into the final ramp of the fully mixed chaotic Hamiltonian. For approximate continuous symmetries, the transitional behaviour is governed by a universal process that we call Hilbert space diffusion. The diffusion constant corresponding to this process is related to the relaxation rate of the associated nearly conserved charge. By implementing a chaotic sigma model for Hilbert-space diffusion, we formulate an analytic theory of this process which agrees quantitatively with our numerical results for different examples.</description>

      <title>Spikes and spines in 3D Lorentzian simplicial quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simplicial approaches to quantum gravity such as Quantum Regge Calculus and Spin Foams include configurations where bulk edges can become arbitrarily large while keeping the lengths of the boundary edges small. Such configurations pose significant challenges in Euclidean Quantum Regge Calculus, as they lead to infinities for the partition function and length expectation values. Here we investigate such configurations in three-dimensional Lorentzian Quantum Regge Calculus, and find that the partition function and length expectation values remain finite. This shows that the Lorentzian approach can avoid a key issue of the Euclidean approach. We also find that the space of configurations, for which bulk edges can become very large, is much richer than in the Euclidean case. In particular, it includes configurations with irregular light-cone structures, which lead to imaginary terms in the Regge action and branch cuts along the Lorentzian path integral contour. Hence, to meaningfully define the Lorentzian Regge path integral, one needs to clarify how such configurations should be handled.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider general linear gauge theory, with independent solder form and connection. These spaces have both torsion and nonmetricity. We show that the Cartan structure equations together with the defining equation for nonmetricity allow the mixed symmetry components of nonmetricity to be absorbed into an altered torsion tensor. Field redefinitions reduce the structure equations to those of Poincare gauge theory, with local Lorentz symmetry and metric compatibility. In order to allow recovery the original torsion and nonmetric fields, we replace the definition of nonmetricity by an additional structure equation and demand integrability of the extended system. We show that the maximal Lie algebra compatible with the enlarged set is isomorphic to the conformal Lie algebra. From this Lorentzian conformal geometry, we establish that the difference between the field strength of special conformal transformations and the torsion and is given by the mixed symmetry nonmetricity of an equivalent asymmetric system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the concept of phase time, which has been previously proposed as a solution to the problem of time in quantum gravity. Concretely, we show how the geometry of configuration space together with the phase of the wave function of the universe can, under certain conditions, lead to the definition of a positive-definite squared norm from which probabilities can be defined. The norm is conserved under time evolution, and we obtain a version of Ehrenfest's theorem that is analogous to the one in ordinary quantum mechanics. We address how the present approach avoids some difficulties that were encountered in previous attempts at defining an Ehrenfest theorem relative to phase time in the context of relativistic quantum mechanics and canonical quantum gravity, and how it is connected to a notion of gauge fixing the inner product. We conclude with a brief outlook.</description>

      <title>Stable $f(Q)$ gravity model through non-trivial connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study effectively reconstructs a cosmological model utilizing covariant $f(Q)$ gravity within Connection-III and FLRW spacetime. The dynamic behavior of the reconstructed model is thoroughly analyzed using the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and various observational datasets. Our robust findings demonstrate that the model displays quintessence behavior at the present epoch and converges to the $\Lambda$CDM model at late time. It is confirmed through comprehensive evaluations against energy conditions that the Null Energy Condition remains positive throughout cosmic evolution, and the Dominant Energy Condition is consistently satisfied. The Strong Energy Condition is initially fulfilled in the early Universe but violated in the late epoch. Moreover, scalar perturbations extensively assess stability, affirming the strength of the model with respect to the Hubble parameter. This research offers compelling insights into cosmic acceleration, suggesting that $f(Q)$ gravity can effectively displace the $\Lambda$CDM model and provides a convincing alternative explanation for the current accelerating expansion of the Universe without relying on the cosmological constant.</description>

Abstract: Cotton gravity was recently introduced as a higher derivative extension of General Relativity. The field equations of the theory involve the rank-3 Cotton tensor. Here we show that all solutions of the theory, including the black holes, have vanishing conserved charges, i.e. mass and angular momentum. This result implies that either the theory is unphysical since all the black holes carry the charges of the vacuum and can be created at no energy cost, or the theory has confinement of mass/energy and all other conserved quantities.</description>

Abstract: We evaluate the three-loop five-point pentagon-box-box massless integral family in the dimensional regularization scheme, via canonical differential equation. We use tools from computational algebraic geometry to enable the necessary integral reductions. The boundary values of the differential equation are determined analytically in the Euclidean region. To express the final result, we introduce a new representation of weight six functions in terms of one-fold integrals over the product of weight-three functions with weight-two kernels that are derived from the differential equation. Our work paves the way to the analytic computation of three-loop multi-leg Feynman integrals.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic non-Gaussianity of ultra slow-roll inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the non-Gaussian tail of the curvature fluctuation, $\zeta$, in an inflationary scenario with a transient ultra slow-roll phase that generates a localized large enhancement of the spectrum of $\zeta$. To do so, we implement a numerical procedure that provides the probability distribution of $\zeta$ order by order in perturbation theory. The non-Gaussianities of $\zeta$ can be shown to arise from its non-linear relation to the inflaton fluctuations and from the intrinsic non-Gaussianities of the latter, which stem from its self interactions. We find that intrinsic non-Gaussianities, which have often been ignored to estimate the abundance of primordial black holes in this kind of scenario, are important. The relevance of the intrinsic contribution depends on the rapidity with which the transient ultra slow-roll phase occurs, as well as on its duration. Our method cannot be used accurately when the perturbative in-in formalism fails to apply, highlighting the relevance of developing fully non-perturbative approaches to the problem.</description>

      <title>Black hole spectroscopy and nonlinear echoes in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory with a nonminimal coupling between the electromagnetic and scalar field, we study linear (non)radial perturbations and nonlinear radial dynamics of spherically symmetric black holes. In a certain region of the parameter space, this theory admits hairy black holes with a stable photon sphere. This has a counterpart in the effective potential of linear perturbations, featuring multiple maxima and minima. The corresponding quasinormal mode spectrum contains long-lived modes trapped in the potential cavity and the time-domain linear response displays echoes, as previously observed for horizonless compact objects. Interestingly, the black-hole dynamics in this theory can be studied at the nonlinear level. By performing fully-fledged 1+1 simulations, we show that echoes are present even when the nonlinearities are significant. To our knowledge, this is the first example of echoes appearing in a consistent theory beyond a linearized analysis. In a follow-up work we will study whether this feature is also present in the post-merger signal from black hole collisions in this theory.</description>

      <title>Weak Gravity Limit in Newer General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse linearised field equations around the Minkowski metric with its standard flat parallel transport in models of Newer GR, that is quadratic actions in terms of nonmetricity tensor. We show that half of the freedom in choosing the model parameters is immediately fixed by asking for reasonable properties of tensors and vectors, defined with respect to spatial rotations, and accurately describe the much more complicated sector of scalars. In particular, we show that, from the teleparallel viewpoint, the model of STEGR with addition of a gradient squared of the metric determinant exhibits three halves new dynamical modes, and not just one like it was previously claimed.</description>
