      <title>Iterative Resolution of Prompt Ambiguities Using a Progressive Cutting-Search Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI systems have revolutionized human interaction by enabling natural language-based coding and problem solving. However, the inherent ambiguity of natural language often leads to imprecise instructions, forcing users to iteratively test, correct, and resubmit their prompts. We propose an iterative approach that systematically narrows down these ambiguities through a structured series of clarification questions and alternative solution proposals, illustrated with input/output examples as well. Once every uncertainty is resolved, a final, precise solution is generated. Evaluated on a diverse dataset spanning coding, data analysis, and creative writing, our method demonstrates superior accuracy, competitive resolution times, and higher user satisfaction compared to conventional one-shot solutions, which typically require multiple manual iterations to achieve a correct output.</description>

      <title>The Multimodal Paradox: How Added and Missing Modalities Shape Bias and Performance in Multimodal AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal learning, which integrates diverse data sources such as images, text, and structured data, has proven superior to unimodal counterparts in high-stakes decision-making. However, while performance gains remain the gold standard for evaluating multimodal systems, concerns around bias and robustness are frequently overlooked. In this context, this paper explores two key research questions (RQs): (i) RQ1 examines whether adding a modality con-sistently enhances performance and investigates its role in shaping fairness measures, assessing whether it mitigates or amplifies bias in multimodal models; (ii) RQ2 investigates the impact of missing modalities at inference time, analyzing how multimodal models generalize in terms of both performance and fairness. Our analysis reveals that incorporating new modalities during training consistently enhances the performance of multimodal models, while fairness trends exhibit variability across different evaluation measures and datasets. Additionally, the absence of modalities at inference degrades performance and fairness, raising concerns about its robustness in real-world deployment. We conduct extensive experiments using multimodal healthcare datasets containing images, time series, and structured information to validate our findings.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Impact of AI-Powered Audiovisual Personalization on Learner Emotion, Focus, and Learning Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Independent learners often struggle with sustaining focus and emotional regulation in unstructured or distracting settings. Although some rely on ambient aids such as music, ASMR, or visual backgrounds to support concentration, these tools are rarely integrated into cohesive, learner-centered systems. Moreover, existing educational technologies focus primarily on content adaptation and feedback, overlooking the emotional and sensory context in which learning takes place. Large language models have demonstrated powerful multimodal capabilities including the ability to generate and adapt text, audio, and visual content. Educational research has yet to fully explore their potential in creating personalized audiovisual learning environments. To address this gap, we introduce an AI-powered system that uses LLMs to generate personalized multisensory study environments. Users select or generate customized visual themes (e.g., abstract vs. realistic, static vs. animated) and auditory elements (e.g., white noise, ambient ASMR, familiar vs. novel sounds) to create immersive settings aimed at reducing distraction and enhancing emotional stability. Our primary research question investigates how combinations of personalized audiovisual elements affect learner cognitive load and engagement. Using a mixed-methods design that incorporates biometric measures and performance outcomes, this study evaluates the effectiveness of LLM-driven sensory personalization. The findings aim to advance emotionally responsive educational technologies and extend the application of multimodal LLMs into the sensory dimension of self-directed learning.</description>

      <title>BLAB: Brutally Long Audio Bench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing large audio language models (LMs) capable of understanding diverse spoken interactions is essential for accommodating the multimodal nature of human communication and can increase the accessibility of language technologies across different user populations. Recent work on audio LMs has primarily evaluated their performance on short audio segments, typically under 30 seconds, with limited exploration of long-form conversational speech segments that more closely reflect natural user interactions with these models. We introduce Brutally Long Audio Bench (BLAB), a challenging long-form audio benchmark that evaluates audio LMs on localization, duration estimation, emotion, and counting tasks using audio segments averaging 51 minutes in length. BLAB consists of 833+ hours of diverse, full-length audio clips, each paired with human-annotated, text-based natural language questions and answers. Our audio data were collected from permissively licensed sources and underwent a human-assisted filtering process to ensure task compliance. We evaluate six open-source and proprietary audio LMs on BLAB and find that all of them, including advanced models such as Gemini 2.0 Pro and GPT-4o, struggle with the tasks in BLAB. Our comprehensive analysis reveals key insights into the trade-offs between task difficulty and audio duration. In general, we find that audio LMs struggle with long-form speech, with performance declining as duration increases. They perform poorly on localization, temporal reasoning, counting, and struggle to understand non-phonemic information, relying more on prompts than audio content. BLAB serves as a challenging evaluation framework to develop audio LMs with robust long-form audio understanding capabilities.</description>

      <title>Is AI currently capable of identifying wild oysters? A comparison of human annotators against the AI model, ODYSSEE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oysters are ecologically and commercially important species that require frequent monitoring to track population demographics (e.g. abundance, growth, mortality). Current methods of monitoring oyster reefs often require destructive sampling methods and extensive manual effort. Therefore, they are suboptimal for small-scale or sensitive environments. A recent alternative, the ODYSSEE model, was developed to use deep learning techniques to identify live oysters using video or images taken in the field of oyster reefs to assess abundance. The validity of this model in identifying live oysters on a reef was compared to expert and non-expert annotators. In addition, we identified potential sources of prediction error. Although the model can make inferences significantly faster than expert and non-expert annotators (39.6 s, $2.34 \pm 0.61$ h, $4.50 \pm 1.46$ h, respectively), the model overpredicted the number of live oysters, achieving lower accuracy (63\%) in identifying live oysters compared to experts (74\%) and non-experts (75\%) alike. Image quality was an important factor in determining the accuracy of the model and the annotators. Better quality images improved human accuracy and worsened model accuracy. Although ODYSSEE was not sufficiently accurate, we anticipate that future training on higher-quality images, utilizing additional live imagery, and incorporating additional annotation training classes will greatly improve the model's predictive power based on the results of this analysis. Future research should address methods that improve the detection of living vs. dead oysters.</description>

      <title>Holmes: Automated Fact Check with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of Internet connectivity has accelerated the spread of disinformation, threatening societal trust, decision-making, and national security. Disinformation has evolved from simple text to complex multimodal forms combining images and text, challenging existing detection methods. Traditional deep learning models struggle to capture the complexity of multimodal disinformation. Inspired by advances in AI, this study explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated disinformation detection. The empirical study shows that (1) LLMs alone cannot reliably assess the truthfulness of claims; (2) providing relevant evidence significantly improves their performance; (3) however, LLMs cannot autonomously search for accurate evidence. To address this, we propose Holmes, an end-to-end framework featuring a novel evidence retrieval method that assists LLMs in collecting high-quality evidence. Our approach uses (1) LLM-powered summarization to extract key information from open sources and (2) a new algorithm and metrics to evaluate evidence quality. Holmes enables LLMs to verify claims and generate justifications effectively. Experiments show Holmes achieves 88.3% accuracy on two open-source datasets and 90.2% in real-time verification tasks. Notably, our improved evidence retrieval boosts fact-checking accuracy by 30.8% over existing methods</description>

      <title>CombiBench: Benchmarking LLM Capability for Combinatorial Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurosymbolic approaches integrating large language models with formal reasoning have recently achieved human-level performance on mathematics competition problems in algebra, geometry and number theory. In comparison, combinatorics remains a challenging domain, characterized by a lack of appropriate benchmarks and theorem libraries. To address this gap, we introduce CombiBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 100 combinatorial problems, each formalized in Lean~4 and paired with its corresponding informal statement. The problem set covers a wide spectrum of difficulty levels, ranging from middle school to IMO and university level, and span over ten combinatorial topics. CombiBench is suitable for testing IMO solving capabilities since it includes all IMO combinatorial problems since 2000 (except IMO 2004 P3 as its statement contain an images). Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive and standardized evaluation framework, dubbed Fine-Eval (for $\textbf{F}$ill-in-the-blank $\textbf{in}$ L$\textbf{e}$an Evaluation), for formal mathematics. It accommodates not only proof-based problems but also, for the first time, the evaluation of fill-in-the-blank questions. Using Fine-Eval as the evaluation method and Kimina Lean Server as the backend, we benchmark several LLMs on CombiBench and observe that their capabilities for formally solving combinatorial problems remain limited. Among all models tested (none of which has been trained for this particular task), Kimina-Prover attains the best results, solving 7 problems (out of 100) under both ``with solution'' and ``without solution'' scenarios. We open source the benchmark dataset alongside with the code of the proposed evaluation method at https://github.com/MoonshotAI/CombiBench/.</description>

      <title>Patterns and Mechanisms of Contrastive Activation Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a significant challenge due to their inherent complexity and opacity. While techniques like fine-tuning can modify model behavior, they typically require extensive computational resources. Recent work has introduced a class of contrastive activation engineering (CAE) techniques as promising approaches for steering LLM outputs through targeted modifications to their internal representations. Applied at inference-time with zero cost, CAE has the potential to introduce a new paradigm of flexible, task-specific LLM behavior tuning. We analyze the performance of CAE in in-distribution, out-of-distribution settings, evaluate drawbacks, and begin to develop comprehensive guidelines for its effective deployment. We find that 1. CAE is only reliably effective when applied to in-distribution contexts. 2. Increasing the number of samples used to generate steering vectors has diminishing returns at around 80 samples. 3. Steering vectors are susceptible to adversarial inputs that reverses the behavior that is steered for. 4. Steering vectors harm the overall model perplexity. 5. Larger models are more resistant to steering-induced degradation.</description>

      <title>RAG-MCP: Mitigating Prompt Bloat in LLM Tool Selection via Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle to effectively utilize a growing number of external tools, such as those defined by the Model Context Protocol (MCP)\cite{IntroducingMCP}, due to prompt bloat and selection complexity. We introduce RAG-MCP, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework that overcomes this challenge by offloading tool discovery. RAG-MCP uses semantic retrieval to identify the most relevant MCP(s) for a given query from an external index before engaging the LLM. Only the selected tool descriptions are passed to the model, drastically reducing prompt size and simplifying decision-making. Experiments, including an MCP stress test, demonstrate RAG-MCP significantly cuts prompt tokens (e.g., by over 50%) and more than triples tool selection accuracy (43.13% vs 13.62% baseline) on benchmark tasks. RAG-MCP enables scalable and accurate tool integration for LLMs.</description>

      <title>Capability-Driven Skill Generation with LLMs: A RAG-Based Approach for Reusing Existing Libraries and Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern automation systems increasingly rely on modular architectures, with capabilities and skills as one solution approach. Capabilities define the functions of resources in a machine-readable form and skills provide the concrete implementations that realize those capabilities. However, the development of a skill implementation conforming to a corresponding capability remains a time-consuming and challenging task. In this paper, we present a method that treats capabilities as contracts for skill implementations and leverages large language models to generate executable code based on natural language user input. A key feature of our approach is the integration of existing software libraries and interface technologies, enabling the generation of skill implementations across different target languages. We introduce a framework that allows users to incorporate their own libraries and resource interfaces into the code generation process through a retrieval-augmented generation architecture. The proposed method is evaluated using an autonomous mobile robot controlled via Python and ROS 2, demonstrating the feasibility and flexibility of the approach.</description>

      <title>Artificial Behavior Intelligence: Technology, Challenges, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting human behavior has emerged as a core capability in various AI application domains such as autonomous driving, smart healthcare, surveillance systems, and social robotics. This paper defines the technical framework of Artificial Behavior Intelligence (ABI), which comprehensively analyzes and interprets human posture, facial expressions, emotions, behavioral sequences, and contextual cues. It details the essential components of ABI, including pose estimation, face and emotion recognition, sequential behavior analysis, and context-aware modeling. Furthermore, we highlight the transformative potential of recent advances in large-scale pretrained models, such as large language models (LLMs), vision foundation models, and multimodal integration models, in significantly improving the accuracy and interpretability of behavior recognition. Our research team has a strong interest in the ABI domain and is actively conducting research, particularly focusing on the development of intelligent lightweight models capable of efficiently inferring complex human behaviors. This paper identifies several technical challenges that must be addressed to deploy ABI in real-world applications including learning behavioral intelligence from limited data, quantifying uncertainty in complex behavior prediction, and optimizing model structures for low-power, real-time inference. To tackle these challenges, our team is exploring various optimization strategies including lightweight transformers, graph-based recognition architectures, energy-aware loss functions, and multimodal knowledge distillation, while validating their applicability in real-time environments.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Scholarly Peer Review via Persistent Workflow Prompting, Meta-Prompting, and Meta-Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical peer review of scientific manuscripts presents a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), partly due to data limitations and the complexity of expert reasoning. This report introduces Persistent Workflow Prompting (PWP), a potentially broadly applicable prompt engineering methodology designed to bridge this gap using standard LLM chat interfaces (zero-code, no APIs). We present a proof-of-concept PWP prompt for the critical analysis of experimental chemistry manuscripts, featuring a hierarchical, modular architecture (structured via Markdown) that defines detailed analysis workflows. We develop this PWP prompt through iterative application of meta-prompting techniques and meta-reasoning aimed at systematically codifying expert review workflows, including tacit knowledge. Submitted once at the start of a session, this PWP prompt equips the LLM with persistent workflows triggered by subsequent queries, guiding modern reasoning LLMs through systematic, multimodal evaluations. Demonstrations show the PWP-guided LLM identifying major methodological flaws in a test case while mitigating LLM input bias and performing complex tasks, including distinguishing claims from evidence, integrating text/photo/figure analysis to infer parameters, executing quantitative feasibility checks, comparing estimates against claims, and assessing a priori plausibility. To ensure transparency and facilitate replication, we provide full prompts, detailed demonstration analyses, and logs of interactive chats as supplementary resources. Beyond the specific application, this work offers insights into the meta-development process itself, highlighting the potential of PWP, informed by detailed workflow formalization, to enable sophisticated analysis using readily available LLMs for complex scientific tasks.</description>

      <title>Domain Adversarial Training for Mitigating Gender Bias in Speech-based Mental Health Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech-based AI models are emerging as powerful tools for detecting depression and the presence of Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), offering a non-invasive and cost-effective way to assess mental health. However, these models often struggle with gender bias, which can lead to unfair and inaccurate predictions. In this study, our study addresses this issue by introducing a domain adversarial training approach that explicitly considers gender differences in speech-based depression and PTSD detection. Specifically, we treat different genders as distinct domains and integrate this information into a pretrained speech foundation model. We then validate its effectiveness on the E-DAIC dataset to assess its impact on performance. Experimental results show that our method notably improves detection performance, increasing the F1-score by up to 13.29 percentage points compared to the baseline. This highlights the importance of addressing demographic disparities in AI-driven mental health assessment.</description>

      <title>Validating the Effectiveness of a Large Language Model-based Approach for Identifying Children's Development across Various Free Play Settings in Kindergarten</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free play is a fundamental aspect of early childhood education, supporting children's cognitive, social, emotional, and motor development. However, assessing children's development during free play poses significant challenges due to the unstructured and spontaneous nature of the activity. Traditional assessment methods often rely on direct observations by teachers, parents, or researchers, which may fail to capture comprehensive insights from free play and provide timely feedback to educators. This study proposes an innovative approach combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with learning analytics to analyze children's self-narratives of their play experiences. The LLM identifies developmental abilities, while performance scores across different play settings are calculated using learning analytics techniques. We collected 2,224 play narratives from 29 children in a kindergarten, covering four distinct play areas over one semester. According to the evaluation results from eight professionals, the LLM-based approach achieved high accuracy in identifying cognitive, motor, and social abilities, with accuracy exceeding 90% in most domains. Moreover, significant differences in developmental outcomes were observed across play settings, highlighting each area's unique contributions to specific abilities. These findings confirm that the proposed approach is effective in identifying children's development across various free play settings. This study demonstrates the potential of integrating LLMs and learning analytics to provide child-centered insights into developmental trajectories, offering educators valuable data to support personalized learning and enhance early childhood education practices.</description>

      <title>Procedural Memory Is Not All You Need: Bridging Cognitive Gaps in LLM-Based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a landmark achievement in Artificial Intelligence (AI), demonstrating unprecedented proficiency in procedural tasks such as text generation, code completion, and conversational coherence. These capabilities stem from their architecture, which mirrors human procedural memory -- the brain's ability to automate repetitive, pattern-driven tasks through practice. However, as LLMs are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, it becomes impossible to ignore their limitations operating in complex, unpredictable environments. This paper argues that LLMs, while transformative, are fundamentally constrained by their reliance on procedural memory. To create agents capable of navigating ``wicked'' learning environments -- where rules shift, feedback is ambiguous, and novelty is the norm -- we must augment LLMs with semantic memory and associative learning systems. By adopting a modular architecture that decouples these cognitive functions, we can bridge the gap between narrow procedural expertise and the adaptive intelligence required for real-world problem-solving.</description>

      <title>The Steganographic Potentials of Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential for large language models (LLMs) to hide messages within plain text (steganography) poses a challenge to detection and thwarting of unaligned AI agents, and undermines faithfulness of LLMs reasoning. We explore the steganographic capabilities of LLMs fine-tuned via reinforcement learning (RL) to: (1) develop covert encoding schemes, (2) engage in steganography when prompted, and (3) utilize steganography in realistic scenarios where hidden reasoning is likely, but not prompted. In these scenarios, we detect the intention of LLMs to hide their reasoning as well as their steganography performance. Our findings in the fine-tuning experiments as well as in behavioral non fine-tuning evaluations reveal that while current models exhibit rudimentary steganographic abilities in terms of security and capacity, explicit algorithmic guidance markedly enhances their capacity for information concealment.</description>

      <title>am-ELO: A Stable Framework for Arena-based LLM Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arena-based evaluation is a fundamental yet significant evaluation paradigm for modern AI models, especially large language models (LLMs). Existing framework based on ELO rating system suffers from the inevitable instability problem due to ranking inconsistency and the lack of attention to the varying abilities of annotators. In this paper, we introduce a novel stable arena framework to address these issues by enhancing the ELO Rating System. Specifically, we replace the iterative update method with a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) approach, m-ELO, and provide theoretical proof of the consistency and stability of the MLE approach for model ranking. Additionally, we proposed the am-ELO, which modify the Elo Rating's probability function to incorporate annotator abilities, enabling the simultaneous estimation of model scores and annotator reliability. Experiments demonstrate that this method ensures stability, proving that this framework offers a more robust, accurate, and stable evaluation method for LLMs.</description>

      <title>STORY2GAME: Generating (Almost) Everything in an Interactive Fiction Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce STORY2GAME, a novel approach to using Large Language Models to generate text-based interactive fiction games that starts by generating a story, populates the world, and builds the code for actions in a game engine that enables the story to play out interactively. Whereas a given set of hard-coded actions can artificially constrain story generation, the ability to generate actions means the story generation process can be more open-ended but still allow for experiences that are grounded in a game state. The key to successful action generation is to use LLM-generated preconditions and effects of actions in the stories as guides for what aspects of the game state must be tracked and changed by the game engine when a player performs an action. We also introduce a technique for dynamically generating new actions to accommodate the player's desire to perform actions that they think of that are not part of the story. Dynamic action generation may require on-the-fly updates to the game engine's state representation and revision of previously generated actions. We evaluate the success rate of action code generation with respect to whether a player can interactively play through the entire generated story.</description>

      <title>A Hashgraph-Inspired Consensus Mechanism for Reliable Multi-Model Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inconsistent outputs and hallucinations from large language models (LLMs) are major obstacles to reliable AI systems. When different proprietary reasoning models (RMs), such as those by OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, DeepSeek, and xAI, are given the same complex request, they often produce divergent results due to variations in training and inference. This paper proposes a novel consensus mechanism, inspired by distributed ledger technology, to validate and converge these outputs, treating each RM as a black-box peer. Building on the Hashgraph consensus algorithm, our approach employs gossip-about-gossip communication and virtual voting to achieve agreement among an ensemble of RMs. We present an architectural design for a prototype system in which RMs iteratively exchange and update their answers, using information from each round to improve accuracy and confidence in subsequent rounds. This approach goes beyond simple majority voting by incorporating the knowledge and cross-verification content of every model. We justify the feasibility of this Hashgraph-inspired consensus for AI ensembles and outline its advantages over traditional ensembling techniques in reducing nonfactual outputs. Preliminary considerations for implementation, evaluation criteria for convergence and accuracy, and potential challenges are discussed. The proposed mechanism demonstrates a promising direction for multi-agent AI systems to self-validate and deliver high-fidelity responses in complex tasks.</description>

      <title>OSUniverse: Benchmark for Multimodal GUI-navigation AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OSUniverse: a benchmark of complex, multimodal desktop-oriented tasks for advanced GUI-navigation AI agents that focuses on ease of use, extensibility, comprehensive coverage of test cases, and automated validation. We divide the tasks in increasing levels of complexity, from basic precision clicking to multistep, multiapplication tests requiring dexterity, precision, and clear thinking from the agent. In version one of the benchmark, presented here, we have calibrated the complexity of the benchmark test cases to ensure that the SOTA (State of the Art) agents (at the time of publication) do not achieve results higher than 50%, while the average white collar worker can perform all these tasks with perfect accuracy. The benchmark can be scored manually, but we also introduce an automated validation mechanism that has an average error rate less than 2%. Therefore, this benchmark presents solid ground for fully automated measuring of progress, capabilities and the effectiveness of GUI-navigation AI agents over the short and medium-term horizon. The source code of the benchmark is available at https://github.com/agentsea/osuniverse.</description>

      <title>Synthesizing Images on Perceptual Boundaries of ANNs for Uncovering and Manipulating Human Perceptual Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human decision-making in cognitive tasks and daily life exhibits considerable variability, shaped by factors such as task difficulty, individual preferences, and personal experiences. Understanding this variability across individuals is essential for uncovering the perceptual and decision-making mechanisms that humans rely on when faced with uncertainty and ambiguity. We present a computational framework BAM (Boundary Alignment &amp; Manipulation framework) that combines perceptual boundary sampling in ANNs and human behavioral experiments to systematically investigate this phenomenon. Our perceptual boundary sampling algorithm generates stimuli along ANN decision boundaries that intrinsically induce significant perceptual variability. The efficacy of these stimuli is empirically validated through large-scale behavioral experiments involving 246 participants across 116,715 trials, culminating in the variMNIST dataset containing 19,943 systematically annotated images. Through personalized model alignment and adversarial generation, we establish a reliable method for simultaneously predicting and manipulating the divergent perceptual decisions of pairs of participants. This work bridges the gap between computational models and human individual difference research, providing new tools for personalized perception analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-enabled planning and control algorithms are increasingly popular, but they often lack rigorous guarantees of performance or safety. We introduce an algorithm for computing underapproximate backward reachable sets of nonlinear discrete time neural feedback loops. We then use the backward reachable sets to check goal-reaching properties. Our algorithm is based on overapproximating the system dynamics function to enable computation of underapproximate backward reachable sets through solutions of mixed-integer linear programs. We rigorously analyze the soundness of our algorithm and demonstrate it on a numerical example. Our work expands the class of properties that can be verified for learning-enabled systems.</description>

      <title>Learning Symbolic Persistent Macro-Actions for POMDP Solving Over Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an integration of temporal logical reasoning and Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) to achieve interpretable decision-making under uncertainty with macro-actions. Our method leverages a fragment of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) based on Event Calculus (EC) to generate \emph{persistent} (i.e., constant) macro-actions, which guide Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based POMDP solvers over a time horizon, significantly reducing inference time while ensuring robust performance. Such macro-actions are learnt via Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) from a few traces of execution (belief-action pairs), thus eliminating the need for manually designed heuristics and requiring only the specification of the POMDP transition model. In the Pocman and Rocksample benchmark scenarios, our learned macro-actions demonstrate increased expressiveness and generality when compared to time-independent heuristics, indeed offering substantial computational efficiency improvements.</description>

      <title>Gap the (Theory of) Mind: Sharing Beliefs About Teammates' Goals Boosts Collaboration Perception, Not Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In human-agent teams, openly sharing goals is often assumed to enhance planning, collaboration, and effectiveness. However, direct communication of these goals is not always feasible, requiring teammates to infer their partner's intentions through actions. Building on this, we investigate whether an AI agent's ability to share its inferred understanding of a human teammate's goals can improve task performance and perceived collaboration. Through an experiment comparing three conditions-no recognition (NR), viable goals (VG), and viable goals on-demand (VGod) - we find that while goal-sharing information did not yield significant improvements in task performance or overall satisfaction scores, thematic analysis suggests that it supported strategic adaptations and subjective perceptions of collaboration. Cognitive load assessments revealed no additional burden across conditions, highlighting the challenge of balancing informativeness and simplicity in human-agent interactions. These findings highlight the nuanced trade-off of goal-sharing: while it fosters trust and enhances perceived collaboration, it can occasionally hinder objective performance gains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our work contributes to the fast-growing literature on the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform graph-related tasks. In particular, we focus on usage scenarios that rely on the visual modality, feeding the model with a drawing of the graph under analysis. We investigate how the model's performance is affected by the chosen layout paradigm, the aesthetics of the drawing, and the prompting technique used for the queries. We formulate three corresponding research questions and present the results of a thorough experimental analysis. Our findings reveal that choosing the right layout paradigm and optimizing the readability of the input drawing from a human perspective can significantly improve the performance of the model on the given task. Moreover, selecting the most effective prompting technique is a challenging yet crucial task for achieving optimal performance.</description>

      <title>Snakemaker: Seamlessly transforming ad-hoc analyses into sustainable Snakemake workflows with generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reproducibility and sustainability present significant challenges in bioinformatics software development, where rapidly evolving tools and complex workflows often result in short-lived or difficult-to-adapt pipelines. This paper introduces Snakemaker, a tool that leverages generative AI to facilitate researchers build sustainable data analysis pipelines by converting unstructured code into well-defined Snakemake workflows. Snakemaker non-invasively tracks the work performed in the terminal by the researcher, analyzes execution patterns, and generates Snakemake workflows that can be integrated into existing pipelines. Snakemaker also supports the transformation of monolithic Ipython Notebooks into modular Snakemake pipelines, resolving the global state of the notebook into discrete, file-based interactions between rules. An integrated chat assistant provides users with fine-grained control through natural language instructions. Snakemaker generates high-quality Snakemake workflows by adhering to the best practices, including Conda environment tracking, generic rule generation and loop unrolling. By lowering the barrier between prototype and production-quality code, Snakemaker addresses a critical gap in computational reproducibility for bioinformatics research.</description>

      <title>Physical foundations for trustworthy medical imaging: a review for artificial intelligence researchers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence in medical imaging has seen unprecedented growth in the last years, due to rapid advances in deep learning and computing resources. Applications cover the full range of existing medical imaging modalities, with unique characteristics driven by the physics of each technique. Yet, artificial intelligence professionals entering the field, and even experienced developers, often lack a comprehensive understanding of the physical principles underlying medical image acquisition, which hinders their ability to fully leverage its potential. The integration of physics knowledge into artificial intelligence algorithms enhances their trustworthiness and robustness in medical imaging, especially in scenarios with limited data availability. In this work, we review the fundamentals of physics in medical images and their impact on the latest advances in artificial intelligence, particularly, in generative models and reconstruction algorithms. Finally, we explore the integration of physics knowledge into physics-inspired machine learning models, which leverage physics-based constraints to enhance the learning of medical imaging features.</description>

      <title>The Precautionary Principle and the Innovation Principle: Incompatible Guides for AI Innovation Governance?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In policy debates concerning the governance and regulation of Artificial Intelligence (AI), both the Precautionary Principle (PP) and the Innovation Principle (IP) are advocated by their respective interest groups. Do these principles offer wholly incompatible and contradictory guidance? Does one necessarily negate the other? I argue here that provided attention is restricted to weak-form PP and IP, the answer to both of these questions is "No." The essence of these weak formulations is the requirement to fully account for type-I error costs arising from erroneously preventing the innovation's diffusion through society (i.e. mistaken regulatory red-lighting) as well as the type-II error costs arising from erroneously allowing the innovation to diffuse through society (i.e. mistaken regulatory green-lighting). Within the Signal Detection Theory (SDT) model developed here, weak-PP red-light (weak-IP green-light) determinations are optimal for sufficiently small (large) ratios of expected type-I to type-II error costs. For intermediate expected cost ratios, an amber-light 'wait-and-monitor' policy is optimal. Regulatory sandbox instruments allow AI testing and experimentation to take place within a structured environment of limited duration and societal scale, whereby the expected cost ratio falls within the 'wait-and-monitor' range. Through sandboxing regulators and innovating firms learn more about the expected cost ratio, and what respective adaptations -- of regulation, of technical solution, of business model, or combination thereof, if any -- are needed to keep the ratio out of the weak-PP red-light zone.</description>

      <title>Sentient Agent as a Judge: Evaluating Higher-Order Social Cognition in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessing how well a large language model (LLM) understands human, rather than merely text, remains an open challenge. To bridge the gap, we introduce Sentient Agent as a Judge (SAGE), an automated evaluation framework that measures an LLM's higher-order social cognition. SAGE instantiates a Sentient Agent that simulates human-like emotional changes and inner thoughts during interaction, providing a more realistic evaluation of the tested model in multi-turn conversations. At every turn, the agent reasons about (i) how its emotion changes, (ii) how it feels, and (iii) how it should reply, yielding a numerical emotion trajectory and interpretable inner thoughts. Experiments on 100 supportive-dialogue scenarios show that the final Sentient emotion score correlates strongly with Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory (BLRI) ratings and utterance-level empathy metrics, validating psychological fidelity. We also build a public Sentient Leaderboard covering 18 commercial and open-source models that uncovers substantial gaps (up to 4x) between frontier systems (GPT-4o-Latest, Gemini2.5-Pro) and earlier baselines, gaps not reflected in conventional leaderboards (e.g., Arena). SAGE thus provides a principled, scalable and interpretable tool for tracking progress toward genuinely empathetic and socially adept language agents.</description>

      <title>Aligning Large Language Models with Healthcare Stakeholders: A Pathway to Trustworthy AI Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The wide exploration of large language models (LLMs) raises the awareness of alignment between healthcare stakeholder preferences and model outputs. This alignment becomes a crucial foundation to empower the healthcare workflow effectively, safely, and responsibly. Yet the varying behaviors of LLMs may not always match with healthcare stakeholders' knowledge, demands, and values. To enable a human-AI alignment, healthcare stakeholders will need to perform essential roles in guiding and enhancing the performance of LLMs. Human professionals must participate in the entire life cycle of adopting LLM in healthcare, including training data curation, model training, and inference. In this review, we discuss the approaches, tools, and applications of alignments between healthcare stakeholders and LLMs. We demonstrate that LLMs can better follow human values by properly enhancing healthcare knowledge integration, task understanding, and human guidance. We provide outlooks on enhancing the alignment between humans and LLMs to build trustworthy real-world healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>Enhancing tutoring systems by leveraging tailored promptings and domain knowledge with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have reignited interest in their impact on Computer-based Learning (CBL). AI-driven tools like ChatGPT and Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) have enhanced learning experiences through personalisation and flexibility. ITSs can adapt to individual learning needs and provide customised feedback based on a student's performance, cognitive state, and learning path. Despite these advances, challenges remain in accommodating diverse learning styles and delivering real-time, context-aware feedback. Our research aims to address these gaps by integrating skill-aligned feedback via Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) into prompt engineering for Large Language Models (LLMs) and developing an application to enhance learning through personalised tutoring in a computer science programming context. The pilot study evaluated a proposed system using three quantitative metrics: readability score, response time, and feedback depth, across three programming tasks of varying complexity. The system successfully sorted simulated students into three skill-level categories and provided context-aware feedback. This targeted approach demonstrated better effectiveness and adaptability compared to general methods.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Structured Knowledge: A Concept Map-Based Approach for High-Quality Multiple Choice Question Generation with Effective Distractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating high-quality MCQs, especially those targeting diverse cognitive levels and incorporating common misconceptions into distractor design, is time-consuming and expertise-intensive, making manual creation impractical at scale. Current automated approaches typically generate questions at lower cognitive levels and fail to incorporate domain-specific misconceptions. This paper presents a hierarchical concept map-based framework that provides structured knowledge to guide LLMs in generating MCQs with distractors. We chose high-school physics as our test domain and began by developing a hierarchical concept map covering major Physics topics and their interconnections with an efficient database design. Next, through an automated pipeline, topic-relevant sections of these concept maps are retrieved to serve as a structured context for the LLM to generate questions and distractors that specifically target common misconceptions. Lastly, an automated validation is completed to ensure that the generated MCQs meet the requirements provided. We evaluate our framework against two baseline approaches: a base LLM and a RAG-based generation. We conducted expert evaluations and student assessments of the generated MCQs. Expert evaluation shows that our method significantly outperforms the baseline approaches, achieving a success rate of 75.20% in meeting all quality criteria compared to approximately 37% for both baseline methods. Student assessment data reveal that our concept map-driven approach achieved a significantly lower guess success rate of 28.05% compared to 37.10% for the baselines, indicating a more effective assessment of conceptual understanding. The results demonstrate that our concept map-based approach enables robust assessment across cognitive levels and instant identification of conceptual gaps, facilitating faster feedback loops and targeted interventions at scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present 30 Day Me, a habit formation application that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to help users break down their goals into manageable, actionable steps and track their progress. Central to the app is the 30DAYGEN system, which generates 3,531 unique 30-day challenges sourced from over 15K webpages, and enables runtime search of challenge ideas aligned with user-defined goals. We showcase how LLMs can be harnessed to rapidly construct domain specific content corpora for behavioral and educational purposes, and propose a practical pipeline that incorporates effective LLM enhanced approaches for content generation and semantic deduplication.</description>

      <title>A Computational Model of Inclusive Pedagogy: From Understanding to Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human education transcends mere knowledge transfer, it relies on co-adaptation dynamics -- the mutual adjustment of teaching and learning strategies between agents. Despite its centrality, computational models of co-adaptive teacher-student interactions (T-SI) remain underdeveloped. We argue that this gap impedes Educational Science in testing and scaling contextual insights across diverse settings, and limits the potential of Machine Learning systems, which struggle to emulate and adaptively support human learning processes. To address this, we present a computational T-SI model that integrates contextual insights on human education into a testable framework. We use the model to evaluate diverse T-SI strategies in a realistic synthetic classroom setting, simulating student groups with unequal access to sensory information. Results show that strategies incorporating co-adaptation principles (e.g., bidirectional agency) outperform unilateral approaches (i.e., where only the teacher or the student is active), improving the learning outcomes for all learning types. Beyond the testing and scaling of context-dependent educational insights, our model enables hypothesis generation in controlled yet adaptable environments. This work bridges non-computational theories of human education with scalable, inclusive AI in Education systems, providing a foundation for equitable technologies that dynamically adapt to learner needs.</description>

      <title>Ensuring Reproducibility in Generative AI Systems for General Use Cases: A Framework for Regression Testing and Open Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reproducibility and reliability remain pressing challenges for generative AI systems whose behavior can drift with each model update or prompt revision. We introduce GPR-bench, a lightweight, extensible benchmark that operationalizes regression testing for general purpose use cases. GPR-bench couples an open, bilingual (English and Japanese) dataset covering eight task categories (e.g., text generation, code generation, and information retrieval) and 10 scenarios in each task categories (80 total test cases for each language) with an automated evaluation pipeline that employs "LLM-as-a-Judge" scoring of correctness and conciseness. Experiments across three recent model versions - gpt-4o-mini, o3-mini, and o4-mini - and two prompt configurations (default versus concise-writing instruction) reveal heterogeneous quality. Our results show that newer models generally improve correctness, but the differences are modest and not statistically significant, suggesting that GPR-bench may not be sufficiently challenging to differentiate between recent model versions. In contrast, the concise-writing instruction significantly enhances conciseness (+12.37 pp, Mann-Whitney U test: p &lt; 0.001, effect size r = 0.2995) with minimal degradations on accuracy (-1.7 pp), demonstrating the effectiveness of prompt engineering. Released under the MIT License, GPR- bench lowers the barrier to initiating reproducibility monitoring and provides a foundation for community-driven extensions, while also raising important considerations about benchmark design for rapidly evolving language models.</description>

      <title>AI Education in a Mirror: Challenges Faced by Academic and Industry Experts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies continue to evolve, the gap between academic AI education and real-world industry challenges remains an important area of investigation. This study provides preliminary insights into challenges AI professionals encounter in both academia and industry, based on semi-structured interviews with 14 AI experts - eight from industry and six from academia. We identify key challenges related to data quality and availability, model scalability, practical constraints, user behavior, and explainability. While both groups experience data and model adaptation difficulties, industry professionals more frequently highlight deployment constraints, resource limitations, and external dependencies, whereas academics emphasize theoretical adaptation and standardization issues. These exploratory findings suggest that AI curricula could better integrate real-world complexities, software engineering principles, and interdisciplinary learning, while recognizing the broader educational goals of building foundational and ethical reasoning skills.</description>

      <title>Enhancing ML Model Interpretability: Leveraging Fine-Tuned Large Language Models for Better Understanding of AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Across various sectors applications of eXplainableAI (XAI) gained momentum as the increasing black-boxedness of prevailing Machine Learning (ML) models became apparent. In parallel, Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly developed in their abilities to understand human language and complex patterns. By combining both, this paper presents a novel reference architecture for the interpretation of XAI through an interactive chatbot powered by a fine-tuned LLM. We instantiate the reference architecture in the context of State-of-Health (SoH) prediction for batteries and validate its design in multiple evaluation and demonstration rounds. The evaluation indicates that the implemented prototype enhances the human interpretability of ML, especially for users with less experience with XAI.</description>

      <title>Neural Orchestration for Multi-Agent Systems: A Deep Learning Framework for Optimal Agent Selection in Multi-Domain Task Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are foundational in simulating complex real-world scenarios involving autonomous, interacting entities. However, traditional MAS architectures often suffer from rigid coordination mechanisms and difficulty adapting to dynamic tasks. We propose MetaOrch, a neural orchestration framework for optimal agent selection in multi-domain task environments. Our system implements a supervised learning approach that models task context, agent histories, and expected response quality to select the most appropriate agent for each task. A novel fuzzy evaluation module scores agent responses along completeness, relevance, and confidence dimensions, generating soft supervision labels for training the orchestrator. Unlike previous methods that hard-code agent-task mappings, MetaOrch dynamically predicts the most suitable agent while estimating selection confidence. Experiments in simulated environments with heterogeneous agents demonstrate that our approach achieves 86.3% selection accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline strategies including random selection and round-robin scheduling. The modular architecture emphasizes extensibility, allowing agents to be registered, updated, and queried independently. Results suggest that neural orchestration offers a powerful approach to enhancing the autonomy, interpretability, and adaptability of multi-agent systems across diverse task domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which can compromise their safety mechanisms. Existing studies often rely on brute-force optimization or manual design, failing to uncover potential risks in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose a novel jailbreak attack framework, ICRT, inspired by heuristics and biases in human cognition. Leveraging the simplicity effect, we employ cognitive decomposition to reduce the complexity of malicious prompts. Simultaneously, relevance bias is utilized to reorganize prompts, enhancing semantic alignment and inducing harmful outputs effectively. Furthermore, we introduce a ranking-based harmfulness evaluation metric that surpasses the traditional binary success-or-failure paradigm by employing ranking aggregation methods such as Elo, HodgeRank, and Rank Centrality to comprehensively quantify the harmfulness of generated content. Experimental results show that our approach consistently bypasses mainstream LLMs' safety mechanisms and generates high-risk content, providing insights into jailbreak attack risks and contributing to stronger defense strategies.</description>

      <title>Understanding University Students' Use of Generative AI: The Roles of Demographics and Personality Traits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of generative AI (GAI) among university students is rapidly increasing, yet empirical research on students' GAI use and the factors influencing it remains limited. To address this gap, we surveyed 363 undergraduate and graduate students in the United States, examining their GAI usage and how it relates to demographic variables and personality traits based on the Big Five model (i.e., extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and emotional stability, and intellect/imagination). Our findings reveal: (a) Students in higher academic years are more inclined to use GAI and prefer it over traditional resources. (b) Non-native English speakers use and adopt GAI more readily than native speakers. (c) Compared to White, Asian students report higher GAI usage, perceive greater academic benefits, and express a stronger preference for it. Similarly, Black students report a more positive impact of GAI on their academic performance. Personality traits also play a significant role in shaping perceptions and usage of GAI. After controlling demographic factors, we found that personality still significantly predicts GAI use and attitudes: (a) Students with higher conscientiousness use GAI less. (b) Students who are higher in agreeableness perceive a less positive impact of GAI on academic performance and express more ethical concerns about using it for academic work. (c) Students with higher emotional stability report a more positive impact of GAI on learning and fewer concerns about its academic use. (d) Students with higher extraversion show a stronger preference for GAI over traditional resources. (e) Students with higher intellect/imagination tend to prefer traditional resources. These insights highlight the need for universities to provide personalized guidance to ensure students use GAI effectively, ethically, and equitably in their academic pursuits.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Large Language Model Reasoning via Speculative Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tree-search-based reasoning methods have significantly enhanced the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) by facilitating the exploration of multiple intermediate reasoning steps, i.e., thoughts. However, these methods suffer from substantial inference latency, as they have to generate numerous reasoning thoughts, severely limiting LLM applicability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Speculative Search (SpecSearch) framework that significantly accelerates LLM reasoning by optimizing thought generation. Specifically, SpecSearch utilizes a small model to strategically collaborate with a large model at both thought and token levels, efficiently generating high-quality reasoning thoughts. The major pillar of SpecSearch is a novel quality-preserving rejection mechanism, which effectively filters out thoughts whose quality falls below that of the large model's outputs. Moreover, we show that SpecSearch preserves comparable reasoning quality to the large model. Experiments on both the Qwen and Llama models demonstrate that SpecSearch significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to 2.12$\times$ speedup with comparable reasoning quality.</description>

      <title>Decoding Open-Ended Information Seeking Goals from Eye Movements in Reading</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When reading, we often have specific information that interests us in a text. For example, you might be reading this paper because you are curious about LLMs for eye movements in reading, the experimental design, or perhaps you only care about the question ``but does it work?''. More broadly, in daily life, people approach texts with any number of text-specific goals that guide their reading behavior. In this work, we ask, for the first time, whether open-ended reading goals can be automatically decoded from eye movements in reading. To address this question, we introduce goal classification and goal reconstruction tasks and evaluation frameworks, and use large-scale eye tracking for reading data in English with hundreds of text-specific information seeking tasks. We develop and compare several discriminative and generative multimodal LLMs that combine eye movements and text for goal classification and goal reconstruction. Our experiments show considerable success on both tasks, suggesting that LLMs can extract valuable information about the readers' text-specific goals from eye movements.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification for Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is pivotal in enhancing the robustness, reliability, and interpretability of Machine Learning (ML) systems for healthcare, optimizing resources and improving patient care. Despite the emergence of ML-based clinical decision support tools, the lack of principled quantification of uncertainty in ML models remains a major challenge. Current reviews have a narrow focus on analyzing the state-of-the-art UQ in specific healthcare domains without systematically evaluating method efficacy across different stages of model development, and despite a growing body of research, its implementation in healthcare applications remains limited. Therefore, in this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of current UQ in healthcare, offering an informed framework that highlights how different methods can be integrated into each stage of the ML pipeline including data processing, training and evaluation. We also highlight the most popular methods used in healthcare and novel approaches from other domains that hold potential for future adoption in the medical context. We expect this study will provide a clear overview of the challenges and opportunities of implementing UQ in the ML pipeline for healthcare, guiding researchers and practitioners in selecting suitable techniques to enhance the reliability, safety and trust from patients and clinicians on ML-driven healthcare solutions.</description>

      <title>A Wireless Collaborated Inference Acceleration Framework for Plant Disease Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plant disease is a critical factor affecting agricultural production. Traditional manual recognition methods face significant drawbacks, including low accuracy, high costs, and inefficiency. Deep learning techniques have demonstrated significant benefits in identifying plant diseases, but they still face challenges such as inference delays and high energy consumption. Deep learning algorithms are difficult to run on resource-limited embedded devices. Offloading these models to cloud servers is confronted with the restriction of communication bandwidth, and all of these factors will influence the inference's efficiency. We propose a collaborative inference framework for recognizing plant diseases between edge devices and cloud servers to enhance inference speed. The DNN model for plant disease recognition is pruned through deep reinforcement learning to improve the inference speed and reduce energy consumption. Then the optimal split point is determined by a greedy strategy to achieve the best collaborated inference acceleration. Finally, the system for collaborative inference acceleration in plant disease recognition has been implemented using Gradio to facilitate friendly human-machine interaction. Experiments indicate that the proposed collaborative inference framework significantly increases inference speed while maintaining acceptable recognition accuracy, offering a novel solution for rapidly diagnosing and preventing plant diseases.</description>

      <title>Rewriting Pre-Training Data Boosts LLM Performance in Math and Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) in program synthesis and mathematical reasoning is fundamentally limited by the quality of their pre-training corpora. We introduce two openly licensed datasets, released under the Llama 3.3 Community License, that significantly enhance LLM performance by systematically rewriting public data. SwallowCode (approximately 16.1 billion tokens) refines Python snippets from The-Stack-v2 through a novel four-stage pipeline: syntax validation, pylint-based style filtering, and a two-stage LLM rewriting process that enforces style conformity and transforms snippets into self-contained, algorithmically efficient examples. Unlike prior methods that rely on exclusionary filtering or limited transformations, our transform-and-retain approach upgrades low-quality code, maximizing data utility. SwallowMath (approximately 2.3 billion tokens) enhances Finemath-4+ by removing boilerplate, restoring context, and reformatting solutions into concise, step-by-step explanations. Within a fixed 50 billion token training budget, continual pre-training of Llama-3.1-8B with SwallowCode boosts pass@1 by +17.0 on HumanEval and +17.7 on HumanEval+ compared to Stack-Edu, surpassing the baseline model's code generation capabilities. Similarly, substituting SwallowMath yields +12.4 accuracy on GSM8K and +7.6 on MATH. Ablation studies confirm that each pipeline stage contributes incrementally, with rewriting delivering the largest gains. All datasets, prompts, and checkpoints are publicly available, enabling reproducible research and advancing LLM pre-training for specialized domains.</description>

      <title>Unlearning vs. Obfuscation: Are We Truly Removing Knowledge?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlearning has emerged as a critical capability for large language models (LLMs) to support data privacy, regulatory compliance, and ethical AI deployment. Recent techniques often rely on obfuscation by injecting incorrect or irrelevant information to suppress knowledge. Such methods effectively constitute knowledge addition rather than true removal, often leaving models vulnerable to probing. In this paper, we formally distinguish unlearning from obfuscation and introduce a probing-based evaluation framework to assess whether existing approaches genuinely remove targeted information. Moreover, we propose DF-MCQ, a novel unlearning method that flattens the model predictive distribution over automatically generated multiple-choice questions using KL-divergence, effectively removing knowledge about target individuals and triggering appropriate refusal behaviour. Experimental results demonstrate that DF-MCQ achieves unlearning with over 90% refusal rate and a random choice-level uncertainty that is much higher than obfuscation on probing questions.</description>

      <title>Taskmaster Deconstructed: A Quantitative Look at Tension, Volatility, and Viewer Ratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Taskmaster is a British television show that combines comedic performance with a formal scoring system. Despite the appearance of structured competition, it remains unclear whether scoring dynamics contribute meaningfully to audience engagement. We conducted a statistical analysis of 162 episodes across 18 series, using fifteen episode-level metrics to quantify rank volatility, point spread, lead changes, and winner dominance. None of these metrics showed a significant association with IMDb ratings, even after controlling for series effects. Long-term trends suggest that average points have increased over time, while volatility has slightly declined and rank spread has remained stable. These patterns indicate an attempt to enhance competitive visibility without altering the show's structural equilibrium. We also analyzed contestant rank trajectories and identified five recurring archetypes describing performance styles. These patterns suggest that viewer interest is shaped more by contestant behavior than by game mechanics.</description>

      <title>CreoPep: A Universal Deep Learning Framework for Target-Specific Peptide Design and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Target-specific peptides, such as conotoxins, exhibit exceptional binding affinity and selectivity toward ion channels and receptors. However, their therapeutic potential remains underutilized due to the limited diversity of natural variants and the labor-intensive nature of traditional optimization strategies. Here, we present CreoPep, a deep learning-based conditional generative framework that integrates masked language modeling with a progressive masking scheme to design high-affinity peptide mutants while uncovering novel structural motifs. CreoPep employs an integrative augmentation pipeline, combining FoldX-based energy screening with temperature-controlled multinomial sampling, to generate structurally and functionally diverse peptides that retain key pharmacological properties. We validate this approach by designing conotoxin inhibitors targeting the $\alpha$7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, achieving submicromolar potency in electrophysiological assays. Structural analysis reveals that CreoPep-generated variants engage in both conserved and novel binding modes, including disulfide-deficient forms, thus expanding beyond conventional design paradigms. Overall, CreoPep offers a robust and generalizable platform that bridges computational peptide design with experimental validation, accelerating the discovery of next-generation peptide therapeutics.</description>

      <title>When Your Own Output Becomes Your Training Data: Noise-to-Meaning Loops and a Formal RSI Trigger</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Noise-to-Meaning Recursive Self-Improvement (N2M-RSI), a minimal formal model showing that once an AI agent feeds its own outputs back as inputs and crosses an explicit information-integration threshold, its internal complexity will grow without bound under our assumptions. The framework unifies earlier ideas on self-prompting large language models, G\"odelian self-reference, and AutoML, yet remains implementation-agnostic. The model furthermore scales naturally to interacting swarms of agents, hinting at super-linear effects once communication among instances is permitted. For safety reasons, we omit system-specific implementation details and release only a brief, model-agnostic toy prototype in Appendix C.</description>

      <title>Early Prediction of Sepsis: Feature-Aligned Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sepsis is a life threatening medical condition that occurs when the body has an extreme response to infection, leading to widespread inflammation, organ failure, and potentially death. Because sepsis can worsen rapidly, early detection is critical to saving lives. However, current diagnostic methods often identify sepsis only after significant damage has already occurred. Our project aims to address this challenge by developing a machine learning based system to predict sepsis in its early stages, giving healthcare providers more time to intervene.
  A major problem with existing models is the wide variability in the patient information or features they use, such as heart rate, temperature, and lab results. This inconsistency makes models difficult to compare and limits their ability to work across different hospitals and settings. To solve this, we propose a method called Feature Aligned Transfer Learning (FATL), which identifies and focuses on the most important and commonly reported features across multiple studies, ensuring the model remains consistent and clinically relevant.
  Most existing models are trained on narrow patient groups, leading to population bias. FATL addresses this by combining knowledge from models trained on diverse populations, using a weighted approach that reflects each models contribution. This makes the system more generalizable and effective across different patient demographics and clinical environments. FATL offers a practical and scalable solution for early sepsis detection, particularly in hospitals with limited resources, and has the potential to improve patient outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and support more equitable healthcare delivery.</description>

      <title>The Art of Repair: Optimizing Iterative Program Repair with Instruction-Tuned Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic program repair (APR) aims to reduce the manual efforts required to identify and fix errors in source code. Before the rise of LLM-based agents, a common strategy was to increase the number of generated patches, sometimes to the thousands, to achieve better repair results on benchmarks. More recently, self-iterative capabilities enabled LLMs to refine patches over multiple rounds guided by feedback. However, literature often focuses on many iterations and disregards different numbers of outputs.
  We investigate an APR pipeline that balances these two approaches, the generation of multiple outputs and multiple rounds of iteration, while imposing a limit of 10 total patches per bug. We apply three SOTA instruction-tuned LLMs - DeepSeekCoder-Instruct, Codellama-Instruct, Llama3.1-Instruct - to the APR task. We further fine-tune each model on an APR dataset with three sizes (1K, 30K, 65K) and two techniques (Full Fine-Tuning and LoRA), allowing us to assess their repair capabilities on two APR benchmarks: HumanEval-Java and Defects4J.
  Our results show that by using only a fraction (&lt;1%) of the fine-tuning dataset, we can achieve improvements of up to 78% in the number of plausible patches generated, challenging prior studies that reported limited gains using Full Fine-Tuning. However, we find that exceeding certain thresholds leads to diminishing outcomes, likely due to overfitting. Moreover, we show that base models greatly benefit from creating patches in an iterative fashion rather than generating them all at once. In addition, the benefit of iterative strategies becomes more pronounced in complex benchmarks. Even fine-tuned models, while benefiting less from iterations, still gain advantages, particularly on complex benchmarks. The research underscores the need for balanced APR strategies that combine multi-output generation and iterative refinement.</description>

      <title>The Cognitive Foundations of Economic Exchange: A Modular Framework Grounded in Behavioral Evidence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in multi-agent AI is modeling social cooperation under realistic behavioral constraints. Many foundational concepts in economics and ethics such as "trust" or "morality" are often defined informally, without operational criteria or cognitive grounding, which limits their testability and implementation in artificial agents. Drawing on converging empirical evidence from primate behavior, infant cognition, and economic anthropology, we propose a conceptual framework composed of three cognitively minimal mechanisms: individual recognition, reciprocal credence, and cost return sensitivity. This framework reframes trust as a graded cognitive expectation, providing a simulateable basis for reciprocal exchange in artificial agents, and enabling the bottom-up emergence of scalable cooperation and institutional dynamics.</description>

      <title>Generating Narrated Lecture Videos from Slides with Synchronized Highlights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turning static slides into engaging video lectures takes considerable time and effort, requiring presenters to record explanations and visually guide their audience through the material. We introduce an end-to-end system designed to automate this process entirely. Given a slide deck, this system synthesizes a video lecture featuring AI-generated narration synchronized precisely with dynamic visual highlights. These highlights automatically draw attention to the specific concept being discussed, much like an effective presenter would. The core technical contribution is a novel highlight alignment module. This module accurately maps spoken phrases to locations on a given slide using diverse strategies (e.g., Levenshtein distance, LLM-based semantic analysis) at selectable granularities (line or word level) and utilizes timestamp-providing Text-to-Speech (TTS) for timing synchronization. We demonstrate the system's effectiveness through a technical evaluation using a manually annotated slide dataset with 1000 samples, finding that LLM-based alignment achieves high location accuracy (F1 &gt; 92%), significantly outperforming simpler methods, especially on complex, math-heavy content. Furthermore, the calculated generation cost averages under $1 per hour of video, offering potential savings of two orders of magnitude compared to conservative estimates of manual production costs. This combination of high accuracy and extremely low cost positions this approach as a practical and scalable tool for transforming static slides into effective, visually-guided video lectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Rapid Attention Distillation to Linear Attention Decoders at Scale (RADLADS), a protocol for rapidly converting softmax attention transformers into linear attention decoder models, along with two new RWKV-variant architectures, and models converted from popular Qwen2.5 open source models in 7B, 32B, and 72B sizes. Our conversion process requires only 350-700M tokens, less than 0.005% of the token count used to train the original teacher models. Converting to our 72B linear attention model costs less than \$2,000 USD at today's prices, yet quality at inference remains close to the original transformer. These models achieve state-of-the-art downstream performance across a set of standard benchmarks for linear attention models of their size. We release all our models on HuggingFace under the Apache 2.0 license, with the exception of our 72B models which are also governed by the Qwen License Agreement.

      <title>Lesion-Aware Generative Artificial Intelligence for Virtual Contrast-Enhanced Mammography in Breast Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrast-Enhanced Spectral Mammography (CESM) is a dual-energy mammographic technique that improves lesion visibility through the administration of an iodinated contrast agent. It acquires both a low-energy image, comparable to standard mammography, and a high-energy image, which are then combined to produce a dual-energy subtracted image highlighting lesion contrast enhancement. While CESM offers superior diagnostic accuracy compared to standard mammography, its use entails higher radiation exposure and potential side effects associated with the contrast medium. To address these limitations, we propose Seg-CycleGAN, a generative deep learning framework for Virtual Contrast Enhancement in CESM. The model synthesizes high-fidelity dual-energy subtracted images from low-energy images, leveraging lesion segmentation maps to guide the generative process and improve lesion reconstruction. Building upon the standard CycleGAN architecture, Seg-CycleGAN introduces localized loss terms focused on lesion areas, enhancing the synthesis of diagnostically relevant regions. Experiments on the CESM@UCBM dataset demonstrate that Seg-CycleGAN outperforms the baseline in terms of PSNR and SSIM, while maintaining competitive MSE and VIF. Qualitative evaluations further confirm improved lesion fidelity in the generated images. These results suggest that segmentation-aware generative models offer a viable pathway toward contrast-free CESM alternatives.</description>

      <title>Memorization or Interpolation ? Detecting LLM Memorization through Input Perturbation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance through training on massive datasets, they can exhibit concerning behaviors such as verbatim reproduction of training data rather than true generalization. This memorization phenomenon raises significant concerns about data privacy, intellectual property rights, and the reliability of model evaluations. This paper introduces PEARL, a novel approach for detecting memorization in LLMs. PEARL assesses how sensitive an LLM's performance is to input perturbations, enabling memorization detection without requiring access to the model's internals. We investigate how input perturbations affect the consistency of outputs, enabling us to distinguish between true generalization and memorization. Our findings, following extensive experiments on the Pythia open model, provide a robust framework for identifying when the model simply regurgitates learned information. Applied on the GPT 4o models, the PEARL framework not only identified cases of memorization of classic texts from the Bible or common code from HumanEval but also demonstrated that it can provide supporting evidence that some data, such as from the New York Times news articles, were likely part of the training data of a given model.</description>

      <title>A Typology of Synthetic Datasets for Dialogue Processing in Clinical Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic data sets are used across linguistic domains and NLP tasks, particularly in scenarios where authentic data is limited (or even non-existent). One such domain is that of clinical (healthcare) contexts, where there exist significant and long-standing challenges (e.g., privacy, anonymization, and data governance) which have led to the development of an increasing number of synthetic datasets. One increasingly important category of clinical dataset is that of clinical dialogues which are especially sensitive and difficult to collect, and as such are commonly synthesized.
  While such synthetic datasets have been shown to be sufficient in some situations, little theory exists to inform how they may be best used and generalized to new applications. In this paper, we provide an overview of how synthetic datasets are created, evaluated and being used for dialogue related tasks in the medical domain. Additionally, we propose a novel typology for use in classifying types and degrees of data synthesis, to facilitate comparison and evaluation.</description>

Abstract: Autonomous long-horizon mobile manipulation encompasses a multitude of challenges, including scene dynamics, unexplored areas, and error recovery. Recent works have leveraged foundation models for scene-level robotic reasoning and planning. However, the performance of these methods degrades when dealing with a large number of objects and large-scale environments. To address these limitations, we propose MORE, a novel approach for enhancing the capabilities of language models to solve zero-shot mobile manipulation planning for rearrangement tasks. MORE leverages scene graphs to represent environments, incorporates instance differentiation, and introduces an active filtering scheme that extracts task-relevant subgraphs of object and region instances. These steps yield a bounded planning problem, effectively mitigating hallucinations and improving reliability. Additionally, we introduce several enhancements that enable planning across both indoor and outdoor environments. We evaluate MORE on 81 diverse rearrangement tasks from the BEHAVIOR-1K benchmark, where it becomes the first approach to successfully solve a significant share of the benchmark, outperforming recent foundation model-based approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capabilities of our approach in several complex real-world tasks, mimicking everyday activities. We make the code publicly available at https://more-model.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</description>

      <title>Developing A Framework to Support Human Evaluation of Bias in Generated Free Response Text</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM evaluation is challenging even the case of base models. In real world deployments, evaluation is further complicated by the interplay of task specific prompts and experiential context. At scale, bias evaluation is often based on short context, fixed choice benchmarks that can be rapidly evaluated, however, these can lose validity when the LLMs' deployed context differs. Large scale human evaluation is often seen as too intractable and costly. Here we present our journey towards developing a semi-automated bias evaluation framework for free text responses that has human insights at its core. We discuss how we developed an operational definition of bias that helped us automate our pipeline and a methodology for classifying bias beyond multiple choice. We additionally comment on how human evaluation helped us uncover problematic templates in a bias benchmark.</description>

      <title>Latent Adaptive Planner for Dynamic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents Latent Adaptive Planner (LAP), a novel approach for dynamic nonprehensile manipulation tasks that formulates planning as latent space inference, effectively learned from human demonstration videos. Our method addresses key challenges in visuomotor policy learning through a principled variational replanning framework that maintains temporal consistency while efficiently adapting to environmental changes. LAP employs Bayesian updating in latent space to incrementally refine plans as new observations become available, striking an optimal balance between computational efficiency and real-time adaptability. We bridge the embodiment gap between humans and robots through model-based proportional mapping that regenerates accurate kinematic-dynamic joint states and object positions from human demonstrations. Experimental evaluations across multiple complex manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that LAP achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing approaches in success rate, trajectory smoothness, and energy efficiency, particularly in dynamic adaptation scenarios. Our approach enables robots to perform complex interactions with human-like adaptability while providing an expandable framework applicable to diverse robotic platforms using the same human demonstration videos.</description>

      <title>Assessing and Enhancing the Robustness of LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems Through Chaos Engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the application of chaos engineering to enhance the robustness of Large Language Model-Based Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-MAS) in production-like environments under real-world conditions. LLM-MAS can potentially improve a wide range of tasks, from answering questions and generating content to automating customer support and improving decision-making processes. However, LLM-MAS in production or preproduction environments can be vulnerable to emergent errors or disruptions, such as hallucinations, agent failures, and agent communication failures. This study proposes a chaos engineering framework to proactively identify such vulnerabilities in LLM-MAS, assess and build resilience against them, and ensure reliable performance in critical applications.</description>

      <title>Cognitio Emergens: Agency, Dimensions, and Dynamics in Human-AI Knowledge Co-Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific knowledge creation is fundamentally transforming as humans and AI systems evolve beyond tool-user relationships into co-evolutionary epistemic partnerships. When AlphaFold revolutionized protein structure prediction, researchers described engaging with an epistemic partner that reshaped how they conceptualized fundamental relationships. This article introduces Cognitio Emergens (CE), a framework addressing critical limitations in existing models that focus on static roles or narrow metrics while failing to capture how scientific understanding emerges through recursive human-AI interaction over time. CE integrates three components addressing these limitations: Agency Configurations describing how authority distributes between humans and AI (Directed, Contributory, Partnership), with partnerships dynamically oscillating between configurations rather than following linear progression; Epistemic Dimensions capturing six specific capabilities emerging through collaboration across Discovery, Integration, and Projection axes, creating distinctive "capability signatures" that guide development; and Partnership Dynamics identifying forces shaping how these relationships evolve, particularly the risk of epistemic alienation where researchers lose interpretive control over knowledge they formally endorse. Drawing from autopoiesis theory, social systems theory, and organizational modularity, CE reveals how knowledge co-creation emerges through continuous negotiation of roles, values, and organizational structures. By reconceptualizing human-AI scientific collaboration as fundamentally co-evolutionary, CE offers a balanced perspective that neither uncritically celebrates nor unnecessarily fears AI's evolving role, instead providing conceptual tools for cultivating partnerships that maintain meaningful human participation while enabling transformative scientific breakthroughs.</description>

      <title>VISLIX: An XAI Framework for Validating Vision Models with Slice Discovery and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world machine learning models require rigorous evaluation before deployment, especially in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving and surveillance. The evaluation of machine learning models often focuses on data slices, which are subsets of the data that share a set of characteristics. Data slice finding automatically identifies conditions or data subgroups where models underperform, aiding developers in mitigating performance issues. Despite its popularity and effectiveness, data slicing for vision model validation faces several challenges. First, data slicing often needs additional image metadata or visual concepts, and falls short in certain computer vision tasks, such as object detection. Second, understanding data slices is a labor-intensive and mentally demanding process that heavily relies on the expert's domain knowledge. Third, data slicing lacks a human-in-the-loop solution that allows experts to form hypothesis and test them interactively. To overcome these limitations and better support the machine learning operations lifecycle, we introduce VISLIX, a novel visual analytics framework that employs state-of-the-art foundation models to help domain experts analyze slices in computer vision models. Our approach does not require image metadata or visual concepts, automatically generates natural language insights, and allows users to test data slice hypothesis interactively. We evaluate VISLIX with an expert study and three use cases, that demonstrate the effectiveness of our tool in providing comprehensive insights for validating object detection models.</description>

      <title>Motion-compensated cardiac MRI using low-rank diffeomorphic flow (DMoCo)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an unsupervised motion-compensated image reconstruction algorithm for free-breathing and ungated 3D cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We express the image volume corresponding to each specific motion phase as the deformation of a single static image template. The main contribution of the work is the low-rank model for the compact joint representation of the family of diffeomorphisms, parameterized by the motion phases. The diffeomorphism at a specific motion phase is obtained by integrating a parametric velocity field along a path connecting the reference template phase to the motion phase. The velocity field at different phases is represented using a low-rank model. The static template and the low-rank motion model parameters are learned directly from the k-space data in an unsupervised fashion. The more constrained motion model is observed to offer improved recovery compared to current motion-resolved and motion-compensated algorithms for free-breathing 3D cine MRI.</description>

      <title>StableMotion: Training Motion Cleanup Models with Unpaired Corrupted Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion capture (mocap) data often exhibits visually jarring artifacts due to inaccurate sensors and post-processing. Cleaning this corrupted data can require substantial manual effort from human experts, which can be a costly and time-consuming process. Previous data-driven motion cleanup methods offer the promise of automating this cleanup process, but often require in-domain paired corrupted-to-clean training data. Constructing such paired datasets requires access to high-quality, relatively artifact-free motion clips, which often necessitates laborious manual cleanup. In this work, we present StableMotion, a simple yet effective method for training motion cleanup models directly from unpaired corrupted datasets that need cleanup. The core component of our method is the introduction of motion quality indicators, which can be easily annotated through manual labeling or heuristic algorithms and enable training of quality-aware motion generation models on raw motion data with mixed quality. At test time, the model can be prompted to generate high-quality motions using the quality indicators. Our method can be implemented through a simple diffusion-based framework, leading to a unified motion generate-discriminate model, which can be used to both identify and fix corrupted frames. We demonstrate that our proposed method is effective for training motion cleanup models on raw mocap data in production scenarios by applying StableMotion to SoccerMocap, a 245-hour soccer mocap dataset containing real-world motion artifacts. The trained model effectively corrects a wide range of motion artifacts, reducing motion pops and frozen frames by 68% and 81%, respectively.

      <title>Soft Best-of-n Sampling for Model Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Best-of-$n$ (BoN) sampling is a practical approach for aligning language model outputs with human preferences without expensive fine-tuning. BoN sampling is performed by generating $n$ responses to a prompt and then selecting the sample that maximizes a reward function. BoN yields high reward values in practice at a distortion cost, as measured by the KL-divergence between the sampled and original distribution. This distortion is coarsely controlled by varying the number of samples: larger $n$ yields a higher reward at a higher distortion cost. We introduce Soft Best-of-$n$ sampling, a generalization of BoN that allows for smooth interpolation between the original distribution and reward-maximizing distribution through a temperature parameter $\lambda$. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that Soft Best-of-$n$ sampling converges sharply to the optimal tilted distribution at a rate of $O(1/n)$ in KL and the expected (relative) reward. For sequences of discrete outputs, we analyze an additive reward model that reveals the fundamental limitations of blockwise sampling.</description>

      <title>Null Counterfactual Factor Interactions for Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hindsight relabeling is a powerful tool for overcoming sparsity in goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL), especially in certain domains such as navigation and locomotion. However, hindsight relabeling can struggle in object-centric domains. For example, suppose that the goal space consists of a robotic arm pushing a particular target block to a goal location. In this case, hindsight relabeling will give high rewards to any trajectory that does not interact with the block. However, these behaviors are only useful when the object is already at the goal -- an extremely rare case in practice. A dataset dominated by these kinds of trajectories can complicate learning and lead to failures. In object-centric domains, one key intuition is that meaningful trajectories are often characterized by object-object interactions such as pushing the block with the gripper. To leverage this intuition, we introduce Hindsight Relabeling using Interactions (HInt), which combines interactions with hindsight relabeling to improve the sample efficiency of downstream RL. However because interactions do not have a consensus statistical definition tractable for downstream GCRL, we propose a definition of interactions based on the concept of null counterfactual: a cause object is interacting with a target object if, in a world where the cause object did not exist, the target object would have different transition dynamics. We leverage this definition to infer interactions in Null Counterfactual Interaction Inference (NCII), which uses a "nulling'' operation with a learned model to infer interactions. NCII is able to achieve significantly improved interaction inference accuracy in both simple linear dynamics domains and dynamic robotic domains in Robosuite, Robot Air Hockey, and Franka Kitchen and HInt improves sample efficiency by up to 4x.</description>

      <title>RAVU: Retrieval Augmented Video Understanding with Compositional Reasoning over Graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comprehending long videos remains a significant challenge for Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs). Current LMMs struggle to process even minutes to hours videos due to their lack of explicit memory and retrieval mechanisms. To address this limitation, we propose RAVU (Retrieval Augmented Video Understanding), a novel framework for video understanding enhanced by retrieval with compositional reasoning over a spatio-temporal graph. We construct a graph representation of the video, capturing both spatial and temporal relationships between entities. This graph serves as a long-term memory, allowing us to track objects and their actions across time. To answer complex queries, we decompose the queries into a sequence of reasoning steps and execute these steps on the graph, retrieving relevant key information. Our approach enables more accurate understanding of long videos, particularly for queries that require multi-hop reasoning and tracking objects across frames. Our approach demonstrate superior performances with limited retrieved frames (5-10) compared with other SOTA methods and baselines on two major video QA datasets, NExT-QA and EgoSchema.</description>

      <title>seq-JEPA: Autoregressive Predictive Learning of Invariant-Equivariant World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current self-supervised algorithms mostly rely on transformations such as data augmentation and masking to learn visual representations. This is achieved by inducing invariance or equivariance with respect to these transformations after encoding two views of an image. This dominant two-view paradigm can limit the flexibility of learned representations for downstream adaptation by creating performance trade-offs between invariance-related tasks such as image classification and more fine-grained equivariance-related tasks. In this work, we introduce \emph{seq-JEPA}, a world modeling paradigm based on joint-embedding predictive architecture that leverages architectural inductive biases to resolve this trade-off. Without requiring an additional equivariance predictor or loss term, seq-JEPA simultaneously learns two architecturally segregated representations: one equivariant to the specified transformations and another invariant to them and suited for tasks such as classification. To do so, our model processes a short sequence of different views (observations) of an input image. Each encoded view is concatenated with embeddings corresponding to the relative transformation (action) producing the next observation in the sequence. A transformer encoder outputs an aggregate representation of this sequence, which is subsequently conditioned on the action leading to the next observation to predict its representation. Empirically, seq-JEPA achieves strong performance on equivariant benchmarks and image classification without sacrificing one for the other. Additionally, our framework excels at tasks that inherently require aggregating a sequence of observations, such as path integration across actions and predictive learning across eye movements.</description>

      <title>A study on audio synchronous steganography detection and distributed guide inference model based on sliding spectral features and intelligent inference drive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise of short video platforms in global communication, embedding steganographic data in audio synchronization streams has emerged as a new covert communication method. To address the limitations of traditional techniques in detecting synchronized steganography, this paper proposes a detection and distributed guidance reconstruction model based on short video "Yupan" samples released by China's South Sea Fleet on TikTok. The method integrates sliding spectrum feature extraction and intelligent inference mechanisms. A 25 ms sliding window with short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is used to extract the main frequency trajectory and construct the synchronization frame detection model (M1), identifying a frame flag "FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF80". The subsequent 32-byte payload is decoded by a structured model (M2) to infer distributed guidance commands. Analysis reveals a low-entropy, repetitive byte sequence in the 36 to 45 second audio segment with highly concentrated spectral energy, confirming the presence of synchronization frames. Although plaintext semantics are not restored, the consistency in command field layout suggests features of military communication protocols. The multi-segment splicing model further shows cross-video embedding and centralized decoding capabilities. The proposed framework validates the effectiveness of sliding spectral features for synchronized steganography detection and builds an extensible inference model for covert communication analysis and tactical guidance simulation on open platforms.</description>

      <title>A Trustworthy Multi-LLM Network: Challenges,Solutions, and A Use Case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong potential across a variety of tasks in communications and networking due to their advanced reasoning capabilities. However, because different LLMs have different model structures and are trained using distinct corpora and methods, they may offer varying optimization strategies for the same network issues. Moreover, the limitations of an individual LLM's training data, aggravated by the potential maliciousness of its hosting device, can result in responses with low confidence or even bias. To address these challenges, we propose a blockchain-enabled collaborative framework that connects multiple LLMs into a Trustworthy Multi-LLM Network (MultiLLMN). This architecture enables the cooperative evaluation and selection of the most reliable and high-quality responses to complex network optimization problems. Specifically, we begin by reviewing related work and highlighting the limitations of existing LLMs in collaboration and trust, emphasizing the need for trustworthiness in LLM-based systems. We then introduce the workflow and design of the proposed Trustworthy MultiLLMN framework. Given the severity of False Base Station (FBS) attacks in B5G and 6G communication systems and the difficulty of addressing such threats through traditional modeling techniques, we present FBS defense as a case study to empirically validate the effectiveness of our approach. Finally, we outline promising future research directions in this emerging area.</description>

      <title>DocSpiral: A Platform for Integrated Assistive Document Annotation through Human-in-the-Spiral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acquiring structured data from domain-specific, image-based documents such as scanned reports is crucial for many downstream tasks but remains challenging due to document variability. Many of these documents exist as images rather than as machine-readable text, which requires human annotation to train automated extraction systems. We present DocSpiral, the first Human-in-the-Spiral assistive document annotation platform, designed to address the challenge of extracting structured information from domain-specific, image-based document collections. Our spiral design establishes an iterative cycle in which human annotations train models that progressively require less manual intervention. DocSpiral integrates document format normalization, comprehensive annotation interfaces, evaluation metrics dashboard, and API endpoints for the development of AI / ML models into a unified workflow. Experiments demonstrate that our framework reduces annotation time by at least 41\% while showing consistent performance gains across three iterations during model training. By making this annotation platform freely accessible, we aim to lower barriers to AI/ML models development in document processing, facilitating the adoption of large language models in image-based, document-intensive fields such as geoscience and healthcare. The system is freely available at: https://app.ai4wa.com. The demonstration video is available: https://app.ai4wa.com/docs/docspiral/demo.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Evolution: Integrating PSO Principles into Real-Coded Genetic Algorithm Crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces an innovative crossover operator named Particle Swarm Optimization-inspired Crossover (PSOX), which is specifically developed for real-coded genetic algorithms. Departing from conventional crossover approaches that only exchange information between individuals within the same generation, PSOX uniquely incorporates guidance from both the current global best solution and historical optimal solutions across multiple generations. This novel mechanism enables the algorithm to maintain population diversity while simultaneously accelerating convergence toward promising regions of the search space. The effectiveness of PSOX is rigorously evaluated through comprehensive experiments on 15 benchmark test functions with diverse characteristics, including unimodal, multimodal, and highly complex landscapes. Comparative analysis against five state-of-the-art crossover operators reveals that PSOX consistently delivers superior performance in terms of solution accuracy, algorithmic stability, and convergence speed, especially when combined with an appropriate mutation strategy. Furthermore, the study provides an in-depth investigation of how different mutation rates influence PSOX's performance, yielding practical guidelines for parameter tuning when addressing optimization problems with varying landscape properties.</description>

      <title>Seeing the Abstract: Translating the Abstract Language for Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural language goes beyond dryly describing visual content. It contains rich abstract concepts to express feeling, creativity and properties that cannot be directly perceived. Yet, current research in Vision Language Models (VLMs) has not shed light on abstract-oriented language. Our research breaks new ground by uncovering its wide presence and under-estimated value, with extensive analysis. Particularly, we focus our investigation on the fashion domain, a highly-representative field with abstract expressions. By analyzing recent large-scale multimodal fashion datasets, we find that abstract terms have a dominant presence, rivaling the concrete ones, providing novel information, and being useful in the retrieval task. However, a critical challenge emerges: current general-purpose or fashion-specific VLMs are pre-trained with databases that lack sufficient abstract words in their text corpora, thus hindering their ability to effectively represent abstract-oriented language. We propose a training-free and model-agnostic method, Abstract-to-Concrete Translator (ACT), to shift abstract representations towards well-represented concrete ones in the VLM latent space, using pre-trained models and existing multimodal databases. On the text-to-image retrieval task, despite being training-free, ACT outperforms the fine-tuned VLMs in both same- and cross-dataset settings, exhibiting its effectiveness with a strong generalization capability. Moreover, the improvement introduced by ACT is consistent with various VLMs, making it a plug-and-play solution.</description>

      <title>Synthline: A Product Line Approach for Synthetic Requirements Engineering Data Generation using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While modern Requirements Engineering (RE) heavily relies on natural language processing and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, their effectiveness is limited by the scarcity of high-quality datasets. This paper introduces Synthline, a Product Line (PL) approach that leverages Large Language Models to systematically generate synthetic RE data for classification-based use cases. Through an empirical evaluation conducted in the context of using ML for the identification of requirements specification defects, we investigated both the diversity of the generated data and its utility for training downstream models. Our analysis reveals that while synthetic datasets exhibit less diversity than real data, they are good enough to serve as viable training resources. Moreover, our evaluation shows that combining synthetic and real data leads to substantial performance improvements. Specifically, hybrid approaches achieve up to 85% improvement in precision and a 2x increase in recall compared to models trained exclusively on real data. These findings demonstrate the potential of PL-based synthetic data generation to address data scarcity in RE. We make both our implementation and generated datasets publicly available to support reproducibility and advancement in the field.</description>

      <title>Physics-inspired Energy Transition Neural Network for Sequence Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the superior performance of Transformers has made them a more robust and scalable solution for sequence modeling than traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, the effectiveness of Transformer in capturing long-term dependencies is primarily attributed to their comprehensive pair-modeling process rather than inherent inductive biases toward sequence semantics. In this study, we explore the capabilities of pure RNNs and reassess their long-term learning mechanisms. Inspired by the physics energy transition models that track energy changes over time, we propose a effective recurrent structure called the``Physics-inspired Energy Transition Neural Network" (PETNN). We demonstrate that PETNN's memory mechanism effectively stores information over long-term dependencies. Experimental results indicate that PETNN outperforms transformer-based methods across various sequence tasks. Furthermore, owing to its recurrent nature, PETNN exhibits significantly lower complexity. Our study presents an optimal foundational recurrent architecture and highlights the potential for developing effective recurrent neural networks in fields currently dominated by Transformer.</description>

      <title>The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Discrete-Time Gaussian Process Mixtures for Robot Policy Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Mixture of Discrete-time Gaussian Processes (MiDiGap), a novel approach for flexible policy representation and imitation learning in robot manipulation. MiDiGap enables learning from as few as five demonstrations using only camera observations and generalizes across a wide range of challenging tasks. It excels at long-horizon behaviors such as making coffee, highly constrained motions such as opening doors, dynamic actions such as scooping with a spatula, and multimodal tasks such as hanging a mug. MiDiGap learns these tasks on a CPU in less than a minute and scales linearly to large datasets. We also develop a rich suite of tools for inference-time steering using evidence such as collision signals and robot kinematic constraints. This steering enables novel generalization capabilities, including obstacle avoidance and cross-embodiment policy transfer. MiDiGap achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse few-shot manipulation benchmarks. On constrained RLBench tasks, it improves policy success by 76 percentage points and reduces trajectory cost by 67%. On multimodal tasks, it improves policy success by 48 percentage points and increases sample efficiency by a factor of 20. In cross-embodiment transfer, it more than doubles policy success. We make the code publicly available at https://midigap.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Benchmarking of Foundation Models in Remote Sensing: A Capabilities Encoding Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models constitute a significant advancement in computer vision: after a single, albeit costly, training phase, they can address a wide array of tasks. In the field of Earth observation, over 75 remote sensing vision foundation models have been developed in the past four years. However, none has consistently outperformed the others across all available downstream tasks. To facilitate their comparison, we propose a cost-effective method for predicting a model's performance on multiple downstream tasks without the need for fine-tuning on each one. This method is based on what we call "capabilities encoding." The utility of this novel approach is twofold: we demonstrate its potential to simplify the selection of a foundation model for a given new task, and we employ it to offer a fresh perspective on the existing literature, suggesting avenues for future research. Codes are available at https://github.com/pierreadorni/capabilities-encoding.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Lightweight Deep Learning Models for Memory-Constrained Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of lightweight deep learning models for image classification, emphasizing their suitability for deployment in resource-constrained environments such as low-memory devices. Five state-of-the-art architectures - MobileNetV3 Small, ResNet18, SqueezeNet, EfficientNetV2-S, and ShuffleNetV2 - are benchmarked across three diverse datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet. The models are assessed using four key performance metrics: classification accuracy, inference time, floating-point operations (FLOPs), and model size. Additionally, we investigate the impact of hyperparameter tuning, data augmentation, and training paradigms by comparing pretrained models with scratch-trained counterparts, focusing on MobileNetV3 Small. Our findings reveal that transfer learning significantly enhances model accuracy and computational efficiency, particularly for complex datasets like Tiny ImageNet. EfficientNetV2 consistently achieves the highest accuracy, while MobileNetV3 offers the best balance between accuracy and efficiency, and SqueezeNet excels in inference speed and compactness. This study highlights critical trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, offering actionable insights for deploying lightweight models in real-world applications where computational resources are limited. By addressing these challenges, this research contributes to optimizing deep learning systems for edge computing and mobile platforms.</description>

      <title>Mamba-Diffusion Model with Learnable Wavelet for Controllable Symbolic Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent surge in the popularity of diffusion models for image synthesis has attracted new attention to their potential for generation tasks in other domains. However, their applications to symbolic music generation remain largely under-explored because symbolic music is typically represented as sequences of discrete events and standard diffusion models are not well-suited for discrete data. We represent symbolic music as image-like pianorolls, facilitating the use of diffusion models for the generation of symbolic music. Moreover, this study introduces a novel diffusion model that incorporates our proposed Transformer-Mamba block and learnable wavelet transform. Classifier-free guidance is utilised to generate symbolic music with target chords. Our evaluation shows that our method achieves compelling results in terms of music quality and controllability, outperforming the strong baseline in pianoroll generation.

      <title>SD-VSum: A Method and Dataset for Script-Driven Video Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the task of script-driven video summarization, which aims to produce a summary of the full-length video by selecting the parts that are most relevant to a user-provided script outlining the visual content of the desired summary. Following, we extend a recently-introduced large-scale dataset for generic video summarization (VideoXum) by producing natural language descriptions of the different human-annotated summaries that are available per video. In this way we make it compatible with the introduced task, since the available triplets of ``video, summary and summary description'' can be used for training a method that is able to produce different summaries for a given video, driven by the provided script about the content of each summary. Finally, we develop a new network architecture for script-driven video summarization (SD-VSum), that relies on the use of a cross-modal attention mechanism for aligning and fusing information from the visual and text modalities. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate the advanced performance of SD-VSum against state-of-the-art approaches for query-driven and generic (unimodal and multimodal) summarization from the literature, and document its capacity to produce video summaries that are adapted to each user's needs about their content.</description>

      <title>Very High-Resolution Forest Mapping with TanDEM-X InSAR Data and Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models have shown encouraging capabilities for mapping accurately forests at medium resolution with TanDEM-X interferometric SAR data. Such models, as most of current state-of-the-art deep learning techniques in remote sensing, are trained in a fully-supervised way, which requires a large amount of labeled data for training and validation. In this work, our aim is to exploit the high-resolution capabilities of the TanDEM-X mission to map forests at 6 m. The goal is to overcome the intrinsic limitations posed by midresolution products, which affect, e.g., the detection of narrow roads within vegetated areas and the precise delineation of forested regions contours. To cope with the lack of extended reliable reference datasets at such a high resolution, we investigate self-supervised learning techniques for extracting highly informative representations from the input features, followed by a supervised training step with a significantly smaller number of reliable labels. A 1 m resolution forest/non-forest reference map over Pennsylvania, USA, allows for comparing different training approaches for the development of an effective forest mapping framework with limited labeled samples. We select the best-performing approach over this test region and apply it in a real-case forest mapping scenario over the Amazon rainforest, where only very few labeled data at high resolution are available. In this challenging scenario, the proposed self-supervised framework significantly enhances the classification accuracy with respect to fully-supervised methods, trained using the same amount of labeled data, representing an extremely promising starting point for large-scale, very high-resolution forest mapping with TanDEM-X data.</description>

      <title>Absolute Zero: Reinforced Self-play Reasoning with Zero Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03335v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown promise in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models by learning directly from outcome-based rewards. Recent RLVR works that operate under the zero setting avoid supervision in labeling the reasoning process, but still depend on manually curated collections of questions and answers for training. The scarcity of high-quality, human-produced examples raises concerns about the long-term scalability of relying on human supervision, a challenge already evident in the domain of language model pretraining. Furthermore, in a hypothetical future where AI surpasses human intelligence, tasks provided by humans may offer limited learning potential for a superintelligent system. To address these concerns, we propose a new RLVR paradigm called Absolute Zero, in which a single model learns to propose tasks that maximize its own learning progress and improves reasoning by solving them, without relying on any external data. Under this paradigm, we introduce the Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR), a system that self-evolves its training curriculum and reasoning ability by using a code executor to both validate proposed code reasoning tasks and verify answers, serving as an unified source of verifiable reward to guide open-ended yet grounded learning. Despite being trained entirely without external data, AZR achieves overall SOTA performance on coding and mathematical reasoning tasks, outperforming existing zero-setting models that rely on tens of thousands of in-domain human-curated examples. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AZR can be effectively applied across different model scales and is compatible with various model classes.</description>

      <title>Avoid Recommending Out-of-Domain Items: Constrained Generative Recommendation with LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for generative recommender systems due to their transformative capabilities in user interaction. However, ensuring they do not recommend out-of-domain (OOD) items remains a challenge. We study two distinct methods to address this issue: RecLM-ret, a retrieval-based method, and RecLM-cgen, a constrained generation method. Both methods integrate seamlessly with existing LLMs to ensure in-domain recommendations. Comprehensive experiments on three recommendation datasets demonstrate that RecLM-cgen consistently outperforms RecLM-ret and existing LLM-based recommender models in accuracy while eliminating OOD recommendations, making it the preferred method for adoption. Additionally, RecLM-cgen maintains strong generalist capabilities and is a lightweight plug-and-play module for easy integration into LLMs, offering valuable practical benefits for the community.

Abstract: Visual Generative AI models have demonstrated remarkable capability in generating high-quality images from simple inputs like text prompts. However, because these models are trained on images from diverse sources, they risk memorizing and reproducing specific content, raising concerns about intellectual property (IP) infringement. Recent advances in prompt engineering offer a cost-effective way to enhance generative AI performance. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of prompt engineering techniques in mitigating IP infringement risks in image generation. Our findings show that Chain of Thought Prompting and Task Instruction Prompting significantly reduce the similarity between generated images and the training data of diffusion models, thereby lowering the risk of IP infringement.</description>

      <title>SPAP: Structured Pruning via Alternating Optimization and Penalty Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is often constrained by their substantial computational and memory demands. While structured pruning presents a viable approach by eliminating entire network components, existing methods suffer from performance degradation, reliance on heuristic metrics, or expensive finetuning. To address these challenges, we propose SPAP (Structured Pruning via Alternating Optimization and Penalty Methods), a novel and efficient structured pruning framework for LLMs grounded in optimization theory. SPAP formulates the pruning problem through a mixed-integer optimization model, employs a penalty method that effectively makes pruning decisions to minimize pruning errors, and introduces an alternating minimization algorithm tailored to the splittable problem structure for efficient weight updates and performance recovery. Extensive experiments on OPT, LLaMA-3/3.1/3.2, and Qwen2.5 models demonstrate SPAP's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, delivering linear inference speedups (1.29$\times$ at 30% sparsity) and proportional memory reductions. Our work offers a practical, optimization-driven solution for pruning LLMs while preserving model performance.</description>

      <title>Reinforced Correlation Between Vision and Language for Precise Medical AI Assistant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical AI assistants support doctors in disease diagnosis, medical image analysis, and report generation. However, they still face significant challenges in clinical use, including limited accuracy with multimodal content and insufficient validation in real-world settings. We propose RCMed, a full-stack AI assistant that improves multimodal alignment in both input and output, enabling precise anatomical delineation, accurate localization, and reliable diagnosis through hierarchical vision-language grounding. A self-reinforcing correlation mechanism allows visual features to inform language context, while language semantics guide pixel-wise attention, forming a closed loop that refines both modalities. This correlation is enhanced by a color region description strategy, translating anatomical structures into semantically rich text to learn shape-location-text relationships across scales. Trained on 20 million image-mask-description triplets, RCMed achieves state-of-the-art precision in contextualizing irregular lesions and subtle anatomical boundaries, excelling in 165 clinical tasks across 9 modalities. It achieved a 23.5% relative improvement in cell segmentation from microscopy images over prior methods. RCMed's strong vision-language alignment enables exceptional generalization, with state-of-the-art performance in external validation across 20 clinically significant cancer types, including novel tasks. This work demonstrates how integrated multimodal models capture fine-grained patterns, enabling human-level interpretation in complex scenarios and advancing human-centric AI healthcare.</description>

      <title>Automatic Calibration for Membership Inference Attack on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) have recently been employed to determine whether a specific text was part of the pre-training data of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing methods often misinfer non-members as members, leading to a high false positive rate, or depend on additional reference models for probability calibration, which limits their practicality. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel framework called Automatic Calibration Membership Inference Attack (ACMIA), which utilizes a tunable temperature to calibrate output probabilities effectively. This approach is inspired by our theoretical insights into maximum likelihood estimation during the pre-training of LLMs. We introduce ACMIA in three configurations designed to accommodate different levels of model access and increase the probability gap between members and non-members, improving the reliability and robustness of membership inference. Extensive experiments on various open-source LLMs demonstrate that our proposed attack is highly effective, robust, and generalizable, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines across three widely used benchmarks. Our code is available at: \href{https://github.com/Salehzz/ACMIA}{\textcolor{blue}{Github}}.</description>

      <title>DDaTR: Dynamic Difference-aware Temporal Residual Network for Longitudinal Radiology Report Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) automates the creation of radiology reports from medical imaging, enhancing the efficiency of the reporting process. Longitudinal Radiology Report Generation (LRRG) extends RRG by incorporating the ability to compare current and prior exams, facilitating the tracking of temporal changes in clinical findings. Existing LRRG approaches only extract features from prior and current images using a visual pre-trained encoder, which are then concatenated to generate the final report. However, these methods struggle to effectively capture both spatial and temporal correlations during the feature extraction process. Consequently, the extracted features inadequately capture the information of difference across exams and thus underrepresent the expected progressions, leading to sub-optimal performance in LRRG. To address this, we develop a novel dynamic difference-aware temporal residual network (DDaTR). In DDaTR, we introduce two modules at each stage of the visual encoder to capture multi-level spatial correlations. The Dynamic Feature Alignment Module (DFAM) is designed to align prior features across modalities for the integrity of prior clinical information. Prompted by the enriched prior features, the dynamic difference-aware module (DDAM) captures favorable difference information by identifying relationships across exams. Furthermore, our DDaTR employs the dynamic residual network to unidirectionally transmit longitudinal information, effectively modelling temporal correlations. Extensive experiments demonstrated superior performance over existing methods on three benchmarks, proving its efficacy in both RRG and LRRG tasks.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Clinical Decision Support System using QLoRA-Fine-Tuned LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research paper investigates the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare, specifically focusing on enhancing medical decision support through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrated with hospital-specific data and fine-tuning using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA). The system utilizes Llama 3.2-3B-Instruct as its foundation model. By embedding and retrieving context-relevant healthcare information, the system significantly improves response accuracy. QLoRA facilitates notable parameter efficiency and memory optimization, preserving the integrity of medical information through specialized quantization techniques. Our research also shows that our model performs relatively well on various medical benchmarks, indicating that it can be used to make basic medical suggestions. This paper details the system's technical components, including its architecture, quantization methods, and key healthcare applications such as enhanced disease prediction from patient symptoms and medical history, treatment suggestions, and efficient summarization of complex medical reports. We touch on the ethical considerations-patient privacy, data security, and the need for rigorous clinical validation-as well as the practical challenges of integrating such systems into real-world healthcare workflows. Furthermore, the lightweight quantized weights ensure scalability and ease of deployment even in low-resource hospital environments. Finally, the paper concludes with an analysis of the broader impact of LLMs on healthcare and outlines future directions for LLMs in medical settings.</description>

      <title>Framework GNN-AID: Graph Neural Network Analysis Interpretation and Defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing need for Trusted AI (TAI) highlights the importance of interpretability and robustness in machine learning models. However, many existing tools overlook graph data and rarely combine these two aspects into a single solution. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a popular approach, achieving top results across various tasks. We introduce GNN-AID (Graph Neural Network Analysis, Interpretation, and Defense), an open-source framework designed for graph data to address this gap. Built as a Python library, GNN-AID supports advanced trust methods and architectural layers, allowing users to analyze graph datasets and GNN behavior using attacks, defenses, and interpretability methods.
  GNN-AID is built on PyTorch-Geometric, offering preloaded datasets, models, and support for any GNNs through customizable interfaces. It also includes a web interface with tools for graph visualization and no-code features like an interactive model builder, simplifying the exploration and analysis of GNNs. The framework also supports MLOps techniques, ensuring reproducibility and result versioning to track and revisit analyses efficiently.
  GNN-AID is a flexible tool for developers and researchers. It helps developers create, analyze, and customize graph models, while also providing access to prebuilt datasets and models for quick experimentation. Researchers can use the framework to explore advanced topics on the relationship between interpretability and robustness, test defense strategies, and combine methods to protect against different types of attacks.
  We also show how defenses against evasion and poisoning attacks can conflict when applied to graph data, highlighting the complex connections between defense strategies.

      <title>Phenotype-Guided Generative Model for High-Fidelity Cardiac MRI Synthesis: Advancing Pretraining and Clinical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging is a vital non-invasive tool for diagnosing heart diseases and evaluating cardiac health. However, the limited availability of large-scale, high-quality CMR datasets poses a major challenge to the effective application of artificial intelligence (AI) in this domain. Even the amount of unlabeled data and the health status it covers are difficult to meet the needs of model pretraining, which hinders the performance of AI models on downstream tasks. In this study, we present Cardiac Phenotype-Guided CMR Generation (CPGG), a novel approach for generating diverse CMR data that covers a wide spectrum of cardiac health status. The CPGG framework consists of two stages: in the first stage, a generative model is trained using cardiac phenotypes derived from CMR data; in the second stage, a masked autoregressive diffusion model, conditioned on these phenotypes, generates high-fidelity CMR cine sequences that capture both structural and functional features of the heart in a fine-grained manner. We synthesized a massive amount of CMR to expand the pretraining data. Experimental results show that CPGG generates high-quality synthetic CMR data, significantly improving performance on various downstream tasks, including diagnosis and cardiac phenotypes prediction. These gains are demonstrated across both public and private datasets, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. Code is availabel at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CPGG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant promise for various applications in healthcare. However, their efficacy in the Arabic medical domain remains unexplored due to the lack of high-quality domain-specific datasets and benchmarks. This study introduces MedArabiQ, a novel benchmark dataset consisting of seven Arabic medical tasks, covering multiple specialties and including multiple choice questions, fill-in-the-blank, and patient-doctor question answering. We first constructed the dataset using past medical exams and publicly available datasets. We then introduced different modifications to evaluate various LLM capabilities, including bias mitigation. We conducted an extensive evaluation with five state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini 1.5. Our findings highlight the need for the creation of new high-quality benchmarks that span different languages to ensure fair deployment and scalability of LLMs in healthcare. By establishing this benchmark and releasing the dataset, we provide a foundation for future research aimed at evaluating and enhancing the multilingual capabilities of LLMs for the equitable use of generative AI in healthcare.</description>

Abstract: Centralized and distributed systems are two main approaches to organizing ICT infrastructure, each with its pros and cons. Centralized systems concentrate resources in one location, making management easier but creating single points of failure. Distributed systems, on the other hand, spread resources across multiple nodes, offering better scalability and fault tolerance, but requiring more complex management. The choice between them depends on factors like application needs, scalability, and data sensitivity. Centralized systems suit applications with limited scalability and centralized control, while distributed systems excel in large-scale environments requiring high availability and performance. This paper explores a distributed document repository system developed for the Italian Ministry of Justice, using edge repositories to analyze textual data and metadata, enhancing semantic exploration capabilities.</description>

      <title>Detecting Quishing Attacks with Machine Learning Techniques Through QR Code Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of QR code based phishing ("Quishing") poses a growing cybersecurity threat, as attackers increasingly exploit QR codes to bypass traditional phishing defenses. Existing detection methods predominantly focus on URL analysis, which requires the extraction of the QR code payload, and may inadvertently expose users to malicious content. Moreover, QR codes can encode various types of data beyond URLs, such as Wi-Fi credentials and payment information, making URL-based detection insufficient for broader security concerns. To address these gaps, we propose the first framework for quishing detection that directly analyzes QR code structure and pixel patterns without extracting the embedded content. We generated a dataset of phishing and benign QR codes and we used it to train and evaluate multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, LightGBM, and XGBoost. Our best-performing model (XGBoost) achieves an AUC of 0.9106, demonstrating the feasibility of QR-centric detection. Through feature importance analysis, we identify key visual indicators of malicious intent and refine our feature set by removing non-informative pixels, improving performance to an AUC of 0.9133 with a reduced feature space. Our findings reveal that the structural features of QR code correlate strongly with phishing risk. This work establishes a foundation for quishing mitigation and highlights the potential of direct QR analysis as a critical layer in modern phishing defenses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding the optimal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) configuration for a given use case can be complex and expensive. Motivated by this challenge, frameworks for RAG hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) have recently emerged, yet their effectiveness has not been rigorously benchmarked. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive study involving 5 HPO algorithms over 5 datasets from diverse domains, including a new one collected for this work on real-world product documentation. Our study explores the largest HPO search space considered to date, with two optimized evaluation metrics. Analysis of the results shows that RAG HPO can be done efficiently, either greedily or with iterative random search, and that it significantly boosts RAG performance for all datasets. For greedy HPO approaches, we show that optimizing models first is preferable to the prevalent practice of optimizing sequentially according to the RAG pipeline order.</description>

      <title>Blending 3D Geometry and Machine Learning for Multi-View Stereopsis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional multi-view stereo (MVS) methods primarily depend on photometric and geometric consistency constraints. In contrast, modern learning-based algorithms often rely on the plane sweep algorithm to infer 3D geometry, applying explicit geometric consistency (GC) checks only as a post-processing step, with no impact on the learning process itself. In this work, we introduce GC MVSNet plus plus, a novel approach that actively enforces geometric consistency of reference view depth maps across multiple source views (multi view) and at various scales (multi scale) during the learning phase (see Fig. 1). This integrated GC check significantly accelerates the learning process by directly penalizing geometrically inconsistent pixels, effectively halving the number of training iterations compared to other MVS methods. Furthermore, we introduce a densely connected cost regularization network with two distinct block designs simple and feature dense optimized to harness dense feature connections for enhanced regularization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves a new state of the art on the DTU and BlendedMVS datasets and secures second place on the Tanks and Temples benchmark. To our knowledge, GC MVSNet plus plus is the first method to enforce multi-view, multi-scale supervised geometric consistency during learning. Our code is available.</description>

      <title>A new membership inference attack that spots memorization in generative and predictive models: Loss-Based with Reference Model algorithm (LBRM)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models can unintentionally memorize training data, posing significant privacy risks. This paper addresses the memorization phenomenon in time series imputation models, introducing the Loss-Based with Reference Model (LBRM) algorithm. The LBRM method leverages a reference model to enhance the accuracy of membership inference attacks, distinguishing between training and test data. Our contributions are twofold: first, we propose an innovative method to effectively extract and identify memorized training data, significantly improving detection accuracy. On average, without fine-tuning, the AUROC improved by approximately 40\%. With fine-tuning, the AUROC increased by approximately 60\%. Second, we validate our approach through membership inference attacks on two types of architectures designed for time series imputation, demonstrating the robustness and versatility of the LBRM approach in different contexts. These results highlight the significant enhancement in detection accuracy provided by the LBRM approach, addressing privacy risks in time series imputation models.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm for reservoir computing (RC) that leverages a pool of cultured biological neurons as the reservoir substrate, creating a biological reservoir computing (BRC). This system operates similarly to an echo state network (ESN), with the key distinction that the neural activity is generated by a network of cultured neurons, rather than being modeled by traditional artificial computational units. The neuronal activity is recorded using a multi-electrode array (MEA), which enables high-throughput recording of neural signals. In our approach, inputs are introduced into the network through a subset of the MEA electrodes, while the remaining electrodes capture the resulting neural activity. This generates a nonlinear mapping of the input data to a high-dimensional biological feature space, where distinguishing between data becomes more efficient and straightforward, allowing a simple linear classifier to perform pattern recognition tasks effectively. To evaluate the performance of our proposed system, we present an experimental study that includes various input patterns, such as positional codes, bars with different orientations, and a digit recognition task. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using biological neural networks to perform tasks traditionally handled by artificial neural networks, paving the way for further exploration of biologically-inspired computing systems, with potential applications in neuromorphic engineering and bio-hybrid computing.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Module Transferability in Single Image Super-Resolution: Universality Assessment and Cycle Residual Blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has substantially advanced the Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR). However, existing researches have predominantly focused on raw performance gains, with little attention paid to quantifying the transferability of architectural components. In this paper, we introduce the concept of "Universality" and its associated definitions which extend the traditional notion of "Generalization" to encompass the modules' ease of transferability, thus revealing the relationships between module universality and model generalizability. Then we propose the Universality Assessment Equation (UAE), a metric for quantifying how readily a given module could be transplanted across models. Guided by the UAE results of standard residual blocks and other plug-and-play modules, we further design two optimized modules, Cycle Residual Block (CRB) and Depth-Wise Cycle Residual Block (DCRB). Through comprehensive experiments on natural-scene benchmarks, remote-sensing datasets, extreme-industrial imagery and on-device deployments, we demonstrate that networks embedded with the proposed plug-and-play modules outperform several state-of-the-arts, reaching a PSNR enhancement of up to 0.83dB or enabling a 71.3% reduction in parameters with negligible loss in reconstruction fidelity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The personalization of Stable Diffusion for generating professional portraits from amateur photographs is a burgeoning area, with applications in various downstream contexts. This paper investigates the impact of augmentations on improving facial resemblance when using two prominent personalization techniques: DreamBooth and InstantID. Through a series of experiments with diverse subject datasets, we assessed the effectiveness of various augmentation strategies on the generated headshots' fidelity to the original subject. We introduce FaceDistance, a wrapper around FaceNet, to rank the generations based on facial similarity, which aided in our assessment. Ultimately, this research provides insights into the role of augmentations in enhancing facial resemblance in SDXL-generated portraits, informing strategies for their effective deployment in downstream applications.</description>

      <title>Rapid AI-based generation of coverage paths for dispensing applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coverage Path Planning of Thermal Interface Materials (TIM) plays a crucial role in the design of power electronics and electronic control units. Up to now, this is done manually by experts or by using optimization approaches with a high computational effort. We propose a novel AI-based approach to generate dispense paths for TIM and similar dispensing applications. It is a drop-in replacement for optimization-based approaches. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) receives the target cooling area as input and directly outputs the dispense path. Our proposed setup does not require labels and we show its feasibility on multiple target areas. The resulting dispense paths can be directly transferred to automated manufacturing equipment and do not exhibit air entrapments. The approach of using an ANN to predict process parameters for a desired target state in real-time could potentially be transferred to other manufacturing processes.</description>

      <title>Ergodic Generative Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFNs) were initially introduced on directed acyclic graphs to sample from an unnormalized distribution density. Recent works have extended the theoretical framework for generative methods allowing more flexibility and enhancing application range. However, many challenges remain in training GFNs in continuous settings and for imitation learning (IL), including intractability of flow-matching loss, limited tests of non-acyclic training, and the need for a separate reward model in imitation learning. The present work proposes a family of generative flows called Ergodic Generative Flows (EGFs) which are used to address the aforementioned issues. First, we leverage ergodicity to build simple generative flows with finitely many globally defined transformations (diffeomorphisms) with universality guarantees and tractable flow-matching loss (FM loss). Second, we introduce a new loss involving cross-entropy coupled to weak flow-matching control, coined KL-weakFM loss. It is designed for IL training without a separate reward model. We evaluate IL-EGFs on toy 2D tasks and real-world datasets from NASA on the sphere, using the KL-weakFM loss. Additionally, we conduct toy 2D reinforcement learning experiments with a target reward, using the FM loss.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Person Image Synthesis Using a Flow Matching Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pose-Guided Person Image Synthesis (PGPIS) generates realistic person images conditioned on a target pose and a source image. This task plays a key role in various real-world applications, such as sign language video generation, AR/VR, gaming, and live streaming. In these scenarios, real-time PGPIS is critical for providing immediate visual feedback and maintaining user immersion.However, achieving real-time performance remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of synthesizing high-fidelity images from diverse and dynamic human poses. Recent diffusion-based methods have shown impressive image quality in PGPIS, but their slow sampling speeds hinder deployment in time-sensitive applications. This latency is particularly problematic in tasks like generating sign language videos during live broadcasts, where rapid image updates are required. Therefore, developing a fast and reliable PGPIS model is a crucial step toward enabling real-time interactive systems. To address this challenge, we propose a generative model based on flow matching (FM). Our approach enables faster, more stable, and more efficient training and sampling. Furthermore, the proposed model supports conditional generation and can operate in latent space, making it especially suitable for real-time PGPIS applications where both speed and quality are critical. We evaluate our proposed method, Real-Time Person Image Synthesis Using a Flow Matching Model (RPFM), on the widely used DeepFashion dataset for PGPIS tasks. Our results show that RPFM achieves near-real-time sampling speeds while maintaining performance comparable to the state-of-the-art models. Our methodology trades off a slight, acceptable decrease in generated-image accuracy for over a twofold increase in generation speed, thereby ensuring real-time performance.</description>

      <title>LlamaFirewall: An open source guardrail system for building secure AI agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have evolved from simple chatbots into autonomous agents capable of performing complex tasks such as editing production code, orchestrating workflows, and taking higher-stakes actions based on untrusted inputs like webpages and emails. These capabilities introduce new security risks that existing security measures, such as model fine-tuning or chatbot-focused guardrails, do not fully address. Given the higher stakes and the absence of deterministic solutions to mitigate these risks, there is a critical need for a real-time guardrail monitor to serve as a final layer of defense, and support system level, use case specific safety policy definition and enforcement. We introduce LlamaFirewall, an open-source security focused guardrail framework designed to serve as a final layer of defense against security risks associated with AI Agents. Our framework mitigates risks such as prompt injection, agent misalignment, and insecure code risks through three powerful guardrails: PromptGuard 2, a universal jailbreak detector that demonstrates clear state of the art performance; Agent Alignment Checks, a chain-of-thought auditor that inspects agent reasoning for prompt injection and goal misalignment, which, while still experimental, shows stronger efficacy at preventing indirect injections in general scenarios than previously proposed approaches; and CodeShield, an online static analysis engine that is both fast and extensible, aimed at preventing the generation of insecure or dangerous code by coding agents. Additionally, we include easy-to-use customizable scanners that make it possible for any developer who can write a regular expression or an LLM prompt to quickly update an agent's security guardrails.</description>

Abstract: Public deliberation, as in open discussion of issues of public concern, often suffers from scattered and shallow discourse, poor sensemaking, and a disconnect from actionable policy outcomes. This paper introduces BCause, a discussion system leveraging generative AI and human-machine collaboration to transform unstructured dialogue around public issues (such as urban living, policy changes, and current socio-economic transformations) into structured, actionable democratic processes. We present three innovations: (i) importing and transforming unstructured transcripts into argumentative discussions, (ii) geo-deliberated problem-sensing via a Telegram bot for local issue reporting, and (iii) smart reporting with customizable widgets (e.g., summaries, topic modelling, policy recommendations, clustered arguments). The system's human-AI partnership preserves critical human participation to ensure ethical oversight, contextual relevance, and creative synthesis.</description>

      <title>Rainbow Delay Compensation: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Framework for Mitigating Delayed Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In real-world multi-agent systems (MASs), observation delays are ubiquitous, preventing agents from making decisions based on the environment's true state. An individual agent's local observation often consists of multiple components from other agents or dynamic entities in the environment. These discrete observation components with varying delay characteristics pose significant challenges for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). In this paper, we first formulate the decentralized stochastic individual delay partially observable Markov decision process (DSID-POMDP) by extending the standard Dec-POMDP. We then propose the Rainbow Delay Compensation (RDC), a MARL training framework for addressing stochastic individual delays, along with recommended implementations for its constituent modules. We implement the DSID-POMDP's observation generation pattern using standard MARL benchmarks, including MPE and SMAC. Experiments demonstrate that baseline MARL methods suffer severe performance degradation under fixed and unfixed delays. The RDC-enhanced approach mitigates this issue, remarkably achieving ideal delay-free performance in certain delay scenarios while maintaining generalization capability. Our work provides a novel perspective on multi-agent delayed observation problems and offers an effective solution framework.</description>

      <title>ALMA: Aggregated Lipschitz Maximization Attack on Auto-encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the extensive use of deep autoencoders (AEs) in critical applications, their adversarial robustness remains relatively underexplored compared to classification models. AE robustness is characterized by the Lipschitz bounds of its components. Existing robustness evaluation frameworks based on white-box attacks do not fully exploit the vulnerabilities of intermediate ill-conditioned layers in AEs. In the context of optimizing imperceptible norm-bounded additive perturbations to maximize output damage, existing methods struggle to effectively propagate adversarial loss gradients throughout the network, often converging to less effective perturbations. To address this, we propose a novel layer-conditioning-based adversarial optimization objective that effectively guides the adversarial map toward regions of local Lipschitz bounds by enhancing loss gradient information propagation during attack optimization. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on state-of-the-art AEs that our adversarial objective results in stronger attacks, outperforming existing methods in both universal and sample-specific scenarios. As a defense method against this attack, we introduce an inference-time adversarially trained defense plugin that mitigates the effects of adversarial examples.</description>

      <title>Binding threshold units with artificial oscillatory neurons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Kuramoto oscillatory neurons were recently introduced as an alternative to threshold units. Empirical evidence suggests that oscillatory units outperform threshold units in several tasks including unsupervised object discovery and certain reasoning problems. The proposed coupling mechanism for these oscillatory neurons is heterogeneous, combining a generalized Kuramoto equation with standard coupling methods used for threshold units. In this research note, we present a theoretical framework that clearly distinguishes oscillatory neurons from threshold units and establishes a coupling mechanism between them. We argue that, from a biological standpoint, oscillatory and threshold units realise distinct aspects of neural coding: roughly, threshold units model intensity of neuron firing, while oscillatory units facilitate information exchange by frequency modulation. To derive interaction between these two types of units, we constrain their dynamics by focusing on dynamical systems that admit Lyapunov functions. For threshold units, this leads to Hopfield associative memory model, and for oscillatory units it yields a specific form of generalized Kuramoto model. The resulting dynamical systems can be naturally coupled to form a Hopfield-Kuramoto associative memory model, which also admits a Lyapunov function. Various forms of coupling are possible. Notably, oscillatory neurons can be employed to implement a low-rank correction to the weight matrix of a Hopfield network. This correction can be viewed either as a form of Hebbian learning or as a popular LoRA method used for fine-tuning of large language models. We demonstrate the practical realization of this particular coupling through illustrative toy experiments.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in personalized MLLMs enable effective capture of user-specific concepts, supporting both recognition of personalized concepts and contextual captioning. However, humans typically explore and reason over relations among objects and individuals, transcending surface-level information to achieve more personalized and contextual understanding. To this end, existing methods may face three main limitations: Their training data lacks multi-object sets in which relations among objects are learnable. Building on the limited training data, their models overlook the relations between different personalized concepts and fail to reason over them. Their experiments mainly focus on a single personalized concept, where evaluations are limited to recognition and captioning tasks. To address the limitations, we present a new dataset named ReGraP, consisting of 120 sets of personalized knowledge. Each set includes images, KGs, and CoT QA pairs derived from the KGs, enabling more structured and sophisticated reasoning pathways. We propose ReGraP-LLaVA, an MLLM trained with the corresponding KGs and CoT QA pairs, where soft and hard graph prompting methods are designed to align KGs within the model's semantic space. We establish the ReGraP Benchmark, which contains diverse task types: multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, True/False, and descriptive questions in both open- and closed-ended settings. The proposed benchmark is designed to evaluate the relational reasoning and knowledge-connection capability of personalized MLLMs. We conduct experiments on the proposed ReGraP-LLaVA and other competitive MLLMs. Results show that the proposed model not only learns personalized knowledge but also performs relational reasoning in responses, achieving the SoTA performance compared with the competitive methods. All the codes and datasets are released at: https://github.com/xyfyyds/ReGraP.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Inference for Eliminating Sentiment Bias in Recommender Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommender Systems (RSs) aim to provide personalized recommendations for users. A newly discovered bias, known as sentiment bias, uncovers a common phenomenon within Review-based RSs (RRSs): the recommendation accuracy of users or items with negative reviews deteriorates compared with users or items with positive reviews. Critical users and niche items are disadvantaged by such unfair recommendations. We study this problem from the perspective of counterfactual inference with two stages. At the model training stage, we build a causal graph and model how sentiment influences the final rating score. During the inference stage, we decouple the direct and indirect effects to mitigate the impact of sentiment bias and remove the indirect effect using counterfactual inference. We have conducted extensive experiments, and the results validate that our model can achieve comparable performance on rating prediction for better recommendations and effective mitigation of sentiment bias. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to employ counterfactual inference on sentiment bias mitigation in RSs.</description>

      <title>Revolutionizing Brain Tumor Imaging: Generating Synthetic 3D FA Maps from T1-Weighted MRI using CycleGAN Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional anisotropy (FA) and directionally encoded colour (DEC) maps are essential for evaluating white matter integrity and structural connectivity in neuroimaging. However, the spatial misalignment between FA maps and tractography atlases hinders their effective integration into predictive models. To address this issue, we propose a CycleGAN based approach for generating FA maps directly from T1-weighted MRI scans, representing the first application of this technique to both healthy and tumour-affected tissues. Our model, trained on unpaired data, produces high fidelity maps, which have been rigorously evaluated using Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), demonstrating particularly robust performance in tumour regions. Radiological assessments further underscore the model's potential to enhance clinical workflows by providing an AI-driven alternative that reduces the necessity for additional scans.</description>

Abstract: Assured safe-separation is essential for achieving seamless high-density operation of airborne vehicles in a shared airspace. To equip resource-constrained aerial systems with this safety-critical capability, we present ViSafe, a high-speed vision-only airborne collision avoidance system. ViSafe offers a full-stack solution to the Detect and Avoid (DAA) problem by tightly integrating a learning-based edge-AI framework with a custom multi-camera hardware prototype designed under SWaP-C constraints. By leveraging perceptual input-focused control barrier functions (CBF) to design, encode, and enforce safety thresholds, ViSafe can provide provably safe runtime guarantees for self-separation in high-speed aerial operations. We evaluate ViSafe's performance through an extensive test campaign involving both simulated digital twins and real-world flight scenarios. By independently varying agent types, closure rates, interaction geometries, and environmental conditions (e.g., weather and lighting), we demonstrate that ViSafe consistently ensures self-separation across diverse scenarios. In first-of-its-kind real-world high-speed collision avoidance tests with closure rates reaching 144 km/h, ViSafe sets a new benchmark for vision-only autonomous collision avoidance, establishing a new standard for safety in high-speed aerial navigation.</description>

      <title>Actor-Critics Can Achieve Optimal Sample Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Actor-critic algorithms have become a cornerstone in reinforcement learning (RL), leveraging the strengths of both policy-based and value-based methods. Despite recent progress in understanding their statistical efficiency, no existing work has successfully learned an $\epsilon$-optimal policy with a sample complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ trajectories with general function approximation when strategic exploration is necessary.
  We address this open problem by introducing a novel actor-critic algorithm that attains a sample-complexity of $O(dH^5 \log|\mathcal{A}|/\epsilon^2 + d H^4 \log|\mathcal{F}|/ \epsilon^2)$ trajectories, and accompanying $\sqrt{T}$ regret when the Bellman eluder dimension $d$ does not increase with $T$ at more than a $\log T$ rate.
  Here, $\mathcal{F}$ is the critic function class, $\mathcal{A}$ is the action space, and $H$ is the horizon in the finite horizon MDP setting. Our algorithm integrates optimism, off-policy critic estimation targeting the optimal Q-function, and rare-switching policy resets.
  We extend this to the setting of Hybrid RL, showing that initializing the critic with offline data yields sample efficiency gains compared to purely offline or online RL. Further, utilizing access to offline data, we provide a \textit{non-optimistic} provably efficient actor-critic algorithm that only additionally requires $N_{\text{off}} \geq c_{\text{off}}^*dH^4/\epsilon^2$ in exchange for omitting optimism, where $c_{\text{off}}^*$ is the single-policy concentrability coefficient and $N_{\text{off}}$ is the number of offline samples. This addresses another open problem in the literature. We further provide numerical experiments to support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>FlexiAct: Towards Flexible Action Control in Heterogeneous Scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Action customization involves generating videos where the subject performs actions dictated by input control signals. Current methods use pose-guided or global motion customization but are limited by strict constraints on spatial structure, such as layout, skeleton, and viewpoint consistency, reducing adaptability across diverse subjects and scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose FlexiAct, which transfers actions from a reference video to an arbitrary target image. Unlike existing methods, FlexiAct allows for variations in layout, viewpoint, and skeletal structure between the subject of the reference video and the target image, while maintaining identity consistency. Achieving this requires precise action control, spatial structure adaptation, and consistency preservation. To this end, we introduce RefAdapter, a lightweight image-conditioned adapter that excels in spatial adaptation and consistency preservation, surpassing existing methods in balancing appearance consistency and structural flexibility. Additionally, based on our observations, the denoising process exhibits varying levels of attention to motion (low frequency) and appearance details (high frequency) at different timesteps. So we propose FAE (Frequency-aware Action Extraction), which, unlike existing methods that rely on separate spatial-temporal architectures, directly achieves action extraction during the denoising process. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively transfers actions to subjects with diverse layouts, skeletons, and viewpoints. We release our code and model weights to support further research at https://shiyi-zh0408.github.io/projectpages/FlexiAct/</description>

      <title>AMO: Adaptive Motion Optimization for Hyper-Dexterous Humanoid Whole-Body Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humanoid robots derive much of their dexterity from hyper-dexterous whole-body movements, enabling tasks that require a large operational workspace: such as picking objects off the ground. However, achieving these capabilities on real humanoids remains challenging due to their high degrees of freedom (DoF) and nonlinear dynamics. We propose Adaptive Motion Optimization (AMO), a framework that integrates sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) with trajectory optimization for real-time, adaptive whole-body control. To mitigate distribution bias in motion imitation RL, we construct a hybrid AMO dataset and train a network capable of robust, on-demand adaptation to potentially O.O.D. commands. We validate AMO in simulation and on a 29-DoF Unitree G1 humanoid robot, demonstrating superior stability and an expanded workspace compared to strong baselines. Finally, we show that AMO's consistent performance supports autonomous task execution via imitation learning, underscoring the system's versatility and robustness.</description>

      <title>VITA-Audio: Fast Interleaved Cross-Modal Token Generation for Efficient Large Speech-Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growing requirement for natural human-computer interaction, speech-based systems receive increasing attention as speech is one of the most common forms of daily communication. However, the existing speech models still experience high latency when generating the first audio token during streaming, which poses a significant bottleneck for deployment. To address this issue, we propose VITA-Audio, an end-to-end large speech model with fast audio-text token generation. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight Multiple Cross-modal Token Prediction (MCTP) module that efficiently generates multiple audio tokens within a single model forward pass, which not only accelerates the inference but also significantly reduces the latency for generating the first audio in streaming scenarios. In addition, a four-stage progressive training strategy is explored to achieve model acceleration with minimal loss of speech quality. To our knowledge, VITA-Audio is the first multi-modal large language model capable of generating audio output during the first forward pass, enabling real-time conversational capabilities with minimal latency. VITA-Audio is fully reproducible and is trained on open-source data only. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves an inference speedup of 3~5x at the 7B parameter scale, but also significantly outperforms open-source models of similar model size on multiple benchmarks for automatic speech recognition (ASR), text-to-speech (TTS), and spoken question answering (SQA) tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05537v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of symbolic regression (SR) arises in many different applications, such as identifying physical laws or deriving mathematical equations describing the behavior of financial markets from given data. Various methods exist to address the problem of SR, often based on genetic programming. However, these methods are usually complicated and involve various hyperparameters. In this paper, we present our new approach ParFam that utilizes parametric families of suitable symbolic functions to translate the discrete symbolic regression problem into a continuous one, resulting in a more straightforward setup compared to current state-of-the-art methods. In combination with a global optimizer, this approach results in a highly effective method to tackle the problem of SR. We theoretically analyze the expressivity of ParFam and demonstrate its performance with extensive numerical experiments based on the common SR benchmark suit SRBench, showing that we achieve state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we present an extension incorporating a pre-trained transformer network DL-ParFam to guide ParFam, accelerating the optimization process by up to two magnitudes. Our code and results can be found at https://github.com/Philipp238/parfam.</description>

      <title>The Adaptive Arms Race: Redefining Robustness in AI Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite considerable efforts on making them robust, real-world AI-based systems remain vulnerable to decision based attacks, as definitive proofs of their operational robustness have so far proven intractable. Canonical robustness evaluation relies on adaptive attacks, which leverage complete knowledge of the defense and are tailored to bypass it. This work broadens the notion of adaptivity, which we employ to enhance both attacks and defenses, showing how they can benefit from mutual learning through interaction. We introduce a framework for adaptively optimizing black-box attacks and defenses under the competitive game they form. To assess robustness reliably, it is essential to evaluate against realistic and worst-case attacks. We thus enhance attacks and their evasive arsenal together using RL, apply the same principle to defenses, and evaluate them first independently and then jointly under a multi-agent perspective. We find that active defenses, those that dynamically control system responses, are an essential complement to model hardening against decision-based attacks; that these defenses can be circumvented by adaptive attacks, something that elicits defenses being adaptive too. Our findings, supported by an extensive theoretical and empirical investigation, confirm that adaptive adversaries pose a serious threat to black-box AI-based systems, rekindling the proverbial arms race. Notably, our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art black-box attacks and defenses, while bringing them together to render effective insights into the robustness of real-world deployed ML-based systems.</description>

Abstract: Which fairness metrics are appropriately applicable in your contexts? There may be instances of discordance regarding the perception of fairness, even when the outcomes comply with established fairness metrics. Several questionnaire-based surveys have been conducted to evaluate fairness metrics with human perceptions of fairness. However, these surveys were limited in scope, including only a few hundred participants within a single country. In this study, we conduct an international survey to evaluate public perceptions of various fairness metrics in decision-making scenarios. We collected responses from 1,000 participants in each of China, France, Japan, and the United States, amassing a total of 4,000 participants, to analyze the preferences of fairness metrics. Our survey consists of three distinct scenarios paired with four fairness metrics. This investigation explores the relationship between personal attributes and the choice of fairness metrics, uncovering a significant influence of national context on these preferences.</description>

      <title>Language Models Trained to do Arithmetic Predict Human Risky and Intertemporal Choice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observed similarities in the behavior of humans and Large Language Models (LLMs) have prompted researchers to consider the potential of using LLMs as models of human cognition. However, several significant challenges must be addressed before LLMs can be legitimately regarded as cognitive models. For instance, LLMs are trained on far more data than humans typically encounter, and may have been directly trained on human data in specific cognitive tasks or aligned with human preferences. Consequently, the origins of these behavioral similarities are not well understood. In this paper, we propose a novel way to enhance the utility of LLMs as cognitive models. This approach involves (i) leveraging computationally equivalent tasks that both an LLM and a rational agent need to master for solving a cognitive problem and (ii) examining the specific task distributions required for an LLM to exhibit human-like behaviors. We apply this approach to decision-making -- specifically risky and intertemporal choice -- where the key computationally equivalent task is the arithmetic of expected value calculations. We show that an LLM pretrained on an ecologically valid arithmetic dataset, which we call Arithmetic-GPT, predicts human behavior better than many traditional cognitive models. Pretraining LLMs on ecologically valid arithmetic datasets is sufficient to produce a strong correspondence between these models and human decision-making. Our results also suggest that LLMs used as cognitive models should be carefully investigated via ablation studies of the pretraining data.</description>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has experienced significant advancement over the past decade, prompting a growing interest in applications within finance. This survey critically evaluates 167 publications, exploring diverse RL applications and frameworks in finance. Financial markets, marked by their complexity, multi-agent nature, information asymmetry, and inherent randomness, serve as an intriguing test-bed for RL. Traditional finance offers certain solutions, and RL advances these with a more dynamic approach, incorporating machine learning methods, including transfer learning, meta-learning, and multi-agent solutions. This survey dissects key RL components through the lens of Quantitative Finance. We uncover emerging themes, propose areas for future research, and critique the strengths and weaknesses of existing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16876v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing efficient traffic models is crucial for optimizing modern transportation systems. However, current modeling approaches remain labor-intensive and prone to human errors due to their dependence on manual workflows. These processes typically involve extensive literature reviews, formula tuning, and iterative testing, which often lead to inefficiencies. To address this, we propose TR-Agent, an AI-powered framework that autonomously develops and refines traffic models through a closed-loop, iterative process. We structure the research pipeline into four key stages: idea generation, theory formulation, theory evaluation, and iterative optimization, and implement TR-Agent with four corresponding modules. These modules collaborate to retrieve knowledge from external sources, generate novel hypotheses, implement and debug models, and evaluate their performance on evaluation datasets. Through iteratively feedback and refinement, TR-Agent improves both modeling efficiency and effectiveness. We validate the framework on three representative traffic models: the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) for car-following behavior, the MOBIL model for lane-changing, and the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) speed-density relationship for macroscopic traffic flow modeling. Experimental results show substantial performance gains over the original models. To assess the robustness and generalizability of the improvements, we conduct additional evaluations across multiple real-world datasets, demonstrating consistent performance gains beyond the original development data. Furthermore, TR-Agent produces interpretable explanations for each improvement, enabling researchers to easily verify and extend its results. This makes TR-Agent a valuable assistant for traffic modeling refinement and a promising tool for broader applications in transportation research.</description>

Abstract: Given the temporal GPS coordinates from a large set of human agents, how can we model their mobility behavior toward effective anomaly (e.g. bad-actor or malicious behavior) detection without any labeled data? Human mobility and trajectory modeling have been extensively studied, showcasing varying abilities to manage complex inputs and balance performance-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we formulate anomaly detection in complex human behavior by modeling raw GPS data as a sequence of stay-point events, each characterized by spatio-temporal features, along with trips (i.e. commute) between the stay-points. Our problem formulation allows us to leverage modern sequence models for unsupervised training and anomaly detection. Notably, we equip our proposed model USTAD (for Uncertainty-aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection) with aleatoric (i.e. data) uncertainty estimation to account for inherent stochasticity in certain individuals' behavior, as well as epistemic (i.e. model) uncertainty to handle data sparsity under a large variety of human behaviors. Together, aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties unlock a robust loss function as well as uncertainty-aware decision-making in anomaly scoring. Extensive experiments shows that USTAD improves anomaly detection AUCROC by 3\%-15\% over baselines in industry-scale data.</description>

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities over textual and visual inputs. However, these models remain prone to generating misinformation. Identifying and mitigating ungrounded responses is crucial for developing trustworthy AI. Traditional explainability methods such as gradient-based relevancy maps, offer insight into the decision process of models, but are often computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time output validation. In this work, we introduce FastRM, an efficient method for predicting explainable Relevancy Maps of LVLMs. Furthermore, FastRM provides both quantitative and qualitative assessment of model confidence. Experimental results demonstrate that FastRM achieves a 99.8% reduction in computation time and a 44.4% reduction in memory footprint compared to traditional relevancy map generation. FastRM allows explainable AI to be more practical and scalable, thereby promoting its deployment in real-world applications and enabling users to more effectively evaluate the reliability of model outputs.</description>

      <title>Fourier Position Embedding: Enhancing Attention's Periodic Extension for Length Generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17739v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extending the context length of Language Models (LMs) by improving Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) has become a trend. While existing works mainly address RoPE's limitations within attention mechanism, this paper provides an analysis across nearly all parts of LMs, uncovering their adverse effects on length generalization for RoPE-based attention. Using Discrete Signal Processing theory, we show that RoPE enables periodic attention by implicitly achieving Non-Uniform Discrete Fourier Transform. However, this periodicity is undermined by the spectral damage caused by: 1) linear layers and activation functions outside of attention; 2) insufficiently trained frequency components brought by time-domain truncation. Building on our observations, we propose Fourier Position Embedding (FoPE), which enhances attention's frequency-domain properties to improve both its periodic extension and length generalization. FoPE constructs Fourier Series and zero-outs the destructive frequency components, increasing model robustness against the spectrum damage. Experiments across various model scales and benchmarks show that, within varying context windows, FoPE maintains a more stable performance compared to RoPE and ALiBi. Several analyses and ablations bring further support to our method and theoretical modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18116v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have brought exciting new advances to mobile UI agents, a long-standing research field that aims to complete arbitrary natural language tasks through mobile UI interactions. However, existing UI agents usually demand powerful large language models that are difficult to be deployed locally on end-users' devices, raising huge concerns about user privacy and centralized serving cost. Inspired by the remarkable coding abilities of recent small language models (SLMs), we propose to convert the UI task automation problem to a code generation problem, which can be effectively solved by an on-device SLM and efficiently executed with an on-device code interpreter. Unlike normal coding tasks that can be extensively pre-trained with public datasets, generating UI automation code is challenging due to the diversity, complexity, and variability of target apps. Therefore, we adopt a document-centered approach that automatically builds fine-grained API documentation for each app and generates diverse task samples based on this documentation. By guiding the agent with the synthetic documents and task samples, it learns to generate precise and efficient scripts to complete unseen tasks. Based on detailed comparisons with state-of-the-art mobile UI agents, our approach effectively improves the mobile task automation with significantly higher success rates and lower latency/token consumption.

      <title>Synergizing Large Language Models and Task-specific Models for Time Series Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05675v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In anomaly detection, methods based on large language models (LLMs) can incorporate expert knowledge by reading professional document, while task-specific small models excel at extracting normal data patterns and detecting value fluctuations from training data of target applications. Inspired by the human nervous system, where the brain stores expert knowledge and the peripheral nervous system and spinal cord handle specific tasks like withdrawal and knee-jerk reflexes, we propose CoLLaTe, a framework designed to facilitate collaboration between LLMs and task-specific models, leveraging the strengths of both models for anomaly detection.
  In particular, we first formulate the collaboration process and identify two key challenges in the collaboration:
  (1) the misalignment between the expression domains of the LLMs and task-specific small models, and (2) error accumulation arising from the predictions of both models.
  To address these challenges, we then introduce two key components in CoLLaTe: a model alignment module and a collaborative loss function. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate that these components effectively mitigate the identified challenges and achieve better performance than both LLM-based and task-specific models.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Multi-Agent Planning with Adaptive Skill Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite much progress in training distributed artificial intelligence (AI), building cooperative multi-agent systems with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) faces challenges in sample efficiency, interpretability, and transferability. Unlike traditional learning-based methods that require extensive interaction with the environment, large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in zero-shot planning and complex reasoning. However, existing LLM-based approaches heavily rely on text-based observations and struggle with the non-Markovian nature of multi-agent interactions under partial observability. We present COMPASS, a novel multi-agent architecture that integrates vision-language models (VLMs) with a dynamic skill library and structured communication for decentralized closed-loop decision-making. The skill library, bootstrapped from demonstrations, evolves via planner-guided tasks to enable adaptive strategies. COMPASS propagates entity information through multi-hop communication under partial observability. Evaluations on the improved StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMACv2) demonstrate COMPASS's strong performance against state-of-the-art MARL baselines across both symmetric and asymmetric scenarios. Notably, in the symmetric Protoss 5v5 task, COMPASS achieved a 57\% win rate, representing a 30 percentage point advantage over QMIX (27\%).

      <title>LiteWebAgent: The Open-Source Suite for VLM-Based Web-Agent Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce LiteWebAgent, an open-source suite for VLM-based web agent applications. Our framework addresses a critical gap in the web agent ecosystem with a production-ready solution that combines minimal serverless backend configuration, intuitive user and browser interfaces, and extensible research capabilities in agent planning, memory, and tree search. For the core LiteWebAgent agent framework, we implemented a simple yet effective baseline using recursive function calling, providing with decoupled action generation and action grounding. In addition, we integrate advanced research components such as agent planning, agent workflow memory, and tree search in a modular and extensible manner. We then integrate the LiteWebAgent agent framework with frontend and backend as deployed systems in two formats: (1) a production Vercel-based web application, which provides users with an agent-controlled remote browser, (2) a Chrome extension leveraging LiteWebAgent's API to control an existing Chrome browser via CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol). The LiteWebAgent framework is available at https://github.com/PathOnAI/LiteWebAgent, with deployed frontend at https://lite-web-agent.vercel.app/.</description>

      <title>A Cognitive-Mechanistic Human Reliability Analysis Framework: A Nuclear Power Plant Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional human reliability analysis (HRA) methods, such as IDHEAS-ECA, rely on expert judgment and empirical rules that often overlook the cognitive underpinnings of human error. Moreover, conducting human-in-the-loop experiments for advanced nuclear power plants is increasingly impractical due to novel interfaces and limited operational data. This study proposes a cognitive-mechanistic framework (COGMIF) that enhances the IDHEAS-ECA methodology by integrating an ACT-R-based human digital twin (HDT) with TimeGAN-augmented simulation. The ACT-R model simulates operator cognition, including memory retrieval, goal-directed procedural reasoning, and perceptual-motor execution, under high-fidelity scenarios derived from a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) simulator. To overcome the resource constraints of large-scale cognitive modeling, TimeGAN is trained on ACT-R-generated time-series data to produce high-fidelity synthetic operator behavior datasets. These simulations are then used to drive IDHEAS-ECA assessments, enabling scalable, mechanism-informed estimation of human error probabilities (HEPs). Comparative analyses with SPAR-H and sensitivity assessments demonstrate the robustness and practical advantages of the proposed COGMIF. Finally, procedural features are mapped onto a Bayesian network to quantify the influence of contributing factors, revealing key drivers of operational risk. This work offers a credible and computationally efficient pathway to integrate cognitive theory into industrial HRA practices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drawing on 1,178 safety and reliability papers from 9,439 generative AI papers (January 2020 - March 2025), we compare research outputs of leading AI companies (Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI) and AI universities (CMU, MIT, NYU, Stanford, UC Berkeley, and University of Washington). We find that corporate AI research increasingly concentrates on pre-deployment areas -- model alignment and testing &amp; evaluation -- while attention to deployment-stage issues such as model bias has waned. Significant research gaps exist in high-risk deployment domains, including healthcare, finance, misinformation, persuasive and addictive features, hallucinations, and copyright. Without improved observability into deployed AI, growing corporate concentration could deepen knowledge deficits. We recommend expanding external researcher access to deployment data and systematic observability of in-market AI behaviors.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Cooperative Rationalization: The Risk of Spurious Correlations in Even Clean Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the self-rationalization framework constructed with a cooperative game, where a generator initially extracts the most informative segment from raw input, and a subsequent predictor utilizes the selected subset for its input. The generator and predictor are trained collaboratively to maximize prediction accuracy. In this paper, we first uncover a potential caveat: such a cooperative game could unintentionally introduce a sampling bias during rationale extraction. Specifically, the generator might inadvertently create an incorrect correlation between the selected rationale candidate and the label, even when they are semantically unrelated in the original dataset. Subsequently, we elucidate the origins of this bias using both detailed theoretical analysis and empirical evidence. Our findings suggest a direction for inspecting these correlations through attacks, based on which we further introduce an instruction to prevent the predictor from learning the correlations. Through experiments on six text classification datasets and two graph classification datasets using three network architectures (GRUs, BERT, and GCN), we show that our method not only significantly outperforms recent rationalization methods, but also achieves comparable or even better results than a representative LLM (llama3.1-8b-instruct).</description>

      <title>q-Learning in Continuous Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.00713v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the continuous-time counterpart of Q-learning for reinforcement learning (RL) under the entropy-regularized, exploratory diffusion process formulation introduced by Wang et al. (2020). As the conventional (big) Q-function collapses in continuous time, we consider its first-order approximation and coin the term ``(little) q-function". This function is related to the instantaneous advantage rate function as well as the Hamiltonian. We develop a ``q-learning" theory around the q-function that is independent of time discretization. Given a stochastic policy, we jointly characterize the associated q-function and value function by martingale conditions of certain stochastic processes, in both on-policy and off-policy settings. We then apply the theory to devise different actor-critic algorithms for solving underlying RL problems, depending on whether or not the density function of the Gibbs measure generated from the q-function can be computed explicitly. One of our algorithms interprets the well-known Q-learning algorithm SARSA, and another recovers a policy gradient (PG) based continuous-time algorithm proposed in Jia and Zhou (2022b). Finally, we conduct simulation experiments to compare the performance of our algorithms with those of PG-based algorithms in Jia and Zhou (2022b) and time-discretized conventional Q-learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Towards A Robust Group-level Emotion Recognition via Uncertainty-Aware Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Group-level emotion recognition (GER) is an inseparable part of human behavior analysis, aiming to recognize an overall emotion in a multi-person scene. However, the existing methods are devoted to combing diverse emotion cues while ignoring the inherent uncertainties under unconstrained environments, such as congestion and occlusion occurring within a group. Additionally, since only group-level labels are available, inconsistent emotion predictions among individuals in one group can confuse the network. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-aware learning (UAL) method to extract more robust representations for GER. By explicitly modeling the uncertainty of each individual, we utilize stochastic embedding drawn from a Gaussian distribution instead of deterministic point embedding. This representation captures the probabilities of different emotions and generates diverse predictions through this stochasticity during the inference stage. Furthermore, uncertainty-sensitive scores are adaptively assigned as the fusion weights of individuals' face within each group. Moreover, we develop an image enhancement module to enhance the model's robustness against severe noise. The overall three-branch model, encompassing face, object, and scene component, is guided by a proportional-weighted fusion strategy and integrates the proposed uncertainty-aware method to produce the final group-level output. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our method across three widely used databases.</description>

      <title>Co-NavGPT: Multi-Robot Cooperative Visual Semantic Navigation Using Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07937v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual target navigation is a critical capability for autonomous robots operating in unknown environments, particularly in human-robot interaction scenarios. While classical and learning-based methods have shown promise, most existing approaches lack common-sense reasoning and are typically designed for single-robot settings, leading to reduced efficiency and robustness in complex environments. To address these limitations, we introduce Co-NavGPT, a novel framework that integrates a Vision Language Model (VLM) as a global planner to enable common-sense multi-robot visual target navigation. Co-NavGPT aggregates sub-maps from multiple robots with diverse viewpoints into a unified global map, encoding robot states and frontier regions. The VLM uses this information to assign frontiers across the robots, facilitating coordinated and efficient exploration. Experiments on the Habitat-Matterport 3D (HM3D) demonstrate that Co-NavGPT outperforms existing baselines in terms of success rate and navigation efficiency, without requiring task-specific training. Ablation studies further confirm the importance of semantic priors from the VLM. We also validate the framework in real-world scenarios using quadrupedal robots. Supplementary video and code are available at: https://sites.google.com/view/co-navgpt2.</description>

      <title>Causal Structure Representation Learning of Confounders in Latent Space for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inferring user preferences from the historical feedback of users is a valuable problem in recommender systems. Conventional approaches often rely on the assumption that user preferences in the feedback data are equivalent to the real user preferences without additional noise, which simplifies the problem modeling. However, there are various confounders during user-item interactions, such as weather and even the recommendation system itself. Therefore, neglecting the influence of confounders will result in inaccurate user preferences and suboptimal performance of the model. Furthermore, the unobservability of confounders poses a challenge in further addressing the problem. To address these issues, we refine the problem and propose a more rational solution. Specifically, we consider the influence of confounders, disentangle them from user preferences in the latent space, and employ causal graphs to model their interdependencies without specific labels. By cleverly combining local and global causal graphs, we capture the user-specificity of confounders on user preferences. We theoretically demonstrate the identifiability of the obtained causal graph. Finally, we propose our model based on Variational Autoencoders, named Causal Structure representation learning of Confounders in latent space (CSC). We conducted extensive experiments on one synthetic dataset and five real-world datasets, demonstrating the superiority of our model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the learned causal representations of confounders are controllable, potentially offering users fine-grained control over the objectives of their recommendation lists with the learned causal graphs.</description>

      <title>PLUM: Improving Inference Efficiency By Leveraging Repetition-Sparsity Trade-Off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient inference of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices is essential. Quantization and sparsity are key techniques that translate to repetition and sparsity within tensors at the hardware-software interface. This paper introduces the concept of repetition-sparsity trade-off that helps explain computational efficiency during inference. We propose PLUM, a unified co-design framework that integrates DNN inference systems and quantization (forward and backward pass) to leverage the repetition-sparsity trade-off to improve inference efficiency. Our results demonstrate that PLUM's quantization method is more accurate than binary quantization with the same number of non-zero weights. Detailed analysis indicates that signed binarization generates a smaller distribution of effectual (non-zero) parameters nested within a larger distribution of total parameters of latent full-precision weights for a DNN block. Finally, the proposed PLUM framework achieves a 26% speedup on real hardware, doubles energy efficiency, and reduces density by 2.8x compared to binary methods while retaining top-1 accuracy when compared to prior-art methods for ResNets on ImageNet (by achieving 66.2% top-1 accuracy), presenting an alternative solution for deploying efficient models in resource-limited environments.</description>

      <title>Effective backdoor attack on graph neural networks in link prediction tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a class of deep learning models capable of processing graph-structured data, and they have demonstrated significant performance in a variety of real-world applications. Recent studies have found that GNN models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. When specific patterns (called backdoor triggers, e.g., subgraphs, nodes, etc.) appear in the input data, the backdoor embedded in the GNN models is activated, which misclassifies the input data into the target class label specified by the attacker, whereas when there are no backdoor triggers in the input, the backdoor embedded in the GNN models is not activated, and the models work normally. Backdoor attacks are highly stealthy and expose GNN models to serious security risks. Currently, research on backdoor attacks against GNNs mainly focus on tasks such as graph classification and node classification, and backdoor attacks against link prediction tasks are rarely studied. In this paper, we propose a backdoor attack against the link prediction tasks based on GNNs and reveal the existence of such security vulnerability in GNN models, which make the backdoored GNN models to incorrectly predict unlinked two nodes as having a link relationship when a trigger appear. The method uses a single node as the trigger and poison selected node pairs in the training graph, and then the backdoor will be embedded in the GNN models through the training process. In the inference stage, the backdoor in the GNN models can be activated by simply linking the trigger node to the two end nodes of the unlinked node pairs in the input data, causing the GNN models to produce incorrect link prediction results for the target node pairs.</description>

      <title>Incoherent Probability Judgments in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) trained for next-word prediction have demonstrated remarkable proficiency at producing coherent text. But are they equally adept at forming coherent probability judgments? We use probabilistic identities and repeated judgments to assess the coherence of probability judgments made by LLMs. Our results show that the judgments produced by these models are often incoherent, displaying human-like systematic deviations from the rules of probability theory. Moreover, when prompted to judge the same event, the mean-variance relationship of probability judgments produced by LLMs shows an inverted-U-shaped like that seen in humans. We propose that these deviations from rationality can be explained by linking autoregressive LLMs to implicit Bayesian inference and drawing parallels with the Bayesian Sampler model of human probability judgments.</description>

      <title>FreDF: Learning to Forecast in the Frequency Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series modeling presents unique challenges due to autocorrelation in both historical data and future sequences. While current research predominantly addresses autocorrelation within historical data, the correlations among future labels are often overlooked. Specifically, modern forecasting models primarily adhere to the Direct Forecast (DF) paradigm, generating multi-step forecasts independently and disregarding label autocorrelation over time. In this work, we demonstrate that the learning objective of DF is biased in the presence of label autocorrelation. To address this issue, we propose the Frequency-enhanced Direct Forecast (FreDF), which mitigates label autocorrelation by learning to forecast in the frequency domain, thereby reducing estimation bias. Our experiments show that FreDF significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and is compatible with a variety of forecast models.

      <title>Are Colors Quanta of Light for Human Vision? A Quantum Cognition Study of Visual Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that colors are light quanta for human visual perception in a similar way as photons are light quanta for physical measurements of light waves. Our result relies on the identification in the quantum measurement process itself of the warping mechanism which is characteristic of human perception. This warping mechanism makes stimuli classified into the same category perceived as more similar, while stimuli classified into different m categories are perceived as more different. In the quantum measurement process, the warping takes place between the pure states, which play the role played for human perception by the stimuli, and the density states after decoherence, which play the role played for human perception by the percepts. We use the natural metric for pure states, namely the normalized Fubini Study metric to measure distances between pure states, and the natural metric for density states, namely the normalized trace-class metric, to measure distances between density states. We then show that when pure states lie within a well-defined region surrounding an eigenstate, the quantum measurement, namely the process of decoherence, contracts the distance between these pure states, while the reverse happens for pure states lying in a well-defined region between two eigenstates, for which the quantum measurement causes a dilation. We elaborate as an example the situation of a two-dimensional quantum measurement described by the Bloch model and apply it to the situation of two colors 'Light' and 'Dark'. We argue that this analogy of warping, on the one hand in human perception and on the other hand in the quantum measurement process, makes colors to be quanta of light for human vision.</description>

      <title>HINT: Hypernetwork Approach to Training Weight Interval Regions in Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15444v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a new Continual Learning (CL) paradigm was presented to control catastrophic forgetting, called Interval Continual Learning (InterContiNet), which relies on enforcing interval constraints on the neural network parameter space. Unfortunately, InterContiNet training is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the weight space, making intervals difficult to manage. To address this issue, we introduce HINT, a technique that employs interval arithmetic within the embedding space and utilizes a hypernetwork to map these intervals to the target network parameter space. We train interval embeddings for consecutive tasks and train a hypernetwork to transform these embeddings into weights of the target network. An embedding for a given task is trained along with the hypernetwork, preserving the response of the target network for the previous task embeddings. Interval arithmetic works with a more manageable, lower-dimensional embedding space rather than directly preparing intervals in a high-dimensional weight space. Our model allows faster and more efficient training. Furthermore, HINT maintains the guarantee of not forgetting. At the end of training, we can choose one universal embedding to produce a single network dedicated to all tasks. In such a framework, hypernetwork is used only for training and, finally, we can utilize one set of weights. HINT obtains significantly better results than InterContiNet and gives SOTA results on several benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Beyond Bare Queries: Open-Vocabulary Object Grounding with 3D Scene Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07113v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Locating objects described in natural language presents a significant challenge for autonomous agents. Existing CLIP-based open-vocabulary methods successfully perform 3D object grounding with simple (bare) queries, but cannot cope with ambiguous descriptions that demand an understanding of object relations. To tackle this problem, we propose a modular approach called BBQ (Beyond Bare Queries), which constructs 3D scene graph representation with metric and semantic spatial edges and utilizes a large language model as a human-to-agent interface through our deductive scene reasoning algorithm. BBQ employs robust DINO-powered associations to construct 3D object-centric map and an advanced raycasting algorithm with a 2D vision-language model to describe them as graph nodes. On the Replica and ScanNet datasets, we have demonstrated that BBQ takes a leading place in open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation compared to other zero-shot methods. Also, we show that leveraging spatial relations is especially effective for scenes containing multiple entities of the same semantic class. On challenging Sr3D+, Nr3D and ScanRefer benchmarks, our deductive approach demonstrates a significant improvement, enabling objects grounding by complex queries compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The combination of our design choices and software implementation has resulted in significant data processing speed in experiments on the robot on-board computer. This promising performance enables the application of our approach in intelligent robotics projects. We made the code publicly available at https://linukc.github.io/BeyondBareQueries/.</description>

      <title>CombAlign: Enhancing Model Expressiveness in Unsupervised Graph Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13216v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised graph alignment finds the node correspondence between a pair of attributed graphs by only exploiting graph structure and node features. One category of recent studies first computes the node representation and then matches nodes with the largest embedding-based similarity, while the other category reduces the problem to optimal transport (OT) via Gromov-Wasserstein learning. However, it remains largely unexplored in the model expressiveness, as well as how theoretical expressivity impacts prediction accuracy. We investigate the model expressiveness from two aspects. First, we characterize the model's discriminative power in distinguishing matched and unmatched node pairs across two graphs. Second, we study the model's capability of guaranteeing node matching properties such as one-to-one matching and mutual alignment. Motivated by our theoretical analysis, we put forward a hybrid approach named CombAlign with stronger expressive power. Specifically, we enable cross-dimensional feature interaction for OT-based learning and propose an embedding-based method inspired by the Weisfeiler-Lehman test. We also apply non-uniform marginals obtained from the embedding-based modules to OT as priors for more expressiveness. Based on that, we propose a traditional algorithm-based refinement, which combines our OT and embedding-based predictions using the ensemble learning strategy and reduces the problem to maximum weight matching. With carefully designed edge weights, we ensure those matching properties and further enhance prediction accuracy. By extensive experiments, we demonstrate a significant improvement of 14.5% in alignment accuracy compared to state-of-the-art approaches and confirm the soundness of our theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>TTT: A Temporal Refinement Heuristic for Tenuously Tractable Discrete Time Reachability Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reachable set computation is an important tool for analyzing control systems. Simulating a control system can show general trends, but a formal tool like reachability analysis can provide guarantees of correctness. Reachability analysis for complex control systems, e.g., with nonlinear dynamics and/or a neural network controller, is often either slow or overly conservative. To address these challenges, much literature has focused on spatial refinement, i.e., tuning the discretization of the input sets and intermediate reachable sets. This paper introduces the idea of temporal refinement: automatically choosing when along the horizon of the reachability problem to execute slow symbolic queries which incur less approximation error versus fast concrete queries which incur more approximation error. Temporal refinement can be combined with other refinement approaches as an additional tool to trade off tractability and tightness in approximate reachable set computation. We introduce a temporal refinement algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness at computing approximate reachable sets for nonlinear systems with neural network controllers. We calculate reachable sets with varying computational budget and show that our algorithm can generate approximate reachable sets with a similar amount of error to the baseline in 20-70% less time.</description>

      <title>Bellman Unbiasedness: Tractable and Provably Efficient Distributional Reinforcement Learning with General Value Function Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributional reinforcement learning improves performance by capturing environmental stochasticity, but a comprehensive theoretical understanding of its effectiveness remains elusive. In addition, the intractable element of the infinite dimensionality of distributions has been overlooked. In this paper, we present a regret analysis of distributional reinforcement learning with general value function approximation in a finite episodic Markov decision process setting. We first introduce a key notion of $\textit{Bellman unbiasedness}$ which is essential for exactly learnable and provably efficient distributional updates in an online manner. Among all types of statistical functionals for representing infinite-dimensional return distributions, our theoretical results demonstrate that only moment functionals can exactly capture the statistical information. Secondly, we propose a provably efficient algorithm, $\texttt{SF-LSVI}$, that achieves a tight regret bound of $\tilde{O}(d_E H^{\frac{3}{2}}\sqrt{K})$ where $H$ is the horizon, $K$ is the number of episodes, and $d_E$ is the eluder dimension of a function class.</description>

      <title>radarODE: An ODE-Embedded Deep Learning Model for Contactless ECG Reconstruction from Millimeter-Wave Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radar-based contactless cardiac monitoring has become a popular research direction recently, but the fine-grained electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is still hard to reconstruct from millimeter-wave radar signal. The key obstacle is to decouple the cardiac activities in the electrical domain (i.e., ECG) from that in the mechanical domain (i.e., heartbeat), and most existing research only uses pure data-driven methods to map such domain transformation as a black box. Therefore, this work first proposes a signal model for domain transformation, and then a novel deep learning framework called radarODE is designed to fuse the temporal and morphological features extracted from radar signals and generate ECG. In addition, ordinary differential equations are embedded in radarODE as a decoder to provide morphological prior, helping the convergence of the model training and improving the robustness under body movements. After being validated on the dataset, the proposed radarODE achieves better performance compared with the benchmark in terms of missed detection rate, root mean square error, Pearson correlation coefficient with the improvement of 9%, 16% and 19%, respectively. The validation results imply that radarODE is capable of recovering ECG signals from radar signals with high fidelity and can be potentially implemented in real-life scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Struggles of LLMs in Cross-lingual Code Clone Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04430v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the involvement of multiple programming languages in modern software development, cross-lingual code clone detection has gained traction within the software engineering community. Numerous studies have explored this topic, proposing various promising approaches. Inspired by the significant advances in machine learning in recent years, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated their ability to tackle various tasks, this paper revisits cross-lingual code clone detection. We evaluate the performance of five (05) LLMs and eight prompts (08) for the identification of cross-lingual code clones. Additionally, we compare these results against two baseline methods. Finally, we evaluate a pre-trained embedding model to assess the effectiveness of the generated representations for classifying clone and non-clone pairs. The studies involving LLMs and Embedding models are evaluated using two widely used cross-lingual datasets, XLCoST and CodeNet. Our results show that LLMs can achieve high F1 scores, up to 0.99, for straightforward programming examples. However, they not only perform less well on programs associated with complex programming challenges but also do not necessarily understand the meaning of "code clones" in a cross-lingual setting. We show that embedding models used to represent code fragments from different programming languages in the same representation space enable the training of a basic classifier that outperforms all LLMs by ~1 and ~20 percentage points on the XLCoST and CodeNet datasets, respectively. This finding suggests that, despite the apparent capabilities of LLMs, embeddings provided by embedding models offer suitable representations to achieve state-of-the-art performance in cross-lingual code clone detection.</description>

      <title>LLM-3D Print: Large Language Models To Monitor and Control 3D Printing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Industry 4.0 has revolutionized manufacturing by driving digitalization and shifting the paradigm toward additive manufacturing (AM). Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), a key AM technology, enables the creation of highly customized, cost-effective products with minimal material waste through layer-by-layer extrusion, posing a significant challenge to traditional subtractive methods. However, the susceptibility of material extrusion techniques to errors often requires expert intervention to detect and mitigate defects that can severely compromise product quality. While automated error detection and machine learning models exist, their generalizability across diverse 3D printer setups, firmware, and sensors is limited, and deep learning methods require extensive labeled datasets, hindering scalability and adaptability. To address these challenges, we present a process monitoring and control framework that leverages pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside 3D printers to detect and address printing defects. The LLM evaluates print quality by analyzing images captured after each layer or print segment, identifying failure modes and querying the printer for relevant parameters. It then generates and executes a corrective action plan. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework in identifying defects by comparing it against a control group of engineers with diverse AM expertise. Our evaluation demonstrated that LLM-based agents not only accurately identify common 3D printing errors, such as inconsistent extrusion, stringing, warping, and layer adhesion, but also effectively determine the parameters causing these failures and autonomously correct them without any need for human intervention.</description>

      <title>Towards Predicting Temporal Changes in a Patient's Chest X-ray Images based on Electronic Health Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) is an important diagnostic tool widely used in hospitals to assess patient conditions and monitor changes over time. Recently, generative models, specifically diffusion-based models, have shown promise in generating realistic synthetic CXRs. However, these models mainly focus on conditional generation using single-time-point data, i.e., generating CXRs conditioned on their corresponding reports from a specific time. This limits their clinical utility, particularly for capturing temporal changes. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, EHRXDiff, which predicts future CXR images by integrating previous CXRs with subsequent medical events, e.g., prescriptions, lab measures, etc. Our framework dynamically tracks and predicts disease progression based on a latent diffusion model, conditioned on the previous CXR image and a history of medical events. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of our framework across three key aspects, including clinical consistency, demographic consistency, and visual realism. Results show that our framework generates high-quality, realistic future images that effectively capture potential temporal changes. This suggests that our framework could be further developed to support clinical decision-making and provide valuable insights for patient monitoring and treatment planning in the medical field. The code is available at https://github.com/dek924/EHRXDiff.</description>

      <title>Beyond Single Concept Vector: Modeling Concept Subspace in LLMs with Gaussian Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00153v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probing learned concepts in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for understanding how semantic knowledge is encoded internally. Training linear classifiers on probing tasks is a principle approach to denote the vector of a certain concept in the representation space. However, the single vector identified for a concept varies with both data and training, making it less robust and weakening its effectiveness in real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose an approach to approximate the subspace representing a specific concept. Built on linear probing classifiers, we extend the concept vectors into Gaussian Concept Subspace (GCS). We demonstrate GCS's effectiveness through measuring its faithfulness and plausibility across multiple LLMs with different sizes and architectures. Additionally, we use representation intervention tasks to showcase its efficacy in real-world applications such as emotion steering. Experimental results indicate that GCS concept vectors have the potential to balance steering performance and maintaining the fluency in natural language generation tasks.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Guided Self-Questioning and Answering for Video-Language Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of multi-modal models has been rapidly advancing, with some demonstrating remarkable capabilities. However, annotating video-text pairs remains expensive and insufficient. Take video question answering (VideoQA) tasks as an example, human annotated questions and answers often cover only part of the video, since the corresponding text is often short and monotonous, leading to underutilization of video. To address this, we propose a Bootstrapping Video-Language Alignment framework (BoViLA), a self-training method that augments question samples during training process through LLM-based self-questioning and answering, which help model exploit video information and the internal knowledge of LLMs more thoroughly to improve modality alignment. However, low-quality self-generated questions may instead contaminate the performance, especially in the early stages of training, as we have observed in our experiments. To filter bad self-generated questions, we introduce Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) to estimate uncertainty and assess the quality of self-generated questions by evaluating the modality alignment within the context. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to explore LLM-based self-training frameworks for modality alignment. We evaluate BoViLA on five strong VideoQA benchmarks, where it outperforms several state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate its effectiveness and generality. Additionally, we provide extensive analyses of the self-training framework and the EDL-based uncertainty filtering mechanism. The code will be made available.</description>

Abstract: Online hate speech has become increasingly prevalent on social media platforms, causing harm to individuals and society. While efforts have been made to combat this issue through content moderation, the potential of user-driven counterspeech as an alternative solution remains underexplored. Existing counterspeech methods often face challenges such as fear of retaliation and skill-related barriers. To address these challenges, we introduce CounterQuill, an AI-mediated system that assists users in composing effective and empathetic counterspeech. CounterQuill provides a three-step process: (1) a learning session to help users understand hate speech and counterspeech; (2) a brainstorming session that guides users in identifying key elements of hate speech and exploring counterspeech strategies; and (3) a co-writing session that enables users to draft and refine their counterspeech with CounterQuill. We conducted a within-subjects user study with 20 participants to evaluate CounterQuill in comparison to ChatGPT. Results show that CounterQuill's guidance and collaborative writing process provided users a stronger sense of ownership over their co-authored counterspeech. Users perceived CounterQuill as a writing partner and thus were more willing to post the co-written counterspeech online compared to the one written with ChatGPT.</description>

      <title>radarODE-MTL: A Multi-Task Learning Framework with Eccentric Gradient Alignment for Robust Radar-Based ECG Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar is promising to provide robust and accurate vital sign monitoring in an unobtrusive manner. However, the radar signal might be distorted in propagation by ambient noise or random body movement, ruining the subtle cardiac activities and destroying the vital sign recovery. In particular, the recovery of electrocardiogram (ECG) signal heavily relies on the deep-learning model and is sensitive to noise. Therefore, this work creatively deconstructs the radar-based ECG recovery into three individual tasks and proposes a multi-task learning (MTL) framework, radarODE-MTL, to increase the robustness against consistent and abrupt noises. In addition, to alleviate the potential conflicts in optimizing individual tasks, a novel multi-task optimization strategy, eccentric gradient alignment (EGA), is proposed to dynamically trim the task-specific gradients based on task difficulties in orthogonal space. The proposed radarODE-MTL with EGA is evaluated on the public dataset with prominent improvements in accuracy, and the performance remains consistent under noises. The experimental results indicate that radarODE-MTL could reconstruct accurate ECG signals robustly from radar signals and imply the application prospect in real-life situations. The code is available at: http://github.com/ZYY0844/radarODE-MTL.</description>

      <title>MAMMAL -- Molecular Aligned Multi-Modal Architecture and Language</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22367v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models applied to vast biological datasets have the potential to transform biology by uncovering disease mechanisms and accelerating drug development. However, current models are often siloed, trained separately on small-molecules, proteins, or transcriptomic data, limiting their ability to capture complex, multi-modal interactions. Effective drug discovery requires computational tools that integrate multiple biological entities while supporting prediction and generation, a challenge existing models struggle to address. For this purpose, we present MAMMAL - Molecular Aligned Multi-Modal Architecture and Language - a versatile method applied to create a multi-task foundation model that learns from large-scale biological datasets across diverse modalities, including proteins, small-molecules, and omics. MAMMAL's structured prompt syntax supports classification, regression, and generation tasks while handling token and scalar inputs and outputs. Evaluated on eleven diverse downstream tasks, it reaches a new state of the art (SOTA) in nine tasks and is comparable to SOTA in two tasks, all within a unified architecture, unlike prior task-specific models. Additionally, we explored Alphafold 3 binding prediction capabilities on antibody-antigen and nanobody-antigen complexes showing significantly better classification performance of MAMMAL in 3 out of 4 targets. The model code and pretrained weights are publicly available at https://github.com/BiomedSciAI/biomed-multi-alignment and https://huggingface.co/ibm/biomed.omics.bl.sm.ma-ted-458m</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have witnessed impressive advances in video action understanding. Increased dataset sizes, variability, and computation availability have enabled leaps in performance and task diversification. Current systems can provide coarse- and fine-grained descriptions of video scenes, extract segments corresponding to queries, synthesize unobserved parts of videos, and predict context across multiple modalities. This survey comprehensively reviews advances in uni- and multi-modal action understanding across a range of tasks. We focus on prevalent challenges, overview widely adopted datasets, and survey seminal works with an emphasis on recent advances. We broadly distinguish between three temporal scopes: (1) recognition tasks of actions observed in full, (2) prediction tasks for ongoing partially observed actions, and (3) forecasting tasks for subsequent unobserved action(s). This division allows us to identify specific action modeling and video representation challenges. Finally, we outline future directions to address current shortcomings.</description>

      <title>A Cognitive Paradigm Approach to Probe the Perception-Reasoning Interface in VLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13620v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence involves understanding the cognitive mechanisms underlying visual reasoning in sophisticated models like Vision-Language Models (VLMs). How do these models integrate visual perception with abstract thought, especially when reasoning across multiple images or requiring fine-grained compositional understanding? Drawing inspiration from cognitive science, this paper introduces a structured evaluation framework using diverse visual reasoning tasks-Bongard Problems (BPs) and Winoground-to dissect the perception-reasoning interface in VLMs. We propose three distinct evaluation paradigms, mirroring human problem-solving strategies: Direct Visual Rule Learning (DVRL; holistic processing), Deductive Rule Learning (DRL; rule extraction and application), and Componential Analysis (CA; analytical decomposition via task-agnostic textual descriptions). These paradigms systematically vary cognitive load and probe processing stages. Notably, CA enables multi-image reasoning evaluation even for single-image architectures and isolates reasoning from perception by operating on textual descriptions. Applying this framework, we demonstrate that CA, leveraging powerful language models for reasoning over rich, independently generated descriptions, achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on challenging benchmarks including Bongard-OpenWorld, Bongard-HOI, and Winoground. Ablation studies confirm reasoning improves significantly when perceptual challenges are mitigated, revealing a critical perception bottleneck. Our framework provides a valuable diagnostic tool and suggests that decoupling perception (via rich, task-agnostic description) from reasoning is a promising direction for robust and general visual intelligence.</description>

      <title>HardML: A Benchmark For Evaluating Data Science And Machine Learning knowledge and reasoning in AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present HardML, a benchmark designed to evaluate the knowledge and reasoning abilities in the fields of data science and machine learning. HardML comprises a diverse set of 100 challenging multiple-choice questions, handcrafted over a period of 6 months, covering the most popular and modern branches of data science and machine learning. These questions are challenging even for a typical Senior Machine Learning Engineer to answer correctly. To minimize the risk of data contamination, HardML uses mostly original content devised by the author. Current state of the art AI models achieve a 30% error rate on this benchmark, which is about 3 times larger than the one achieved on the equivalent, well known MMLU ML. While HardML is limited in scope and not aiming to push the frontier, primarily due to its multiple choice nature, it serves as a rigorous and modern testbed to quantify and track the progress of top AI. While plenty benchmarks and experimentation in LLM evaluation exist in other STEM fields like mathematics, physics and chemistry, the subfields of data science and machine learning remain fairly underexplored.</description>

      <title>HadamRNN: Binary and Sparse Ternary Orthogonal RNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00047v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary and sparse ternary weights in neural networks enable faster computations and lighter representations, facilitating their use on edge devices with limited computational power. Meanwhile, vanilla RNNs are highly sensitive to changes in their recurrent weights, making the binarization and ternarization of these weights inherently challenging. To date, no method has successfully achieved binarization or ternarization of vanilla RNN weights. We present a new approach leveraging the properties of Hadamard matrices to parameterize a subset of binary and sparse ternary orthogonal matrices. This method enables the training of orthogonal RNNs (ORNNs) with binary and sparse ternary recurrent weights, effectively creating a specific class of binary and sparse ternary vanilla RNNs. The resulting ORNNs, called HadamRNN and Block-HadamRNN, are evaluated on benchmarks such as the copy task, permuted and sequential MNIST tasks, the IMDB dataset, two GLUE benchmarks, and two IoT benchmarks. Despite binarization or sparse ternarization, these RNNs maintain performance levels comparable to state-of-the-art full-precision models, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, our approach is the first solution with binary recurrent weights capable of tackling the copy task over 1000 timesteps.</description>

      <title>Predicting potentially abusive clauses in Chilean terms of services with natural language processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the growing concern of information asymmetry in consumer contracts, exacerbated by the proliferation of online services with complex Terms of Service that are rarely even read. Even though research on automatic analysis methods is conducted, the problem is aggravated by the general focus on English-language Machine Learning approaches and on major jurisdictions, such as the European Union. We introduce a new methodology and a substantial dataset addressing this gap. We propose a novel annotation scheme with four categories and a total of 20 classes, and apply it on 50 online Terms of Service used in Chile. Our evaluation of transformer-based models highlights how factors like language- and/or domain-specific pre-training, few-shot sample size, and model architecture affect the detection and classification of potentially abusive clauses. Results show a large variability in performance for the different tasks and models, with the highest macro-F1 scores for the detection task ranging from 79% to 89% and micro-F1 scores up to 96%, while macro-F1 scores for the classification task range from 60% to 70% and micro-F1 scores from 64% to 80%. Notably, this is the first Spanish-language multi-label classification dataset for legal clauses, applying Chilean law and offering a comprehensive evaluation of Spanish-language models in the legal domain. Our work lays the ground for future research in method development for rarely considered legal analysis and potentially leads to practical applications to support consumers in Chile and Latin America as a whole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain randomization in reinforcement learning is an established technique for increasing the robustness of control policies trained in simulation. By randomizing environment properties during training, the learned policy can become robust to uncertainties along the randomized dimensions. While the environment distribution is typically specified by hand, in this paper we investigate automatically discovering a sampling distribution via entropy-regularized reward maximization of a normalizing-flow-based neural sampling distribution. We show that this architecture is more flexible and provides greater robustness than existing approaches that learn simpler, parameterized sampling distributions, as demonstrated in six simulated and one real-world robotics domain. Lastly, we explore how these learned sampling distributions, combined with a privileged value function, can be used for out-of-distribution detection in an uncertainty-aware multi-step manipulation planner.</description>

      <title>Music for All: Representational Bias and Cross-Cultural Adaptability of Music Generation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of Music-Language Models has greatly enhanced the automatic music generation capability of AI systems, but they are also limited in their coverage of the musical genres and cultures of the world. We present a study of the datasets and research papers for music generation and quantify the bias and under-representation of genres. We find that only 5.7% of the total hours of existing music datasets come from non-Western genres, which naturally leads to disparate performance of the models across genres. We then investigate the efficacy of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques in mitigating this bias. Our experiments with two popular models -- MusicGen and Mustango, for two underrepresented non-Western music traditions -- Hindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music, highlight the promises as well as the non-triviality of cross-genre adaptation of music through small datasets, implying the need for more equitable baseline music-language models that are designed for cross-cultural transfer learning.</description>

      <title>Caught in the Web of Words: Do LLMs Fall for Spin in Medical Literature?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07963v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical research faces well-documented challenges in translating novel treatments into clinical practice. Publishing incentives encourage researchers to present "positive" findings, even when empirical results are equivocal. Consequently, it is well-documented that authors often spin study results, especially in article abstracts. Such spin can influence clinician interpretation of evidence and may affect patient care decisions. In this study, we ask whether the interpretation of trial results offered by Large Language Models (LLMs) is similarly affected by spin. This is important since LLMs are increasingly being used to trawl through and synthesize published medical evidence. We evaluated 22 LLMs and found that they are across the board more susceptible to spin than humans. They might also propagate spin into their outputs: We find evidence, e.g., that LLMs implicitly incorporate spin into plain language summaries that they generate. We also find, however, that LLMs are generally capable of recognizing spin, and can be prompted in a way to mitigate spin's impact on LLM outputs.</description>

      <title>MoM: Linear Sequence Modeling with Mixture-of-Memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear sequence modeling methods, such as linear attention, state space modeling, and linear RNNs, offer significant efficiency improvements by reducing the complexity of training and inference. However, these methods typically compress the entire input sequence into a single fixed-size memory state, which leads to suboptimal performance on recall-intensive downstream tasks. Drawing inspiration from neuroscience, particularly the brain's ability to maintain robust long-term memory while mitigating "memory interference", we introduce a novel architecture called Mixture-of-Memories (MoM). MoM utilizes multiple independent memory states, with a router network directing input tokens to specific memory states. This approach greatly enhances the overall memory capacity while minimizing memory interference. As a result, MoM performs exceptionally well on recall-intensive tasks, surpassing existing linear sequence modeling techniques. Despite incorporating multiple memory states, the computation of each memory state remains linear in complexity, allowing MoM to retain the linear-complexity advantage during training, while constant-complexity during inference. Our experimental results show that MoM significantly outperforms current linear sequence models on downstream language tasks, particularly recall-intensive tasks, and even achieves performance comparable to Transformer models. The code is released at https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMs/MoM and is also released as a part of https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMs/Linear-MoE.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Risk Minimization Approach for Offline Inverse RL and Dynamic Discrete Choice Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14131v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating Dynamic Discrete Choice (DDC) models, also known as offline Maximum Entropy-Regularized Inverse Reinforcement Learning (offline MaxEnt-IRL) in machine learning. The objective is to recover reward or $Q^*$ functions that govern agent behavior from offline behavior data. In this paper, we propose a globally convergent gradient-based method for solving these problems without the restrictive assumption of linearly parameterized rewards. The novelty of our approach lies in introducing the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) based IRL/DDC framework, which circumvents the need for explicit state transition probability estimation in the Bellman equation. Furthermore, our method is compatible with non-parametric estimation techniques such as neural networks. Therefore, the proposed method has the potential to be scaled to high-dimensional, infinite state spaces. A key theoretical insight underlying our approach is that the Bellman residual satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition -- a property that, while weaker than strong convexity, is sufficient to ensure fast global convergence guarantees. Through a series of synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms benchmark methods and state-of-the-art alternatives.</description>

      <title>DEFT: Differentiable Branched Discrete Elastic Rods for Modeling Furcated DLOs in Real-Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15037v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous wire harness assembly requires robots to manipulate complex branched cables with high precision and reliability. A key challenge in automating this process is predicting how these flexible and branched structures behave under manipulation. Without accurate predictions, it is difficult for robots to reliably plan or execute assembly operations. While existing research has made progress in modeling single-threaded Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs), extending these approaches to Branched Deformable Linear Objects (BDLOs) presents fundamental challenges. The junction points in BDLOs create complex force interactions and strain propagation patterns that cannot be adequately captured by simply connecting multiple single-DLO models. To address these challenges, this paper presents Differentiable discrete branched Elastic rods for modeling Furcated DLOs in real-Time (DEFT), a novel framework that combines a differentiable physics-based model with a learning framework to: 1) accurately model BDLO dynamics, including dynamic propagation at junction points and grasping in the middle of a BDLO, 2) achieve efficient computation for real-time inference, and 3) enable planning to demonstrate dexterous BDLO manipulation.

      <title>Liver Cirrhosis Stage Estimation from MRI with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an end-to-end deep learning framework for automated liver cirrhosis stage estimation from multi-sequence MRI. Cirrhosis is the severe scarring (fibrosis) of the liver and a common endpoint of various chronic liver diseases. Early diagnosis is vital to prevent complications such as decompensation and cancer, which significantly decreases life expectancy. However, diagnosing cirrhosis in its early stages is challenging, and patients often present with life-threatening complications. Our approach integrates multi-scale feature learning with sequence-specific attention mechanisms to capture subtle tissue variations across cirrhosis progression stages. Using CirrMRI600+, a large-scale publicly available dataset of 628 high-resolution MRI scans from 339 patients, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in three-stage cirrhosis classification. Our best model achieves 72.8% accuracy on T1W and 63.8% on T2W sequences, significantly outperforming traditional radiomics-based approaches. Through extensive ablation studies, we show that our architecture effectively learns stage-specific imaging biomarkers. We establish new benchmarks for automated cirrhosis staging and provide insights for developing clinically applicable deep learning systems.

      <title>ToMCAT: Theory-of-Mind for Cooperative Agents in Teams via Multiagent Diffusion Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present ToMCAT (Theory-of-Mind for Cooperative Agents in Teams), a new framework for generating ToM-conditioned trajectories. It combines a meta-learning mechanism, that performs ToM reasoning over teammates' underlying goals and future behavior, with a multiagent denoising-diffusion model, that generates plans for an agent and its teammates conditioned on both the agent's goals and its teammates' characteristics, as computed via ToM. We implemented an online planning system that dynamically samples new trajectories (replans) from the diffusion model whenever it detects a divergence between a previously generated plan and the current state of the world. We conducted several experiments using ToMCAT in a simulated cooking domain. Our results highlight the importance of the dynamic replanning mechanism in reducing the usage of resources without sacrificing team performance. We also show that recent observations about the world and teammates' behavior collected by an agent over the course of an episode combined with ToM inferences are crucial to generate team-aware plans for dynamic adaptation to teammates, especially when no prior information is provided about them.</description>

      <title>Using Mechanistic Interpretability to Craft Adversarial Attacks against Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional white-box methods for creating adversarial perturbations against LLMs typically rely only on gradient computation from the targeted model, ignoring the internal mechanisms responsible for attack success or failure. Conversely, interpretability studies that analyze these internal mechanisms lack practical applications beyond runtime interventions. We bridge this gap by introducing a novel white-box approach that leverages mechanistic interpretability techniques to craft practical adversarial inputs. Specifically, we first identify acceptance subspaces - sets of feature vectors that do not trigger the model's refusal mechanisms - then use gradient-based optimization to reroute embeddings from refusal subspaces to acceptance subspaces, effectively achieving jailbreaks. This targeted approach significantly reduces computation cost, achieving attack success rates of 80-95\% on state-of-the-art models including Gemma2, Llama3.2, and Qwen2.5 within minutes or even seconds, compared to existing techniques that often fail or require hours of computation. We believe this approach opens a new direction for both attack research and defense development. Furthermore, it showcases a practical application of mechanistic interpretability where other methods are less efficient, which highlights its utility. The code and generated datasets are available at https://github.com/Sckathach/subspace-rerouting.</description>

      <title>CALLM: Understanding Cancer Survivors' Emotions and Intervention Opportunities via Mobile Diaries and Context-Aware Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cancer survivors face unique emotional challenges that impact their quality of life. Mobile diary entries provide a promising method for tracking emotional states, improving self-awareness, and promoting well-being outcome. This paper aims to, through mobile diaries, understand cancer survivors' emotional states and key variables related to just-in-time intervention opportunities, including the desire to regulate emotions and the availability to engage in interventions. Although emotion analysis tools show potential for recognizing emotions from text, current methods lack the contextual understanding necessary to interpret brief mobile diary narratives. Our analysis of diary entries from cancer survivors (N=407) reveals systematic relationships between described contexts and emotional states, with administrative and health-related contexts associated with negative affect and regulation needs, while leisure activities promote positive emotions. We propose CALLM, a Context-Aware framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to analyze these brief entries by integrating retrieved peer experiences and personal diary history. CALLM demonstrates strong performance with balanced accuracies reaching 72.96% for positive affect, 73.29% for negative affect, 73.72% for emotion regulation desire, and 60.09% for intervention availability, outperforming language model baselines. Post-hoc analysis reveals that model confidence strongly predicts accuracy, with longer diary entries generally enhancing performance, and brief personalization periods yielding meaningful improvements. Our findings demonstrate how contextual information in mobile diaries can be effectively leveraged to understand emotional experiences, predict key states, and identify optimal intervention moments for personalized just-in-time support.</description>

      <title>Towards Hierarchical Multi-Step Reward Models for Enhanced Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13551v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies show that Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong reasoning capabilities through supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. However, a key approach, the Process Reward Model (PRM), suffers from reward hacking, making it unreliable in identifying the best intermediate step. In addition, the cost of annotating reasoning processes for reward modeling is high, making large-scale collection of high-quality data challenging. To address this, we propose a novel reward model approach called the Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM), which evaluates both individual and consecutive reasoning steps at both fine-grained and coarse-grained levels. HRM excels at assessing multi-step reasoning coherence, especially when flawed steps are later corrected through self-reflection. To further reduce the cost of generating training data, we introduce a lightweight and effective data augmentation strategy called Hierarchical Node Compression (HNC), which merges two consecutive reasoning steps into one within the tree structure. By applying HNC to MCTS-generated reasoning trajectories, we enhance the diversity and robustness of HRM training data while introducing controlled noise with minimal computational overhead. Empirical results on the PRM800K dataset show that HRM, together with HNC, provides more stable and reliable evaluations than PRM. Furthermore, cross-domain evaluations on the MATH500 and GSM8K datasets demonstrate HRM's strong generalization and robustness across a variety of reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Content ARCs: Decentralized Content Rights in the Age of Generative AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) has sparked significant debate over balancing the interests of creative rightsholders and AI developers. As GenAI models are trained on vast datasets that often include copyrighted material, questions around fair compensation and proper attribution have become increasingly urgent. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a framework called Content ARCs (Authenticity, Rights, Compensation). By combining open standards for provenance and dynamic licensing with data attribution, and decentralized technologies, Content ARCs create a mechanism for managing rights and compensating creators for using their work in AI training. We characterize several nascent works in the AI data licensing space within Content ARCs and identify where challenges remain to fully implement the end-to-end framework.</description>

      <title>UI-Vision: A Desktop-centric GUI Benchmark for Visual Perception and Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous agents that navigate Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) to automate tasks like document editing and file management can greatly enhance computer workflows. While existing research focuses on online settings, desktop environments, critical for many professional and everyday tasks, remain underexplored due to data collection challenges and licensing issues. We introduce UI-Vision, the first comprehensive, license-permissive benchmark for offline, fine-grained evaluation of computer use agents in real-world desktop environments. Unlike online benchmarks, UI-Vision provides: (i) dense, high-quality annotations of human demonstrations, including bounding boxes, UI labels, and action trajectories (clicks, drags, and keyboard inputs) across 83 software applications, and (ii) three fine-to-coarse grained tasks-Element Grounding, Layout Grounding, and Action Prediction-with well-defined metrics to rigorously evaluate agents' performance in desktop environments. Our evaluation reveals critical limitations in state-of-the-art models like UI-TARS-72B, including issues with understanding professional software, spatial reasoning, and complex actions like drag-and-drop. These findings highlight the challenges in developing fully autonomous computer use agents. By releasing UI-Vision as open-source, we aim to advance the development of more capable agents for real-world desktop tasks.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-guided machine learning for county-level corn yield prediction under drought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) technique, enabling the non-contact acquisition of extensive ground observations, is a valuable tool for crop yield predictions. Traditional process-based models struggle to incorporate large volumes of RS data, and most users lack understanding of crop growth mechanisms. In contrast, machine learning (ML) models are often criticized as "black boxes" due to their limited interpretability. To address these limitations, we utilized Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (KGML), a framework that leverages the strengths of both process-based and ML models. Existing works have either overlooked the role of soil moisture in corn growth or did not embed this effect into their models. To bridge this gap, we developed the Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning with Soil Moisture (KGML-SM) framework, treating soil moisture as an intermediate variable in corn growth to emphasize its key role in plant development. Additionally, based on the prior knowledge that the model may overestimate under drought conditions, we designed a drought-aware loss function that penalized predicted yield in drought-affected areas. Our experiments showed that the KGML-SM model outperformed other traditional ML models. We explored the relationships between drought, soil moisture, and corn yield prediction by assessing the importance of different features within the model, and analyzing how soil moisture impacts predictions across different regions and time periods. Finally we provided interpretability for prediction errors to guide future model optimization.</description>

Abstract: Human-Machine Teaming (HMT) is revolutionizing collaboration across domains such as defense, healthcare, and autonomous systems by integrating AI-driven decision-making, trust calibration, and adaptive teaming. This survey presents a comprehensive taxonomy of HMT, analyzing theoretical models, including reinforcement learning, instance-based learning, and interdependence theory, alongside interdisciplinary methodologies. Unlike prior reviews, we examine team cognition, ethical AI, multi-modal interactions, and real-world evaluation frameworks. Key challenges include explainability, role allocation, and scalable benchmarking. We propose future research in cross-domain adaptation, trust-aware AI, and standardized testbeds. By bridging computational and social sciences, this work lays a foundation for resilient, ethical, and scalable HMT systems.</description>

      <title>HAIR: Hardness-Aware Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Introspective Reasoning for LLM Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values remains critical yet hindered by four key challenges: (1) scarcity of balanced safety datasets, (2) alignment tax, (3) vulnerability to jailbreak attacks due to shallow alignment, and (4) inability to dynamically adapt rewards according to task difficulty. To address these limitations, we introduce HAIR (Hardness-Aware Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Introspective Reasoning), a novel alignment approach inspired by shadow models in membership inference attacks. Our approach consists of two main components: (1) construction of a balanced safety Chain-of-Draft (CoD) dataset for seven harmful categories using structured prompts that leverage the introspective reasoning capabilities of LLMs; and (2) training of category-specific reward models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), dynamically tuning optimization to task difficulty at both the data and model levels. Comprehensive experiments across four harmlessness and four usefulness benchmarks demonstrate that HAIR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming all baseline methods in safety while maintaining high levels of usefulness.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Parametric Retrieval Augmented Generation for Test-time Knowledge Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23895v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents from external sources and incorporating them into the context. While it improves reliability by providing factual texts, it significantly increases inference costs as context length grows and introduces challenging issue of RAG hallucination, primarily caused by the lack of corresponding parametric knowledge in LLMs. An efficient solution is to enhance the knowledge of LLMs at test-time. Parametric RAG (PRAG) addresses this by embedding document into LLMs parameters to perform test-time knowledge enhancement, effectively reducing inference costs through offline training. However, its high training and storage costs, along with limited generalization ability, significantly restrict its practical adoption. To address these challenges, we propose Dynamic Parametric RAG (DyPRAG), a novel framework that leverages a lightweight parameter translator model to efficiently convert documents into parametric knowledge. DyPRAG not only reduces inference, training, and storage costs but also dynamically generates parametric knowledge, seamlessly enhancing the knowledge of LLMs and resolving knowledge conflicts in a plug-and-play manner at test-time. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capabilities of DyPRAG, offering a powerful and practical RAG paradigm which enables superior knowledge fusion and mitigates RAG hallucination in real-world applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/Trae1ounG/DyPRAG.</description>

      <title>LGIN: Defining an Approximately Powerful Hyperbolic GNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00142v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While graph neural networks (GNNs) operating in hyperbolic spaces have shown promise for modeling hierarchical and complex relational data, a critical limitation often overlooked is their potentially limited discriminative power compared to their Euclidean counterparts or fundamental graph isomorphism tests like the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) hierarchy. Existing hyperbolic aggregation schemes, while curvature-aware, may not sufficiently capture the intricate structural differences required to robustly distinguish non-isomorphic graphs owing to non-injective aggregation functions. To address this expressiveness gap in hyperbolic graph learning, we introduce the Lorentzian Graph Isomorphic Network (LGIN), a novel GNN designed to achieve enhanced discriminative capabilities within the Lorentzian model of hyperbolic space. LGIN proposes a new update rule that effectively combines local neighborhood information with a richer representation of graph structure designed to preserve the Lorentzian metric tensor. This represents a significant step towards building more expressive GNNs in non-Euclidean geometries, overcoming a common bottleneck in current hyperbolic methods. We conduct extensive evaluations across nine diverse benchmark datasets, including molecular and protein structures. LGIN consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art hyperbolic and Euclidean GNNs, showcasing its practical efficacy and validating its superior ability to capture complex graph structures and distinguish between different graphs. To the best of our knowledge, LGIN is the first work to study the framework behind a powerful GNN on the hyperbolic space. The code for our paper can be found at https://github.com/Deceptrax123/LGIN</description>

      <title>Catch Me if You Search: When Contextual Web Search Results Affect the Detection of Hallucinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01153v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While we increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) for various tasks, these models are known to produce inaccurate content or `hallucinations' with potentially disastrous consequences. The recent integration of web search results into LLMs prompts the question of whether people utilize them to verify the generated content, thereby accurately detecting hallucinations. An online experiment (N = 560) investigated how the provision of search results, either static (i.e., fixed search results provided by LLM) or dynamic (i.e., participant-led searches), affects participants' perceived accuracy of LLM-generated content (i.e., genuine, minor hallucination, major hallucination), self-confidence in accuracy ratings, as well as their overall evaluation of the LLM, as compared to the control condition (i.e., no search results). Results showed that participants in both static and dynamic conditions (vs. control) rated hallucinated content to be less accurate and perceived the LLM more negatively. However, those in the dynamic condition rated genuine content as more accurate and demonstrated greater overall self-confidence in their assessments than those in the static search or control conditions. We highlighted practical implications of incorporating web search functionality into LLMs in real-world contexts.</description>

      <title>DyTTP: Trajectory Prediction with Normalization-Free Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is a cornerstone for the safe operation of autonomous driving systems, where understanding the dynamic behavior of surrounding agents is crucial. Transformer-based architectures have demonstrated significant promise in capturing complex spatio-temporality dependencies. However, their reliance on normalization layers can lead to computation overhead and training instabilities. In this work, we present a two-fold approach to address these challenges. First, we integrate DynamicTanh (DyT), which is the latest method to promote transformers, into the backbone, replacing traditional layer normalization. This modification simplifies the network architecture and improves the stability of the inference. We are the first work to deploy the DyT to the trajectory prediction task. Complementing this, we employ a snapshot ensemble strategy to further boost trajectory prediction performance. Using cyclical learning rate scheduling, multiple model snapshots are captured during a single training run. These snapshots are then aggregated via simple averaging at inference time, allowing the model to benefit from diverse hypotheses without incurring substantial additional computational cost. Extensive experiments on Argoverse datasets demonstrate that our combined approach significantly improves prediction accuracy, inference speed and robustness in diverse driving scenarios. This work underscores the potential of normalization-free transformer designs augmented with lightweight ensemble techniques in advancing trajectory forecasting for autonomous vehicles.</description>

      <title>SEAL: Steerable Reasoning Calibration of Large Language Models for Free</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's o1-series have demonstrated compelling capabilities for complex reasoning tasks via the extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning mechanism. However, recent studies reveal substantial redundancy in the CoT reasoning traces, which not only increases inference latency but also negatively impacts model performance by diverting attention to unnecessary reasoning paths. To address this issue, we investigate the internal reasoning structures of LLMs and categorize them into three primary thought types: execution, reflection, and transition thoughts. Moreover, our analysis reveals that excessive reflection and transition thoughts are strongly correlated with failure cases and these thought categories exhibit clear separation in the latent space. Based on these, we introduce SEAL (Steerable reasoning calibration), a training-free approach that seamlessly calibrates the CoT process, improving accuracy while demonstrating significant efficiency gains. SEAL consists of an offline stage for extracting the reasoning steering vector in the latent space, followed by an on-the-fly calibration of the reasoning trace through representation intervention using the steering vector. Notably, the steering vector exhibits strong transferability across various tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple models (DeepSeek-R1-Distill and QwQ-32B-Preview) and benchmarks (Math500, GSM8K, LiveCodeBench) validate the effectiveness of SEAL, up to a 11% improvement in accuracy while reducing reasoning tokens by 11.8% to 50.4%. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/VITA-Group/SEAL.</description>

      <title>CCSK:Cognitive Convection of Self-Knowledge Based Retrieval Augmentation for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10498v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) in Q&amp;A task increased substantially through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) which brings in external knowledge. However, the main difficulty lies in balancing the inherent self-knowledge of LLMs with external information retrieval (IR). The current threshold-based methods apply one-dimensional static mechanisms with single criterion. As a result, their IR decisions might be irrelevant to the LLMs' response under difficult queries. To alleviate this problem, we propose Cognitive Convection of Self-Knowledge (CCSK). Different from traditional methods that maintain single fixed IR activation criteria, CCSK implements a dynamic joint decision process via a Siamese Network module and a Response Quality Model. The Siamese Network calculates the cosine similarity between the current query and the historical queries. The Response Quality Model evaluates the responses of LLMs through LightGBM. The final decision of the CCSK is derived from the outputs of the two modules, as well as text features fused using a multi-head attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that CCSK significantly enhances the model's effectiveness in information retrieval.</description>

      <title>Chain-of-Thought Textual Reasoning for Few-shot Temporal Action Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13460v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional temporal action localization (TAL) methods rely on large amounts of detailed annotated data, whereas few-shot TAL reduces this dependence by using only a few training samples to identify unseen action categories. However, existing few-shot TAL methods typically focus solely on video-level information, neglecting textual information, which can provide valuable semantic support for the localization task. Therefore, we propose a new few-shot temporal action localization method by Chain-of-Thought textual reasoning to improve localization performance. Specifically, we design a novel few-shot learning framework that leverages textual semantic information to enhance the model's ability to capture action commonalities and variations, which includes a semantic-aware text-visual alignment module designed to align the query and support videos at different levels. Meanwhile, to better express the temporal dependencies and causal relationships between actions at the textual level to assist action localization, we design a Chain of Thought (CoT)-like reasoning method that progressively guides the Vision Language Model (VLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) to generate CoT-like text descriptions for videos. The generated texts can capture more variance of action than visual features. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available ActivityNet1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets. We introduce the first dataset named Human-related Anomaly Localization and explore the application of the TAL task in human anomaly detection. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in single-instance and multi-instance scenarios. We will release our code, data and benchmark.</description>

      <title>Towards Accurate and Interpretable Neuroblastoma Diagnosis via Contrastive Multi-scale Pathological Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13754v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neuroblastoma, adrenal-derived, is among the most common pediatric solid malignancies, characterized by significant clinical heterogeneity. Timely and accurate pathological diagnosis from hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole-slide images is critical for patient prognosis. However, current diagnostic practices primarily rely on subjective manual examination by pathologists, leading to inconsistent accuracy. Existing automated whole-slide image classification methods encounter challenges such as poor interpretability, limited feature extraction capabilities, and high computational costs, restricting their practical clinical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose CMSwinKAN, a contrastive-learning-based multi-scale feature fusion model tailored for pathological image classification, which enhances the Swin Transformer architecture by integrating a Kernel Activation Network within its multilayer perceptron and classification head modules, significantly improving both interpretability and accuracy. By fusing multi-scale features and leveraging contrastive learning strategies, CMSwinKAN mimics clinicians' comprehensive approach, effectively capturing global and local tissue characteristics. Additionally, we introduce a heuristic soft voting mechanism guided by clinical insights to bridge patch-level predictions to whole-slide image-level classifications seamlessly. We verified the CMSwinKAN on the publicly available BreakHis dataset and the PpNTs dataset, which was established by our hospital. Results demonstrate that CMSwinKAN performs better than existing state-of-the-art pathology-specific models pre-trained on large datasets. Our source code is available at https://github.com/JSLiam94/CMSwinKAN.</description>

      <title>PINN-MEP: Continuous Neural Representations for Minimum-Energy Path Discovery in Molecular Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16381v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing conformational transitions in physical systems remains a fundamental challenge in the computational sciences. Traditional sampling methods like molecular dynamics (MD) or MCMC often struggle with the high-dimensional nature of molecular systems and the high energy barriers of transitions between stable states. While these transitions are rare events in simulation timescales, they often represent the most biologically significant processes - for example, the conformational change of an ion channel protein from its closed to open state, which controls cellular ion flow and is crucial for neural signaling. Such transitions in real systems may take milliseconds to seconds but could require months or years of continuous simulation to observe even once. We present a method that reformulates transition path generation as a continuous optimization problem solved through physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) inspired by string methods for minimum-energy path (MEP) generation. By representing transition paths as implicit neural functions and leveraging automatic differentiation with differentiable molecular dynamics force fields, our method enables the efficient discovery of physically realistic transition pathways without requiring expensive path sampling. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on two proteins, including an explicitly hydrated bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) system with over 8,300 atoms.</description>

      <title>Pushing the boundary on Natural Language Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) is a central task in natural language understanding with applications in fact-checking, question answering, and information retrieval. Despite its importance, current NLI systems heavily rely on supervised learning with datasets that often contain annotation artifacts and biases, limiting generalization and real-world applicability. In this work, we apply a reinforcement learning-based approach using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for Chain-of-Thought (CoT) learning in NLI, eliminating the need for labeled rationales and enabling this type of training on more challenging datasets such as ANLI. We fine-tune 7B, 14B, and 32B language models using parameter-efficient techniques (LoRA and QLoRA), demonstrating strong performance across standard and adversarial NLI benchmarks. Our 32B AWQ-quantized model surpasses state-of-the-art results on 7 out of 11 adversarial sets$\unicode{x2013}$or on all of them considering our replication$\unicode{x2013}$within a 22GB memory footprint, showing that robust reasoning can be retained under aggressive quantization. This work provides a scalable and practical framework for building robust NLI systems without sacrificing inference quality.</description>

      <title>RepliBench: Evaluating the Autonomous Replication Capabilities of Language Model Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncontrollable autonomous replication of language model agents poses a critical safety risk. To better understand this risk, we introduce RepliBench, a suite of evaluations designed to measure autonomous replication capabilities. RepliBench is derived from a decomposition of these capabilities covering four core domains: obtaining resources, exfiltrating model weights, replicating onto compute, and persisting on this compute for long periods. We create 20 novel task families consisting of 86 individual tasks. We benchmark 5 frontier models, and find they do not currently pose a credible threat of self-replication, but succeed on many components and are improving rapidly. Models can deploy instances from cloud compute providers, write self-propagating programs, and exfiltrate model weights under simple security setups, but struggle to pass KYC checks or set up robust and persistent agent deployments. Overall the best model we evaluated (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) has a &gt;50% pass@10 score on 15/20 task families, and a &gt;50% pass@10 score for 9/20 families on the hardest variants. These findings suggest autonomous replication capability could soon emerge with improvements in these remaining areas or with human assistance.</description>

      <title>UnifyFL: Enabling Decentralized Cross-Silo Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning (ML) paradigm in which models are trained on private data across several devices called clients and combined at a single node called an aggregator rather than aggregating the data itself. Many organizations employ FL to have better privacy-aware ML-driven decision-making capabilities. However, organizations often operate independently rather than collaborate to enhance their FL capabilities due to the lack of an effective mechanism for collaboration. The challenge lies in balancing trust and resource efficiency. One approach relies on trusting a third-party aggregator to consolidate models from all organizations (multilevel FL), but this requires trusting an entity that may be biased or unreliable. Alternatively, organizations can bypass a third party by sharing their local models directly, which requires significant computational resources for validation. Both approaches reflect a fundamental trade-off between trust and resource constraints, with neither offering an ideal solution. In this work, we develop a trust-based cross-silo FL framework called UnifyFL, which uses decentralized orchestration and distributed storage. UnifyFL provides flexibility to the participating organizations and presents synchronous and asynchronous modes to handle stragglers. Our evaluation on a diverse testbed shows that UnifyFL achieves a performance comparable to the ideal multilevel centralized FL while allowing trust and optimal use of resources.</description>

      <title>Light Weight CNN for classification of Brain Tumors from MRI Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach for the multi-class classification of brain tumors using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. We utilize a publicly available dataset containing MRI images categorized into four classes: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. Our primary objective is to build a light weight deep learning model that can automatically classify brain tumor types with high accuracy. To achieve this goal, we incorporate image preprocessing steps, including normalization, data augmentation, and a cropping technique designed to reduce background noise and emphasize relevant regions. The CNN architecture is optimized through hyperparameter tuning using Keras Tuner, enabling systematic exploration of network parameters. To ensure reliable evaluation, we apply 5-fold cross-validation, where each hyperparameter configuration is evaluated across multiple data splits to mitigate overfitting. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a classification accuracy of 98.78%, indicating its potential as a diagnostic aid in clinical settings. The proposed method offers a low-complexity yet effective solution for assisting in early brain tumor diagnosis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, natural language has been the primary medium for human-robot interaction. However, its inherent lack of spatial precision introduces challenges for robotic task definition such as ambiguity and verbosity. Moreover, in some public settings where quiet is required, such as libraries or hospitals, verbal communication with robots is inappropriate. To address these limitations, we introduce the Robotic Visual Instruction (RoVI), a novel paradigm to guide robotic tasks through an object-centric, hand-drawn symbolic representation. RoVI effectively encodes spatial-temporal information into human-interpretable visual instructions through 2D sketches, utilizing arrows, circles, colors, and numbers to direct 3D robotic manipulation. To enable robots to understand RoVI better and generate precise actions based on RoVI, we present Visual Instruction Embodied Workflow (VIEW), a pipeline formulated for RoVI-conditioned policies. This approach leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret RoVI inputs, decode spatial and temporal constraints from 2D pixel space via keypoint extraction, and then transform them into executable 3D action sequences. We additionally curate a specialized dataset of 15K instances to fine-tune small VLMs for edge deployment,enabling them to effectively learn RoVI capabilities. Our approach is rigorously validated across 11 novel tasks in both real and simulated environments, demonstrating significant generalization capability. Notably, VIEW achieves an 87.5% success rate in real-world scenarios involving unseen tasks that feature multi-step actions, with disturbances, and trajectory-following requirements.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Llama-Nemotron series of models, an open family of heterogeneous reasoning models that deliver exceptional reasoning capabilities, inference efficiency, and an open license for enterprise use. The family comes in three sizes -- Nano (8B), Super (49B), and Ultra (253B) -- and performs competitively with state-of-the-art reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 while offering superior inference throughput and memory efficiency. In this report, we discuss the training procedure for these models, which entails using neural architecture search from Llama 3 models for accelerated inference, knowledge distillation, and continued pretraining, followed by a reasoning-focused post-training stage consisting of two main parts: supervised fine-tuning and large scale reinforcement learning. Llama-Nemotron models are the first open-source models to support a dynamic reasoning toggle, allowing users to switch between standard chat and reasoning modes during inference. To further support open research and facilitate model development, we provide the following resources: 1. We release the Llama-Nemotron reasoning models -- LN-Nano, LN-Super, and LN-Ultra -- under the commercially permissive NVIDIA Open Model License Agreement. 2. We release the complete post-training dataset: Llama-Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset. 3. We also release our training codebases: NeMo, NeMo-Aligner, and Megatron-LM.</description>

      <title>Distilling Two-Timed Flow Models by Separately Matching Initial and Terminal Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A flow matching model learns a time-dependent vector field $v_t(x)$ that generates a probability path $\{ p_t \}_{0 \leq t \leq 1}$ that interpolates between a well-known noise distribution ($p_0$) and the data distribution ($p_1$). It can be distilled into a two-timed flow model (TTFM) $\phi_{s,x}(t)$ that can transform a sample belonging to the distribution at an initial time $s$ to another belonging to the distribution at a terminal time $t$ in one function evaluation. We present a new loss function for TTFM distillation called the \emph{initial/terminal velocity matching} (ITVM) loss that extends the Lagrangian Flow Map Distillation (LFMD) loss proposed by Boffi et al. by adding redundant terms to match the initial velocities at time $s$, removing the derivative from the terminal velocity term at time $t$, and using a version of the model under training, stabilized by exponential moving averaging (EMA), to compute the target terminal average velocity. Preliminary experiments show that our loss leads to better few-step generation performance on multiple types of datasets and model architectures over baselines.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Exploiting Plasticity for Non-stationary Network Resource Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adapting to non-stationary network conditions presents significant challenges for resource adaptation. However, current solutions primarily rely on stationary assumptions. While data-driven reinforcement learning approaches offer promising solutions for handling network dynamics, our systematic investigation reveals a critical limitation: neural networks suffer from plasticity loss, significantly impeding their ability to adapt to evolving network conditions. Through theoretical analysis of neural propagation mechanisms, we demonstrate that existing dormant neuron metrics inadequately characterize neural plasticity loss. To address this limitation, we have developed the Silent Neuron theory, which provides a more comprehensive framework for understanding plasticity degradation. Based on these theoretical insights, we propose the Reset Silent Neuron (ReSiN), which preserves neural plasticity through strategic neuron resets guided by both forward and backward propagation states. In our implementation of an adaptive video streaming system, ReSiN has shown significant improvements over existing solutions, achieving up to 168% higher bitrate and 108% better quality of experience (QoE) while maintaining comparable smoothness. Furthermore, ReSiN consistently outperforms in stationary environments, demonstrating its robust adaptability across different network conditions.</description>

      <title>Humans can learn to detect AI-generated texts, or at least learn when they can't</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates whether individuals can learn to accurately discriminate between human-written and AI-produced texts when provided with immediate feedback, and if they can use this feedback to recalibrate their self-perceived competence. We also explore the specific criteria individuals rely upon when making these decisions, focusing on textual style and perceived readability.
  We used GPT-4o to generate several hundred texts across various genres and text types comparable to Koditex, a multi-register corpus of human-written texts. We then presented randomized text pairs to 255 Czech native speakers who identified which text was human-written and which was AI-generated. Participants were randomly assigned to two conditions: one receiving immediate feedback after each trial, the other receiving no feedback until experiment completion. We recorded accuracy in identification, confidence levels, response times, and judgments about text readability along with demographic data and participants' engagement with AI technologies prior to the experiment.
  Participants receiving immediate feedback showed significant improvement in accuracy and confidence calibration. Participants initially held incorrect assumptions about AI-generated text features, including expectations about stylistic rigidity and readability. Notably, without feedback, participants made the most errors precisely when feeling most confident -- an issue largely resolved among the feedback group.
  The ability to differentiate between human and AI-generated texts can be effectively learned through targeted training with explicit feedback, which helps correct misconceptions about AI stylistic features and readability, as well as potential other variables that were not explored, while facilitating more accurate self-assessment. This finding might be particularly important in educational contexts.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Robustness of Deep Learning Models for Inland Water Body Segmentation from SAR Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inland water body segmentation from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is an important task needed for several applications, such as flood mapping. While SAR sensors capture data in all-weather conditions as high-resolution images, differentiating water and water-like surfaces from SAR images is not straightforward. Inland water bodies, such as large river basins, have complex geometry, which adds to the challenge of segmentation. U-Net is a widely used deep learning model for land-water segmentation of SAR images. In practice, manual annotation is often used to generate the corresponding water masks as ground truth. Manual annotation of the images is prone to label noise owing to data poisoning attacks, especially due to complex geometry. In this work, we simulate manual errors in the form of adversarial attacks on the U-Net model and study the robustness of the model to human errors in annotation. Our results indicate that U-Net can tolerate a certain level of corruption before its performance drops significantly. This finding highlights the crucial role that the quality of manual annotations plays in determining the effectiveness of the segmentation model. The code and the new dataset, along with adversarial examples for robust training, are publicly available. (GitHub link - https://github.com/GVCL/IWSeg-SAR-Poison.git)</description>

      <title>A Synergistic Framework of Nonlinear Acoustic Computing and Reinforcement Learning for Real-World Human-Robot Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework integrating nonlinear acoustic computing and reinforcement learning to enhance advanced human-robot interaction under complex noise and reverberation. Leveraging physically informed wave equations (e.g., Westervelt, KZK), the approach captures higher-order phenomena such as harmonic generation and shock formation. By embedding these models in a reinforcement learning-driven control loop, the system adaptively optimizes key parameters (e.g., absorption, beamforming) to mitigate multipath interference and non-stationary noise. Experimental evaluations, covering far-field localization, weak signal detection, and multilingual speech recognition, demonstrate that this hybrid strategy surpasses traditional linear methods and purely data-driven baselines, achieving superior noise suppression, minimal latency, and robust accuracy in demanding real-world scenarios. The proposed system demonstrates broad application prospects in AI hardware, robot, machine audition, artificial audition, and brain-machine interfaces.</description>

      <title>Regression is all you need for medical image translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The acquisition of information-rich images within a limited time budget is crucial in medical imaging. Medical image translation (MIT) can help enhance and supplement existing datasets by generating synthetic images from acquired data. While Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural image generation, their benefits - creativity and image realism - do not necessarily transfer to medical applications where highly accurate anatomical information is required. In fact, the imitation of acquisition noise or content hallucination hinder clinical utility. Here, we introduce YODA (You Only Denoise once - or Average), a novel 2.5D diffusion-based framework for volumetric MIT. YODA unites diffusion and regression paradigms to produce realistic or noise-free outputs. Furthermore, we propose Expectation-Approximation (ExpA) DM sampling, which draws inspiration from MRI signal averaging. ExpA-sampling suppresses generated noise and, thus, eliminates noise from biasing the evaluation of image quality. Through extensive experiments on four diverse multi-modal datasets - comprising multi-contrast brain MRI and pelvic MRI-CT - we show that diffusion and regression sampling yield similar results in practice. As such, the computational overhead of diffusion sampling does not provide systematic benefits in medical information translation. Building on these insights, we demonstrate that YODA outperforms several state-of-the-art GAN and DM methods. Notably, YODA-generated images are shown to be interchangeable with, or even superior to, physical acquisitions for several downstream tasks. Our findings challenge the presumed advantages of DMs in MIT and pave the way for the practical application of MIT in medical imaging.</description>

      <title>Think on your Feet: Adaptive Thinking via Reinforcement Learning for Social Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective social intelligence simulation requires language agents to dynamically adjust reasoning depth, a capability notably absent in current approaches. While existing methods either lack this kind of reasoning capability or enforce uniform long chain-of-thought reasoning across all scenarios, resulting in excessive token usage and inappropriate social simulation. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{M}$ode $\textbf{L}$earning ($\textbf{AML}$) that strategically selects from four thinking modes (intuitive reaction $\rightarrow$ deep contemplation) based on real-time context. Our framework's core innovation, the $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{M}$ode $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{AMPO}$) algorithm, introduces three key advancements over existing methods: (1) Multi-granular thinking mode design, (2) Context-aware mode switching across social interaction, and (3) Token-efficient reasoning via depth-adaptive processing. Extensive experiments on social intelligence tasks confirm that AML achieves 15.6% higher task performance than state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our method outperforms GRPO by 7.0% with 32.8% shorter reasoning chains. These results demonstrate that context-sensitive thinking mode selection, as implemented in AMPO, enables more human-like adaptive reasoning than GRPO's fixed-depth approach.</description>

      <title>Sharpness-Aware Minimization with Z-Score Gradient Filtering for Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves neural network generalization by optimizing the worst-case loss within a neighborhood of parameters, yet it perturbs parameters using the entire gradient vector, including components with low statistical significance. We introduce ZSharp, a refined sharpness-aware optimization method that incorporates layer-wise Z-score normalization followed by percentile-based filtering. This process selects only the most statistically significant gradient components-those with large standardized magnitudes-for constructing the perturbation direction. ZSharp retains the standard two-phase SAM structure of ascent and descent while modifying the ascent step to focus on sharper, curvature-relevant directions. We evaluate ZSharp on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet using a range of models including ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers. Across all architectures and datasets, ZSharp consistently achieves higher test accuracy compared to SAM, ASAM, and Friendly-SAM. These results indicate that Z-score-based gradient filtering can enhance the sharpness sensitivity of the update direction, leading to improved generalization in deep neural network training.</description>

      <title>Advancing Constrained Monotonic Neural Networks: Achieving Universal Approximation Beyond Bounded Activations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional techniques for imposing monotonicity in MLPs by construction involve the use of non-negative weight constraints and bounded activation functions, which pose well-known optimization challenges. In this work, we generalize previous theoretical results, showing that MLPs with non-negative weight constraint and activations that saturate on alternating sides are universal approximators for monotonic functions. Additionally, we show an equivalence between the saturation side in the activations and the sign of the weight constraint. This connection allows us to prove that MLPs with convex monotone activations and non-positive constrained weights also qualify as universal approximators, in contrast to their non-negative constrained counterparts. Our results provide theoretical grounding to the empirical effectiveness observed in previous works while leading to possible architectural simplification. Moreover, to further alleviate the optimization difficulties, we propose an alternative formulation that allows the network to adjust its activations according to the sign of the weights. This eliminates the requirement for weight reparameterization, easing initialization and improving training stability. Experimental evaluation reinforces the validity of the theoretical results, showing that our novel approach compares favourably to traditional monotonic architectures.</description>

      <title>EMORL: Ensemble Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Efficient and Flexible LLM Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) for large language model (LLM) fine-tuning show promise in addressing multi-objective tasks but still face significant challenges, including complex objective balancing, low training efficiency, poor scalability, and limited explainability. Leveraging ensemble learning principles, we introduce an Ensemble Multi-Objective RL (EMORL) framework that fine-tunes multiple models with individual objectives while optimizing their aggregation after the training to improve efficiency and flexibility. Our method is the first to aggregate the last hidden states of individual models, incorporating contextual information from multiple objectives. This approach is supported by a hierarchical grid search algorithm that identifies optimal weighted combinations. We evaluate EMORL on counselor reflection generation tasks, using text-scoring LLMs to evaluate the generations and provide rewards during RL fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments on the PAIR and Psych8k datasets, we demonstrate the advantages of EMORL against existing baselines: significantly lower and more stable training consumption ($17,529\pm 1,650$ data points and $6,573\pm 147.43$ seconds), improved scalability and explainability, and comparable performance across multiple objectives.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Graphs for Enhancing Large Language Models in Entity Disambiguation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have positioned them as a prominent solution for Natural Language Processing tasks. Notably, they can approach these problems in a zero or few-shot manner, thereby eliminating the need for training or fine-tuning task-specific models. However, LLMs face some challenges, including hallucination and the presence of outdated knowledge or missing information from specific domains in the training data. These problems cannot be easily solved by retraining the models with new data as it is a time-consuming and expensive process. To mitigate these issues, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have been proposed as a structured external source of information to enrich LLMs. With this idea, in this work we use KGs to enhance LLMs for zero-shot Entity Disambiguation (ED). For that purpose, we leverage the hierarchical representation of the entities' classes in a KG to gradually prune the candidate space as well as the entities' descriptions to enrich the input prompt with additional factual knowledge. Our evaluation on popular ED datasets shows that the proposed method outperforms non-enhanced and description-only enhanced LLMs, and has a higher degree of adaptability than task-specific models. Furthermore, we conduct an error analysis and discuss the impact of the leveraged KG's semantic expressivity on the ED performance.</description>
