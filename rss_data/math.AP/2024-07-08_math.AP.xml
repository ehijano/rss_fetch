      <title>Periodic gravity-capillary roll wave solutions to the inclined viscous shallow water equations in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study periodic, two-dimensional, gravity-capillary traveling wave solutions to a viscous shallow water system posed on an inclined plane. While thinking of the Reynolds and Bond numbers as fixed and finite, we vary the speed of the traveling frame and the degree of the incline and identify a set of the latter two parameters that classifies from which combinations nontrivial and small amplitude solution curves originate. Our principal technical tools are a combination of the implicit function theorem and a local multiparameter bifurcation theorem. To the best of the author's knowledge, this paper constitutes the first construction and mathematical study of properly two dimensional examples of viscous roll waves.</description>

      <title>Large Time Behavior of Solutions to Cauchy Problem for 1-D Compressible Isentropic Navier-Stokes/Allen-Cahn System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the large time behavior of the solutions to the Cauchy problem for the one-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes/Allen-Cahn system with the immiscible two-phase flow initially located near the phase separation state. Under the assumptions that the initial data is a small perturbation of the constant state, we prove the global existence and uniqueness of the solutions and establish the time decay rates of the solution as well as its higher-order spatial derivatives. Moreover, we derive that the solutions of the system are time asymptotically approximated by the solutions of the modified parabolic system and obtain decay rates in $L^2$ and $L^1$. Furthermore, we show that the solution of the system is time asymptotically approximated in $L^p (1 \leq p \leq+\infty)$ by the diffusion waves.</description>

      <title>Multi-phase high frequency solutions to Klein-Gordon-Maxwell equations in Lorenz gauge in (3+1) Minkowski spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a 1-parameter family (A{\lambda}, {\Phi}{\lambda}){\lambda} of multi-phase high frequency solutions to Klein-Gordon-Maxwell equations in Lorenz gauge in the (3+1)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. This family is based on an initial ansatz. We prove that for {\lambda} small enough the family of solutions exists on an interval uniform in {\lambda} only function of the initial ansatz. These solutions are close to an approximate solution constructed by geometric optics. The initial ansatz needs to be regular enough, to satisfy a polarization condition and to satisfy the constraints for Maxwell null-transport in Lorenz gauge, but there is no need for smallness of any kind. The phases need to interact in a coherent way. We also observe that the limit (A0, {\Phi}0) is not solution to Klein-Gordon-Maxwell equations but to a Klein-Gordon-Maxwell null-transport type system.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and ill-posedness for a system of periodic quadratic derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem of a system of quadratic derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations which was introduced by M. Colin and T. Colin (2004) as a model of laser-plasma interaction. For the nonperiodic setting, the authors proved some well-posedness results, which contain the scaling critical case for $d\geq 2$. In the present paper, we prove the well-posedness of this system for the periodic setting. In particular, well-posedness is proved at the scaling critical regularity for $d\geq 3$ under some conditions for the coefficients of the Laplacian. We also prove some ill-posedness results. As long as we use an iteration argument, our well-posedness results are optimal except for some critical cases.</description>

      <title>Mixed type boundary value problem of elliptic equation in a thin domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the a priori estimates for two-dimensional second order homogeneous linear elliptic equations in a narrow region. In a crescent-shaped area, part of the boundary is subject to an oblique derivative boundary condition, while the other part of the boundary is subject to a Dirichlet boundary condition. We show that, as the crescent-shaped area collapses into a segment under suitable conditions, the boundary value problem obeys uniform Schauder estimates and induces an asymptotic estimate.</description>

      <title>Approximation of the first Steklov-Dirichlet eigenvalue on eccentric spherical shells in general dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the first Steklov-Dirichlet eigenvalue on eccentric spherical shells in $\mathbb{R}^{n+2}$ with $n\geq 1$, imposing the Steklov condition on the outer boundary sphere, denoted by $\Gamma_S$, and the Dirichlet condition on the inner boundary sphere. The first eigenfunction admits a Fourier--Gegenbauer series expansion via the bispherical coordinates, where the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator on $\Gamma_S$ can be recursively expressed in terms of the expansion coefficients arXiv:2309.09587. In this paper, we develop a finite section approach for the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator to approximate the first Steklov--Dirichlet eigenvalue on eccentric spherical shells. We prove the exponential convergence of this approach by using the variational characterization of the first eigenvalue. Furthermore, based on the convergence result, we propose a numerical computation scheme as an extension of the two-dimensional result in [Hong et al., Ann. Mat. Pura Appl., 2022] to general dimensions. We provide numerical examples of the first Steklov-Dirichlet eigenvalue on eccentric spherical shells with various geometric configurations.</description>

      <title>The existence of solutions for a Schrodinger equation with jumping nonlinearities crossing the essential spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the existence of one solution for a Schr\"{o}dinger equation with jumping nonlinearities: $-\Delta u+V(x)u=f(x,u)$, $x\in \mathbb {R}^N$, and $u(x)\to 0$, $|x|\to +\infty$, where $V$ is a potential function on which we make hypotheses, and in particular allow $V$ which is unbounded below, and $f(x,u)=au^-+bu^++g(x,u)$. No restriction on $b$ is required, which implies that $f(x,s)s^{-1}$ may interfere with the essential spectrum of $ -\Delta+V$ for $s\to +\infty$. Using the truncation method and the Morse theory, we can compute critical groups of the corresponding functional at zero and infinity, then prove the existence of one negative solution.</description>

      <title>The optimal time-decay estimates for 2-D inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the optimal time-decay estimates for 2-D inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes equations. In particular, we prove that $\|u(t)\|_{\dot{B}^{\theta}_{p,1}({\mathop{\mathbb R\kern 0pt}\nolimits}^2)}={\mathcal O} (t^{\frac1p-\frac32-\frac{\theta}2})$ as $t\rightarrow\infty$ for any $p\in[2,\infty[,~\theta\in [0,2]$ if initially $\rho_0u_0\in \dot{B}^{-2}_{2,\infty}({\mathop{\mathbb R\kern 0pt}\nolimits}^2)$. This is optimal even for the classical homogeneous Navier-Stokes equations. Different with Schonbek and Wiegner's Fourier splitting device, our method here seems more direct, and can adapt to many other equations as well. Moreover, our method allows us to work in the $L^p$-based spaces.</description>

Abstract: In this short paper we prove, using the JKO scheme, that quantities such as the Fisher information stay bounded or decrease across time for a family of 1-homogeneous diffusive PDEs. As a corollary, we prove that moduli of continuity are conserved across time for the solutions of those PDEs.</description>

Abstract: Well-posedness of certain semilinear parabolic problems with nonlocal initial conditions is shown in time-weighted spaces. The result is applied to recover the initial states in semilinear parabolic problems with nonlinearities of superlinear behavior near zero from small time-averages over arbitrary time periods.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal-to-local convergence of the Cahn-Hilliard equation with degenerate mobility and the Flory-Huggins potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cahn-Hilliard equation is a fundamental model for phase separation phenomena. Its rigorous derivation from the nonlocal aggregation equation, motivated by the desire to link interacting particle systems and continuous descriptions, has received much attention in recent years. In the recent article, we showed how to treat the case of degenerate mobility for the first time. Here, we discuss how to adapt the exploited tools to the case of the mobility $m(u)=u\,(1-u)$ as in the original works of Giacomin-Lebowitz and Elliott-Garcke. The main additional information is the boundedness of $u$, implied by the form of mobility, which allows handling the nonlinear terms. We also discuss the case of (mildly) singular kernels and a model of cell-cell adhesion with the same mobility.</description>

This complements known examples of such kind of homeomorphisms whose gradient has rank $&lt;k$ almost everywhere.</description>

      <title>A uniform-in-time nonlocal approximation of the standard Fokker-Planck equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a nonlocal approximation of the Fokker-Planck equation in which we can estimate the speed of convergence to equilibrium in a way which respects the local limit of the equation. This uniform estimate cannot be easily obtained with standard inequalities or entropy methods, but can be obtained through the use of Harris's theorem, finding interesting links to quantitative versions of the central limit theorem in probability. As a consequence one can prove that solutions of this nonlocal approximation converge to solutions of the usual Fokker-Planck equation uniformly in time -- hence we show the approximation is asymptotic-preserving in this sense. The associated equilibrium has some interesting tail and regularity properties, which we also study.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness for rough solutions of defocusing cubic NLS on three dimensional compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the global well-posedness for cubic nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation(NLS) $ i\partial_tu+\Delta_gu=|u|^2u$ posed on the three dimensional compact manifolds $(M,g)$ with initial data $u_0\in H^s(M)$ where $s&gt;\frac{\sqrt{21}-1}{4}$ for Zoll manifold and $s&gt;\frac{1+3\sqrt{5}}{8}$ for the product of spheres $\Bbb{S}^2\times\Bbb{S}^1$. We utilize the multilinear eigenfunction estimate on compact manifold to treat the interaction of different frequencies, which is more complicated compared to the case of flat torus [C. Fan, G. Staffilani, H. Wang, B. Wilson, Anal. PDE, 11 (2018), 919-944.] and waveguide manifold [Z. Zhao, J. Zheng, SIAM J. Math. Anal. 53 (2020), 3644-3660.]. Moreover, combining with the I-method adapted to the non-periodic case, bilinear Strichartz estimates along with the scale-invariant $L^p$ linear Strichartz estimates, we partially obtain the similar result of [Z. Zhao, J. Zheng, SIAM J. Math. Anal. 53 (2020), 3644-3660.] on non-flat compact manifold setting. As a consequence, we obtain the polynomial bounds of the $H^s$ norm of solution $u$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the limit of vanishing lattice spacing we provide a rigorous variational coarse-graining result for a next-to-nearest neighbor lattice model of a simple crystal. We show that the $\Gamma$-limit of suitable scaled versions of the model leads to an energy describing a continuum mechanical model depending on partial dislocations and stacking faults. Our result highlights the necessary multiscale character of the energies setting the groundwork for more comprehensive models that can better explain and predict the mechanical behavior of materials with complex defect structures.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of 2D Navier-Stokes with Dirichlet boundary fractional noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the global well-posedness and interior regularity for the 2D Navier-Stokes equations driven by a fractional noise acting as an inhomogeneous Dirichlet-type boundary condition. The model describes a vertical slice of the ocean with a relative motion between the two surfaces and can be thought of as a stochastic variant of the Couette flow. The relative motion of the surfaces is modeled by a Gaussian noise which is coloured in space and fractional in time with Hurst parameter greater than 3/4.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the following anisotropic quasi-geostrophic equations \begin{equation}\tag*{$(AQG)_{\alpha,\beta}$} \partial_t\theta+ u_\theta.\nabla\theta +\mu|\partial_1|^{2\alpha}\theta+\nu |\partial_2|^{2\beta}\theta=0,\quad u_\theta=\mathcal{R}^{\perp}\theta, \end{equation} where $\min\{\alpha,\beta\}=\frac{1}{2}$ et $\max\{\alpha,\beta\}\in \left(\frac{1}{2},1\right)$. This equation is a particular case of the equation introduced by Ye (2019) in \cite{YZ}. In this paper, we prove that for any initial data $\theta^0$ in the Sobolev space $H^{s}(\mathbb{R}^2)$, $s &gt;1$, the equation $(AQG)_{\alpha,\beta}$ has a global solution $\theta$ in $C_b(\mathbb{R}^+,H^s(\mathbb{R}^2)).$</description>

      <title>Properties of Besov-Lorentz spaces and application to Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg, Fefferman and Lin, we try to investigate how to control the set of large value points for the strong solution of Navier-Stokes equations. Besov-Lorentz spaces have multiple indices which can reflect complex changes of the set of the large value points. Hence we consider some properties of Gauss flow, paraproduct flow and couple flow related to the Besov-Lorentz spaces. When dealing with Lorentz index, we use wavelets and maximum norm to describe the decay situation in the binary time ring and to define time-frequency microlocal maximum norm space. We use maximum operator, $\alpha$-triangle inequality and H\"older inequality etc to get accurate estimates. As an application, we get a global wellposedness result of the Navier-Stokes equations where the solution can reflect how the size of the set of large value points changes.</description>

      <title>Linear Partial Differential Equations in Module of Copolynomials of Several Variables over a Commutative Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the copolynomials of $n$ variables, i.e. $K$-linear mappings from the ring of polynomials $K[x_1,...,x_n]$ into the commutative ring $K$.
  We prove an existence and uniqueness theorem for a linear differential equation of infinite order which can be considered as an algebraic version of the classical Malgrange-Ehrenpreis theorem for the existence of the fundamental solution of a linear differential operator with constant coefficients. We find the fundamental solutions of linear differential operators of infinite order and show that the unique solution of the corresponding inhomogeneous equation can be represented as a convolution of the fundamental solution of this operator and the right-hand side. We also prove the existence and uniqueness theorem of the Cauchy problem for some linear differential equations in the module of formal power series with copolynomial coefficients.</description>

      <title>Liouville theorems and universal estimates for superlinear elliptic problems without scale invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give applications of known and new Liouville type theorems to universal singularity and decay estimates for non scale invariant elliptic problems, including Lane-Emden and Schr\"odinger type systems. This applies to various classes of nonlinearities with regular variation and possibly different behaviors at $0$ and $\infty$. To this end, we adapt the method from [72] to elliptic systems, which relies on a generalized rescaling technique and on doubling arguments from [55].
  This is in particular facilitated by new Liouville type theorems in the whole space and in a half-space, for elliptic problems without scale invariance, that we obtain. Our results apply to some non-cooperative systems, for which maximum principle based techniques such as moving planes do not apply. To prove these Liouville type theorems, we employ two methods, respectively based on Pohozaev-type identities combined with functional inequalities on the unit sphere, and on reduction to a scalar equation by proportionality of components.
  In turn we will survey the existing methods for proving Liouville-type theorems for superlinear elliptic equations and systems, and list some of the typical existing results for (Sobolev subcritical) systems.
  In the case of scalar equations, we also revisit the classical Gidas-Spruck integral Bernstein method, providing some improvements which turn out to be efficient for certain nonlinearities, and we next compare the performances of various methods on a benchmark example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes non-uniform continuity of the data-to-solution map in the periodic case, for the two-component Fornberg-Whitham system in Besov spaces $B^s_{p,r}(\mathbb{T}) \times B^{s-1}_{p,r}(\mathbb{T})$ for $s&gt; \max\{2+\frac{1}{p}, \frac{5}{2}\}$. In particular, when $p=2$ and $r=2$, this proves the non-uniform dependence on initial data for the system in Sobolev spaces $H^s(\mathbb{T})\times H^{s-1}(\mathbb{T})$ for $s&gt; \frac{5}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Lower gradient estimates for viscosity solutions to first-order Hamilton--Jacobi equations depending on the unknown function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the lower bounds for the gradients of viscosity solutions to the Hamilton--Jacobi equation, where the convex Hamiltonian depends on the unknown function. We obtain gradient estimates using two different methods. First, we utilize the equivalence between viscosity solutions and Barron--Jensen solutions to study the properties of the inf-convolution. Second, we examine the Lie equation to understand how initial gradients propagate along its solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new numerical strategy for the stabilization of evolution systems. The method is based on the methodology given by Ammari, Nicaise and Pignotti in "Stabilization by switching time-delay, Asymptot. Anal., 83 (2013), 263--283". This method is then implemented in 1D by suitable numerical approximation techniques. Numerical experiments complete this study to confirm the theoretical announced results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the indirect stabilization problem for a system of two coupled semilinear wave equations with internal damping in a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The nonlinearity is assumed to be subcritical, defocusing and analytic. Under geometric control condition on both coupling and damping regions, we establish the exponential energy decay rate.</description>

      <title>Moments approaches for asymptotic inverse problems of depolymerisation and fragmentation systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shrinkage of large particles, either through depolymerisation (i.e. progressive shortening) or through fragmentation (breakage into smaller pieces) may be modelled by discrete equations, of Becker-D\''oring type, or by continuous ones. In this note, we review two kinds of inverse problems: the first is the estimation of the initial size-distribution from moments measurements in a depolymerising system, in collaboration with Philippe Moireau and inspired by experiments carried out by Human Rezaei's team; the second is the inference of fragmentation characteristics from size distribution samples, in collaboration with Miguel Escobedo and Magali Tournus, based on biological questions and experiments of Wei-Feng Xue's team.</description>

      <title>Beale--Kato--Majda-type continuation criteria for Hall- and electron-magnetohydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that regular solutions to electron-MHD with resistivity can be continued as long as the time integral of the supremum of the current gradient remains finite. This dimensionless continuation criterion is analogous to the celebrated result of Beale--Kato--Majda for the incompressible Euler and Navier--Stokes equations. A similar continuation criterion, formulated in terms of the time integral of the supremum of the vorticity, velocity gradient and current gradient, is established for the Hall-MHD with resistivity as well.</description>

      <title>Germs for scalar conservation laws: the Hamilton-Jacobi equation point of view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the entropy solution to a scalar conservation law posed on the real line with a  flux that is discontinuous  at one point (in the space variable) coincides with the derivative of the solution to a Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equation whose Hamiltonian is discontinuous. Flux functions (Hamiltonians) are not assumed to be convex in the state (gradient) variable. The proof consists in proving the  convergence of two numerical schemes.  We rely on the theory developed   by B.~Andreianov, K.~H.~Karlsen and N.~H.~Risebro (\textit{Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal.}, 2011) for such scalar conservation laws  and on the viscosity solution theory developed by the authors (\textit{arxiv}, 2023) for the corresponding HJ equation.  This study allows us to characterise certain germs introduced in the AKR theory (namely maximal and complete ones) and relaxation operators introduced in the viscosity solution framework.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Analysis of a bi-monomeric nonlinear Becker-D{\"o}ring system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To provide a mechanistic explanation of sustained {then} damped oscillations observed in a depolymerisation experiment,  a bi-monomeric variant of the seminal Becker-D\"oring system has been proposed in \cite{DFMR}. When all reaction rates are constant, the equations are the following: \begin{align*}\frac{dv}{dt} &amp; =-vw+v\sum_{j=2}^{\infty}c_{j}, \qquad \frac{dw}{dt} =vw-w\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}c_{j},  \\ \frac{dc_{j}}{dt} &amp; =J_{j-1}-J_{j}\ \ ,\ \ j\geq1\ \ ,\ \ \ J_{j}=wc_{j}-vc_{j+1}\ \ ,\ \ j\geq1\ \ ,\ J_{0}=0,
\end{align*} where $v$ and $w$ are two distinct unit species, and $c_i$ represents the concentration of clusters containing $i$ units.
  We study in detail the mechanisms leading to such oscillations and characterise the different phases of the dynamics, from the initial high-amplitude oscillations to the progressive damping leading to the convergence towards the unique positive stationary solution. We give quantitative approximations for the main quantities of interest: period of the oscillations, size of the damping (corresponding to a loss of energy), number of oscillations characterising each phase. We illustrate these results by numerical simulation, in line with the theoretical results,  and provide numerical methods to solve the system.</description>

      <title>On a nonlinear nonlocal reaction-diffusion system applied to image restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with a novel nonlinear coupled nonlocal reaction-diffusion system proposed for image restoration, characterized by the advantages of preserving low gray level features and textures.The gray level indicator in the proposed model is regularized using a new method based on porous media type equations, which is suitable for recovering noisy blurred images. The well-posedness, regularity, and other properties of the model are investigated, addressing the lack of theoretical analysis in those existing similar types of models. Numerical experiments conducted on texture and satellite images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in denoising and deblurring tasks.</description>

      <title>The rigorous derivation of Vlasov equations with local alignments from moderately interacting particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a rigorous derivation of the mean-field limit for a moderately interacting particle system in $\R^d$ $(d\geq 2)$. For stochastic initial data, we demonstrate that the solution to the interacting particle model, with an appropriately applied cut-off, converges in probabilistic sense to the solution of the characteristics of the regularized Vlasov models featuring local alignments and Newtonian potential. Notably, the cutoff parameter for the singular potential is selected to scale polynomially with the number of particles, representing an improvement over the logarithmic cut-off obtained in [38].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study nonlinear Vlasov equations with a smooth interaction kernel on a compact manifold without boundary where the geodesic flow exhibits strong chaotic behavior, known as the Anosov property. We show that, for small initial data with finite regularity and supported away from the null section, there exist global solutions to the nonlinear Vlasov equations which weakly converge to an equilibrium of the free transport equation, and whose potential strongly converges to zero, both with exponential speed. Central to our approach are microlocal anisotropic Sobolev spaces, originally developed for studying Pollicott-Ruelle resonances, that we further refine to deal with the geometry of the full cotangent bundle, which paves the way to the analysis of nonlinear Vlasov equations.</description>

      <title>Global dynamics for the generalized chemotaxis-Navier-Stokes system in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem of the three-dimensional generalized chemotaxis-Navier-Stokes system
  \begin{eqnarray*}
  \begin{cases} \partial_t n+u\cdot \nabla n=\Delta n- \nabla \cdot (\chi(c)n \nabla c),\\ \partial_t c+u \cdot \nabla c=\Delta c-nf(c),\\ \partial_t u +u \cdot \nabla u+\nabla P=-(-\Delta)^\alpha u-n\nabla \phi,\\ \nabla \cdot u=0. 
  \end{cases} \end{eqnarray*} First, we study the time extensibility criteria of strong solutions, including the Prodi-Serrin type criterion ($\alpha&gt;\frac{3}{4}$) and the Beir${\rm\tilde{a}}$o da Veiga type criterion $(\alpha&gt;\frac{1}{2})$. Furthermore, with Lions' dissipation exponent $\alpha\geq \frac{5}{4}$, we verify the global existence and uniqueness of strong solutions for arbitrarily large initial fluid velocity and oxygen concentration. These results reflect the influence of the generalized dissipation for the solutions of the coupled chemotaxis-fluid equations. Finally, in the scenario of weaker dissipation ($\frac{3}{4}&lt;\alpha&lt;\frac{5}{4}$), we establish uniform regularity estimates for global strong solutions and further obtain optimal time-decay rates under the mild condition that the initial $L^2$ energy is small. To our knowledge, this is the first result concerning the global existence and large-time behavior of strong solutions for the three-dimensional chemotaxis-Navier-Stokes equations with possibly large oscillations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a truncation of the second year group project at Imperial college london. In this paper, we consider a semilinear reaction diffusion system of SIR model which involves the birth rate and the death rate. We first prove the non-negativity and global existence theorem to ensure that the model makes sense. We prove the uniform convergence of the infection-free solution and study an example that separable solutions can be computed. We also focus on the steady state solution, which we prove the non-uniqueness of the solution and investigate the regularity of the general solution. In the end we also introduce an interesting phenomenon, which is called the Turing instability caused by the diffusion in the model.</description>

      <title>Monotone heteroclinic solutions to semilinear PDEs in cylinders and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show the existence of strictly monotone heteroclinic type solutions of semilinear elliptic equations in cylinders. The motivation of this construction is twofold: first, it implies the existence of an entire bounded solution of a semilinear equation without critical points which is not one-dimensional. Second, this gives an example of a bounded stationary solution for the 2D Euler equations without stagnation points which is not a shear flow, completing previous results of Hamel and Nadirashvili. The proof uses a minimization technique together with a truncation argument, and a limit procedure.</description>

      <title>Unexpected phenomena in a one dimensional elliptic equation with a singular first order divergence term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study existence of a weak solution for one-dimensional problems as \begin{equation}\label{intro}\tag{1} \begin{cases} \displaystyle -\frac{d}{dx}\left(a(x) \frac{d u}{dx}\right) = - \frac{d \phi (u) }{dx}- \frac{d g(x) }{dx}&amp; \text{in}\;(0,L),\\
  u(0)=u(L)=0\,, &amp; \end{cases} \end{equation} where $a$ is a positive bounded function, $g\in L^2(0,L)$, and $\phi:\mathbb{R}\mapsto \mathbb{R}\cup \{+\infty\}$ is continuous as a function with values in $\mathbb{R}\cup \{+\infty\}$. Some relevant qualitative and quantitative facts concerning such problems and their solutions are described. In particular a precise characterization of the behaviour of suitable approximating solution is provided. Of particular (and independent) interest is the study of an associated ODE for which, we prove existence, uniqueness and comparison results. As a consequence of our arguments, a delicate stability result as well a quite unexpected multiplicity result is shown for problems as in \eqref{intro}.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes for the Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a rigorous definition of quasinormal modes for the Kerr black hole. They are obtained as the discrete set of poles of the meromorphically continued cutoff resolvent. The construction combines the method of complex scaling near asymptotically flat infinity with microlocal methods near the black hole horizon. We study the distribution of quasinormal modes in both the high and low energy regimes. We establish the existence of a high energy spectral gap and exclude the accumulation of quasinormal modes at zero energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend several results established for stable minimal hypersurfaces to $\delta$-stable minimal hypersurfaces. These include the regularity and compactness theorems for immersed $\delta$-stable minimal hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ when $n \geq 3$ and $\delta &gt; \frac{n-2}{n}$, as well as the $\delta$-stable Bernstein theorem for $n=3$ and $n=4$ for properly immersion. The range of $\delta$ is optimal, as the $n$-dimensional catenoid in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is $\frac{n-2}{n}$-stable.</description>

      <title>A High-Order Perturbation of Envelopes (HOPE) Method for Vector Electromagnetic Scattering by Periodic Inhomogeneous Media: Analytic Continuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic waves interacting with three--dimensional periodic structures occur in many applications of great scientific and engineering interest. These three dimensional interactions are extremely complicated and subtle, so it is unsurprising that practitioners find their rapid, robust, and accurate numerical simulation to be of paramount interest. Among the wide array of possible numerical approaches, the High--Order Spectral algorithms are often preferred due to their surpassing fidelity with a moderate number of unknowns, and here we describe an algorithm that fits into this class. In addition, we take a perturbative approach to the problem which views the deviation of the permittivity from a reference value as the deformation and we conduct a regular perturbation theory. This work concludes a line of research on these methods which began with two-dimensional problems governed by the Helmholtz equation and moved to small perturbations in the fully three-dimensional vector Maxwell equations. We now extend these latter results to large (real) perturbations constituting a rigorous analytic continuation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homogenisation empowers the efficient macroscale system level prediction of physical problems with intricate microscale structures. Here we develop an innovative powerful, rigorous and flexible framework for asymptotic homogenisation of dynamics at the finite scale separation of real physics, with proven results underpinned by modern dynamical systems theory. The novel systematic approach removes most of the usual assumptions, whether implicit or explicit, of other methodologies. By no longer assuming averages the methodology constructs so-called multi-continuum or micromorphic homogenisations systematically based upon the microscale physics. The developed framework and approach enables a user to straightforwardly choose and create such homogenisations with clear physical and theoretical support, and of highly controllable accuracy and fidelity.</description>

      <title>Geometric and Analytic Aspects of Simon-Lojasiewicz Inequalities on Vector Bundles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In real analysis, the Lojasiewicz inequalities, revitalized by Leon Simon in his pioneering work on singularities of energy minimizing maps, have proven to be monumental in differential geometry, geometric measure theory, and variational problems. These inequalities provide specific growth and stability conditions for prescribed real-analytic functions, and have found applications to gradient flows, gradient systems, and as explicated in this paper, vector bundles over compact Riemannian manifolds. In this work, we outline the theory of functionals and variational problems over vector bundles, explore applications to arbitrary real-analytic functionals, and describe the energy functional on $S^{n-1}$ as a functional over a vector bundle.</description>

Abstract: We deform the heat kernel and the Brownian motion on $\mathbb{R}^{N}$ from the perspective of "$(k,a)$-generalized Fourier analysis" with $k=0$. This is a new type of harmonic analysis proposed by S.Ben Sa\"id--T.Kobayashi--B.{\O}rsted from the representation theoretic viewpoint. In this paper, we construct the $a$-deformed heat kernel and $a$-deformed Brownian motion, and explore their some basic properties. We also prove that the $(k,a)$-generalized Fourier integral kernels are polynomial growth when $k=0$, for a justification of some discussions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish an approach to trace inequalities for potential-type operators based on an appropriate modification of an interpolation theorem due to Calder\'on. We develop a general theoretical tool for establishing boundedness of notoriously difficult operators (such as potentials) on certain specific types of rearrangement-invariant function spaces from analogous properties of operators that are easier to handle (such as fractional maximal operators). The key ingredient for the development of the theory is the initial pair of endpoint estimates for the easier operator whose pivotal example is based on a two-weight inequality of Sawyer. Among various applications we obtain a generalization of the celebrated trace inequality involving the Riesz potential and the Hausdorff content by Korobkov and Kristensen.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes on Kerr spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a rigorous framework for defining quasinormal modes on stationary, asymptotically flat spacetimes as isolated eigenvalues of the infinitesimal generator of time translations. We consider time functions corresponding to a foliation of asymptotically hyperboloidal hypersurfaces and restrict to suitable Hilbert spaces of functions. These functions have finite Sobolev regularity in bounded regions, but need to be Gevrey-regular at null infinity. This framework is developed in the context of sub-extremal Kerr spacetimes, but also gives uniform-in-$\Lambda$ resolvent estimates on Kerr--de Sitter spacetimes with a small cosmological constant $\Lambda$. As a corollary, we also construct the meromorphic continuation (in a sector of the complex plane) of the cut-off resolvent in Kerr that is associated to the standard Boyer--Lindquist time function. The framework introduced in this paper bridges different notions of quasinormal modes found in the literature. As further applications of our methods, we prove stability of quasinormal frequencies in a sector of the complex plane, with respect to suitably small perturbations and establish convergence properties for Kerr--de Sitter quasinormal frequencies when the cosmological constant approaches zero.</description>

      <title>Poisson stability of solutions for stochastic evolution equations driven by fractional Brownian motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of Poisson stability of solutions for stochastic semi-linear evolution equation driven by fractional Brownian motion $$\mathrm{d} X(t)= \left( AX(t) + f(t,X(t)) \right) \mathrm{d}t + g\left(t,X(t)\right)\mathrm{d}B^H_{Q}(t),$$ where $A$ is an exponentially stable linear operator acting on a separable Hilbert space $\mathbb{H}$, coefficients $f$ and $g$ are Poisson stable in time, and $B^H_Q (t)$ is a $Q$-cylindrical fBm with Hurst index $H$. First, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the solution for this equation. Then, we prove that under the condition where the functions $f$ and $g$ are sufficiently "small", the equation admits a solution that exhibits the same character of recurrence as $f$ and $g$. The discussion is further extended to the asymptotic stability of these Poisson stable solutions. Finally, we include an example to validate our results.</description>

      <title>Theoretical analysis of a finite-volume scheme for a stochastic Allen-Cahn problem with constraint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this contribution is to address the convergence study of a time and space approximation scheme for an Allen-Cahn problem with constraint and perturbed by a multiplicative noise of It\^o type. The problem is set in a bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^d$ (with $d=2$ or $3$) and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions are considered. The employed strategy consists in building a numerical scheme on a regularized version \`a la Moreau-Yosida of the constrained problem, and passing to the limit simultaneously with respect to the regularization parameter and the time and space steps, denoted respectively by $\epsilon$, $\Delta t$ and $h$. Combining a semi-implicit Euler-Maruyama time discretization with a Two-Point Flux Approximation (TPFA) scheme for the spatial variable, one is able to prove, under the assumption $\Delta t=\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{2+\theta})$ for a positive $\theta$, the convergence of such a $(\epsilon, \Delta t, h)$ scheme towards the unique weak solution of the initial problem, \textit{ a priori} strongly in $L^2(\Omega;L^2(0,T;L^2(\Lambda)))$ and \textit{a posteriori} also strongly in $L^{p}(0,T; L^2(\Omega\times \Lambda))$ for any finite $p\geq 1$.</description>

      <title>Strongly consistent low-dissipation WENO schemes for finite elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a way to maintain strong consistency and facilitate error analysis in the context of dissipation-based WENO stabilization for continuous and discontinuous Galerkin discretizations of conservation laws. Following Kuzmin and Vedral (J. Comput. Phys. 487:112153, 2023) and Vedral (arXiv preprint arXiv:2309.12019), we use WENO shock detectors to determine appropriate amounts of low-order artificial viscosity. In contrast to existing WENO methods, our approach blends candidate polynomials using residual-based nonlinear weights. The shock-capturing terms of our stabilized Galerkin methods vanish if residuals do. This enables us to achieve improved accuracy compared to weakly consistent alternatives. As we show in the context of steady convection-diffusion-reaction (CDR) equations, nonlinear local projection stabilization terms can be included in a way that preserves the coercivity of local bilinear forms. For the corresponding Galerkin-WENO discretization of a CDR problem, we rigorously derive a priori error estimates. Additionally, we demonstrate the stability and accuracy of the proposed method through one- and two-dimensional numerical experiments for hyperbolic conservation laws and systems thereof. The numerical results for representative test problems are superior to those obtained with traditional WENO schemes, particularly in scenarios involving shocks and steep gradients.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the growth of high Sobolev norms of solutions to Nonlinear Schrodinger Equations on $S^1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:1003.5705v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Nonlinear Schrodinger type equations on $S^1$. In this paper, we obtain polynomial bounds on the growth in time of high Sobolev norms of their solutions. The key is to derive an iteration bound based on a frequency decomposition of the solution. This iteration bound is different than the one used earlier in the work of Bourgain, and is less dependent on the structure of the nonlinearity. We first look at the defocusing NLS equation with nonlinearity of degree $\geq 5$. For the quintic NLS, Bourgain derives stronger bounds using different techniques. However, our approach works for higher nonlinearities, where the techniques of Bourgain don't seem to apply. Furthermore, we study variants of the defocusing cubic NLS in which the complete integrability is broken. Among this class of equations, we consider in particular the Hartree Equation, with sufficiently regular convolution potential. For most of the equations that come from modifying the defocusing cubic NLS, we obtain better bounds than for the other equations due to the fact that we can use higher modified energies as in the work of the I-Team.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the growth of high Sobolev norms of solutions to Nonlinear Schrodinger Equations on $\mathbb{R}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:1003.5707v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the cubic nonlinear Schrodinger equation, and the Hartree equation, with sufficiently regular convolution potential, both on the real line. We are interested in bounding the growth of high Sobolev norms of solutions to these equations. Since the cubic NLS is completely integrable, it makes sense to bound only the fractional Sobolev norms of solutions, whose initial data is of restricted smoothness. For the Hartree equation, we consider all Sobolev norms. For both equations, we derive our results by using an appropriate frequency decomposition. In the case of the cubic NLS, this method allows us to recover uniform bounds on the integral Sobolev norms, up to a factor of $t^{0+}$. For the Hartree equation, we use the same method as in our previous work on $S^1$, and the improved Strichartz estimate to obtain a better bound than we previously obtained in the periodic setting.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, the Cauchy problem for a Friedrichs system on a globally hyperbolic manifold with a timelike boundary is investigated. By imposing admissible boundary conditions, the existence and the uniqueness of strong solutions are shown. Furthermore, if the Friedrichs system is hyperbolic, the Cauchy problem is proved to be well-posed in the sense of Hadamard. Finally, examples of Friedrichs systems with admissible boundary conditions are provided.</description>

Abstract: We study the Rayleigh-Taylor instability for two miscible, incompressible, inviscid fluids. Scale-invariant estimates for the size of the mixing zone and coarsening of internal structures in the fully nonlinear regime are established following techniques introduced for the Saffman-Taylor instability in [OttoMenon, 2004]. These bounds provide optimal scaling laws and reveal the strong role of dissipation in slowing down mixing.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we provide well-posedness results for nonlinear parabolic PDEs given by reaction-diffusion equations describing the concentration of oxygen in encapsulated cells. The cells are described in terms of a core and a shell, which introduces a discontinuous diffusion coefficient as the material properties of the core and shell differ. In addition, the cells are subject to general nonlinear consumption of oxygen. As no monotonicity condition is imposed on the consumption monotone operator theory cannot be used. Moreover, the discontinuity in the diffusion coefficient bars us to apply classical results. However, by directly applying a Galerkin method we obtain uniqueness and existence of the strong form solution. These results will provide the basis to study the dynamics of cells in critical states.</description>

      <title>Optimal boundary regularity and a Hopf-type lemma for Dirichlet problems involving the logarithmic Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the optimal boundary regularity of solutions to Dirichlet problems involving the logarithmic Laplacian. Our proofs are based on the construction of suitable barriers via the Kelvin transform and direct computations. As applications of our results, we show a Hopf-type Lemma for nonnegative weak solutions and the uniqueness of solutions to some nonlinear problems.</description>

      <title>Boundary layer expansions of the steady MHD equations in a bounded domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09726v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the validity of boundary layer expansions for the MHD system in a rectangle. We describe the solution up to any order when the tangential magnetic field is much smaller or much larger than the tangential velocity field, thereby extending a previous work of S.J. Ding, Z.L. Lin and F. Xie.</description>

      <title>On the stochastic selection of integral curves of a rough vector field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02364v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for bounded, divergence-free vector fields b in L^1_{loc}((0,1];BV(\T^d;\R^d)), there exists a unique incompressible measure on integral curves of b. We recall the vector field constructed by Depauw in [Depauw, C. R. Math. Acad. Sci. Paris, 2003], which lies in the above class, and prove that for this vector field, the unique incompressible measure on integral curves exhibits stochasticity.</description>

      <title>Existence of solutions for a semilinear parabolic system with singular initial data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(u,v)$ be a solution to the Cauchy problem for a semilinear parabolic system \[ \mathrm{(P)} \qquad \cases{ \partial_t u=D_1\Delta u+v^p\quad &amp; $\quad\mbox{in}\quad{\mathbb{R}}^N\times(0,T),$\\ \partial_t v=D_2\Delta v+u^q\quad &amp; $\quad\mbox{in}\quad{\mathbb{R}}^N\times(0,T),$\\ (u(\cdot,0),v(\cdot,0))=(\mu,\nu) &amp; $\quad\mbox{in}\quad{\mathbb{R}}^N,$ } \] where $N\ge 1$, $T&gt;0$, $D_1&gt;0$, $D_2&gt;0$, $0&lt;p\le q$ with $pq&gt;1$, and $(\mu,\nu)$ is a pair of nonnegative Radon measures or locally integrable nonnegative functions in ${\mathbb R}^N$. In this paper we establish sharp sufficient conditions on the initial data for the existence of solutions to problem~(P) using uniformly local Morrey spaces and uniformly local weak Zygmund type spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1901.03207v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the strong unique continuation property for many-body Pauli operators with external potentials, interaction potentials and magnetic fields in $L^p\loc(\R^d)$, and with magnetic potentials in ${L^{q}\loc(\R^d)}$, where ${p &gt; \max(2d/3,2)}$ and ${q &gt; 2d}$. For this purpose, we prove a singular Carleman estimate involving fractional Laplacian operators.</description>

      <title>On the Viability and Invariance of Proper Sets under Continuity Inclusions in Wasserstein Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11945v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we derive conditions for the existence of solutions to state-constrained continuity inclusions in Wasserstein spaces whose right-hand sides may be discontinuous in time. These latter are based on a fine investigation of the infinitesimal behaviour of the underlying reachable sets, through which we show that up to a negligible set of times, every admissible velocity of a continuity inclusion can be approximately realised as the metric derivative of a solution of the dynamics, and vice versa. Building on these results, we are able to establish necessary and sufficient geometric conditions for the viability and invariance of stationary and time-dependent constraint sets which involve a suitable notion of contingent cones in Wasserstein spaces, and presented in ascending order of generality. We then close the article by exhibiting two prototypical examples of constraints sets appearing in applications for which one can compute relevant subfamilies of contingent directions.</description>

      <title>Lie reductions and exact solutions of dispersionless Nizhnik equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exhaustively classify the Lie reductions of the real dispersionless Nizhnik equation to partial differential equations in two independent variables and to ordinary differential equations. Lie and point symmetries of reduced equations are comprehensively studied, including the analysis of which of them correspond to hidden symmetries of the original equation. If necessary, associated Lie reductions of a nonlinear Lax representation of the dispersionless Nizhnik equation are carried out as well. As a result, we construct wide families of new invariant solutions of this equation in explicit form in terms of elementary, Lambert and hypergeometric functions as well as in parametric or implicit form. We show that Lie reductions to algebraic equations lead to no new solutions of this equation in addition to the constructed ones. Multiplicative separation of variables is used for illustrative construction of non-invariant solutions.</description>

      <title>Error analysis for a viscoelastic phase separation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider systematic numerical approximation of a viscoelastic phase separation model that describes the demixing of a polymer solvent mixture. An unconditionally stable discretisation method is proposed based on a finite element approximation in space and a variational time discretization strategy. The proposed method preserves the energy-dissipation structure of the underlying system exactly and allows to establish a fully discrete nonlinear stability estimate in natural norms based on the concept of relative energy. These estimates are used to derive order optimal error estimates for the method under minimal smoothness assumptions on the problem data, despite the presence of various strong nonlinearities in the equations. The theoretical results and main properties of the method are illustrated by numerical simulations which also demonstrate the capability to reproduce the relevant physical effects observed in experiments.</description>
