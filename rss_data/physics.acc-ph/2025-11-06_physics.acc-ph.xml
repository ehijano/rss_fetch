      <title>Wide frequency-range acceleration using second harmonic RF bucket in fixed field accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel acceleration scheme for fixed-field accelerators (FFAs), in which RF buckets with harmonic numbers $h = 1$ and $h = 2$ are time-sequenced to form a single, continuous acceleration path. This approach completes acceleration in two RF frequency sweeps, thereby reducing the total frequency sweep range and shortening the repetition period. The feasibility of this method is demonstrated through longitudinal simulations based on parameters of the FFA at the Institute for Integrated Radiation and Nuclear Science, Kyoto University (KURNS). We also establish operational conditions under which the second harmonic RF bucket remains stable and practically usable.</description>

      <title>Beam Cleaning and Collimation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collimation systems in particle accelerators are designed to safely and efficiently dispose of unavoidable beam losses during operation. Their specific roles vary depending on the type of accelerator. The state of the art in hadron beam collimation for high-intensity, high-energy superconducting colliders is exemplified by the system implemented at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In this machine, the stored beam energy reaches levels several orders of magnitude higher than the tiny energy required to quench superconducting magnets. It also exceeds by orders of magnitude the damage thresholds of typical accelerator components, placing stringent demands on beam loss control. Collimation systems are therefore essential for the reliable daily operation of modern accelerators. This lecture reviews the design of a multistage collimation system, using the LHC as a case study. The LHC collimation system has achieved unprecedented cleaning performance, with a level of complexity unmatched by any other accelerator. Design aspects and operational challenges of such large-scale collimation systems are also discussed.</description>

      <title>CEPC Project Status</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we give a brief historical review of particle physics achievement through e+e- colliders and proton accelerators in the last half century and perspective for the next half century with worldwide consensus. The Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) is a Higgs factory proposed by Chinese scientists in 2012, and its Technical Design Report (TDR) has been completed in Dec. 2023. Since 2024 CEPC has entered into Engineering Design Report (EDR) phase (2024-2027) and CEPC detector reference design report (Ref-TDR) has been released in Oct. 2025. CEPC plans to apply for the starting the construction in the 16th five year plan (2030-2035).</description>
