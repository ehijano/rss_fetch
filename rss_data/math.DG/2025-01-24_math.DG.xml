      <title>Hard Lefschetz Condition on symplectic non-K\"ahler solvmanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide new families of compact complex manifolds with no K\"ahler structure carrying symplectic structures satisfying the \textit{Hard Lefschetz Condition}. These examples are obtained as compact quotients of the solvable Lie group $\mathbb{C}^{2n} \ltimes_{\rho} \mathbb{C}^{2m}$, for which we construct explicit lattices. By cohomological computations we prove that such manifolds carry symplectic structures satisfying the \textit{Hard Lefschetz Condition}. Furthermore, we compute the Kodaira dimension of an almost-K\"ahler structure and generators for the de Rham and Dolbeault cohomologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we prove mass-capacity inequalities for asymptotically flat manifolds whose boundary capacity potential satisfies an overdetermined problem, referred to as critical area-normalized capacitors. As a consequence, we obtain uniqueness results for the Schwarzschild metric, from which improvements in the uniqueness theorems for spin asymptotically flat spacetimes containing a connected photon surface, as well as for spin asymptotically flat static manifolds with boundary are obtained.</description>

      <title>Discrete curve theory in space forms: planar elastic and area-constrained elastic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a notion of discrete elastic and area-constrained elastic curves in 2-dimensional space forms. Our definition extends the well-known discrete Euclidean curvature equation to space forms and reflects various geometric properties known from their smooth counterparts. Special emphasis is paid to discrete flows built from B\"acklund transformations in the respective space forms. The invariants of the flows form a hierarchy of curves and we show that discrete elastic and constrained elastic curves can be characterized as elements of this hierarchy. This work also includes an introductory chapter on discrete curve theory in space forms, where we find discrete Frenet-type formulas and describe an associated family related to a fundamental theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider Einstein-type manifolds with boundary which generalizes important geometric equations, like static vacuum and static perfect fluid. We investigate some geometric inequalities for those manifolds. Then, we established boundary estimates in terms of the first eigenvalue of the Jacobi operator and another one related to the Brown-York mass.</description>

      <title>The Strong Cosmic Censorship Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the wake of major breakthroughs in General Relativity during the 1960s, Roger Penrose introduced Strong Cosmic Censorship, a profound conjecture regarding the deterministic nature of the theory. Penrose's proposal has since opened far-reaching new mathematical avenues, revealing connections to fundamental questions about black holes and the nature of gravitational singularities. We review recent advances arising from modern techniques in the theory of partial differential equations as applied to Strong Cosmic Censorship, maintaining a focus on the context of gravitational collapse that gave birth to the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Model category structures on truncated multicomplexes for complex geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To a bicomplex one can associate two natural filtrations, the column and row filtrations, and then two associated spectral sequences. This can be generalized to $N$-multicomplexes. We present a family of model category structures on the category of $N$-multicomplexes where the weak equivalences are the morphisms inducing a quasi-isomorphism at a fixed page $r$ of the first spectral sequence and at a fixed page $s$ of the second spectral sequence. Such weak equivalences arise naturally in complex geometry. In particular, the model structures presented here establish a basis for studying homotopy types of almost and generalized complex manifolds.</description>

      <title>Jiggling: an h-principle without homotopical assumptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The jiggling lemma of Thurston shows that any triangulation can be jiggled (read: subdivided and then perturbed) to be in general position with respect to a distribution. Our main result is a generalization of Thurston's lemma. It states that piecewise smooth solutions of a given open and fiberwise dense differential relation $\mathcal{R} \subset J^1(E)$ of first order can be constructed by jiggling arbitrary sections of $E$. Our statement also holds in parametric and relative form. We understand this as an h-principle without homotopical assumptions for piecewise smooth solutions of $\mathcal{R}$.</description>

      <title>Systolic $S^1$-index and characterization of non-smooth Zoll convex bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define the systolic $S^1$-index of a convex body as the Fadell-Rabinowitz index of the space of centralized generalized systoles associated with its boundary. We show that this index is a symplectic invariant. Using the systolic $S^1$-index, we propose a definition of generalized Zoll convex bodies and prove that this definition is equivalent to the usual one in the smooth setting. Moreover, we show how the generalized Zoll convex bodies can be characterized in the term of their Gutt-Hutchings capacities. Additionally, we show that the space of generalized Zoll convex bodies is closed in the space of all convex bodies. As a corollary, we establish that if the interior of a convex body is symplectomorphic to the interior of a ball, then such a convex body must be generalized Zoll, and in particular Zoll if the boundary of that convex body is smooth. We also discuss some examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we show that the support of a locally $k$-uniform measure in $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ satisfies a kind of unique continuation property. As a consequence, we show that locally uniformly distributed measures satisfy a weaker unique continuation property. This continues work of Kirchheim and Preiss (Math. Scand. 2002) and David, Kenig and Toro (Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 2001) and lends additional evidence to the conjecture proposed by Kowalski and Preiss (J. Reine Angew. Math. 1987) that the support of a locally $n$-uniform measure in $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ is contained in the zero set of a quadratic polynomial.</description>

Abstract: We prove a canonical variation-type result for submersion metrics with positive intermediate Ricci curvatures. This can then be used in conjunction with surgery techniques to establish the existence of metrics with positive intermediate Ricci curvatures on a wide range of examples which had previously only been known to admit positive Ricci curvature, such as highly connected manifolds and exotic spheres. Further, we extend results of the second author on the moduli space of metrics with positive Ricci curvature to positive intermediate Ricci curvatures.</description>

      <title>A Gauss-Bonnet formula for the renormalized area of minimal submanifolds of Poincar\'e-Einstein manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assuming the extrinsic $Q$-curvature admits a decomposition into the Pfaffian, a scalar conformal submanifold invariant, and a tangential divergence, we prove that the renormalized area of an even-dimensional minimal submanifold of a Poincar\'e-Einstein manifold can be expressed as a linear combination of its Euler characteristic and the integral of a scalar conformal submanifold invariant. We derive such a decomposition of the extrinsic $Q$-curvature in dimensions two and four, thereby recovering and generalizing results of Alexakis-Mazzeo and Tyrrell, respectively. We also conjecture such a decomposition for general natural submanifold scalars whose integral over compact submanifolds is conformally invariant, and verify our conjecture in dimensions two and four. Our results also apply to the area of a compact even-dimensional minimal submanifold of an Einstein manifold.</description>

      <title>Volume preserving spacetime mean curvature flow in initial data sets and applications to General Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a volume preserving curvature evolution of surfaces in an asymptotically Euclidean initial data set with positive ADM-energy. The speed is given by a nonlinear function of the mean curvature which generalizes the spacetime mean curvature recently considered by Cederbaum-Sakovich (Calc. Var. PDE, 2021). Following a classical approach by Huisken-Yau (Invent. Math. 1996), we show that the flow starting from suitably round initial surfaces exists for all times and converges to a constant (spacetime) curvature limit. This provides an alternative construction of the CSTMC foliation by Cederbaum-Sakovich and has applications in the definition of center of mass of an isolated system in General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Kasner-like description of spacelike singularities in spherically symmetric spacetimes with scalar matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of spacelike singularities in spherically symmetric spacetimes obeying the Einstein equations, in the presence of matter. We consider in particular matter described by a scalar field, both in the presence of an electromagnetic field and without. We prove that if a spacelike singularity obeying several reasonable assumptions is formed, then the Hawking mass, the Kretschmann scalar, and the matter fields have inverse polynomial blow-up rates near the singularity that may be described precisely.
  Furthermore, one may view the resulting spacetime in the context of the BKL heuristics regarding space-like singularities in relativistic cosmology. In particular, near any point $p$ on the singular boundary in our spherically symmetric spacetime, we obtain a leading order BKL-type expansion, including a description of Kasner exponents associated to $p$.
  This provides a rigorous description of a detailed correspondence between Kasner-like singularities most often associated to the cosmological setting, and the singularities observed in (spherically symmetric) gravitational collapse. Moreover, we outline a program concerning the study of the stability and instability of spacelike singularities in the latter picture, both outside of spherical symmetry and within (where the electromagnetic field acts as a proxy for angular momentum).</description>

      <title>Unital $C_\infty$-algebras and the real homotopy type of $(r-1)$-connected compact manifolds of dimension $\le \ell(r-1)+2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19506v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We encode the real homotopy type of an $n$-dimensional $(r-1)$-connected compact manifold $M$, $ r\ge 2$ into a minimal unital $C_\infty$-structure on $H^* (M,\mathbb R)$, obtained via homotopy transfer of the unital DGCA structure of the small quotient algebra associated with a Hodge decomposition of the de Rham algebra $\mathcal A^*(M)$, which has been proposed by Fiorenza-Kawai-L\^e-Schwachh\"ofer in [Ann. Sc. Norm. Super Pisa (5), vol. XXII (2021), 79-107]. We prove that if $n \le \ell (r-1) +2$, with $\ell \geq 4$, the multiplication $\mu_k$ on the minimal unital $C_\infty$-algebra $H^*(M,\mathbb R)$ vanishes for all $k \ge \ell-1$. This extends the results from [loc. cit.], extending the bound on the dimension from $5r-3$ to the general bound $\ell(r-1) +2$. We also prove a variant of this result, conjectured by Zhou, stating that if $n \le \ell(r-1)+4$ and $b_r (M) =1$ then the multiplication $\mu_k$ for all $k \ge \ell-1$ vanishes. This implies two formality results by Cavalcanti [Math. Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 141 (2006), 101-112]. We show that in any dimension $n$ the Harrison cohomology class $[\mu_3]\in \mathrm {HHarr}^{3,-1}(H^* (M, \mathbb R), H^*(M, \mathbb R)) $ is a homotopy invariant of $M$ and the first obstruction to formality, and provide a detailed proof that if $n\leq 4r-1$ this is the only obstruction. Furthermore, we show that in any dimension $n$ the class $[\mu_3]$ and the Bianchi-Massey tensor invented by Crowley-Nordstr\"om in [J. Topol. 13(2020), 539-575] define each other uniquely.</description>

      <title>Two optimization problems for the Loewner energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Jordan curve on the Riemann sphere can be encoded by its conformal welding, a circle homeomorphism. The Loewner energy measures how far a Jordan curve is away from being a circle, or equivalently, how far its welding homeomorphism is away from being a M\"obius transformation. We consider two optimizing problems for the Loewner energy, one under the constraint for the curves to pass through $n$ given points on the Riemann sphere, which is the conformal boundary of hyperbolic $3$-space $\mathbb H^3$; the other under the constraint for $n$ given points on the circle to be welded to another $n$ given points of the circle. The latter problem can be viewed as optimizing positive curves on the boundary of AdS$^3$ space passing through $n$ prescribed points. We observe that the answers to the two problems exhibit interesting symmetries: optimizing the Jordan curve in $\partial_\infty \mathbb H^3$ gives rise to a welding homeomorphism that is the boundary of a pleated plane in AdS$^3$, whereas optimizing the positive curve in $\partial_\infty\!\operatorname{AdS}^3$ gives rise to a Jordan curve that is the boundary of a pleated plane in $\mathbb H^3$.</description>

Abstract: In this note we prove the Riemannian analog of black hole mode stability for Hermitian, non-self-dual gravitational instantons which are either asymptotically locally flat (ALF) and Ricci-flat, or compact and Einstein with positive cosmological constant. We show that the Teukolsky equation on any such manifold is a positive definite operator. We also discuss the compatibility of the results with the existence of negative modes associated to variational instabilities.</description>
