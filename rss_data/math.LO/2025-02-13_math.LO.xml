      <title>The infinitesimal subgroup of interpretable groups in some dp-minimal valued fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue our local analysis of groups interpretable in various dp-minimal valued fields, as introduced in [8]. We associate with every infinite group $G$ interpretable in those fields an infinite type-definable infinitesimal subgroup $\nu(G)$, generated by the four infinitesimal subgroups $\nu_D(G)$ associated with the distinguished sorts $K$, $\textbf{k}$, $\Gamma$ and $K/\mathcal{O}$.
  To show that $\nu(G)$ is type-definable, we show that the resulting subgroups $\nu_D(G)$ commute with each other as $D$ ranges over the four distinguished sorts. We then study the basic properties of $\nu(G)$. Among others, we show that $\nu(G_1\times G_2)=\nu(G_1)\times \nu(G_2)$ and that if $G_1\le G$ is a definable subgroup then $\nu(G_1)$ is relatively definable in $\nu(G)$. We also discuss possible connections between $\mathrm{dp\text{-}rk}(\nu(G))$ and elimination of imaginaries.</description>

      <title>The external version of a subclassical logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A three-valued logic L is subclassical when it is defined by a single matrix having the classical two-element matrix as a subreduct. In this case, the language of L can be expanded with special unary connectives, called external operators. The resulting logic L^e is the external version of L, a notion originally introduced by D. Bochvar in 1938 with respect to his weak Kleene logic. In this paper we study the semantic properties of the external version of a three-valued subclassical logic L. We determine sufficient and necessary conditions to turn a model of L into a model of L^e . Moreover, we establish some distinctive semantic properties of L^e.</description>

      <title>Residually Dominated Groups in Henselian Valued Fields of Equicharacteristic Zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce \emph{residually dominated groups} in pure henselian valued fields of equicharacteristic zero as an analogue of stably dominated groups introduced by Hrushovski and Rideau-Kikuchi. We show that when $G$ is a residually dominated group, there is a finite-to-one group homomorphism from its connected component into a connected stably dominated group, and we study the functoriality and universality properties of this map. Moreover, we prove that there is a group homomorphism into a definable group in the residue field that witnesses the residual domination. In our proofs, we use the results of Montenegro, Onshuus, and Simon on groups definable in $\mathrm{NTP}_2$-theories that extend the theory of fields. Along the way, we also provide an algebraic characterization of residually dominated types, generalizing the work by Ealy, Haskell and Simon for stably dominated types in algebraically closed valued fields and study the properties of residually dominated types.</description>

      <title>Temporal Model On Quantum Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a unified theoretical framework for modeling temporal memory dynamics, combining concepts from temporal logic, memory decay models, and hierarchical contexts. The framework formalizes the evolution of propositions over time using linear and branching temporal models, incorporating exponential decay (Ebbinghaus forgetting curve) and reactivation mechanisms via Bayesian updating. The hierarchical organization of memory is represented using directed acyclic graphs to model recall dependencies and interference. Novel insights include feedback dynamics, recursive influences in memory chains, and the integration of entropy-based recall efficiency. This approach provides a foundation for understanding memory processes across cognitive and computational domains.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Digital Circuits: Denotation, Operational, and Algebraic Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis details a project to define a fully compositional theory of synchronous sequential circuits built from primitive components, motivated by applying techniques successfully used in programming languages to hardware.
  The first part of the thesis defines the syntactic foundations of sequential circuit morphisms, and then builds three different semantic theories: denotational, operational and algebraic. We characterise the denotational semantics of sequential circuits as certain causal stream functions, as well as providing a link to existing circuit methodologies by mapping between circuit morphisms, stream functions and Mealy machines. The operational semantics is defined as a strategy for applying some global transformations followed by local reductions to demonstrate how a circuit processes a value, leading to a notion of observational equivalence. The algebraic semantics consists of equations for bringing circuits into a pseudo-normal form, and then encoding between different state sets. This part of the thesis concludes with a discussion of some novel applications, such as those for using partial evaluation for digital circuits.
  While mathematically rigorous, the categorical string diagram formalism is not suited for reasoning computationally. The second part of this thesis details an extension of string diagram rewriting with hypergraphs so that it is compatible with the traced comonoid structure present in the category of digital circuits. We identify the properties that characterise cospans of hypergraphs corresponding to traced comonoid terms, and demonstrate how to identify rewriting contexts valid for rewriting modulo traced comonoid structure. We apply the graph rewriting framework to fixed point operators as well as the operational semantics from the first part, and present a new hardware description language based on these theoretical developments.</description>

      <title>Relative cofinality of ideals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a two-parameter modification of the cofinality invariant of ideals. This allows us to include the interaction of a pair of ideals in the study of base-like structures. We find the values (cardinal numbers or well-known cardinal invariants) of the invariant for pairs of some critical ideals on $\omega$. We also dichotomously divide pairs of known ideals on the real line based on whether their relative cofinality is trivial or uncountable. Finally, we also study the relative cofinality of maximal ideals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study infinite groups interpretable in power bounded $T$-convex, $V$-minimal or $p$-adically closed fields. We show that if $G$ is an interpretable definably semisimple group (i.e., has no definable infinite normal abelian subgroups) then, up to a finite index subgroup, it is definably isogenous to a group $G_1\times G_2$, where $G_1$ is a $K$-linear group and $G_2$ is a $\mathbf{k}$-linear group. The analysis is carried out by studying the interaction of $G$ with four distinguished sorts: the valued field $K$, the residue field $\mathbf{k}$, the value group $\Gamma$, and the closed $0$-balls $K/\mathcal{O}$.</description>

      <title>On the expressive power of inquisitive epistemic logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14573v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inquisitive modal logic, InqML, in its epistemic incarnation, extends standard epistemic logic to capture not just the information that agents have, but also the questions that they are interested in. We use the natural notion of bisimulation equivalence in the setting of InqML, as introduced in [Ciardelli/Otto: JSL 2021], to characterise the expressiveness of InqML as the bisimulation invariant fragment of first-order logic over natural classes of two-sorted first-order structures that arise as relational encodings of inquisitive epistemic (S5-like) models. The non-elementary nature of these classes crucially requires non-classical model-theoretic methods for the analysis of first-order expressiveness, irrespective of whether we aim for characterisations in the sense of classical or of finite model theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by Bartoszy\'nski's work on small sets, we introduce a new ideal defined by interval partitions on natural numbers and summable sequences of positive reals. Similarly, we present another ideal that relies on Bartoszy\'nski's and Shelah's representation of $F_\sigma$ measure zero sets. We show they are $\sigma$-ideals characterizing all small sets and $F_\sigma$ measure zero sets. We also study the cardinal characteristics associated with the introduced ideals. We use them to describe the invariants of measure, discuss their connection to Cicho\'n's diagram, and present related consistency results.</description>

      <title>On the Compatibility of Constructive Predicative Mathematics with Weyl's Classical Predicativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that most constructive and predicative foundations aiming to develop Bishop's constructive analysis are incompatible with a classical predicative development of analysis as Weyl put forward in his $\textit{Das Kontinuum}$. Here, we show how this incompatibility arises from the possibility to define sets by quantifying over (the exponentiation of) functional relations. Such a possibility is present in most constructive foundations but it is not allowed in modern reformulations of Weyl's logical system. In particular, we argue how in Aczel's Constructive Set Theory, Martin-L\"of's type theory and Homotopy Type Theory, the incompatibility with classical predicativity \`a la Weyl reduces to the fact of being able to interpret Heyting arithmetic in all finite types with the addition of the internal rule of number-theoretic unique choice, identifying functional relations over natural numbers with a primitive notion of function defined as $\lambda$-terms of type theory. Then, we argue how a possible way out is offered by constructive foundations, such as the Minimalist Foundation, where exponentiation is limited to functions defined as $\lambda$-terms of (dependent) type theory. The price to pay is to renounce number-theoretic choice principles, including the rule of unique choice, typical of most foundations formalizing Bishop's constructive mathematics. This restriction calls for a point-free constructive development of topology as advocated by P. Martin-L\"of and G. Sambin with the introduction of Formal Topology. We then conclude that the Minimalist Foundation promises to be a natural crossroads between Bishop's constructivism and Weyl's classical predicativity provided that a point-free constructive reformulation of analysis is viable.</description>

      <title>Quasi-treeings are treeable: a streamlined proof</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a streamlined exposition of a construction by R. Chen, A. Poulin, R. Tao, and A. Tserunyan, which proves the treeability of equivalence relations generated by any locally-finite Borel graph such that each component is a quasi-tree. More generally, we show that if each component of a locally-finite Borel graph admits a finitely-separating Borel family of cuts, then we may 'canonically' replace each component of the graph by a tree of special ultrafilter-like objects on cuts called orientations; moreover, if the cuts are dense towards ends, then the union of these trees is a Borel treeing.</description>
