      <title>Introduction of Vacuum Fields to Cavity with Diffraction Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space-based gravitational wave detector DECIGO employs a 1000 km-long Fabry-Perot cavity, which introduces significant diffraction loss. Previous studies accounted or diffraction loss by modeling it as a reduction in laser power for sensitivity calculations. In this research, we take an optical approach by explicitly considering the impact of vacuum fields introduced through diffraction loss, including leakage loss and higher-order mode loss, as well as mirror optical loss. By formulating input-output relations that incorporate these vacuum fields in a realistic cavity with diffraction loss and an optical spring, we achieve a more precise evaluation of DECIGO's optical response. This analysis provides new insights into how diffraction loss affects quantum-locking techniques, offering a refined framework for improving DECIGO's optical design and sensitivity estimation.</description>

      <title>Assessing Suburban Air Quality Constraints on Free Cooling in an Irish City</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperate climates are expected to have an expansion of the number of hours where ventilative cooling is needed and where potential is available even under climate change scenarios. Further to this, the use of free cooling in the form of untreated outdoor air has the potential to be a renewable energy source that adds flexibility to national electricity grids if used appropriately and is critical in decarbonising cooling more generally, particularly where coupled with significant thermal mass in buildings. The following study utilises external air quality measurements from the PASSESPARTOUT project and were collected from unique external air quality systems located in Cork in Ireland. The study characterises this data according to constraints based on control limits for cooling systems and for individual external air quality parameters. While the work aims to demonstrate the barriers to cooling potential that may exist due to poor external air quality, it also offers insights into where good urban air quality supports diurnal ventilative cooling strategies that are best suited given these limitations. The findings show that out of seven outdoor pollutants investigated, NO2 and PM2.5 were consistently above recommended threshold limits in suburban areas and present a barrier to the use of indoor-outdoor direct airflow coupling using natural ventilation strsategies for ventilative cooling purposes. Indoor concentration levels within the surrounding areas to those investigated should be evaluated to develop Indoor-Outdoor ratios for designers for barrier pollutants.</description>

      <title>Copper Damascene Process-Based High-Performance Thin Film Lithium Tantalate Modulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfacing electrical and optical systems is a ubiquitous requirement for modern networks. Competitive footprint, efficiency, and bandwidth figures have propelled interest in deploying integrated electro-optic modulators based on Pockels materials for such tasks. Due to its wide usage in legacy bulk electro-optic modulators, and triggered by the availability of 'on insulator' wafers, lithium niobate based devices have seen major advances. Recently, even more favorable properties have been demonstrated in lithium tantalate based devices, featuring similar Pockels effect, but exhibiting lower bias drift and lower birefringence, while equally benefiting from existing volume usage in wireless RF filters. Despite major progress in integrated modulators, these newly emerged ferro-electrical modulators cannot be integrated tightly with electronics yet using standardized processes, such as flip-chip bonding. Here, we overcome this bottleneck by incorporating the copper Damascene process in the fabrication of integrated lithium tantalate modulators. We demonstrate modulators featuring microwave losses that are ~10% lower than in designs relying on conventional gold electrodes. Our results allow us to reach data transmission figures on par with those of electro-optic modulators fabricated with other low-resistivity, yet less common, metals. Specifically, our fabricated modulators are able to achieve data transmission rates of 416 and 540 Gbit/s while preserving bit error ratios below the 25% SD-FEC threshold in a PAM4 and PAM8 transmission schemes, respectively. Together with the commercial availability of lithium tantalate as a Pockels material, our results open a path towards scalable and direct chip-on-wafer embedding of EO modulators with micro-electronic integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>Theory of Azimuthally Propagating Electromagnetic Waves in Cylindrical Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a detailed study of azimuthally propagating electromagnetic waves in cylindrical metallic cavities with circular cross section. Dispersion characteristics of these waves are determined from Maxwell's equations. Solutions are grouped into branches that account for all known results that are obtained from axial propagation. It is reported that the lowest TE mode starts propagating in the azimuthal direction at a frequency that depends only on the height of the cavity and may be much lower than the cutoff of the TE mode in the axial direction. Universal curves allow the determination of resonant frequencies and field distribution of TE and TM modes in circular cavities containing wedges of arbitrary angles and baffles, with no additional computation. It is shown that the frequency dependence of the propagation constant of a given branch determines all the resonant frequencies of the branch for arbitrary boundary conditions in the azimuthal direction. It is argued that propagation-based models, when applicable, are more accurate than resonance-based models. The lowest TE branch starts at a non-physical resonance. Applications to microwave dual-mode filter design are discussed briefly.</description>

      <title>Phase Retrieval via Gain-Based Photonic XY-Hamiltonian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-retrieval from coded diffraction patterns (CDP) is important to X-ray crystallography, diffraction tomography and astronomical imaging, yet remains a hard, non-convex inverse problem. We show that CDP recovery can be reformulated exactly as the minimisation of a continuous-variable XY Hamiltonian and solved by gain-based photonic networks. The coupled-mode equations we exploit are the natural mean-field dynamics of exciton-polariton condensate lattices, coupled-laser arrays and driven photon Bose-Einstein condensates, while other hardware such as the spatial photonic Ising machine can implement the same update rule through high-speed digital feedback, preserving full optical parallelism. Numerical experiments on images, two- and three-dimensional vortices and unstructured complex data demonstrate that the gain-based solver consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art Relaxed-Reflect-Reflect (RRR) algorithm in the medium-noise regime (signal-to-noise ratios 10--40 dB) and retains this advantage as problem size scales. Because the physical platform performs the continuous optimisation, our approach promises fast, energy-efficient phase retrieval on readily available photonic hardware. uch as two- and three-dimensional vortices, and unstructured random data. Moreover, the solver's accuracy remains high as problem sizes increase, underscoring its scalability.</description>

      <title>Structured Illumination for Surface-Resolved Grazing-Incidence X-ray Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computational imaging technique for imaging thin films at grazing-incidence (GI) angles by incorporating structured illumination into existing GI X-ray scattering setups. This method involves scanning a micro-coded aperture across the incident X-ray beam at a grazing angle, followed by computational reconstruction to extract localized structural and scattering information along the beam footprint on the sample. Unlike conventional GI X-ray scattering methods, which provide only averaged structural data, our approach offers localized scattering information. We detail the underlying principles of this technique and demonstrate its effectiveness through experimental results on an organic semiconductor thin film.</description>

      <title>Conservation of optical chirality in nanoscale light-matter interactions: A study of the Born-Kuhn model system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical chirality density is a measure of the local handedness of electromagnetic fields. Like energy density, it may be absorbed or scattered through the interaction between light and matter. Here, we utilize the conservation of optical chirality to connect the parity and time-reversal symmetries of the intrinsic excitational eigenmodes of a material to those of their associated electromagnetic eigenfields as dictated by Maxwell's equations. To make this connection explicit, we theoretically examine the Born-Kuhn (BK) system, composed of a pair of plasmonic nanorods of variable separation, as a prototypical material model that is both geometrically chiral in its static structure and truly excitationally chiral in its eigenexcitations and eigenfields. By relaying optical chirality metrics of the BK eigenfields back to their underlying sourcing material degrees of freedom, we derive a unique mechanical chirality measure that is related to, but distinct from, other pseudoscalar metrics recently discussed in the literature. Beyond analysis in the absence of sources, we further derive optical chiral extinction, scattering, and absorption cross sections under external drive and discuss their rigorous connection to more common circular dichroism measurements as well as their limitations in comparison to eigenfield chirality metrics. Lastly, we investigate the conversion of achiral linearly polarized light into chiral elliptically polarized light through interaction with the BK system, illustrating the conservation of optical chirality in the interaction between light and matter through an analytically tractable example.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Metasurface Lens for Long-Wavelength Infrared Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectric metasurfaces are structured thin films with thickness smaller than the wavelength that aim at replacing and enhancing conventional bulk optical components by structuring local resonances across an aperture. At visible and near-infrared frequencies, titania or silicon are routinely used as substrates to realize these ultrathin devices, ideally suited for conventional nanofabrication techniques. Unfortunately, directly scaling these design and material approaches to long-wave infrared frequencies is not practical, due to challenges in the required thicknesses and the presence of phonon absorption lines. Nonlocal metasurfaces based on extended resonances with a local geometric phase offer a compelling design platform that can address these challenges. They enable ultrathin metasurfaces, as they leverage lattice resonances, while they also offer multi-functionalities and frequency-selectivity, and they can be implemented in a range of low-loss material platforms. Here, we demonstrate nonlocal metalenses based on germanium thin films on a zinc-selenide substrate, operating around 10.3{\mu}m within a deeply subwavelength device thickness of 1.45{\mu}m (14% the free-space wavelength). We showcase a novel meta-unit geometry based on a square lattice with highly isotropic dispersion features, supporting a resonant geometric phase that is highly stable in frequency, simplifying the rational design of complex metasurface operations. The introduced platform promises highly multi-functional, low-profile meta-optics with enhanced meta-unit designs, compatible with the challenging thermal spectral region for imaging and sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Order within disorder: spectral key generation and distribution in random lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In secure communication, highly random entropy sources are essential for information security. Random lasers (RLs), which arise from multiple scattering in disordered structures, are potentially ideal entropy sources. Traditionally, RLs are viewed as disordered and unpredictable. However, in this work, we present novel evidence that orderly patterns exist beneath the seemingly disordered outputs of RLs. Utilizing deep learning techniques, a variety of advanced neural network models are used to analyze the spectral data in multiple dimensions. The results show that the time series of RLs spectra are unpredictable, but spectral wavelength component intensities can be recovered due to inter-modal correlations. This finding not only breaks through the traditional perception that RLs are unpredictable, but also reveals for the first time that RLs have the dual characteristics of both randomness and determinism. Based on this new characteristic, we further expand the application field of RLs and innovatively design a new type of key generation and distribution scheme. In this scheme, the disordered property of RLs is used for key generation to ensure high randomness, while their ordered property is used for key distribution to guarantee accuracy and reliability. The scheme provides a new strategy for secure communication.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian exceptional physics in RP^2 hyperbolic media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional momentum space provides an orientable base space of a torus for topological classifications based on band theory. Here, we introduce a non-orientable momentum space isomorphic to the real projective plane RP^2 within the low-symmetry media. We show that the local band fluidity can be characterized by an expanded dihedral group with non-Abelian properties, while the global band fluidity offers a versatile platform to explore the evolution of non-Hermitian exceptional manifolds, including order-1, higher-order, hybrid exceptional manifolds, diabolic points and even bound states in the continuum. Furthermore, the non-orientable momentum space can pave the way for exploring the emergence of phenomena for exceptional manifolds.</description>

      <title>Giant and Rapidly Switching Intrinsic Chirality Enabled by Toroidal Quasi-Bound States in the Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circular dichroism (CD), arising from spin-selective light-matter interactions controlled by chirality, is critical for advanced applications such as chiral imaging and ultrasensitive biosensing. However, CD of chiral natural materials is inherently constrained owing to molecular symmetry and thermodynamic stability. Recently, artificially engineered metasurfaces incorporating chiral quasi-bound states in the continuum (Q-BICs) have emerged as a promising solution, which enables near-unity CD responses. However, their current designs heavily rely on complex three-dimensional geometries, posing significant challenges for integration with planar on-chip platforms. To address the stringent challenges, we demonstrate a truly planar metasurface that achieves giant intrinsic chiral responses by utilizing a chiral Q-BIC dominated by out-of-plane toroidal dipoles (Tz). With deep-subwavelength ({\lambda}/20) thickness, our metasurface exhibits outstanding intrinsic CD values in both simulations (&gt;0.90) and experiments (~0.80). Moreover, in contrast to previous electric or magnetic chiral Q-BICs, the toroidal Q-BIC produces a rapidly switching CD response - transitioning sharply between positive and negative giant CD values within ~0.2 GHz, and the switching is highly sensitive to small oblique incidence of opposite angles. Therefore, our scheme provides a planar platform for studying chiral light-matter interactions involving toroidal dipoles, important for future development of polarization- and angle-sensitive photonic and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Reality-infused Deep Learning Framework via Angle-resolved Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces and optical Fourier surfaces (OFSs), featuring patterned nanostructures and profiled diffractive elements, offer versatile platforms for light field manipulation. Compared to tuning structural parameters, adjusting incident light angles provides greater design flexibility. However, angle-resolved light behaviors are often complex due to diverse mode excitations and couplings, posing challenges for simulations and nanofabrication. Here, we present a reality-infused deep learning framework augmented by angle-resolved measuring technology, enabling precise and real-time predictions of angular dispersion characteristics for metasurfaces and OFSs. This approach captures critical fabrication and measurement imperfections typically missed by conventional simulations. We demonstrate a 900-fold acceleration in the design process and accomplish near-perfect prediction consistency to experimental results, with an impressive accuracy up to 99.8%. Our study not only supports valuable insights into the development of meta-devices but also represents a paradigm shift from simulation-driven to reality-infused methods, paving the way for advancements in extensive optical design applications.</description>

      <title>Contact Lens with Moir\'e patterns for High-Precision Eye Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eye tracking is a key technology for human-computer interaction, particularly crucial in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) systems. We propose a novel eye-tracking approach based on incorporating passive eye-tracking modules into contact lenses. These modules comprise two superimposed gratings separated by a narrow gap. The overlapped gratings produce moir\'e pattern, while the spatial separation between them results in parallax effect, namely, pattern transformation upon variations in viewing angle, which enables accurate angular measurements. This method is insensitive to ambient lighting conditions and requires neither scale and color bars nor perspective corrections. Using this approach, we have experimentally measured lens orientation with angular resolution exceeding 0.3{\deg}, which is satisfactory for gaze detection in most AR/VR applications. Furthermore, the proposed technological platform holds a potential for many-fold enhancement in measurement precision.</description>

      <title>Non-destructive sub-surface inspection of multi-layer wind turbine blade coatings by mid-infrared Optical Coherence Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-destructive inspection (NDI) is useful in the industrial sector to ensure that manufacturing follows defined specifications, reducing the quantity of waste and thereby the cost of production. In response to climate change and the need to reduce carbon footprints, there is a growing demand for NDI solutions that are primarily non-contact, as well as non-destructive, fast, and easily integrated. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), a well-known diagnostic technique in medical and biological research, is increasingly being used for industrial NDI. In the mid-infrared (MIR) wavelength range, OCT can be used to characterise parts and defects not possible by other industry-ready scanners, and enables better penetration than conventional near-infrared OCT.
  In this article, we demonstrate NDI of wind turbine blade (WTB) coatings using an MIR OCT scanner employing light around 4 $\mu$m from a supercontinuum source. We inspected the top two layers of the coating (topcoat and primer) in two different samples. The first is to determine the maximum penetration depth, and the second one is to emulate defect identification. The results of our study confirm that MIR OCT scanners are highly suitable for coating inspection and quality control in the production of WTBs, with performance parameters not achievable by other technologies.</description>

      <title>Potentials with partly constant FSR: semiclassical theory and applications to SNAP microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Propagation of whispering gallery modes in Surface Nanoscale Axial Photonics (SNAP) microresonators, fabricated at the optical fiber surface, is commonly described by a one-dimensional wave equation, resembling the Schr\"odinger equation, where the fiber cutoff frequency (CF) varying along the fiber length plays the role of potential and the light frequency plays the role of energy. Of particular importance for applications including frequency comb generation, frequency conversion, and signal processing are SNAP microresonators with constant free spectrum range (FSR). Here we note that, in addition to CF potentials with a globally constant FSR, the potentials having constant FSR confined within a specific spectral region may be sufficient or, in certain cases, preferable for a range of applications. We describe such potentials in semiclassical approximation and analyze their properties considering representative examples.</description>

      <title>Ablation of black-Si by (Gauss-)Bessel femtosecond laser beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser machining and modification of black-Si (b-Si) by femtosecond laser Gaussian (G-) and Gauss-Bessel (GB-) beams are compared at a wavelength of 1030 nm. The GB-beam was generated using a diffractive axicon lens and 10x demagnification optics. It was found that modification of b-Si well below (a factor 50x) the single pulse ablation fluence of 0.2 J/cm2 was possible, corresponding to ablation/melting of nano-needles. The width of modification was almost independent of pulse energy/fluence and had a width of 1/e2-intensity profile at the melting regime. For the GB-beam, the smallest width of laser modification at 0.2 J/cm2 threshold (at the center core) was close to the FWHM of the core of the GB-beam. The aspect ratio of the ablated groove on the surface of b-Si made by GB-beam was twice as large - up to 8 - compared to that achievable with G-beam, and it was at a lower fluence of 4 J/cm2 (50x reduction). Reflectivity of two-side nanotextured b-Si on plasma-thinned 70-micrometers thick Si was strongly reduced in the near-IR range, reaching transmittance &gt;95% at 1.7-2.1 micrometres wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Defect-evolved quadrupole higher-order topological nanolasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological photonics have been garnering widespread interest in engineering the flow of light with topological ideas. Strikingly, the recent introduction of higher-order topological insulators has generalized the fundamental framework of topological photonics, endowing counterintuitive strong confinement of light at lower-dimensional boundaries, thus unlocking exciting prospects for the exploration of topological phenomena in fresh routes as well as the design of topology-driven nanoscale light sources. Here, we revealed the photonic quadrupole topological phases can be activated by defect evolution and performed experimental demonstrations of associated nanoscale lasing operation under this paradigm. The quadrupole higher-order topological nanocavity is constructed by two topologically distinct photonic crystal slabs with opposite directions of defect evolution. Stable single mode emission and low lasing threshold in telecom C-band are achieved at room temperature of the defect-evolved quadrupole topological nanolaser. This work reveals new possibilities for photonic quadrupole topological phase transition, providing an intriguing route toward light confinement and modulation under the topological framework.</description>

      <title>Amplified Feedback and Spontaneous Emission Injection in Quantum Cascade Ring Laser Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ring lasers exhibit rich operational regimes such as unidirectional, bidirectional, or bistable operation. The two-mode dynamics of the counter-propagating modes - clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) and their selection, have gained attention in the mid-infrared; however, the underlying switching mechanism has been largely unexplored. Previously, we experimentally demonstrated robust and deterministic mode selection in a ring quantum cascade laser (QCL) with an active outcoupling waveguide. Here, we apply the Lang-Kobayashi framework to our system to model the effects of spontaneous emission in the waveguide arms as well as amplified optical feedback from the facets on the mechanics of mode switching. We find that coherent feedback from facet reflections agrees upwards of 93\% with the experimental behavior, indicating that amplified feedback is the dominant mechanism driving the mode selection dynamics.</description>

      <title>Photonic Structures to Achieve High-Performance Dew-Harvesting in a 24-h Day-Night Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although most prior research on the dew-harvesting technology has focused on nocturnal operations, achieving round-the-clock freshwater harvesting remains crucial. However, daytime dew-harvesting faces two key challenges as compared to its nighttime counterpart: the high solar irradiance and the large contrast between the ambient temperature and the dewpoint. To address these challenges and guide the photonic design, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze dew-harvesting in a 24-h day-night cycle. Using Nanjing as an example, our analyses reveal that, in the solar regime, a minimum average solar reflectivity of 0.92 is required; in the infrared regime, a 10% reduction in absorptivity outside the 8-13 um transparency window is equivalent to a 5.9% enhancement in emissivity within the window. Guided by these findings, we propose a photonic design, which, in a synthetic experiment with measured meteorological datasets, achieves a water production rate of 313 g/m2-day, in which nearly 40% is contributed by daytime. This performance reaches approximately 70% of the theoretical maximum predicted using the ideal spectrum. We end by optimizing the layout of condensers in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Scheimpflug cameras for range-resolved observations of the atmospheric effects on laser propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the development of Scheimpflug cameras for lidar and remote sensing with an emphasis on active and passive range-finding. Scheimpflug technology uses a tilted camera geometry to natively encode 3D information through projected off-axis pixel view angles and holds the unique potential to serve as an alternative to traditional lidar and remote sensing systems with the demonstrated advantages of high configurability, SWaP-C (Size, Weight and Power-Cost) efficiency and short- vs. far-range optimization. In this work, we demonstrate several compact Scheimpflug-enabled systems as a snapshot atmospheric lidar detector to measure aerosol extinction and optical turbulence effects with high precision over ranges from a few meters to a few kilometer. We compare the instrument's measurements to variance-based Cn2 data collected by a conic anemometer and scintillometer over a 50 m horizontal path. This paper also presents preliminary results on utilizing Scheimpflug technology for photogrammetry, 2D/3D mapping and includes a generalized discussion on the design, alignment and calibration procedures. We believe this work provides a strong basis for the broad use of Scheimpflug technology across multiple use-cases with the fields of lidar and remote sensing.</description>

      <title>A Study on Improvement of Image Quality in Quantum Polarized Microscopy using an Entangled-Photon Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum imaging is an advanced method for microscopy or investigating the optical properties of materials or bio-medical inspections with high accuracy, low noise, and extremely low photo-damage. In previous work, we proposed a quantum imaging technique, in which variations in polarization angle due to reflection or transmission at the sample enhance image contrast in the second-order autocorrelation function at zero delay g2(0). However, the image resolution observed was not satisfactory. In this report, to improve the image quality, the parameters such as coincidence window was optimized to distinguish photon statistics effectively due to change in polarization angle and the objective lens was utilized to focus the entangled photon beams. These modifications enabled optical imaging by accurately detecting slight polarization variations in different media. It is suggested that the proposed method enables a superior imaging performance even in the presence of noise and low-power illumination requirement, offering new possibilities for high-quality imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Resonant pump intensity dependence of luminescence achieved via Floquet engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discover an unexpected behavior in a hybrid system composed of cavity strongly coupled to molecules and subjected to high intensity coherent pumping. We show that if the frequency of the pumping wave is close to polariton transitions in the hybrid system, non monotone dependence of fluorescence and scattering amplitudes on pump intensity with a narrow resonance-like response occurs. We demonstrate that this phenomenon occurs due to hybridization of lower and upper polaritons with substantially different excitation numbers caused by the pumping affecting polariton states of the system. This occurs when the Rabi interaction with coherent field is comparable to the field-matter coupling constant which in turn needs to be sufficient for the manifestation of strong coupling. This non-monotonic dependence of the fluorescence and scattering amplitudes on pump rate intensity pave the way for creation of nonlinear optical devices.</description>

      <title>A versatile setup for symmetry-resolved ultrafast dynamics of quantum materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlated phenomena occur in quantum materials because of the delicate interplay between internal degrees of freedom, leading to multiple symmetry-broken quantum phases. Resolving the structure of these phases is a key challenge, often requiring facilities equipped with x-ray free-electron lasers and electron sources that may not be readily accessible to the average user. Table-top sources that offer alternative means are therefore needed. In this work, we present an all-optical, table-top setup that enables symmetry-resolved studies using linear and nonlinear spectroscopies. We demonstrate the versatility of the setup with chosen examples that underscore the importance of tracking symmetries and showcase the strengths of the setup, which offers a large tunable parameter space.</description>

      <title>Accurate Prediction of Sequential Tensor Properties Using Equivariant Graph Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical spectra serve as a powerful tool for probing the interactions between materials and light, unveiling complex electronic structures such as flat bands and nontrivial topological features. These insights are crucial for the development and optimization of photonic devices, including solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and photodetectors, where understanding the electronic structure directly impacts device performance. Moreover, in anisotropic bulk materials, the optical responses are direction-dependent, and predicting those response tensors still remains computationally demanding due to its inherent complexity and the constraint from crystal symmetry. To address this challenge, we introduce the sequential tensorial properties equivariant neural network (StepENN), a graph neural network architecture that maps crystal structures directly to their full optical tensors across different photon frequencies. By encoding the isotropic sequential scalar components and anisotropic sequential tensor components into l=0 and l=2 spherical tensor components, StepENN ensures symmetry-aware sequential tensor predictions that are consistent with the inherent symmetry constraints of crystal systems. Trained on a dataset of frequency-dependent permittivity tensors for 1,432 bulk semiconductors computed from first-principles methods, our model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 24.216 millifarads per meter (mF/m) on the predicted tensorial spectra with 85.7% of its predictions exhibiting less than 10% relative error, demonstrating its potential for deriving other spectrum-related properties, such as optical conductivity. This framework opens new avenues for the data-driven design of materials with engineered anisotropic optical responses, accelerating material advances in optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Advanced 3D Imaging Approach to TSV/TGV Metrology and Inspection Using Only Optical Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative approach to silicon and glass via inspection, which combines hybrid field microscopy with photometric stereo. Conventional optical microscopy techniques are generally limited to superficial inspections and struggle to effectively visualize the internal structures of silicon and glass vias. By utilizing various lighting conditions for 3D reconstruction, the proposed method surpasses these limitations. By integrating photometric stereo to the traditional optical microscopy, the proposed method not only enhances the capability to detect micro-scale defects but also provides a detailed visualization of depth and edge abnormality, which are typically not visible with conventional optical microscopy inspection. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method effectively captures intricate surface details and internal structures. Quantitative comparisons between the reconstructed models and actual measurements present the capability of the proposed method to significantly improve silicon and glass via inspection process. As a result, the proposed method achieves enhanced cost-effectiveness while maintaining high accuracy and repeatability, suggesting substantial advancements in silicon and glass via inspection techniques</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polaritons are quantum mechanical superpositions of photon states with elementary excitations in molecules and solids. The light-matter admixture causes a characteristic frequency-momentum dispersion shared by all polaritons irrespective of the microscopic nature of material excitations that could entail charge, spin, lattice or orbital effects. Polaritons retain the strong nonlinearities of their matter component and simultaneously inherit ray-like propagation of light. Polaritons prompt new properties, enable new opportunities for spectroscopy/imaging, empower quantum simulations and give rise to new forms of synthetic quantum matter. Here, we review the emergent effects rooted in polaritonic quasiparticles in a wide variety of their physical implementations. We present a broad portfolio of the physical platforms and phenomena of what we term polaritonic quantum matter. We discuss the unifying aspects of polaritons across different platforms and physical implementations and focus on recent developments in: polaritonic imaging, cavity electrodynamics and cavity materials engineering, topology and nonlinearities, as well as quantum polaritonics.</description>

      <title>SmartTrap: Automated Precision Experiments with Optical Tweezers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a trend in research towards more automation using smart systems powered by artificial
  intelligence. While experiments are often challenging to automate, they can greatly benefit from
  automation by reducing labor and increasing reproducibility. For example, optical tweezers are
  widely employed in single-molecule biophysics, cell biomechanics, and soft matter physics, but they
  still require a human operator, resulting in low throughput and limited repeatability. Here, we
  present a smart optical tweezers platform, which we name SmartTrap, capable of performing complex
  experiments completely autonomously. SmartTrap integrates real-time 3D particle tracking using
  deep learning, custom electronics for precise feedback control, and a microfluidic setup for particle
  handling. We demonstrate the ability of SmartTrap to operate continuously, acquiring high-precision
  data over extended periods of time, through a series of experiments. By bridging the gap between
  manual experimentation and autonomous operation, SmartTrap establishes a robust and open source
  framework for the next generation of optical tweezers research, capable of performing large-scale
  studies in single-molecule biophysics, cell mechanics, and colloidal science with reduced experimental
  overhead and operator bias.</description>

      <title>Open quantum systems with particle and bath driven by time-dependent fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a generalized quantum Langevin equation and its fluctuation-dissipation relation describing the quantum dynamics of a tagged particle interacting with a medium (environment), where both the particle and the environment are driven by an external time-dependent (e.g. oscillating) field. We specialize on the case of a charged tagged particle interacting with a bath of charged oscillators, under an external AC electric field, although the results are much more general and can be applied to any type of external time-dependent fields. We derive the corresponding quantum Langevin equation, which obeys a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation where the external field plays an explicit role. Using these results, we provide an illustration of their usefulness and derive a new form of the quantum Nyquist noise for the voltage fluctuations in electrical circuits under AC conditions (finite frequency), which is the most general since it also accounts for the response of the heat bath (e.g. lattice ions) to the applied AC electric field in the GHz-THz region, of relevance for 5G/6G wireless technologies. This generalized quantum fluctuation-dissipation relation for driven systems can also find other applications ranging from quantum noise in quantum optics to quantum computing with trapped ions.</description>

      <title>An analytical exploration of the optomechanical attractor diagram and of limit cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the interplay between mechanical and radiation pressure in an optomechanical cavity system. Our study is based on an analytical evaluation of the infinite Bessel summations involved, which previously had led to a numerical exploration of the so-called attractor diagram. The analytical expressions are then suitable for further asymptotic analysis in opposing regimes of the amplitude, which allows for a characterisation of the diagram in terms of elementary functions. The same method is applied to the study of optomechanical limit cycles, extending previous results for enhanced values of the parameter space without the need for approximations such as the resolved sideband approximation.</description>

      <title>A tutorial on THz pulse analysis: accurate retrieval of pulse arrival times, spectral energy density and absolute spectral phase</title>

Abstract: Electro-optic sampling allows the electric field of THz, mid-infrared and visible light pulses to be measured directly as a function of time, with data analysis often performed in the frequency domain after fast Fourier transform. Here we review aspects of Fourier theory relevant to the frequency-domain analysis of light pulses recorded in the time-domain. We describe a ``best practise'' approach to using the discrete Fourier transform that ensures consistency with analytical results from the continuous Fourier transform. We summarise a phenomenological time-domain model of THz pulses, based on carrier and envelope waves, and show that it can reproduce a wide variety of experimental single- to multi-cycle THz pulses, with exemplary data from lab-based sources (photoconductive antennae, optical rectification, spintronic emitters) and a THz free electron laser. A quantitative comparison of the spectral energy density of these distinct sources is enabled by the amplitude-accuate discrete Fourier transform. We describe a method that ensures the accurate calculation of the absolute spectral phase (valid for arbitrary sampling windows in the time-domain) and summarise how the carrier-envelope phase, pulse arrival time and chirp can be obtained from the phase. Our aim with this overview of THz pulse analysis is to highlight algorithms and concepts that are useful to newcomers to time-domain spectroscopy and experts, alike.</description>

      <title>Tunable coherence laser interferometry: demonstrating 40dB of straylight suppression and compatibility with resonant optical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major limitation of laser interferometers using continuous wave lasers are parasitic light fields, such as ghost beams, scattered or stray light, which can cause non-linear noise. This is especially relevant for laser interferometric ground-based gravitational wave detectors. Increasing their sensitivity, particularly at frequencies below 10 Hz, is threatened by the influence of parasitic photons. These can up-convert low-frequency disturbances into phase and amplitude noise inside the relevant measurement band. By artificially tuning the coherence of the lasers, using pseudo-random-noise (PRN) phase modulations, this influence of parasitic fields can be suppressed. As it relies on these fields traveling different paths, it does not sacrifice the coherence for the intentional interference. We demonstrate the feasibility of this technique experimentally, achieving noise suppression levels of 40 dB in a Michelson interferometer with an artificial coherence length below 30 cm. We probe how the suppression depends on the delay mismatch and length of the PRN sequence. We also prove that optical resonators can be operated in the presence of PRN modulation by measuring the behavior of a linear cavity with and without such a modulation. By matching the resonators round-trip length and the PRN sequence repetition length, the classic response is recovered.</description>

      <title>Scattered light reduction in Sagnac Speed Meters with Tunable Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sagnac Speed Meter and ring resonators can be used as high precision instruments, but they are limited in their sensitivity through scattered light causing non-linear noise. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a technique called Tunable Coherence, where the long coherence length of the laser is broken in a controlled way, to suppress the coupling of scattered light in a Sagnac interferometer. We demonstrate a scattered light suppression of 24.2 dB in a Sagnac interferometer and discuss the experimental limitations. Further, we show an analytical discussion on how Tunable Coherence could be a fundamental solution to light scattering back from optical surfaces into the counter propagating beam, which is an issue particularly in ring resonators.</description>

      <title>Topological protection breakdown: a route to frustrated ferroelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phases manifesting topological patterns in functional systems, like ferroelectric and ferromagnetic vortex superlattices, are typically frustrated non-ergodic states characterized by high-dimensional energy landscapes with intricate and apparently ungovernable behavior. This is also the case for potassium-tantalate-niobate (KTN) crystals. These transparent ferroelectrics manifest remarkable but little-understood metastable domain patterns at optical (micrometer and above) scales near the cubic-to-tetragonal structural phase transition. Here, we formulate the Topological Breakdown Model based on the competition between intrinsic scales of domain-domain collinear and non-collinear interactions associated with polarization-charge screening. The model is able to explain the KTN mesoscopic domain patterns and phase diagram as a function of temperature and external electric field. Findings include a precise set of sharp and broad percolative transitions that are experimentally verified, validating the model. Our study identifies the central role played by competing topologically protected states, identifying the fundamental link between topological protection and frustration that supports a hitherto unexplored functional non-ergodic arena.</description>

      <title>Multipartite continuous-variable quantum nondemolition interaction and entanglement certification and monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement is one of the most studied quantum measurement procedures. Usually, such process involves the coupling of a single system of interest, called signal, with a single probe system, so that the relevant information in the signal system is indirectly measured by observing the probe system. Here, we extend the concept of quantum nondemolition interaction to the cases in which the signal and the probe systems are each one multipartite continuous-variable systems. Specifically, we propose a general scheme that performs the multipartite QND interactions, relying on beam-splitter couplings among the signal and probe modes with ancillary modes prepared off-line in squeezed states. The scheme is also composed by homodyne detections and feedforward modulations. The ancillary modes are detected in the process, providing photocurrents for post-modulation of the output systems, as well as sufficient information to calculate genuine multipartite entanglement conditions of the input systems and to monitor similar conditions of the output systems.</description>
