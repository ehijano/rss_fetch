      <title>An Efficient Algorithm for Determining the Equivalence of Zero-one Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-one reaction networks play a crucial role in cell signaling. Determining the equivalence of reaction networks is a fundamental computational problem in the field of chemical reaction networks. In this work, we develop an efficient method for determining the equivalence of zero-one networks. The efficiency comes from several criteria for determining the equivalence of the steady-state ideals arising from zero-one networks, which helps for cutting down the expenses on computing Grobner bases. Experiments show that our method can successfully classify over three million networks according to their equivalence in a reasonable time.</description>

      <title>Validity of the total quasi-steady-state approximation in stochastic biochemical reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic models for biochemical reaction networks are widely used to explore their complex dynamics but face significant challenges, including difficulties in determining rate constants and high computational costs. To address these issues, model reduction approaches based on deterministic quasi-steady-state approximations (QSSA) have been employed, resulting in propensity functions in the form of deterministic non-elementary reaction functions, such as the Michaelis-Menten equation. In particular, the total QSSA (tQSSA), known for its accuracy in deterministic frameworks, has been perceived as universally valid for stochastic model reduction. However, recent studies have challenged this perception. In this review, we demonstrate that applying tQSSA in stochastic model reduction can distort dynamics, even in cases where the deterministic tQSSA is rigorously valid. This highlights the need for caution when using deterministic QSSA in stochastic model reduction to avoid erroneous conclusions from model simulations.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Controlled Traversing of the Attractor Landscape of Boolean Models in the Context of Cellular Reprogramming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08491v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cellular reprogramming can be used for both the prevention and cure of different diseases. However, the efficiency of discovering reprogramming strategies with classical wet-lab experiments is hindered by lengthy time commitments and high costs. In this study, we develop a novel computational framework based on deep reinforcement learning that facilitates the identification of reprogramming strategies. For this aim, we formulate a control problem in the context of cellular reprogramming for the frameworks of BNs and PBNs under the asynchronous update mode. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of a pseudo-attractor and a procedure for identification of pseudo-attractor state during training. Finally, we devise a computational framework for solving the control problem, which we test on a number of different models.</description>
