      <title>Coset correct means on groups and the probability that two elements commute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amenable groups are those admitting an invariant mean -- a finitely additive probability mean that assigns equal ``weight'' to any two translates of the same set.
  We introduce coset correct means (CCMs), a class of finitely additive means that, for any subgroup, assigns equal weight to all its cosets, weakening and therefore generalising the notion of an invariant mean. We show that, unlike the case for invariant means, every group admits a CCM and give two constructions -- one via the Ultrafilter Lemma and one via the Hahn--Banach Theorem -- both relying on a Theorem of B. H. Neumann. Using CCMs, we define a degree of commutativity for arbitrary groups, measuring the ``probability'' that two random elements of a group commute. We prove that this degree of commutativity is independent of the choice of CCM and is positive precisely for finite-by-abelian-by-finite groups, recovering and unifying previous characterisations.
  We also introduce a defect function that quantifies the failure of left invariance for finitely additive means, and define the defect of a group as the infimum of these. We then prove a dichotomy: the defect for a group is either 0 or 1, with 0 characterising amenable groups.</description>

      <title>Sylow subgroups and the number of irreducible characters of degrees divisible by a prime $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and $p$ a prime. We establish an upper bound for the derived length of a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$ in terms of the number of irreducible characters of $G$ whose degrees are divisible by $p$. We also prove that if $B$ is a $p$-block of a finite $p$-solvable group $G$ with defect group $D$, then the derived length of $D$ is at most one more than the number of ordinary irreducible characters of positive height in $B$.</description>

      <title>The Pseudocentre of a Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1973, Jim Wiegold introduced the concept of pseudocentre P(G) of a group G as the intersection of the normal closures of the centralizers of its elements. He proved that the pseudocentre of a non-trivial finite group is always non-trivial, giving a new variable on which one can use induction in finite group theory. In the same paper, Wiegold states that no obvious relations seem to hold between the pseudocentre and the canonical characteristic subgroups of a group.
  The aim of this work is to show that the pseudocentre is indeed much more involved in the structure of an arbitrary group then anyone could have expected. For example, we prove that a soluble group coincides with its pseudocentre if and only if it is abelian, and that the structure of the commutator subgroup strongly influences the structure of the pseudocentre. And this is not the end of the story. In fact, the behaviour of the pseudocentre in arbitrary (possibly infinite) groups can be extremely wild: sometimes it is very difficult even to understand whether the pseudocentre is trivial or not. This wilderness is exampled by some of our main results (see the introduction for a complete list):
  1) There exists a polycyclic group of Hirsch length 3 in which the pseudocentre is trivial. 2) The pseudocentre of the group of unitriangular matrices over any field is the largest term of the upper central series that is abelian. 3) Free products have a trivial pseudocentre, but there exist amalgamated free products of non-trivial groups coinciding with their pseudocentre. 4) Weakly regular branch groups have a trivial pseudocentre. 5) The pseudocentre of the Thompson group is the derived subgroup. 6) Wreath products can have a totally arbitrary pseudocentre.</description>

      <title>Property (VRC) and virtual fibering for amalgamated free products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on studying properties of amalgamated free products $G=G_1*_{G_0} G_2$, where the amalgamated subgroup $G_0$ is virtually cyclic.
  First, we prove that if the factors $G_1$ and $G_2$ are finitely generated virtually abelian groups then $G$ can be mapped to another virtually abelian group so that this homomorphism is injective on each factor.
  We then present several applications of this result. In particular, we show that if $G_1$ and $G_2$ have property (VRC) (that is, every cyclic subgroup is a virtual retract), then the same is true for $G$. We also prove that $G$ inherits some residual properties (such as residual finiteness or virtual residual solvability) from the factors $G_i$, provided $G_0$ is a virtual retract of $G_i$, for $i=1,2$.
  Finally, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for $G$ to be (virtually) $F_m$-fibered. In particular, we fully characterize when an amalgamated product of two (finitely generated free)-by-cyclic groups over a cyclic subgroup is free-by-cyclic or virtually free-by-cyclic.</description>

      <title>An extension theorem for quasimorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a general sufficient condition for extendability of quasimorphisms on subgroups. This condition recovers the result of Hull--Osin on quasimorphisms on hyperbolically embedded subgroups, and the proof given in this paper is much simpler. We also obtain new results for quasimorphisms on normal subgroups. One result is that for a group $G$ and its normal subgroup $K$, if the quotient $G/K$ is hyperbolic, then any antisymmetric quasi-invariant quasimorphism on $K$ extends to $G$. As an application, the stable commutator length $\mathrm{scl}_G$ is bi-Lipschitz equivalent to the stable mixed commutator length $\mathrm{scl}_{G,K}$ on $[G,K]$.
  Another result concerns about group-theoretic Dehn filling in the sense of Dahmani--Guirardel--Osin. As an application, the quotient of a mapping class group of a surface with boundary by the normal closure of a large power of a pseudo-Anosov element is hierarchically hyperbolic. This gives an affirmative answer to a question of Fournier-Facio--Mangioni--Sisto.</description>

      <title>Lower central series of the Riordan group over the field with two elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Riordan group ${\cal R}$ over the field ${\mathbb F}_2$ is a split extension of the Appell subgroup by the Nottingham group ${\cal N}({\mathbb F}_2)$. Using the lower central series of the Nottingham group obtained by C. Leedham-Green and S. McKay, the lower central series of ${\cal R}({\mathbb F}_2)$ is calculated. It is also proved that the abelianization of the Riordan group over any commutative ring with identity is isomorphic to the direct product of the abelianization of the corresponding Lagrange subgroup, the additive group of the ring, and its multiplicative groups of units.</description>

      <title>Polish full groups preserving an infinite measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend some results of Carderi and Le Ma\^itre on full groups in the probability context to the infinite measure one: there exists at most one Polish group topology (refining the weak topology and coarser than the uniform topology) on an ergodic full group, and the orbit full group of a locally compact group acting in a Borel manner can be endowed with a Polish group topology. Moreover, orbit full groups are complete invariants for orbit equivalence. We then generalize a result from Le Ma\^itre on non-Polishability of the group of finitely supported bijections: the finitely supported elements of an ergodic full group carries a Polish group topology if and only if the associated full group comes from a countable equivalence relation. We finish with algebraic and topological results on ergodic (orbit) full groups concerning normal subgroups, contractibility and genericity of aperiodic elements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Farre, Pozzetti and Viaggi proved that any (d-k)-hyperconvex subgroup of PSL(d,C) is virtually isomorphic to a convex cocompact Kleinian group and that its k-th simple root critical exponent is at most 2. We show that a (d-k)-hyperconvex subgroup is isomorphic to a uniform lattice in PSL(2,C) if and only if its k-th simple root critical exponent is exactly 2. Furthermore, we show that if a strongly irreducible (d-k)-hyperconvex subgroup has k-th simple root critical exponent 2, then it is the image of a uniform lattice in PSL(2, C) by an irreducible representation of PSL(2, C) into PSL(d, C).</description>

      <title>Constructing Thompson representatives via pointed links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend Jones' construction to obtain a surjective map from the Brown-Thompson group $F_3$ to the set of pointed links up to pointed isotopy. We then introduce an operation on $F_3$, and use it to define a new monoid $(F_3, \diamond)$, called the central monoid. Using the extended version of Jones' construction, we obtain a surjective monoid homomorphism from the central monoid to the monoid of pointed links with connected sum. This allows us to introduce a standard form for connected sum representatives in $F_3$, and we extend this construction to a certain family of links by defining disjoint union and linking moves on $F_3$.</description>

Abstract: For any geodesic metric space $X$, we give a complete cohomological characterisation of the hyperbolicity of $X$ in terms of vanishing of its second $\ell^{\infty}$-cohomology. We extend this result to the relative setting of $X$ with a collection of uniformly hyperbolic subgraphs. As an application, we give a cohomological characterisation of acylindrical hyperbolicity.</description>

      <title>The hyperbolic cover of an elliptic Weyl group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06401v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study in detail the hyperbolic covers $\tilde{W}$ and $\hat{W}$ of an elliptic Weyl system introduced by Saito. We show that they are isomorphic and also isomorphic to an extended Coxeter system of star type. For $\tilde{c}$ a Coxeter transformation in $\tilde{W}$ we can conclude the Hurwitz transitivity of the braid group action on the set of reduced reflection factorizations of $\tilde{c}$ from the Hurwitz transitivity in extended Coxeter systems of star type. This then enables us to establish for a weighted projective line $\mathbb{X}$ of tubular type an order preserving bijection between the poset of thick subcategories of $\mathrm{coh}(\mathbb{X})$ generated by an exceptional sequence and the poset $[\mathrm{id}, \tilde{c}]$ ordered by the absolute order. In an Appendix, we study the hyperbolic cover of a Coxeter system.</description>

      <title>On the ET0L subgroup membership problem in bounded automata groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are interested in the subgroup membership problem in groups acting on rooted $d$-regular trees and a natural class of subgroups, the stabilisers of infinite rays emanating from the root. These rays, which can also be viewed as infinite words in the alphabet with d letters, form the boundary of the tree. Stabilisers of infinite rays are not finitely generated in general, but if the ray is computable, the membership problem is well posed and solvable. The main result of the paper is that, for bounded automata groups, the membership problem in the stabiliser of any ray that is eventually periodic as an infinite word, forms an ET0L language that is constructable. The result is optimal in the sense that, in general, the membership problem for the stabiliser of an infinite ray in a bounded automata group cannot be context-free. As an application, we give a recursive formula for the associated generating function, aka the Green function, on the corresponding infinite Schreier graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let f be an arbitrary positive integer valued function. The goal of this note is to show that one can construct a finitely generated group in which the discrete log problem is polynomially equivalent to computing the function f. In particular, we provide infinite, but finitely generated groups, in which the discrete logarithm problem is arbitrarily hard. As another application, we construct a family of two-generated groups that have polynomial time word problem and NP-complete discrete log problem. Additionally, using our framework, we propose a generic scheme of cryptographic protocols, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Vanishing of Topological Invariants For Unnormalized Schatten $p$ multiplicative Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A result of Dadarlat shows that nonzero even rational cohomology obstructs the matricial stability of many discrete groups. In the author's previous work, 2-cohomology is used to argue that certain groups are not stable in unnormalized Schatten $p$-norms for $p &gt; 1$, although 2-cohomology is known not to obstruct stability in the unnormalized 2-norm in general. The main result of this paper demonstrates that we should not expect $2k$ cohomology to obstruct in the unnormalized Schatten $p$-norm for $p\le k$, because the invariant in Dadarlat's argument vanishes for maps that are asymptotically multiplicative in the Schatten $p$-norm.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Word Maps on Groups and Polynomial Maps on Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notions of Fatou and Julia sets in the context of word maps on complex Lie groups and polynomial maps on finite-dimensional associative $\mathbb C$-algebras. For the group-theoretic question, we investigate the dynamics of the power map $x \mapsto x^{M}$ on the Lie group $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb C)$, where $M \geq 2$ is an integer. For the algebra-related question, we study polynomial self-maps of $\mathrm{M}_n(\mathbb C)$ induced by monic polynomials in one variable. In both cases, we pin down the explicit description of the Fatou and Julia sets. We also show that there does not exist any wandering Fatou component of the pair $(p,\mathrm M_n(\mathbb C))$ where $p\in\mathbb C[z]$ is a monic polynomial of degree $\geq 2$.</description>
