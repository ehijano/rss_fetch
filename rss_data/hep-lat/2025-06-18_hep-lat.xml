      <title>Confined-deconfined interface tension and latent heat in $\SU{N}$ gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-precision lattice results for the confined-deconfined interface tension and the latent heat of pure $SU(N)$ gauge theories up to $N=10$ and investigate their asymptotic $N$-dependency. For both quantities we observe the leading $N^2$ behaviour and subleading corrections, with the result for the interface tension $\sigma/T_c^3 = 0.0182(7) N^2 - 0.194(15)$ and for the latent heat $L/T_c^4 = 0.360(6) N^2 - 1.88(17)$. We use the \emph{mixed phase ensemble} method - where the system is constrained so that half of the volume is in the confined phase and the other half in the deconfined phase - and the interface tension is obtained by measuring the capillary wave fluctuation spectra of the interfaces between the two phases. The method bypasses supercritical slowing down from which other methods for determining the interface tension suffer, and as a by-product produces accurate estimates of the critical inverse gauge coupling as a function of the inverse temperature. We use the latter to determine the lattice beta function values, required to compute the latent heat from the discontinuity in the average plaquette action across the confined-deconfined transition.</description>

      <title>'t Hooft line in 4D $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory and a microscopic description of dyon's statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In lattice gauge theory with compact gauge field variables, an introduction of the gauge field topology requires the assumption that lattice field configurations are sufficiently smooth. This assumption is referred to as the admissibility condition. However, the admissibility condition always ensures the Bianchi identity, and thus prohibits the existence of magnetic objects such as the 't~Hooft line. Recently, in 2D compact scalar field theory, Ref.~\cite{Abe:2023uan} proposed a method to define magnetic objects without violating the admissibility condition by introducing holes into the lattice. In this paper, we extend this ``excision method'' to 4D Maxwell theory and propose a new definition of the 't~Hooft line on the lattice. Using this definition, we first demonstrate a lattice counterpart of the Witten effect which endows the 't~Hooft line with electric charge and make it a dyon. Furthermore, we show that by interpreting the 't~Hooft line as a boundary of the lattice system, the statistics of the dyon can be directly read off. We also explain how the dyonic operator which satisfies the Dirac quantization condition becomes a genuine loop operator even at finite lattice spacings.</description>

      <title>On the two-loop penguin contributions to the Anomalous Dimensions of four-quark operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00249v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the Next-to-Leading Order (two-loop) contributions to the Anomalous Dimensions of $\Delta F = 1$ four-quark operators in QCD. We devise a test for anomalous dimensions, that we regard as of general interest, and by means of which we detect a problem in the results available in the literature. Deconstructing the steps leading to the available result, we identify the source of the problem, which is related to the operator known as $Q_{11}$. We show how to fix the problem and provide the corrected anomalous dimensions. With the insight of our findings, we propose an alternative approach to the one used in the literature which does not suffer from the identified disease, and which confirms our corrected results. We assess the numerical impact of our corrections, which happens to be in the ballpark of $5\%$ in certain entries of the evolution matrix. Our results are important for the correct resummation of Next-to-Leading Logarithms in analyses of physics beyond the Standard Model in $\Delta F = 1$ processes, such as the decays of Kaons and $B$-mesons.</description>
