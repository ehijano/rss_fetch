      <title>DEMO enhanced BPMN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an integration between DEMO (Design and Engineering Methodology for Organizations) and BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation). While BPMN is widely used for its intuitive, flow-based representation of business processes, it suffers from a lack of formal semantics, ambiguity, and limitations in modeling multi-party collaborations. In contrast, DEMO offers a theoretically robust, ontology-driven framework that focuses on abstracting the essential structure of business processes. A novel approach combining the rigor of DEMO's transaction patterns with the more practical, widely adopted BPMN framework is proposed and demonstrated. This integration allows for the benefits of DEMO's theoretical foundations to be utilized within BPMN diagrams, providing a more comprehensive and precise understanding of business processes. We argue that this combination enriches the modeling of business processes, providing a more coherent and reliable tool for both practitioners and researchers.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of single-server Markovian queues: A dynamic amplification approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is revolutionizing various fields, including operations research and queueing theory. This study presents a quantum method for simulating single-server Markovian (M/M/1) queues, making quantum computing more accessible to researchers in operations research. We introduce a dynamic amplification approach that adapts to queue traffic, potentially improving simulation efficiency, and design custom-parameterized quantum gates for arrival and service processes. This flexible framework enables modeling of various queueing scenarios while bridging quantum computing and classical queueing theory. Notably, our quantum method shows potential advantages over classical simulations, particularly in high-traffic scenarios. This quantum simulation approach opens new possibilities for analyzing complex queueing systems, potentially outperforming classical methods in challenging scenarios and paving the way for quantum-enhanced operations research. The method was implemented and tested across low-, moderate-, and high-traffic scenarios, comparing quantum simulations with both theoretical formulas and classical simulations. Results demonstrate high agreement between quantum computations and theoretical predictions, with relative errors below 0.002 for effective arrival rates in high-traffic scenarios. As the number of qubits increases, we observe rapid convergence to theoretical values, with relative errors decreasing by up to two orders of magnitude in some cases. Sensitivity analysis reveals optimal parameter regions yielding errors lower than 0.001.</description>

      <title>Predictive Tree-based Virtual Keyboard for Improved Gaze Typing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On-screen keyboard eye-typing systems are limited due to the lack of predictive text and user-centred approaches, resulting in low text entry rates and frequent recalibration. This work proposes integrating the prediction by partial matching (PPM) technique into a tree-based virtual keyboard. We developed the Flex-Tree on-screen keyboard using a two-stage tree-based character selection system with ten commands, testing it with three degree of PPM (PPM1, PPM2, PPM3). Flex-Tree provides access to 72 English characters, including upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters, and offers functionalities like the delete command for corrections. The system was evaluated with sixteen healthy volunteers using two specially designed typing tasks, including the hand-picked and random-picked sentences. The spelling task was performed using two input modalities: (i) a mouse and (ii) a portable eye-tracker. Two experiments were conducted, encompassing 24 different conditions. The typing performance of Flex-Tree was compared with that of a tree-based virtual keyboard with an alphabetic arrangement (NoPPM) and the Dasher on-screen keyboard for new users. Flex-Tree with PPM3 outperformed the other keyboards, achieving average text entry speeds of 27.7 letters/min with a mouse and 16.3 letters/min with an eye-tracker. Using the eye-tracker, the information transfer rates at the command and letter levels were 108.4 bits/min and 100.7 bits/min, respectively. Flex-Tree, across all three degree of PPM, received high ratings on the system usability scale and low-weighted ratings on the NASA Task Load Index for both input modalities, highlighting its user-centred design.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Protocol for High-Quality QAOA Parameters with Few Shots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00557v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum heuristic for combinatorial optimization that has been demonstrated to scale better than state-of-the-art classical solvers for some problems. For a given problem instance, QAOA performance depends crucially on the choice of the parameters. While average-case optimal parameters are available in many cases, meaningful performance gains can be obtained by fine-tuning these parameters for a given instance. This task is especially challenging, however, when the number of circuit executions (shots) is limited. In this work, we develop an end-to-end protocol that combines multiple parameter settings and fine-tuning techniques. We use large-scale numerical experiments to optimize the protocol for the shot-limited setting and observe that optimizers with the simplest internal model (linear) perform best. We implement the optimized pipeline on a trapped-ion processor using up to 32 qubits and 5 QAOA layers, and we demonstrate that the pipeline is robust to small amounts of hardware noise. To the best of our knowledge, these are the largest demonstrations of QAOA parameter fine-tuning on a trapped-ion processor in terms of 2-qubit gate count.</description>

      <title>Parallax: A Compiler for Neutral Atom Quantum Computers under Hardware Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among different quantum computing technologies, neutral atom quantum computers have several advantageous features, such as multi-qubit gates, application-specific topologies, movable qubits, homogenous qubits, and long-range interactions. However, existing compilation techniques for neutral atoms fall short of leveraging these advantages in a practical and scalable manner. This paper introduces Parallax, a zero-SWAP, scalable, and parallelizable compilation and atom movement scheduling method tailored for neutral atom systems, which reduces high-error operations by 25% and increases the success rate by 28% on average compared to the state-of-the-art technique.</description>
