      <title>Entanglement dynamics of many-body quantum states with evolving system conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement analysis of a pure state of a many-body quantum system requires a prior information about its density matrix/ state matrix, obtained in principle by solving the Hamiltonian matrix. The missing information due to complexity of the many-body interactions however renders it necessary to consider an ensemble of Hamiltonians and thereby an ensemble of pure states. This in turn leaves a statistical description of the entanglement measures as the only option.
  We consider physical Hamiltonians that can be modelled by a multiparametric Gaussian ensembles, theoretically derive the state ensembles for its eigenstates and analyze the effect of varying system conditions on its entanglement statistics. Our approach leads to a single parametric based common mathematical formulation for the evolution of the statistics of different state ensembles. The parameter turns out to be a single functional of the system parameters and thereby reveals a deep web of connection underlying different quantum states.</description>

      <title>Les Houches lectures on Theoretical Ecology: High-dimensional models and extreme events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of ecological systems is gaining momentum in modern scientific research, driven by an abundance of empirical data and advancements in bioengineering techniques. However, a full understanding of their dynamical and thermodynamical properties, also in light of the ongoing biodiversity crisis, remains a formidable endeavor. From a theoretical standpoint, modeling the interactions within these complex systems -- such as bacteria in microbial communities, plant-pollinator networks in forests, or starling murmurations -- presents a significant challenge. Given the characteristic high dimensionality of the datasets, alternative elegant approaches employ random matrix formalism and techniques from disordered systems. In these lectures, we will explore two cornerstone models in theoretical ecology: the MacArthur/Resource-Consumer model, and the Generalized Lotka-Volterra model, with a special focus on systems composed of a large number of interacting species. In the second part, we will highlight timely directions, particularly to bridge the gap with empirical observations and detect macroecological patterns.</description>

      <title>Viscosity of polymer melts using non-affine theory based on vibrational modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Viscosity, a fundamental transport and rheological property of liquids, quantifies the resistance to relative motion between molecular layers and plays a critical role in understanding material behavior. Conventional methods, such as the Green-Kubo (GK) approach, rely on time integration of correlation functions, which becomes computationally intensive near the glass transition due to slow correlation decay. A recently proposed method based on non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD) and instantaneous normal mode analysis offers a promising alternative for estimating the viscosity. In this study, we apply the NALD approach to compute the viscosity of the Kremer-Grest polymer system over a range of temperatures and compare these results with those from the GK method and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings reveal that all vibration modes, including the instantaneous normal modes, contribute to the viscosity. This work presents an efficient framework for calculating viscosity across diverse systems, including near the glass transition where the GK method is no longer applicable. Also, it opens the avenue to understanding the role of different vibrational modes linked with structure, facilitating the design of materials with tunable rheological properties.</description>

      <title>Critical Dynamics in Short-Range Quadratic Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate critical transport and the dynamical exponent through the spreading of an initially localized particle in quadratic Hamiltonians with short-range hopping in lattice dimension $d_l$. We consider critical dynamics that emerges when the Thouless time, i.e., the saturation time of the mean-squared displacement, approaches the typical Heisenberg time. We establish a relation, $z=d_l/d_s$, linking the critical dynamical exponent $z$ to $d_l$ and to the spectral fractal dimension $d_s$. This result has notable implications: it says that superdiffusive transport in $d_l\geq 2$ and diffusive transport in $d_l\geq 3$ cannot be critical in the sense defined above. Our findings clarify previous results on disordered and quasiperiodic models and, through Fibonacci potential models in two and three dimensions, provide non-trivial examples of critical dynamics in systems with $d_l\neq1$ and $d_s\neq1$.</description>

      <title>Training a multilayer dynamical spintronic network with standard machine learning tools to perform time series classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02835v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to process time-series at low energy cost is critical for many applications. Recurrent neural network, which can perform such tasks, are computationally expensive when implementing in software on conventional computers. Here we propose to implement a recurrent neural network in hardware using spintronic oscillators as dynamical neurons. Using numerical simulations, we build a multi-layer network and demonstrate that we can use backpropagation through time (BPTT) and standard machine learning tools to train this network. Leveraging the transient dynamics of the spintronic oscillators, we solve the sequential digits classification task with $89.83\pm2.91~\%$ accuracy, as good as the equivalent software network. We devise guidelines on how to choose the time constant of the oscillators as well as hyper-parameters of the network to adapt to different input time scales.</description>

      <title>Generative modeling through internal high-dimensional chaotic activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative modeling aims at producing new datapoints whose statistical properties resemble the ones in a training dataset. In recent years, there has been a burst of machine learning techniques and settings that can achieve this goal with remarkable performances. In most of these settings, one uses the training dataset in conjunction with noise, which is added as a source of statistical variability and is essential for the generative task. Here, we explore the idea of using internal chaotic dynamics in high-dimensional chaotic systems as a way to generate new datapoints from a training dataset. We show that simple learning rules can achieve this goal within a set of vanilla architectures and characterize the quality of the generated datapoints through standard accuracy measures.</description>

      <title>Krylov space approach to Singular Value Decomposition in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a tridiagonalization approach for non-Hermitian random matrices and Hamiltonians using singular value decomposition (SVD). This technique leverages the real and non-negative nature of singular values, bypassing the complex eigenvalues typically found in non-Hermitian systems. We analyze the tridiagonal elements, namely the Lanczos coefficients and the associated Krylov (spread) complexity, appropriately defined through the SVD, across several examples, including Ginibre ensembles and the non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. We demonstrate that in chaotic cases, the complexity exhibits a distinct peak due to the repulsion between singular values, a feature absent in integrable cases. Using our approach, we analytically compute the Krylov complexity for two-dimensional non-Hermitian random matrices within a subset of non-Hermitian symmetry classes including time-reversal, time-reversal$^{\dagger}$, chiral, and sublattice symmetry.</description>

      <title>Higher-order contagion processes in 1.99 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-order interactions have recently emerged as a promising framework for describing new dynamical phenomena in heterogeneous contagion processes. However, a fundamental open question is how to understand their contribution in the eyes of the physics of critical phenomena. Based on mesoscopic field-theoretic Langevin descriptions, we show that: (i) pairwise mechanisms as facilitation or thresholding are formally equivalent to higher-order ones, (ii) pairwise interactions at coarse-grained scales govern the higher-order contact process and, (iii) classical Imry-Ma arguments hold for networks with low spectral dimension. In short, we demonstrate that classical field theories, grounded on model symmetries and/or network dimensionality, still capture the nature of the phase transition, also predicting finite-size effects in real and synthetic networks.</description>
