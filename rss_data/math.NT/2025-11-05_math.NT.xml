      <title>Simultaneous Khintchine theorem on manifolds in positive characteristics: convergence case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we prove the convergence case of Khintchine's theorem for analytic nonplanar manifolds over local fields of positive characteristic, in the setting of simultaneous Diophantine approximation. Our approach is based on the method of counting rational points near manifolds developed by Beresnevich and Yang. The results obtained here extend the work of Beresnevich and Yang, and Beresnevich and Datta, to the function field setting. In the course of the proof, we also establish several new results in the geometry of numbers over function fields, which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>An Elementary Characterization of the Gauss--Kuzmin Measure in the Theory of Continued Fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By a classical result of Gauss and Kuzmin, the frequency with which a string $\mathbf{a}=(a_1,\dots,a_n)$ of positive integers appears in the continued fraction expansion of a random real number is given by $\mu_{GK}({I(\mathbf{a})})$, where $I(\mathbf{a})$ is the set of real numbers in $[0,1)$ whose continued fraction expansion begins with the string $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mu_{GK}$ is the \emph{Gauss--Kuzmin measure}, defined by $\mu_{GK}(I)= \frac{1}{\log 2}\int_I \frac{1}{1+x} dx$, for any interval $I\subseteq[0,1]$. % It is known that the Gauss--Kuzmin measure satisfies the symmetry property $(*)$ $\mu_{GK}(I(\mathbf{a}))=\mu_{GK}(I(\overleftarrow{\mathbf{a}}))$, where $\overleftarrow{\mathbf{a}}=(a_n,\dots,a_1)$ is the reverse of the string $\mathbf{a}$. We show that this property in fact characterizes the Gauss--Kuzmin measure: If $\mu$ is any probability measure with continuous density function on $[0,1]$ satisfying $\mu(I(\mathbf{a}))=\mu(I(\overleftarrow{\mathbf{a}}))$ for all finite strings $\mathbf{a}$, then $\mu=\mu_{GK}$. % We also consider the question whether symmetries analogous to $(*)$ hold for permutations of $\mathbf{a}$ other than the reverse $\overleftarrow{\mathbf{a}}$; we call such a symmetry \emph{nontrivial}. We show that strings $\mathbf{a}$ of length $3$ have no nontrivial symmetries, while for each $n\ge 4$ there exists an infinite family of strings $\mathbf{a}$ of length $n$ that do have nontrivial symmetries. Finally we present numerical data supporting the conjecture that, in an appropriate asymptotic sense, ``almost all'' strings $\mathbf{a}$ have no nontrivial symmetries.</description>

      <title>On the Hasse principle for divisibility in elliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number and $n$ a positive integer. Let $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over a number field $k$. It is known that the local-global divisibility by $p$ holds in $E/k$, but for powers of $p^n$ counterexamples may appear. The validity or the failing of the Hasse principle depends on the elliptic curve $E$ and the field $k$ and, consequently, on the group $\mathrm{Gal}(k(E[p^n])/k)$. For which kind of these groups does the principle hold? For which of them can we find a counterexample? The answer to these questions was known for $n=1,2$, but for $n\geq 3$ they were still open. We show some conditions on the generators of $\mathrm{Gal}(k(E[p^n])/k)$ implying an affirmative answer to the local-global divisibility by $p^n$ in $E$ over $k$, for every $n\geq 2$. We also prove that these conditions are necessary by producing counterexamples in the case when they do not hold. These last results generalize to every power $p^n$, a result obtained by Ranieri for $n=2$.</description>

      <title>A family of analogues to the Robin criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Robin criterion states that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the inequality $\sigma(n) &lt; e^\gamma n \log \log n$ for all $n&gt;5040$, where $\sigma(n)$ is the sum of divisors of $n$, and $\gamma$ is the Euler--Mascheroni constant. Define the family of functions \[ \sigma^{[k]} (n):=\sum_{[d_1,\dots,d_k]=n}d_1\dots d_k \] where $[d_1, \dots, d_k]$ is the least common multiple of $d_1, \dots, d_k$. These functions behave asymptotically like $\sigma(n)^k$ as $k\to\infty$. We prove the following analogue of the Robin criterion: for any $k \geq 2$, the Riemann hypothesis holds if and only if $\sigma^{[k]} (n) &lt; \frac{(e^\gamma n \log \log n)^k}{\zeta(k)}$ for all $n &gt; 2162160$, where $\zeta$ is the Riemann zeta function.</description>

      <title>On the integrality of some P-recursive sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the arithmetic nature of P-recursive sequences through the lens of their D-finite generating functions. Building on classical tools from differential algebra, we revisit the integrality criterion for Motzkin-type sequences due to Klazar and Luca, and propose a unified method for analysing global boundedness and algebraicity within a broader class of holonomic sequences. The central contribution is an algorithm that determines whether all, none, or a one-dimensional family of solutions to certain second-order recurrences are globally bounded. This approach generalizes earlier ad hoc methods and applies successfully to several well-known sequences from the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS).</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds on High Moments of Twisted Fourier coefficients of Modular Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any large prime $q$, $x \leq 1$ and any real $k\geq 2$, we prove a lower bound for the following $2k$-th moment
  \begin{equation*}
  \sum_{\substack{\chi \in X_q^*}} \Big| \sum_{n\leq x} \chi(n)\lambda(n)\Big|^{2k}, \end{equation*}
  where $X_q^*$ denotes the set of primitive Dirichlet characters modulo $q$ and $\lambda(n)$ the Fourier coefficients of a fixed modular form. The bound we obtain is sharp up to a constant factor under the generalized Riemann Hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff measures of sets in Exact Diophantine approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X, d)$ be a compact metric space. Given a countable subset $Q \subset X$, a positive function $R: Q \to \mathbb{R}^+:\xi \mapsto R_{\xi}$, and a non-decreasing function $\phi$, we consider the set $E(Q, R, \phi)$ of points $x \in X$ for which there are infinitely many $\xi \in Q$ satisfying $$d(x, \xi) &lt; \phi(R_{\xi}),$$ yet for any $0&lt;\epsilon&lt;1$, there are only finitely many $\xi \in Q$ such that $$d(x, \xi) &lt; (1-\epsilon)\phi(R_{\xi}).$$ We provide sufficient conditions (which are also necessary under some mild assumptions) for the $s$-dimensional Hausdorff measure of $E(Q, R, \phi)$ to be infinite. This framework generalizes not only the classical set $\mathrm{Exact}(\psi)$ of points exactly $\psi$-approximable by rationals (where $\psi$ is non-increasing), but also certain restricted Diophantine approximation sets.</description>

      <title>Linear relations among radicals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field, fix an algebraic closure $\overline{K}$, and let $G$ be a subgroup of $\overline{K}^\times$. We are able to give a closed formula for the ratio between the degree $[K(G):K]$ and the index $|GK^\times:K^\times|$, provided that the latter is finite. Our formula explains all the $K$-linear relations among radicals, which (beyond the ones stemming from the multiplicative group $GK^\times/K^\times$) are generated by relations among roots of unity and single radicals. Our work builds on results by Rybowicz, which in turn are based on work by Kneser and Schinzel.</description>

      <title>New permutation polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new method to obtain new permutation polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. Using this method, we extend many known permutation polynomials, which take the form $\sum_i(x^q-x+\delta)^{s_i}+L(x)$, where $L(x)$ is a $q$-polynomial over $\mathbb{F}_q$ and $\delta\in\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. We also present an alternative approach for constructing permutation polynomials of the form $x+\gamma Tr_q^{q^d}(x^{q+1}+x^{2q+2})$ for the cases where $q=2^m$, $2\nmid d$ and $ Tr_q^{q^d}(x)=x+x^q+\dots+x^{q^{d-1}}$.</description>

      <title>Hermite-Jensen limits and $d$ log-concavity of $q$-multinomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1878, Sylvester proved Cayley's Conjecture that the coefficients of the Gaussian $q$-binomial coefficients are unimodal. In 1990, O'Hara famously discovered a constructive combinatorial proof, and in 2013, Pak and Panova proved the stronger property of strict unimodality for sufficiently large parameters. We move from unimodality to log-concavity and higher degree $ d$ log-concavity, known as Tur\'an inequalities. Although $q$-binomial coefficients are not always log- or degree $d$ log-concave, it's natural to ask to what extent these inequalities hold. In infinite families with limiting aspect ratio bounded away from zero and one, we prove that these stronger inequalities hold uniformly, for each $C&gt;0,$ on the central window $|m-\mu|&lt; C\sigma,$ where $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the mean and standard deviation of the normalized distribution. More generally, we obtain the same conclusions for $q$-multinomial coefficients. These results stem from the asymptotic behavior of normalized Jensen polynomials, which are approximated by Hermite polynomials.</description>

      <title>Ekedahl-Oort types of $\Z/2\Z$-covers in characteristic $2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study the Ekedahl-Oort types of $\Z/2\Z$-Galois covers $\pi:Y \to X$ in characteristic two. When the base curve $X$ is ordinary, we show that the Ekedahl-Oort type of $Y$ is completely determined by the genus of $X$ and the ramification of $\pi$. For a general base curve $X$, we prove bounds on the Ekedahl-Oort depending on the Ekedahl-Oort type of $X$ and the ramification of $\pi$. Along the way, we develop a theory of \emph{enhanced differentials of the second kind}. This theory allows us to study algebraic de Rham cohomology in any characteristic by working directly with differentials, in contrast to the standard \v{C}ech resolution.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic equivalents of partial sums of the reciprocals of prime numbers via the von Mangoldt function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss an alternative approach to determine an asymptotic equivalent of the partial sum of the reciprocals of prime numbers. This well-known result, related to Merten's second theorem, is usually derived through methods similar to those found in Hardy and Wright's book ``An introduction to the theory of numbers'', involving comparisons with integrals. The present proof differs in several respects, combining an equivalent for the partial sum of $\Lambda(m)/m$, where $\Lambda$ denotes the von Mangoldt function, with an application of Abel's summation formula and properties of the second Chebyshev function $\Psi(x)=\sum_{n\le x}\Lambda(n)$. A simple application to the study of integers with large prime factors is also presented. Beyond the pedagogical aspect of this work, the aim is to highlight the complementarity of arithmetic functions and to show that interesting (and nontrivial) results can be obtained by means of elementary methods.</description>

      <title>Real zeros of $L'(s, \chi_d)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\nu$ be any positive function such that $\nu(x)\to\infty$ as $x\to \infty$. We prove that for almost all fundamental discriminants $d$, $L'(s, \chi_d)$ has at most $(\log\log |d|)( \log\log \log |d|)$ real zeros inside the interval $[1/2+\nu(|d|)/\log |d|, 1]$. Combining this result with a recent work of Klurman, Lamzouri, and Munsch, shows that the number of these zeros equals $(\log\log |d|) (\log\log \log |d|)^{\theta}$ for almost all $d$, where $|\theta|\leq 1$. This comes close to proving a conjecture of Baker and Montgomery, which predicts $\asymp \log\log |d|$ real zeros of $L'(s, \chi_d)$ in the interval $[1/2, 1]$, for almost all $d$. Moreover, assuming a mild hypothesis on the low lying zeros of quadratic Dirichlet $L$-functions (which follows from GRH and the one level density conjecture of Katz and Sarnak), we fully resolve the Baker-Montgomery conjecture (up to the $\log\log\log |d|$ factor). We also show, under the same hypothesis, that for almost all $d$, $100\%$ of the real zeros of $L'(s, \chi_d)$ on $[1/2, 1]$ lie to the right of $1/2+\nu(|d|)/\log |d|$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A base-$g$ Niven number is a natural number divisible by the sum of its base-$g$ digits. We show that, for any $g\geq 3$, all sufficiently large natural numbers can be written as the sum of three base-$g$ Niven numbers. We also give an asymptotic formula for the number of representations of a sufficiently large integer as the sum of three integers with fixed, close to average, digit sums.</description>

      <title>Complexity of counting points on curves and the factor $P_1(T)$ of the zeta function of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article concerns the computational complexity of a fundamental problem in number theory: counting points on curves and surfaces over finite fields. There is no subexponential-time algorithm known and it is unclear if it can be $\mathrm{NP}$-hard.
  Given a curve, we present the first efficient Arthur-Merlin protocol to certify its point-count, its Jacobian group structure, and its Hasse-Weil zeta function. We extend this result to a smooth projective surface to certify the factor $P_{1}(T)$, corresponding to the first Betti number, of the zeta function; by using the counting oracle. We give the first algorithm to compute $P_{1}(T)$ that is poly($\log q$)-time if the degree $D$ of the input surface is fixed; and in quantum poly($D\log q$)-time in general.
  Our technique in the curve case, is to sample hash functions using the Weil and Riemann-Roch bounds, to certify the group order of its Jacobian. For higher dimension varieties, we first reduce to the case of a surface, which is fibred as a Lefschetz pencil of hyperplane sections over $\mathbb{P}^{1}$. The formalism of vanishing cycles, and the inherent big monodromy, enable us to prove an effective version of Deligne's `theoreme du pgcd' using the hard-Lefschetz theorem and an equidistribution result due to Katz. These reduce our investigations to that of computing the zeta function of a curve, defined over a finite field extension $\mathbb{F}_{Q}/\mathbb{F}_{q}$ of poly-bounded degree. This explicitization of the theory yields the first nontrivial upper bounds on the computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Clebsch-Gordan and the theta filtration for modular representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2({\mathbb F}_q)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime. We solve two problems in the mod $p$ representation theory of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_{q})$ where $q=p^f$. We first prove a Clebsch-Gordan decomposition theorem for the tensor product of two mod $p$ representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_{q})$. As an application, we use this to guess the structure of quotients of symmetric power representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_{q})$ by submodules in the theta filtration. We then give a direct proof of this structure showing that such quotients are built out of principal series representations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the dot-product graphs in $\mathbb{F}_q^d$. We prove that if the size of the product of two adjacent sets is large enough, then the set of dot-product graphs has positive density. Our method is based on finite field Fourier analytic techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study graded perfectoid rings as graded analogues of Scholze's (integral) perfectoid rings. We establish a categorical equivalence between graded perfectoid rings and graded perfect prisms, extending the Bhatt-Scholze's correspondence to the graded setting. We also construct the initial graded perfectoid cover of any graded semiperfectoid rings and prove a graded version of Andr\'e's flatness lemma. These results lay the foundations for a graded theory of perfectoid rings.</description>

      <title>On signed Mordell-Weil groups for abelian varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13452v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this short note, we work in the general framework of supersingular abelian varieties defined over $\mathbb{Q}$. Using Coleman maps constructed by B\"uy\"ukboduk--Lei, we define some objects called ``the multi-signed Mordell-Weil groups" for supersingular abelian varieties, make comments on the structure of the dual of these groups as an Iwasawa module and show a (weak) control theorem. This recovers the case of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ non-ordinary at the prime $p$ with $a_p=0$ studied by Antonio Lei. Using the multi-signed Mordell-Weil groups we define what we call ``the multi-signed Tate-Shafarevich groups" along the cyclotomic tower of $\mathbb{Q}$. Finally we pose some open questions related to our newly defined objects and make a remark on the asymptotic growth of these multi-signed Tate-Shafarevich groups along the cyclotomic tower using an idea of Meng Fai Lim.</description>

      <title>On converse theorems for Hilbert modular forms assuming unramified twists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01449v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove two results on converse theorems for Hilbert modular forms over totally real fields of degree $r&gt;1$. The first result recovers a Hilbert modular form (of some level) from an $L$-series satisfying functional equations twisted by all the unramified Hecke characters. The second result assumes both the 'unramified' functional equations and an Euler product, and recovers a Hilbert modular form of the expected level predicted by the shape of the functional equations. Our result generalizes the current converse theorems for $\mathrm{GL}_2$ in the case of Hilbert modular forms in that we completely remove the assumptions on ramified twists.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma \subset \bar{\Q}^{\times}$ be a finitely generated multiplicative group of algebraic numbers, let $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_m$ be non-zero algebraic numbers, and let $\varepsilon &gt;0$ be fixed. In this paper, we prove that there exist only finitely many tuples $(u_1, \ldots, u_m, q, p)\in \Gamma^m\times\mathbb{Z}^2$ with $d = [\mathbb{Q}(u_1, \ldots, u_m):\mathbb{Q}]$ such that for any two tuples $(u_1,\ldots,u_m)$ and $(u'_1,\ldots,u'_m)$, we have $\frac{u_{i_1}}{u_{i_2}}\neq \frac{u'_{i_1}}{u'_{i_2}}$ for $1\leq i_1\neq i_2\leq m$ and it is stable under Galois conjugation over $\Q$, $\max\{|\alpha_1 qu_1|, \ldots, |\alpha_m qu_m|\}&gt;1$, $H\left(\frac{u_{i_1}}{\sigma(u_{i_2})}\right)&gt;\displaystyle\max_{\substack{1\leq i_1 \neq i_2\leq m}}\Bigl\{H\left(\frac{\sigma(\alpha_{i_2})}{\alpha_{i_1}}\right)\mid \sigma:\mathbb{Q}(u_1,\ldots, u_m)\rightarrow \mathbb{C}\Bigl\}$, the tuple $(\alpha_1qu_1, \ldots, \alpha_mq u_m)$ is not pseudo-Pisot and \[0&lt; \left|\sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_iq u_i - p\right|&lt;\frac{1}{\left(\prod_{i=1}^mH( u_i)\right)^{\varepsilon} |q|^{md+\varepsilon}},\] where $H(u_i)$ denotes the absolute Weil height. This result extends one of the main results of Corvaja-Zannier \cite{corv}. In addition, we prove a result similar to \cite[Theorem 1.4]{kul} in a more general setting. In our proofs, we exploit the subspace theorem based on the work of Corvaja-Zannier.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Euclidean lattices spanned by images of algebraic conjugates of an algebraic number under Minkowski embedding, investigating their rank, properties of their automorphism groups and sets of minimal vectors. We are especially interested in situations when the resulting lattice is well-rounded. We show that this happens for large Pisot numbers of prime degree, demonstrating infinite families of such lattices. We also fully classify well-rounded lattices from algebraic conjugates in the 2-dimensional case and present various examples in the 3-dimensional case. Finally, we derive a determinant formula for the resulting lattice in the case when the minimal polynomial of an algebraic number has its Galois group of a particular type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study five pencils of projective quartic Delsarte K3 surfaces. Over finite fields, we give explicit formulas for the point counts of each family, written in terms of hypergeometric sums. Over the complex numbers, we match the periods of the corresponding family with hypergeometric differential operators and series. We also obtain a decomposition of the $L$-function of each pencil in terms of hypergeometric $L$-series and Dedekind zeta functions. This gives an explicit description of the hypergeometric motives geometrically realised by each pencil.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that an arithmetic path integral over the $\ell$-torsion of a Jacobian $J[\ell]$ is equal to the trace of the Frobenius action on a representation of the Heisenberg group $H(J[\ell])$, up to an explicitly determined sign. This is an arithmetic analogue of trace--path integral formulae which arise in quantum field theory, where path integrals over a space of sections of a fibration over a circle can be expressed as the trace of the monodromy action on a Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>A Hilbert 90 Property for S-Class Groups and Applications to the Gross--Kuz'min Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $L/K$ be a cyclic extension of number fields, and let $S$ be a finite set of places of $K$ containing the ramified and Archimedean ones. We say that $L/K$ has the $\mathbf{cl}^S$-Hilbert 90 property if, for any generator $\sigma \in \mathrm{Gal}(L/K)$, the kernel of the arithmetic norm map $\mathbf{cl}^S(L) \to \mathbf{cl}^S(K)$ coincides with $(1 - \sigma)\mathbf{cl}^S(L)$.
  In this article, we first provide a method to verify the $\mathbf{cl}^S$-Hilbert 90 property, which does not require any knowledge of the class group of $L$. Then we investigate a connection between the $\mathbf{cl}^S$-Hilbert 90 property and the Gross-Kuz'min conjecture from Iwasawa theory.
  In doing so, we derive a new criterion for the Gross-Kuz'min conjecture, related to Fermat quotients and spin symbols of prime ideals, which can easily be checked by explicit computation. We conjecture that, in the totally real case, the condition holds for all but finitely many primes. Finally, we present numerical evidence supporting a heuristic in favor of this conjecture.</description>

Abstract: We obtain the $n$th centered moments of one level densities of a large orthogonal family of $L$-functions associated with holomorphic Hecke newforms of level $q$, averaged over $q\sim Q$. We verify the Katz-Sarnak conjecture for these statistics, in the range where the sum of the supports of the Fourier transforms of test functions lies in $(-4, 4)$. In so doing, we need to understand certain phantom oversized terms, which allow us to extract the right off-diagonal contributions. We further need to resolve the combinatorial problem that arises when matching our main terms with random matrix predictions.</description>

Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime, and let $\mathrm{X}$ be a smooth $p$-adic formal scheme over $\mathrm{Spf} \mathcal{O}_K$ where $K/\mathbf{Q}_p$ is a finite extension. We show that reflexive sheaves on the stack $\mathrm{X}^{\mathrm{Syn}}$ are equivalent to $\mathbf{Z}_p$-lattices in crystalline local systems on the rigid generic fiber $\mathrm{X}_\eta$, and then use this to study the essential image of the \'{e}tale realization functor on the isogeny category of perfect complexes on $\mathrm{X}^{\mathrm{Syn}}$. We also show that when $\mathrm{X}/\mathrm{Spf} \mathcal{O}_K$ is smooth and proper that $\mathsf{Perf}(\mathrm{X}^{\mathrm{Syn}})[1/p]$ is equivalent to a category of admissible filtered $F$-isocrystals in perfect complexes.</description>

      <title>The Orbital Bivariate Chromatic Polynomial</title>

      <description>arXiv:2009.08235v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The orbital bivariate chromatic polynomial, introduced in this article, counts the number of ways to color the vertices of a graph with $\lambda$ colors such that adjacent vertices either receive distinct colors from a set of $\lambda$ colors, or the same color from a distinguished subset of $\lambda-\mu$ colors, up to a group of symmetries. This new graph polynomial simultaneously generalizes the orbital chromatic polynomial due to Cameron and Kayibi (2007) and the bivariate chromatic polynomial due to Dohmen, P\"onitz, and Tittmann (2003). We discuss fundamental properties, and provide expansions of this new polynomial for various families of graphs, including complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, paths, and cycles. Some of these expansions are even new for the orbital chromatic polynomial. In addition to these results, we rediscover Fermat's Little Theorem and a ``Fermat-like'' congruence for Lucas numbers. Finally, we outline several open problems related to the orbital bivariate chromatic polynomial.</description>

      <title>Periodic $Y$-Systems and Nahm Sums: The Rank 2 Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify periodic $Y$-systems of rank 2 satisfying the symplectic property. We find that there are six such $Y$-systems. In all cases, the periodicity follows from the existence of two reddening sequences associated with the time evolution of the $Y$-systems in positive and negative directions, which gives rise to quantum dilogarithm identities associated with Donaldson-Thomas invariants. We also consider $q$-series called the Nahm sums associated with these $Y$-systems. We see that they are included in Zagier's list of rank 2 Nahm sums that are likely to be modular functions. It was recently shown by Wang that they are indeed modular functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06577v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a curve of genus at least four which is either very general or very general hyperelliptic, we classify all ways in which a power of its Jacobian can be isogenous to a product of Jacobians of curves. As an application, we show that, for a very general principally polarized abelian variety of dimension at least four, or the intermediate Jacobian of a very general cubic threefold, no power is isogenous to a product of Jacobians of curves. This confirms some cases of the Coleman-Oort conjecture. We further deduce from our results some progress on the question whether the integral Hodge conjecture fails for such abelian varieties.</description>

      <title>Parity of the coefficients of certain eta-quotients, III: two special classes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue a series of papers studying the parity of families of eta-quotients, which provide implications for the parity of the partition function as well as an overarching conjecture on related $q$-series. The present article focuses on two classes. One consists of eta-quotients of the form $f_t^3/f_1$, a distinguished case of Andrews' singular overpartitions that has recently attracted attention among researchers. In addition, we investigate the parity of certain pure eta-powers $f_1^t$, appending new results to known density theorems.</description>
