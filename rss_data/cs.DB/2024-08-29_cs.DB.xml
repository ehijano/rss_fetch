      <title>Efficient $k$-NN Search in IoT Data: Overlap Optimization in Tree-Based Indexing Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of interconnected devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to an exponential increase in data, commonly known as Big IoT Data. Efficient retrieval of this heterogeneous data demands a robust indexing mechanism for effective organization. However, a significant challenge remains: the overlap in data space partitions during index construction. This overlap increases node access during search and retrieval, resulting in higher resource consumption, performance bottlenecks, and impedes system scalability. To address this issue, we propose three innovative heuristics designed to quantify and strategically reduce data space partition overlap. The volume-based method (VBM) offers a detailed assessment by calculating the intersection volume between partitions, providing deeper insights into spatial relationships. The distance-based method (DBM) enhances efficiency by using the distance between partition centers and radii to evaluate overlap, offering a streamlined yet accurate approach. Finally, the object-based method (OBM) provides a practical solution by counting objects across multiple partitions, delivering an intuitive understanding of data space dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in reducing search time, underscoring their potential to improve data space partitioning and enhance overall system performance.</description>

      <title>CardBench: A Benchmark for Learned Cardinality Estimation in Relational Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardinality estimation is crucial for enabling high query performance in relational databases. Recently learned cardinality estimation models have been proposed to improve accuracy but there is no systematic benchmark or datasets which allows researchers to evaluate the progress made by new learned approaches and even systematically develop new learned approaches. In this paper, we are releasing a benchmark, containing thousands of queries over 20 distinct real-world databases for learned cardinality estimation. In contrast to other initial benchmarks, our benchmark is much more diverse and can be used for training and testing learned models systematically. Using this benchmark, we explored whether learned cardinality estimation can be transferred to an unseen dataset in a zero-shot manner. We trained GNN-based and transformer-based models to study the problem in three setups: 1-) instance-based, 2-) zero-shot, and 3-) fine-tuned. Our results show that while we get promising results for zero-shot cardinality estimation on simple single table queries; as soon as we add joins, the accuracy drops. However, we show that with fine-tuning, we can still utilize pre-trained models for cardinality estimation, significantly reducing training overheads compared to instance specific models. We are open sourcing our scripts to collect statistics, generate queries and training datasets to foster more extensive research, also from the ML community on the important problem of cardinality estimation and in particular improve on recent directions such as pre-trained cardinality estimation.</description>

      <title>LLM-assisted Labeling Function Generation for Semantic Type Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting semantic types of columns in data lake tables is an important application. A key bottleneck in semantic type detection is the availability of human annotation due to the inherent complexity of data lakes. In this paper, we propose using programmatic weak supervision to assist in annotating the training data for semantic type detection by leveraging labeling functions. One challenge in this process is the difficulty of manually writing labeling functions due to the large volume and low quality of the data lake table datasets. To address this issue, we explore employing Large Language Models (LLMs) for labeling function generation and introduce several prompt engineering strategies for this purpose. We conduct experiments on real-world web table datasets. Based on the initial results, we perform extensive analysis and provide empirical insights and future directions for researchers in this field.</description>

      <title>MQRLD: A Multimodal Data Retrieval Platform with Query-aware Feature Representation and Learned Index Based on Data Lake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal data has become a crucial element in the realm of big data analytics, driving advancements in data exploration, data mining, and empowering artificial intelligence applications. To support high-quality retrieval for these cutting-edge applications, a robust data retrieval platform should meet the requirements for transparent data storage, rich hybrid queries, effective feature representation, and high query efficiency. However, among the existing platforms, traditional schema-on-write systems, multi-model databases, vector databases, and data lakes, which are the primary options for multimodal data retrieval, are difficult to fulfill these requirements simultaneously. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a more versatile multimodal data retrieval platform to address these issues.
  In this paper, we introduce a Multimodal Data Retrieval Platform with Query-aware Feature Representation and Learned Index based on Data Lake (MQRLD). It leverages the transparent storage capabilities of data lakes, integrates the multimodal open API to provide a unified interface that supports rich hybrid queries, introduces a query-aware multimodal data feature representation strategy to obtain effective features, and offers high-dimensional learned indexes to optimize data query. We conduct a comparative analysis of the query performance of MQRLD against other methods for rich hybrid queries. Our results underscore the superior efficiency of MQRLD in handling multimodal data retrieval tasks, demonstrating its potential to significantly improve retrieval performance in complex environments. We also clarify some potential concerns in the discussion.</description>

      <title>CollectionLocator Level 1: Metadata-Based Search for Collections in Federated Biobanks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biobanks are indispensable resources for medical research collecting biological material and associated data and making them available for research projects and medical studies. For that, the biobank data has to meet certain criteria which can be formulated as adherence to the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) principles.
  We developed a tool, CollectionLocator, which aims at increasing the FAIR compliance of biobank data by supporting researchers in identifying which biobank and which collection are likely to contain cases (material and data) satisfying the requirements of a defined research project when the detailed sample data is not available due to privacy restrictions. The CollectionLocator is based on an ontology-based metadata model to address the enormous heterogeneities and ensure the privacy of the donors of the biological samples and the data. Furthermore, the CollectionLocator represents the data and metadata quality of the collections such that the quality requirements of the requester can be matched with the quality of the available data. The concept of CollectionLocator is evaluated with a proof-of-concept implementation.</description>

      <title>OpenFGL: A Comprehensive Benchmarks for Federated Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) has emerged as a promising distributed training paradigm for graph neural networks across multiple local systems without direct data sharing. This approach is particularly beneficial in privacy-sensitive scenarios and offers a new perspective on addressing scalability challenges in large-scale graph learning. Despite the proliferation of FGL, the diverse motivations from practical applications, spanning various research backgrounds and experimental settings, pose a significant challenge to fair evaluation. To fill this gap, we propose OpenFGL, a unified benchmark designed for the primary FGL scenarios: Graph-FL and Subgraph-FL. Specifically, OpenFGL includes 38 graph datasets from 16 application domains, 8 federated data simulation strategies that emphasize graph properties, and 5 graph-based downstream tasks. Additionally, it offers 18 recently proposed SOTA FGL algorithms through a user-friendly API, enabling a thorough comparison and comprehensive evaluation of their effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate the ability of FGL while also revealing its potential limitations, offering valuable insights for future exploration in this thriving field.</description>

      <title>Do Recommender Systems Promote Local Music? A Reproducibility Study Using Music Streaming Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the influence of recommender systems on local music representation, discussing prior findings from an empirical study on the LFM-2b public dataset. This prior study argued that different recommender systems exhibit algorithmic biases shifting music consumption either towards or against local content. However, LFM-2b users do not reflect the diverse audience of music streaming services. To assess the robustness of this study's conclusions, we conduct a comparative analysis using proprietary listening data from a global music streaming service, which we publicly release alongside this paper. We observe significant differences in local music consumption patterns between our dataset and LFM-2b, suggesting that caution should be exercised when drawing conclusions on local music based solely on LFM-2b. Moreover, we show that the algorithmic biases exhibited in the original work vary in our dataset, and that several unexplored model parameters can significantly influence these biases and affect the study's conclusion on both datasets. Finally, we discuss the complexity of accurately labeling local music, emphasizing the risk of misleading conclusions due to unreliable, biased, or incomplete labels. To encourage further research and ensure reproducibility, we have publicly shared our dataset and code.</description>

      <title>Galley: Modern Query Optimization for Sparse Tensor Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tensor programming abstraction has become a foundational paradigm for modern computing. This framework allows users to write high performance programs for bulk computation via a high-level imperative interface. Recent work has extended this paradigm to sparse tensors (i.e. tensors where most entries are not explicitly represented) with the use of sparse tensor compilers. These systems excel at producing efficient code for computation over sparse tensors, which may be stored in a wide variety of formats. However, they require the user to manually choose the order of operations and the data formats at every step. Unfortunately, these decisions are both highly impactful and complicated, requiring significant effort to manually optimize. In this work, we present Galley, a system for declarative sparse tensor programming. Galley performs cost-based optimization to lower these programs to a logical plan then to a physical plan. It then leverages sparse tensor compilers to execute the physical plan efficiently. We show that Galley achieves high performance on a wide variety of problems including machine learning algorithms, subgraph counting, and iterative graph algorithms.</description>
