      <title>Functoriality of toric coherent-constructible correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A morphism from a diagonalizable group $G$ to a torus of a toric variety $X$ induces an action of $G$ on $X$. We prove the category of ind-coherent sheaves on the quotient stack is equivalent to the category of constructible sheaves on a cover of a real torus with singular support contained in the FLTZ skeleton, extending Kuwagaki's nonequivariant coherent-constructible correspondence arXiv:1610.03214. We also and investigate the functoriality of such correspondence.</description>

      <title>Dirac structures in nonholonomic mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of a Dirac algebroid, which is a linear almost Dirac structure on a vector bundle, was designed to generate phase equations for mechanical systems with linear nonholonomic constraints. We apply it to systems with magnetic-like or gyroscopic potentials, that were previously described by means of almost Poisson structures. The almost Poisson structures present in the literature in this context were constructed using constraints, metrics and information about magnetic or gyroscopic potential present in the Hamiltonian function of the system. The Dirac algebroid we use is constructed out of constraints and canonical geometric structures of the underlying bundles and is universal in the sense that it is independent on the particular Hamiltonian or Lagrangian. We provide examples showing that using the same Dirac structure we can describe systems with different potentials, magnetic or mechanical, added freely to a function generating the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Liouville-Arnold theorem for homogeneous symplectic and contact Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12061v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Hamiltonian system is completely integrable (in the sense of Liouville) if there exist as many independent integrals of motion in involution as the dimension of the configuration space. Under certain regularity conditions, Liouville-Arnold theorem states that the invariant geometric structure associated with Liouville integrability is a fibration by Lagrangian tori (or, more generally, Abelian Lie groups), on which the motion is linear. In this paper, a Liouville-Arnold theorem for contact Hamiltonian systems is proven. More specifically, it is shown that, given a $(2n+1)$-dimensional completely integrable contact system, one can construct a foliation by $(n+1)$-dimensional Abelian Lie groups and induce action-angle coordinates in which the equations of motion are linearized. One important novelty with respect to previous attempts is that the foliation consists of $(n+1)$-dimensional coisotropic submanifolds given by the preimages of rays by the functions in involution. In order to prove the theorem, we first develop a version of Liouville-Arnold theorem for homogeneous functions on exact symplectic manifolds (which is of independent interest), and then apply the symplectization to obtain the contact case.</description>

      <title>Descent with algebraic structures for symplectic cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate and prove a chain level descent property of symplectic cohomology for involutive covers by compact subsets that take into account the natural algebraic structures that are present. The notion of an involutive cover is reviewed. We indicate the role that the statement plays in mirror symmetry.</description>

      <title>Small symplectic $4$-manifolds via contact gluing and some applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05932v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a streamlined procedure for constructing small symplectic $4$-manifolds via contact gluing, based on a technique invented by David Gay around 2000. We also give a few applications, ranging from embeddings of singular Lagrangian $RP^2$s to realizing an infinite family of lens spaces as a hypersurface of contact type in a symplectic Hirzebruch surface. Furthermore, our investigations on $S^1$-invariant contact structures also suggest an interesting and fairly strong upper bound for the self-intersection of a rational unicuspidal curve with one Puiseux pair $(p,q)$ in any algebraic surface (the bound depends only on the values of $(p,q)$).</description>
