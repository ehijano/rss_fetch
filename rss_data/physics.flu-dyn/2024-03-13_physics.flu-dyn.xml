      <title>Burns turbulent dispersion considers the dispersed phase as a passive scalar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Burns turbulent dispersion force is the most commonly used turbulent dispersion in the twofluid RANS bubbly-flow literature. However, its derivation is based on a series of hypothesis that are difficult to justify in industrial flows. It is shown that in low-void fraction vertical pipe flow, the Burns turbulent dispersion formulation is equivalent to considering the radial movement of the gas phase like a passive scalar that follows turbulent eddies. This is not apparent in the derivation of the force. As bubbles in pressurized water reactor (PWR) conditions have a low Stokes number ($\sim$ 10--1), considering bubbles are transported by turbulence is a good approximation for bubble dispersion in pipe flow. Therefore, the Burns turbulent dispersion force is appropriate to represent bubble dispersion in low-void fraction PWR flows.</description>

      <title>Turbulence from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a first-principles approach to turbulence by employing the electrodynamics of continuous media at the viscous limit to recover the Navier-Stokes equations. We treat oscillators with two orthogonal angular momenta as a spin network with properties applicable to the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theorem. The microscopic viscous limit has an irreducible representation that includes $O(3)$ expansion terms for a radiation-dominated fluid with a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric, equivalent to an oriented toroidal de Sitter space. The turbulence solution in $\mathbb{R}^{3,1}$ lies on 6-choose-3 de Sitter intersections of three orthogonal $n$-tori.</description>

      <title>High energy dissipation rates from the impingement of free paper-thin sheets of liquids: Determination of the volume of the energy dissipation zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The micromixing time of impinging thin liquid sheets depends upon the energy dissipation rate. The kinetic energy released by the impingement has been previously studied and was found to be a function of the coefficient of restitution of the collision. In this work, the volume within which the released kinetic energy is dissipated was investigated. The volume of energy dissipation was determined by measuring the time required for the velocity of the single sheet (prior to the collision) to be reduced to the velocity in the mixed sheet (after the collision). Although different, the velocity in single sheets and the velocity in mixed sheets have been previously shown to be constant. High-speed video was used to measure the velocity of features, generated in the front single sheet, as they passed through the impingement zone and into the mixed sheet. The experimental results showed that the time required for the velocity change was approximately equal to the residence time of liquid in the impingement zone. A new equation for the energy dissipation rate was developed and compared with the energy dissipation rate derived from turbulence energy-cascade theory. This comparison showed that the large-eddy turnover time was approximately equal to the residence time in the impingement zone; a result that is in accordance with the notion from turbulence energy-cascade theory that large, energy-containing eddies lose their energy within approximately one large-eddy turnover time. Within the impingement zone, the large-eddy kinetic energy was found to decay exponentially with time.</description>

      <title>Generalised Taylor dispersion of chiral microswimmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport phenomena of microswimmers in fluid flows play a crucial role in various biological processes, including bioconvection and cell sorting. In this paper, we investigate the dispersion behavior of chiral microswimmers in a simple shear flow utilizing the generalized Taylor dispersion (GTD) theory, motivated by biased locomotion of bacterial swimmers known as bacterial rheotaxis. We thus focus on the influence of shear-induced torque effects due to particle chirality, employing an extended Jeffery equation for individual deterministic dynamics. We then numerically calculate macroscopic parameters including averaged swimming velocity and effective diffusion tensor using spherical harmonic expansion, and argue the obtained results based on the fixed points and their stability of the orientational dynamical systems. Our results reveal that chiral effects induce biased locomotion and we observe qualitative transitions in the orientational distribution with increasing Pecl\'et number, aligning with previous experimental findings. The diffusion tensor analysis highlights significant reduction in the diffusion coefficient perpendicular to the flow plane due to chirality. This suggests potential applications in flow-mediated cell separation and we numerically demonstrate such chirality-induced fluid transportation. The presented methods will be useful in predicting and controlling dispersion behaviors of such chiral microswimmers.</description>

      <title>Direct numerical simulation of transition under free-stream turbulence and the influence of large integral length scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under action of free-stream turbulence (FST), elongated streamwise streaky structures are generated inside the boundary layer, and their amplitude and wavelength are crucial for the transition onset. While turbulence intensity is strongly correlated with the transitional Reynolds number, characteristic length scales of the FST are often considered to have a slight impact on the transition location. However, a recent experiment by Fransson &amp; Shahinfar (2020} shows significant effects of FST scales. They found that, for higher free-stream turbulence levels and larger integral length scales, an increase in the length scale postpones transition, contrary to established literature. Here, we aim at understanding these results by performing a series of high-fidelity simulations. These results provide understanding why the FST integral length scale affects the transition location differently. These integral length scales are so large that the wide streaks introduced in the boundary layer have substantially lower growth in the laminar region upstream of the transition to turbulence, than streaks induced by smaller integral length scales. The energy in the boundary layer subsequently propagate to smaller spanwise scales as a result of the non-linear interaction. When the energy has reached smaller spanwise scales larger amplitude streaks results in regions where the streak growth are larger. It takes longer for the energy from the wider streaks to propagate to the spanwise scales associated with the breakdown to turbulence, than for the those with smaller spanwise scales. Thus there is a faster transition for FST with lower integral length scales in this case.</description>

      <title>On the selection of Saffman-Taylor viscous fingers for divergent flow in a wedge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study self-similar viscous fingering for the case of divergent flow within a wedge-shaped Hele-Shaw cell. Previous authors have conjectured the existence of a countably-infinite number of selected solutions, each distinguished by a different value of the relative finger angle. Interestingly, the associated solution branches have been posited to merge and disappear in pairs as the surface tension decreases. We demonstrate how exponential asymptotics is used to derive the selection mechanism. In addition, asymptotic predictions of the finger-to-wedge angle are given for different sized wedges and surface-tension values. The merging of solution branches is explained; this feature is qualitatively different to the case of classic Saffman-Taylor viscous fingering in a parallel channel configuration. The phenomena of branch merging in our self-similar problem relates to tip splitting instabilities in time-dependent flows in a circular geometry, where the viscous fingers destabilise and divide in two.</description>

      <title>Bubble breakup probability in turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bubbles drive gas and chemical transfers in various industrial and geophysical context, in which flows are typically turbulent. A knowledge of the bubble size distributions is then necessary to quantify mass fluxes across interfaces. In a turbulent flow, every bubble might break, depending on both the ratio between inertial and capillary forces at its scale, namely the Weber number We. For inhomogeneous and unstationary flows, the residence time within a turbulent region will also determine the break-up probability. In this work, we use a stochastic linear model, whose parameters have been measured using direct numerical simulations, to infer the breakup probability of bubbles in turbulence as function of the Weber number and the residence time. Our model shows that bubble breakup is a memoryless process, whose breakup rate varies exponentially with $\textrm{We}^{-1}$. This linear model successfully reproduces breakup rates previously measured experimentally.</description>

      <title>DrivAerNet: A Parametric Car Dataset for Data-Driven Aerodynamic Design and Graph-Based Drag Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces DrivAerNet, a large-scale high-fidelity CFD dataset of 3D industry-standard car shapes, and RegDGCNN, a dynamic graph convolutional neural network model, both aimed at aerodynamic car design through machine learning. DrivAerNet, with its 4000 detailed 3D car meshes using 0.5 million surface mesh faces and comprehensive aerodynamic performance data comprising of full 3D pressure, velocity fields, and wall-shear stresses, addresses the critical need for extensive datasets to train deep learning models in engineering applications. It is 60\% larger than the previously available largest public dataset of cars, and is the only open-source dataset that also models wheels and underbody. RegDGCNN leverages this large-scale dataset to provide high-precision drag estimates directly from 3D meshes, bypassing traditional limitations such as the need for 2D image rendering or Signed Distance Fields (SDF). By enabling fast drag estimation in seconds, RegDGCNN facilitates rapid aerodynamic assessments, offering a substantial leap towards integrating data-driven methods in automotive design. Together, DrivAerNet and RegDGCNN promise to accelerate the car design process and contribute to the development of more efficient vehicles. To lay the groundwork for future innovations in the field, the dataset and code used in our study are publicly accessible at \url{https://github.com/Mohamedelrefaie/DrivAerNet}</description>

      <title>Can physical information aid the generalization ability of Neural Networks for hydraulic modeling?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Application of Neural Networks to river hydraulics is fledgling, despite the field suffering from data scarcity, a challenge for machine learning techniques. Consequently, many purely data-driven Neural Networks proved to lack predictive capabilities. In this work, we propose to mitigate such problem by introducing physical information into the training phase. The idea is borrowed from Physics-Informed Neural Networks which have been recently proposed in other contexts. Physics-Informed Neural Networks embed physical information in the form of the residual of the Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) governing the phenomenon and, as such, are conceived as neural solvers, i.e. an alternative to traditional numerical solvers. Such approach is seldom suitable for environmental hydraulics, where epistemic uncertainties are large, and computing residuals of PDEs exhibits difficulties similar to those faced by classical numerical methods. Instead, we envisaged the employment of Neural Networks as neural operators, featuring physical constraints formulated without resorting to PDEs. The proposed novel methodology shares similarities with data augmentation and regularization. We show that incorporating such soft physical information can improve predictive capabilities.</description>

      <title>Learning Closed-form Equations for Subgrid-scale Closures from High-fidelity Data: Promises and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is growing interest in discovering interpretable, closed-form equations for subgrid-scale (SGS) closures/parameterizations of complex processes in Earth systems. Here, we apply a common equation-discovery technique with expansive libraries to learn closures from filtered direct numerical simulations of 2D turbulence and Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC). Across common filters (e.g., Gaussian, box), we robustly discover closures of the same form for momentum and heat fluxes. These closures depend on nonlinear combinations of gradients of filtered variables, with constants that are independent of the fluid/flow properties and only depend on filter type/size. We show that these closures are the nonlinear gradient model (NGM), which is derivable analytically using Taylor-series. Indeed, we suggest that with common (physics-free) equation-discovery algorithms, for many common systems/physics, discovered closures are consistent with the leading term of the Taylor-series (except when cutoff filters are used). Like previous studies, we find that large-eddy simulations with NGM closures are unstable, despite significant similarities between the true and NGM-predicted fluxes (correlations $&gt; 0.95$). We identify two shortcomings as reasons for these instabilities: in 2D, NGM produces zero kinetic energy transfer between resolved and subgrid scales, lacking both diffusion and backscattering. In RBC, potential energy backscattering is poorly predicted. Moreover, we show that SGS fluxes diagnosed from data, presumed the ''truth'' for discovery, depend on filtering procedures and are not unique. Accordingly, to learn accurate, stable closures in future work, we propose several ideas around using physics-informed libraries, loss functions, and metrics. These findings are relevant to closure modeling of any multi-scale system.</description>

      <title>Optimum control strategies for maximum thrust production in underwater undulatory swimming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fish, cetaceans and many other aquatic vertebrates undulate their bodies to propel themselves through water. Numerous studies on natural, artificial or analogous swimmers are dedicated to revealing the links between the kinematics of body oscillation and the production of thrust for swimming. One of the most open and difficult questions concerns the best kinematics to maximize this later quantity for given constraints and how a system strategizes and adjusts its internal parameters to reach this maximum. To address this challenge, we exploit a biomimetic robotic swimmer to determine the control signal that produces the highest thrust. Using machine learning techniques and intuitive models, we find that this optimal control consists of a square wave function, whose frequency is fixed by the interplay between the internal dynamics of the swimmer and the fluid-structure interaction with the surrounding fluid. We then propose a simple implementation for autonomous robotic swimmers that requires no prior knowledge of systems or equations. This application to aquatic locomotion is validated by 2D numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Simulation of high-speed impact of surfactant-laden drops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a computational model to simulate the immediate post-impact spreading behaviour of surfactant-laden drops that impact a flat and solid surface. The model is built on the InterFoam solver (OpenFOAM software), which uses the volume-of-fluid method to solve the Navier-Stokes equations. In order to incorporate surfactant in the bulk and on the interface, we make numerous modifications and extensions, such as coupling the volume-of-fluid method with a level-set method. Simulations demonstrate the accumulation of surfactant in the vicinity of the moving contact line, especially during the formation of the rim. Gradients of surfactant at the liquid-air interface lead to Marangoni forces that oppose the drop spreading, while high-velocity impacts reduce the overall surface tension and increase the magnitude of Marangoni forces. Both of these phenomena, which tend to reduce the maximum spreading, are highly dependent on the surfactant properties. Our computational methodology expands the potential for utilising Computational Fluid Dynamics to model complex interfacial flows that involve surfactants, leading to various opportunities in the future.</description>

      <title>Monge-Ampere Geometry and Vortices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach to Monge-Ampere geometry based on techniques from higher symplectic geometry. Our work is motivated by the application of Monge-Ampere geometry to the Poisson equation for the pressure that arises for incompressible Navier-Stokes flows. Whilst this equation constitutes an elliptic problem for the pressure, it can also be viewed as a non-linear partial differential equation connecting the pressure, the vorticity, and the rate-of-strain. As such, it is a key diagnostic relation in the quest to understand the formation of vortices in turbulent flows. We study this equation via an associated (higher) Lagrangian submanifold in the cotangent bundle to the configuration space of the fluid. Using our definition of a (higher) Monge-Ampere structure, we study an associated metric on the cotangent bundle together with its pull-back to the (higher) Lagrangian submanifold. The signatures of these metrics are dictated by the relationship between vorticity and rate-of-strain, and their scalar curvatures can be interpreted in a physical context in terms of the accumulation of vorticity, strain, and their gradients. We show explicity, in the case of two-dimensional flows, how topological information can be derived from the Monge-Ampere geometry of the Lagrangian submanifold. We also demonstrate how certain solutions to the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, such as Hill's spherical vortex and an integrable case of Arnol'd-Beltrami-Childress flow, have symmetries that facilitate a formulation of these solutions from the perspective of (higher) symplectic reduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an implicit Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization for incompressible two-phase flows using an artificial compressibility formulation. The conservative level set (CLS) method is employed in combination with a reinitialization procedure to capture the moving interface. A projection method based on the L-stable TR-BDF2 method is adopted for the time discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations and of the level set method. Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) is employed to enhance the resolution in correspondence of the interface between the two fluids. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown in a number of classical benchmarks. A specific analysis on the influence of different choices of the mixture viscosity is also carried out.</description>

      <title>Deep learning modelling of manufacturing and build variations on multi-stage axial compressors aerodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04264v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Application of deep learning methods to physical simulations such as CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) for turbomachinery applications, have been so far of limited industrial relevance. This paper demonstrates the development and application of a deep learning framework for real-time predictions of the impact of manufacturing and build variations, such as tip clearance and surface roughness, on the flow field and aerodynamic performance of multi-stage axial compressors in gas turbines. The associated scatter in compressor efficiency is known to have a significant impact on the corresponding overall performance and emissions of the gas turbine, therefore posing a challenge of great industrial and environmental relevance. The proposed architecture is proven to achieve an accuracy comparable to that of the CFD benchmark, in real-time, for an industrially relevant application. The deployed model, is readily integrated within the manufacturing and build process of gas turbines, thus providing the opportunity to analytically assess the impact on performance and potentially reduce requirements for expensive physical tests.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a generalized hybrid method for both two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) surfactant dynamics. While the Navier-Stokes equations are solved by the Eulerian method, the surfactant transport is tracked by a Lagrangian particle method, in which the remeshing technique is employed to prevent particle clustering. For the mass redistribution during remeshing, the redistribution weight is selected with weighted least squares, which shares the theoretical basis of the moving least squares method (MLS) and enables the present hybrid method to work in both 2-D and 3-D cases. This optimized mass redistribution effectively strengthens the robustness of the present hybrid method, as validated by 2-D topological changes of the dumbbell. The conservation, accuracy, and convergence of the present hybrid method have also been validated with both 2-D and 3-D test cases, including a translation circle/sphere, a deformed circle/sphere in the shear flow, and droplet deformation.</description>
