      <title>Universal fragmentation in annihilation reactions with constrained kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In reaction-diffusion models of annihilation reactions in low dimensions, single-particle dynamics provides a bottleneck for reactions, leading to an anomalously slow approach to the empty state. Here, we construct a reaction model with a reciprocal bottleneck on particle dynamics where single-particle motion conserves the center of mass. We show that such a constrained reaction-diffusion dynamics does not approach an empty state but freezes at late times in a state with fragmented particle clusters, and that the late-time dynamics and asymptotic density are universal. Our setup thus constitutes a minimal model for the fragmentation of a one-dimensional lattice into independent particle clusters, and we provide exact results for the final density in the large-reaction rate limit. We suggest that the universal reaction dynamics could be observable in experiments with cold atoms or in the Auger recombination of exciton gases.</description>

      <title>Entropy production of run-and-tumble particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the entropy production in run-and-tumble models. After presenting the general formalism in the framework of the Fokker-Planck equations in one space dimension, we derive some known exact results in simple physical situations (free run-and-tumble particles and harmonic confinement). We then extend the calculation to the case of anisotropic motion (different speeds and tumbling rates for right and left oriented particles), obtaining exact expressions of the entropy production rate. We conclude by discussing the general case of heterogeneous run-and-tumble motion described by space-dependent parameters and extending the analysis to the case of d-dimensional motions.</description>

      <title>100+ years of colossal confusion on colloidal coagulation. Part I: Smoluchowski's work on absorbing boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A report by Brillouin (from Perrin's laboratory) on the rate of adsorption of `granules' to a glass plate [\textit{Ann. Chim. Phys.} 27 (1912) 412--23] prompted Marian von Smoluchowski (MvS) to interpret the data in terms of his newly developed theory of restricted Brownian motion. Placing an adsorbing wall at $x=0$, he modelled the particle concentration $n(x,t)$ as that solution of the diffusion equation which vanished at the wall, a boundary condition (BC) hereafter called SBC. A gaping discrepancy between his theory and Brillouin's data elicited a suggestion from MvS (that a particle might not adhere to the wall on every impact), but no further action -- other than that of applying his theory to spherically symmtric systems. In a paper written before, but published shortly after MvS's untimely death [\textit{Proc. Roy. Acad. Amst.} 20 (1918) 642--58], H. C. Burger erected a new and sturdier framework, which led him to an alternative BC, $D(\partial n/\partial x)_{x=0}=\varkappa n(0,t)$, applicable to a surface with an arbitrary absorption probability ($1\leq\varepsilon\leq 0$); a fallacy (that subsequently claimed more victims, including the present author) prevented him from deducing the correct expression for $\varkappa$. Burger's approach became ``The Road Not Taken'', while the SBC became the cornerstone of colloidal coagulation and bimoleculer reaction kinetics. Burger's approach (but not the ABC) was partly rediscovered by Kolmogorov, and used by Sveshnikov and Fuchs.The emended version of Burger's BC is shown here to coincide with that deduced from the Klein-Kramers equation [\textit{Phys. Rev. Lett.} \textbf{49} (1982) 304--07; \textit{J. Chem. Phys.} \textbf{78} (1983) 2710--12] and the Lorentz model of random flights [\textit{J. Phys. Chem.} \textbf{86} (1982) 4750--56].</description>

      <title>Enzymatic Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an autocatalytic aggregation model in which the rate at which two clusters merge to form a cluster is controlled by the presence of a third "enzymatic" cluster whose mass must equal to the mass of one of the reaction partners. The enzyme is unaffected by the joining event and is available to either participate in or catalyze subsequent reactions. This model is meant to mimic the self-replicating reactions that occur in models for the origin of life. We solve the kinetics of enzymatic aggregation in the model with mass-independent rates and show that the total cluster density decays as $t^{-1/3}$, while the density of clusters of any fixed mass decays as $t^{-2/3}$. These behaviors contrast with the corresponding $t^{-1}$ and $t^{-2}$ scalings for classic aggregation. We extend our model to mass-dependent reaction rates, to situations where only "magic" mass clusters can catalyze reactions, and to include steady monomer input.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and Dynamic Stability: Extended Theories of Heat Conduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental dynamic stability of heat conduction theories beyond Fourier is analyzed in the framework of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. It is shown, that the thermodynamic framework, concave entropy and nonnegative entropy production, can ensure the stability of homogeneous thermodynamic equilibrium. Various special heat conduction theories of Extended Thermodynamics are compared and analysed in the general framework.</description>

      <title>Canonical vs. Grand Canonical Ensemble for Bosonic Gases under Harmonic Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the general relation between canonical and grand canonical ensembles in the thermodynamic limit. We begin our discussion by deriving, with an alternative approach, some standard results first obtained by Kac and coworkers in the late 1970s. Then, motivated by the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of trapped gases with a fixed number of atoms, which is well described by the canonical ensemble and by the recent groundbreaking experimental realization of BEC with photons in a dye-filled optical micro-cavity under genuine grand canonical conditions, we apply our formalism to a system of non-interacting Bose particles confined in a two-dimensional harmonic trap. We discuss in detail the mathematical origin of the inequivalence of ensembles observed in the condensed phase, giving place to the so-called grand canonical catastrophe of density fluctuations. We also provide explicit analytical expressions for the internal energy and specific heat and compare them with available experimental data. For these quantities, we show the equivalence of ensembles in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>On sequences of convex records in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convex records have an appealing purely geometric definition. In a sequence of $d$-dimensional data points, the $n$-th point is a convex record if it lies outside the convex hull of all preceding points. We specifically focus on the bivariate (i.e., two-dimensional) setting. For iid (independent and identically distributed) points, we establish an identity relating the mean number $\mean{R_n}$ of convex records up to time $n$ to the mean number $\mean{N_n}$ of vertices in the convex hull of the first $n$ points. By combining this identity with extensive numerical simulations, we provide a comprehensive overview of the statistics of convex records for various examples of iid data points in the plane: uniform points in the square and in the disk, Gaussian points and points with an isotropic power-law distribution. In all these cases, the mean values and variances of $N_n$ and $R_n$ grow proportionally to each other, resulting in finite limit Fano factors $F_N$ and $F_R$. We also consider planar random walks, i.e., sequences of points with iid increments. For both the Pearson walk in the continuum and the P\'olya walk on a lattice, we characterise the growth of the mean number $\mean{R_n}$ of convex records and demonstrate that the ratio $R_n/\mean{R_n}$ keeps fluctuating with a universal limit distribution.</description>

      <title>Cattaneo--type subdiffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ordinary subdiffusion equation, with fractional time derivatives of at most first order, describes a process in which the propagation velocity of diffusing molecules is unlimited. To avoid this non-physical property the Cattaneo diffusion equation has been proposed. Compared to the ordinary subdiffusion equation, the Cattaneo equation contains an additional time derivative of order greater than one and less than or equal to two. The fractional order of the additional derivative depends on the subdiffusion exponent. We study a Cattaneo-type subdiffusion equation (CTSE) that differs from the ordinary subdiffusion equation by an additional integro--differential operator (AO) which may be independent of subdiffusion parameters. The AO describes processes affecting ordinary subdiffusion. The equation is derived combining the modified diffusive flux equation with the continuity equation. It can also be obtained within the continuous time random walk model with the waiting time distribution for the molecule to jump controlled by the kernel of AO. As examples, the CTSEs with the additional Caputo fractional time derivative of the order independent of the subdiffusion exponent and with the AO generated by a slowly varying function are considered. We discuss whether the ordinary subdiffusion equation and CTSE provide qualitative differences in the description of subdiffusion.</description>

      <title>Amplitude responses of swarmalators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Swarmalators are entities that swarm through space and sync in time and are potentially considered to replicate the complex dynamics of many real-world systems. So far, the internal dynamics of swarmalators have been taken as a phase oscillator inspired by the Kuramoto model. Here, for the first time, we examine the internal dynamics utilizing an amplitude oscillator capable of exhibiting periodic and chaotic behaviors. To incorporate the dual interplay between spatial and internal dynamics, we propose a general model that keeps the properties of swarmalators intact. This adaptation calls for a detailed study which we present in this paper. We establish our study with the Rossler oscillator by taking parameters from both the chaotic and periodic regions. While the periodic oscillator mimics most of the patterns in the previous phase oscillator model, the chaotic oscillator brings some new fascinating states.</description>

      <title>Stable Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases in Systems with Heralded Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a family of local quantum channels whose steady-states exhibit stable mixed-state symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order. Motivated by recent experimental progress on "erasure conversion" techniques that allow one to identify (\emph{herald}) decoherence processes, we consider open systems with biased erasure noise, which leads to strongly symmetric heralded errors. We utilize this heralding to construct a local correction protocol that effectively confines errors into short-ranged pairs in the steady-state. Using a combination of numerical simulations and mean-field analysis, we show that our protocol stabilizes SPT order against a sufficiently low rate of decoherence. As the rate of heralded noise increases, SPT order is eventually lost through a directed percolation transition. We further find that while introducing unheralded errors destroys SPT order in the limit of long length- and time-scales, the correction protocol is sufficient for ensuring that local SPT order persists, with a correlation length that diverges as $\xi \sim (1-f_e)^{-1/2}$, where $f_e$ is the fraction of errors that are heralded.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping the Abelian Lattice Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $U(1)$ Abelian lattice gauge theories using a bootstrap method, in which the loop equations and positivity conditions are employed for Wilson loops with lengths $L\leqslant L_{\textrm{max}}$ to derive two-sided bounds on the Wilson loop averages. We address a fundamental question that whether the constraints from loop equations and positivity are strong enough to solve lattice gauge theories. We answer this question by bootstrapping the 2D $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory. We show that with sufficiently large $L_{\textrm{max}}=60$, the two-sided bounds provide estimates for the plaquette averages with precision near $10^{-8}$ or even higher, suggesting the bootstrap constraints are sufficient to numerically pin down this theory. We compute the bootstrap bounds on the plaquette averages in the 3D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $U(1)$ lattice gauge theories with $L_{\textrm{max}}=16$. In the regions with weak or strong coupling, the two-sided bootstrap bounds converge quickly and coincide with the perturbative results to high precision. The bootstrap bounds are well consistent with the Monte Carlo results in the nonperturbative region. We observe interesting connections between the bounds generated by the bootstrap computations and the Griffiths' inequalities. We present results towards bootstrapping the string tension and glueball mass in Abelian lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Analytical derivation and expansion of the anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling in the transverse field Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A defect density which quantifies the deviation from the spin ground state characterizes non-equilibrium dynamics during phase transitions. The widely recognized Kibble-Zurek scaling predicts how the defect density evolves during phase transitions. However, it can be perturbed by noise, leading to anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling. In this research, we analytically investigate the effect of Gaussian white noise on the transition probabilities of the Landau-Zener model. We apply this model to the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model and derive an analytical approximation for the defect density. Our analysis reveals that under small noise conditions, the model follows an anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling. As the noise increases, a new scaling behavior emerges, showing higher accuracy than previously reported. Furthermore, we identify the parameters that optimize the defect density based on the new scaling. This allows for the refinement of optimized parameters with greater precision and provides further validations of previously established scaling.</description>

      <title>Large-scale atomistic study of plasticity in amorphous gallium oxide with a machine-learning potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compared to the widely investigated crystalline polymorphs of gallium oxide (Ga2O3), knowledge about its amorphous state is still limited. With the help of a machine-learning interatomic potential, we conducted large-scale atomistic simulations to investigate the glass transition and mechanical behavior of amorphous Ga2O3 (a-Ga2O3). During the quenching simulations, amorphization of gallium oxide melt is observed at ultrahigh cooling rates, including a distinct glass transition. The final densities at room temperature have up to 4% variance compared to experiments. The glass transition temperature is evaluated to range from 1234 K to 1348 K at different cooling rates. Structural analysis of the amorphous structure shows evident similarities in structural properties between a-Ga2O3 and amorphous alumina (a-Al2O3), such as radial distribution function, coordination distribution, and bond angle distribution. An amorphous gallium oxide structure that contains approximately one million atoms is prepared for the tension simulation. A highly plastic behavior is observed at room temperature in the tension simulations, comparable to amorphous alumina. With quantitative characterization methods, we show that a-Ga2O3 can possibly has a higher nucleation rate of localized plastic strain events compared to a-Al2O3, which can increase the material's resistance to shear banding formation during deformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the higher-order tensor renormalization group method to study the two-dimensional generalized XY model that admits integer and half-integer vortices. This model is the deformation of the classical XY model and has a rich phase structure consisting of nematic, ferromagnetic, and disordered phases and three transition lines belonging to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless and Ising class. We explore the model for a wide range of temperatures, $T$, and the deformation parameter, $\Delta$, and compute specific heat along with integer and half-integer magnetic susceptibility, finding both BKT-like and Ising-like transitions and the region where they meet.</description>

Abstract: We propose a quantum Monte Carlo algorithm capable of simulating the Bose-Hubbard model on arbitrary graphs, obviating the need for devising lattice-specific updates for different input graphs. We show that with our method, which is based on the recently introduced Permutation Matrix Representation Quantum Monte Carlo [Gupta, Albash and Hen, J. Stat. Mech. (2020) 073105], the problem of adapting the simulation to a given geometry amounts to generating a cycle basis for the graph on which the model is defined, a procedure that can be carried out efficiently and and in an automated manner. To showcase the versatility of our approach, we provide simulation results for Bose-Hubbard models defined on two-dimensional lattices as well as on a number of random graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The most common gene regulation mechanism is when a protein binds to a regulatory sequence to change RNA transcription. However, these sequences are short relative to the genome length, so finding them poses a challenging search problem. This paper presents two mathematical frameworks capturing different aspects of this problem. First, we study the interplay between diffusional flux through a target where the searching proteins get sequestered on DNA far from the target because of non-specific interactions. From this model, we derive a simple formula for the optimal protein-DNA unbinding rate, maximizing the particle flux. Second, we study how the flux flows through a target on a single antenna with variable length. Here, we identify a non-trivial logarithmic correction to the linear behavior relative to the target size proposed by Smoluchowski's flux formula.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Third Law of Thermodynamics</title>

Abstract: The extended Third Law of thermodynamics for nonequilibrium jump processes is studied in previous collaborative papers (Kh et al.,2023) \cite{nernst, SM}, where the nonequilibrium heat capacity and the excess heat with the corresponding quasipotential are introduced. The extended Third Law states that the nonequilibrium heat capacity vanishes under two conditions as the temperature approaches zero. The current paper presents a concise overview of key papers addressing the nonequilibrium calorimetry and the nonequilibrium Nernst postulate (the nonequilibrium Third Law of thermodynamics). The quasipotential is a crucial quantity to calculate the nonequilibrium heat capacity. The new result presented in this work includes an interpretation of the quasipotential in terms of the mean time taken by the Markov jump process, starting from a given state, to reach other states for the first time.</description>

      <title>Beyond Linear Response: Equivalence between Thermodynamic Geometry and Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01286v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental result of thermodynamic geometry is that the optimal, minimal-work protocol that drives a nonequilibrium system between two thermodynamic states in the slow-driving limit is given by a geodesic of the friction tensor, a Riemannian metric defined on control space. For overdamped dynamics in arbitrary dimensions, we demonstrate that thermodynamic geometry is equivalent to $L^2$ optimal transport geometry defined on the space of equilibrium distributions corresponding to the control parameters. We show that obtaining optimal protocols past the slow-driving or linear response regime is computationally tractable as the sum of a friction tensor geodesic and a counterdiabatic term related to the Fisher information metric. These geodesic-counterdiabatic optimal protocols are exact for parameteric harmonic potentials, reproduce the surprising non-monotonic behavior recently discovered in linearly-biased double well optimal protocols, and explain the ubiquitous discontinuous jumps observed at the beginning and end times.</description>

      <title>Exact Floquet flat band and heating suppression via two-rate drive protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of exact Floquet flat bands implying strong violation of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in a large class of closed quantum many-body systems in the presence of a two-rate drive characterized by frequencies $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2=\nu \Omega_1$. We provide the exact analytic condition for this phenomenon to occur for a generic protocol; in particular, $\nu=(2p+1)$, where $p$ is an integer, leads to such flat bands for both square-pulse and cosine drive protocols for arbitrary $\Omega_1$. In the vicinity of these points, heating is suppressed up to very long timescales in such driven systems, leading to a prethermal regime; we demonstrate this by exact numerical studies of distribution and bandwidth of the Floquet eigenstates, spectral form factor, entanglement entropy, and correlation functions of an experimentally realizable finite driven Rydberg chain. The corresponding micromotion exhibits coherent reversal of excitations reminiscent of echoes. Our analysis constitutes a yet unexplored mechanism for heating suppression in driven closed quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Tuning Higher Order Structure in Colloidal Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Colloidal particles self assemble into a wide range of structures under external AC electric fields due to induced dipolar interactions [Yethiraj and Van Blaaderen Nature 421 513 (2003)]. As a result of these dipolar interactions, at low volume fraction the system is modulated between a hard-sphere like state (in the case of zero applied field) and a "string fluid" upon application of the field. Using both particle-resolved experiments and Brownian dynamics simulations, we investigate the emergence of the string fluid with a variety of structural measures including two-body and higher-order correlations. The higher-order structure we probe using three-body spatial correlation functions and a many-body approach based on minimum energy clusters of a dipolar-Lennard-Jones system. This yields a series of geometrically distinct minimum energy clusters upon increasing the strength of the dipolar interaction, which are echoed in the higher-order structure of the colloidal fluids we study here. We find good agreement between experiment and simulation at the two-body level, although some discrepancies are found at higher field strength, where the system falls out of equilibrium. Higher-order correlations exhibit reasonable agreement between experiment and simulation, again with more discrepancy at higher field strength for three--body correlation functions. At higher field strength, the cluster population in our experiments and simulations is dominated by the minimum energy clusters for all sizes $8 \leq m \leq 12$. The agreement that we find here is notable considering that there is no fit parameter in our mapping between experiment and simulation.</description>

      <title>Chiral basis for qubits and spin-helix decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14056v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a qubit basis composed of transverse spin helices with kinks. Unlike the usual computational basis, this chiral basis is well suited for describing quantum states with nontrivial topology. Choosing appropriate parameters the operators of the transverse spin components, $\sigma_n^x$ and $\sigma_n^y$, become diagonal in the chiral basis, which facilitates the study of problems focused on transverse spin components. As an application, we study the temporal decay of the transverse polarization of a spin helix in the XX model that has been measured in recent cold atom experiments. We obtain an explicit universal function describing the relaxation of helices of arbitrary wavelength.</description>

      <title>Effective Action for Dissipative and Nonholonomic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the action of a dynamical system can be supplemented by an effective action for its environment to reproduce arbitrary coordinate dependent ohmic dissipation and gyroscopic forces. The action is a generalization of the harmonic bath model and describes a set of massless interacting scalar fields in an auxiliary space coupled to the original system at the boundary. A certain limit of the model implements nonholonomic constraints. In the case of dynamics with nonlinearly realized symmetries the effective action takes the form of a two-dimensional nonlinear sigma-model. It provides a basis for application of path integral methods to general dissipative and nonholonomic systems.</description>

      <title>Emergent topological ordered phase for the Ising-XY Model revealed by cluster-updating Monte-Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20314v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two-component cold atom systems with anisotropic hopping amplitudes can be phenomenologically described by a two-dimensional Ising-XY coupled model with spatial anisotropy. At low temperatures, theoretical predictions [Phys. Rev. A 72, 053604 (2005)] and [arXiv:0706.1609] indicate the existence of a topological ordered phase characterized by Ising and XY disorder but with 2XY ordering. However, due to ergodic difficulties faced by Monte Carlo methods at low temperatures, this topological phase has not been numerically explored. We propose a linear cluster updating Monte Carlo method, which flips spins without rejection in the anisotropy limit but does not change the energy. Using this scheme and conventional Monte Carlo methods, we succeed in revealing the nature of topological phases with half-vortices and domain walls. In the constructed global phase diagram, Ising and XY type transitions are very close to each other and differ significantly from the schematic phase diagram reported earlier. We also propose and explore a wide range of quantities, including magnetism, superfluidity, specific heat, susceptibility, and even percolation susceptibility, and obtain consistent results. Furthermore, we observe first-order transitions characterized by common intersection points in magnetizations for different system sizes, as opposed to the conventional phase transition where Binder cumulants of various sizes share common intersections. The results are useful to help cold atom experiments explore the half-vortex topological phase.</description>

      <title>Transition from topological to chaos in the nonlinear Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies on topological materials are expanding into the nonlinear regime, while the central principle, namely the bulk-edge correspondence, is yet to be elucidated in the strongly nonlinear regime. Here, we reveal that nonlinear topological edge modes can exhibit the transition to spatial chaos by increasing nonlinearity, which can be a universal mechanism of the breakdown of the bulk-edge correspondence. Specifically, we unveil the underlying dynamical system describing the spatial distribution of zero modes and show the emergence of chaos. We also propose the correspondence between the absolute value of the topological invariant and the dimension of the stable manifold under sufficiently weak nonlinearity. Our results provide a general guiding principle to investigate the nonlinear bulk-edge correspondence that can potentially be extended to arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Localization in the Age of Classical Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical mechanics provides a framework for describing the physics of large, complex many-body systems using only a few macroscopic parameters to determine the state of the system. For isolated quantum many-body systems, such a description is achieved via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which links thermalization, ergodicity and quantum chaotic behavior. However, tendency towards thermalization is not observed at finite system sizes and evolution times in a robust many-body localization (MBL) regime found numerically and experimentally in the dynamics of interacting many-body systems at strong disorder. Although the phenomenology of the MBL regime is well-established, the central question remains unanswered: under what conditions does the MBL regime give rise to an MBL phase in which the thermalization does not occur even in the asymptotic limit of infinite system size and evolution time?
  This review focuses on recent numerical investigations aiming to clarify the status of the MBL phase, and it establishes the critical open questions about the dynamics of disordered many-body systems. Persistent finite size drifts towards ergodicity consistently emerge in spectral properties of disordered many-body systems, excluding naive single-parameter scaling hypothesis and preventing comprehension of the status of the MBL phase. The drifts are related to tendencies towards thermalization and non-vanishing transport observed in the dynamics of many-body systems, even at strong disorder. These phenomena impede understanding of microscopic processes at the ETH-MBL crossover. Nevertheless, the abrupt slowdown of dynamics with increasing disorder strength suggests the proximity of the MBL phase. This review concludes that the questions about thermalization and its failure in disordered many-body systems remain a captivating area open for further explorations.</description>

      <title>Scaled Brownian motion with random anomalous diffusion exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scaled Brownian motion (SBM) is regarded as one of the paradigmatic random processes, featuring the anomalous diffusion property characterized by the diffusion exponent. It is a Gaussian, self-similar process with independent increments, which has found applications across various fields, from turbulence and stochastic hydrology to biophysics. In our paper, inspired by recent single particle tracking biological experiments, we introduce a process termed the scaled Brownian motion with random exponent (SBMRE), which preserves SBM characteristics at the level of individual trajectories, albeit with randomly varying anomalous diffusion exponents across the trajectories. We discuss the main probabilistic properties of SBMRE, including its probability density function (pdf), and the q-th absolute moment. Additionally, we present the expected value of the time-averaged mean squared displacement (TAMSD) and the ergodicity breaking parameter. Furthermore, we analyze the pdf of the first hitting time in a semi-infinite domain, the martingale property of SBMRE, and its stochastic exponential. As special cases, we consider two distributions of the anomalous diffusion exponent, namely the two-point and beta distributions, and discuss the asymptotics of the presented characteristics in such cases. Theoretical results for SBMRE are validated through numerical simulations and compared with the corresponding characteristics for SBM.</description>
