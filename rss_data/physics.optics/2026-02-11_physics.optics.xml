      <title>Optimising Microwave Cavities for nonzero Helicity with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a machine-learning-driven inverse design framework for systematically engineering three-dimensional microwave cavity resonators that support modes with nonzero electromagnetic helicity. In contrast to heuristic approaches to cavity design, helicity maximisation is formulated as a boundary-shape optimisation problem, enabling systematic exploration of complex boundary-shape parameter spaces and the identification of high-helicity designs that are difficult to predict using heuristic design rules alone. We applied this framework to several cavity families composed of smooth, edge-free components, including globally twisted cavities with control-point-defined cross-sections realised in both linear and ring configurations, cavities defined by the intersection of orthogonal prisms, sphere-subtracted cylindrical cavities, and parametrised surface resonators. Two gradient-free optimisation strategies, a genetic algorithm and Bayesian optimisation, were independently employed to explore compact sets of design parameters for these geometries and to optimise a scaled-helicity figure of merit for the dominant helical mode, evaluated via finite-element eigenmode analysis. Robustness to manufacturing tolerances was quantified by applying Gaussian geometric perturbations to the optimised cavities and evaluating statistical robustness metrics that penalise sensitivity to geometric variation.</description>

      <title>Lithium niobate quadratic integrated nonlinear photonics: enabling ultra-wide bandwidth and ultrafast photonic engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated photonic coherent light sources capable of generating emission with broad spectral coverage and ultrashort pulse durations are critical for both fundamental science and emerging technologies. In this Perspective, we start by discussing emerging quantum and classical photonic applications from the standpoint of operating wavelength and timescale, highlighting the technological gaps that persist in current integrated photonic light sources. Next, we introduce the unique properties of lithium niobate-based integrated quadratic nonlinear photonics, and discuss several promising strategies that exploit this platform to realize wavelength-tunable continuous wave light sources and broadband, ultra-short light pulse generation. We also assessed their advantages and limitations while discussing potential solutions. Finally, we outline future prospects and challenges that need to be addressed, aiming at inspiring continued research and innovation in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Launching of Visible-Range Hyperbolic Polaritons by Gold Nanoantennas in a natural van der Waals crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic van der Waals materials provide a powerful platform for nanoscale optoelectronics, enabling strong light$-$matter interaction and deep electromagnetic field confinement mediated by polaritons, hybrid light$-$matter excitations with unique dispersion properties. While polaritonic phenomena in van der Waals heterostructures have been extensively explored in the mid-infrared frequency range, their behaviour at the visible frequencies remains largely unexplored, in part due to the lack of knowledge on natural materials supporting anisotropic and highly confined visible-range polaritons. In this context, MoOCl$_2$, an anisotropic van der Waals metal, is particularly interesting, since it supports hyperbolic plasmon polaritons (PPs) that enable directional propagation and subwavelength light compression. Here, we investigate the strategy for launching anisotropic PPs in MoOCl$_2$ in the visible frequency range using gold rod nanoantennas. The nanoantennas, placed on top of the MoOCl$_2$ crystal, excite in-plane anisotropic PP modes, effectively overcoming the momentum mismatch between waves in free-space and nanoscale PPs. We demonstrate a strong electromagnetic field confinement, angle-dependent absorption, and controlled anisotropic PP launching enabled by gold nanoantennas, highlighting the potential of MoOCl$_2$ as a compact platform for nanoscale waveguiding and optical signal processing. By providing a practical antenna-based strategy for exciting visible-range PPs, this work addresses the lack of compact elements for optical signal manipulation and opens new opportunities for optoelectronic devices based on van der Waals polaritonics.</description>

      <title>MoOCl$_2$ as a Hyperbolic Planar Platform for Nanooptics at Telecom Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-chip optoelectronics is fundamental to modern telecommunication, yet the diffraction limit of light remains a major obstacle to the extreme miniaturization of photonic integrated circuits (PICs). Hyperbolic polaritons (HPs) $-$ hybrid light-matter excitations in materials with opposite-signed dielectric permittivity tensor components $-$ offer a solution through their ability to support deep sub-wavelength confinement and unique optical phenomena such as canalization and negative refraction. To date, however, the most widely studied hyperbolic van der Waals (vdW) crystals, including hBN and $\alpha$-MoO$_3$, operate mainly in the mid-infrared, leaving the telecommunication bands (1260$-$1675 nm) largely uncovered. Here, we predict HPs operating directly in the telecommunication window in the vdW crystal molybdenum oxychloride (MoOCl$_2$). Building on recent evidence that MoOCl$_2$ can support plasmon polaritons in the visible, we theoretically investigate its optical response at telecom wavelengths and identify the conditions under which strongly confined, canalized HPs modes emerge. Beyond establishing a telecom platform, we outline device-level opportunities enabled by these modes, including diffraction-free waveguides based on canalization, tunable polaritonic crystals, and high-efficiency spontaneous emission-enhancement platforms. These paradigms cover the essential pillars of on-chip information processing: emission, propagation, modulation and detection. Our results establish MoOCl$_2$ as a potentially transformative material that bridges physics of hyperbolic PPs with potential practical implementations, opening avenues for ultra-compact, high-density, and low-power photonic components.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Curved Beams at Terahertz Frequencies Using Inverse-Designed Bilayer Diffractive Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curved electromagnetic beams at terahertz (THz) frequencies have recently emerged as a powerful example of wavefront engineering, with applications in imaging and high-capacity wireless communications. Unlike canonical self-accelerating solutions such as Airy beams, general curved-beam propagation enables arbitrary, application-specific trajectories that are not constrained by analytic beam families. Here, we demonstrate a passive and reconfigurable approach for generating trajectory-engineered THz curved beams using inverse-designed bilayer diffractive optical elements (DOEs). Two phase-only diffractive layers are optimized using gradient-based inverse design to produce predetermined curved propagation paths. Reconfiguration is achieved by a 180{\deg} rotation of the second layer, which modifies the effective phase profile of the cascaded structure without altering the incident wave or individual layer designs. The proposed system can produce distinct curved trajectories with controlled transverse displacement and beam confinement, as confirmed by scalar diffraction simulations and experimental measurements. Overall, this work establishes inverse-designed cascaded DOEs as a compact and scalable platform for reconfigurable trajectory control of THz beams, providing a flexible alternative to analytic self-accelerating beams for radiative near-field THz communications.</description>

      <title>Micromolar chemical imaging by high-energy low-photodamage Coherent Anti-stokes Raman Scattering (HELP-CARS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy offers label-free chemical imaging capabilities, but its performance is constrained by small Raman scattering cross-section, strong non-resonant background (NRB), and limited signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Here, we introduce a high-energy, low-photodamage CARS (HELP-CARS) platform designed to overcome these physical limitations. By employing a 1-MHz non-collinear optical parametric amplifier (NOPA) with extensive pulse chirping, HELP-CARS increases the coherent Raman excitation efficiency by ~300 times and improves the signal-to-nonresonant background ratio by 11 times, while inducing negligible damage during live cell imaging. Furthermore, to remove non-independent noise and physically entangled non-resonant background, we incorporate self-supervised deep-learning denoising and background removal based on the Kramers-Kronig relationship, yielding sensitivity improvement by an additional order of magnitude. Together, these advances provide a micromolar imaging sensitivity (160 uM for Dimethyl sulfoxide-d6) corresponding to 1000 molecules in the focal volume. Such high sensitivity enables high-fidelity chemical imaging in both fingerprint and silent windows. Hyperspectral HELP-CARS imaging of deuterated fatty acids allowed first observation of chemical separation with single lipid droplet. Together, HELP-CARS offers a powerful and generalizable approach for ultrasensitive and quantitative vibrational imaging of biological systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Enantioselective Optical Trapping enabled by Longitudinal Mie Resonances in Silicon Nanodisks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical enantioseparation of nanoscale matter is fundamentally limited by the intrinsic weakness of chiroptical forces compared to the dominant achiral gradient forces and thermal fluctuations. Conventional plasmonic approaches typically enhance chirality at the cost of amplifying achiral attraction and heating. Here, we overcome this trade-off by exploiting longitudinal Mie resonances in silicon nanodisks. By employing an Azimuthally-Radially Polarized Beam (ARPB) illumination, we selectively excite longitudinal Mie resonances, with strong optical chirality gradients and comparatively uniform electric field intensities. Specifically, magnetic quadrupole (MQ) resonances, effectively decouple enantioselective forces from the achiral background, providing uniquely favorable conditions for enantioselective optical trapping. Combining full-wave simulations with Kramers' escape-rate theory, we demonstrate a robust trapping system that is both thermally stable and highly selective. We predict trapping selectivity ratios above 100 for particles with Pasteur parameters $|\kappa| \geq$ 0.03 and maintain selectivities above 2 even for weakly chiral analytes ($|\kappa| \approx$ 0.006). These results establish longitudinal Mie resonances in high-index dielectric nanostructures as a promising, non-invasive platform for all-optical chiral analysis and enantiomer separation.</description>

      <title>Optically locked low-noise photonic microwave oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next-generation sensing and communication applications rely on high-frequency microwave generation with low-noise. The microwave photonic technology is promising by the practical application is limited by its complex architecture so far. Here, we demonstrate an optically locked low-noise photonic microwave oscillator, so that all the optical components are packaged within a small module of 166 mL, and low noise microwave generation is achieved at 10.4 GHz with single-sideband phase noise of -54 dBc/Hz at 10 Hz, -141 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz, and -162 dBc/Hz at 10 MHz offset. Above performance arises from a dual-laser self-injection-locking scheme to a single Fabry-Perot cavity with high Q exceeding 10^8, with over 20 dB common-mode noise suppression. The low-noise nature of such reference is coherently transferred to the X-band through a high-performance TFLN electro-optic comb chip, thereby overcoming long-standing barriers in photonic microwave integration to enable truly field-deployable low-noise microwave generation.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian stealthy hyperuniformity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry-driven wave physics in open systems, exemplified by parity-time (PT) symmetry, has extended the landscape of crystalline phases in materials science to include gain-loss media. Given the growing interest in engineering disorder for wave manipulation, such non-Hermitian crystals motivate the extension of non-Hermitian frameworks into the realm of correlated disorder. Here, we propose hyperuniformity and stealthiness in non-Hermitian systems as a generalization of PT-symmetric crystals to correlated disorder. We extend the scattering-microstructure correspondence to open systems, formulating non-Hermitian hyperuniformity and stealthiness that encompass their Hermitian counterparts. This approach, incorporating a statistical crystallography framework for non-Hermitian materials, demonstrates that real-imaginary cross-correlations of the material potential are irrelevant for achieving hyperuniformity but are essential for characterizing stealthiness, revealing unidirectional scattering phases that are inaccessible in Hermitian materials and in non-Hermitian crystals. By analysing the microstructural statistics of the resulting materials, our results, building on non-Hermitian wave physics, establish a connection to materials science, encompassing conventional descriptors of correlated disorder.</description>

      <title>Fully programmable slow light based on a spinor representation of generalized coupled-resonator-induced transparency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), arising from quantum interference in coherently driven atomic systems, has inspired a variety of photonic analogues, such as coupled-resonator-induced transparency (CRIT) built on the quantum-state modelling using resonators. Although CRIT serves as a building block for slow light in photonic integrated circuits, recent advances in topological photonics motivate a further generalization of both EIT and CRIT using gauge-field degrees of freedom. Here, we propose generalized CRIT via a spinor representation with dual-channel gauge fields, enabling fully programmable CRIT featuring dynamical spectral engineering. We generalize the traditional EIT framework by introducing a spinor representation of bright- and dark-mode resonances, yielding a unified description of design parameters through universal unitary operations. Implementing a coupled-resonator building block that accesses the entire design space through dual-channel gauge fields, we demonstrate a programmable slow-light band in a one-dimensional CRIT lattice. These results address urgent needs in optical interconnects, such as tunable delay lines, reconfigurable synchronization, and linear frequency conversion.</description>

      <title>Multimode fiber laser cavities as nonlinear optical processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical computing provides a promising path toward energy-efficient machine learning, yet implementing nonlinear transformations without complex electronics or high-power sources remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate that continuous-wave multimode fiber laser cavities can function as nonlinear optical processors. Input images encoded as phase patterns on a spatial light modulator undergo high-dimensional transformation through the interplay of multimode interference and gain saturation dynamics. The cavity maps input data into spatially stable, class-separable intensity distributions, enabling a simple linear classifier to achieve accuracies of 85--99\% across diverse benchmarks -- including medical imaging and remote sensing -- with orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters than deep neural networks. Our results establish multimode fiber lasers as compact, low-power physical processors for scalable optical machine learning.</description>

      <title>Background-free Tracking of Ultrafast Hole and Electron Dynamics with XUV Transient Grating Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption (TA) and transient reflectivity (TR) spectroscopies enable element-specific insights into attosecond-timescale processes in solids. XUV transient grating spectroscopy (TGS) is an emerging tool that combines the advantages of both absorption and reflectivity while offering intrinsically background-free detection. Here, we implement XUV-TGS by generating a transient grating in germanium solid using two few-cycle near-infrared pulses and probing it with an attosecond XUV pulse, produced via tabletop high-harmonic generation. The spectrally resolved, diffracted XUV pulses directly visualize the separate ultrashort decay times of both photoexcited electrons and holes, without the need for iterative deconvolution. By combining XUV-TA and -TG spectroscopy, we extract the evolution of the complex refractive index, \~n, without the need for Kramers-Kronig reconstruction, as required in XUV-TR, allowing us to extract the roots of the induced optical response. We find reflectivity changes of up to 34% via the real part of \~n, whereas changes in the imaginary part only result in a variation in reflectivity of around 0.5%.</description>

      <title>Emergence of transverse optical spin in a subwavelength grating ring resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The local polarization of the electromagnetic field plays a crucial role in the interaction of light with spin- and valley-polarized quantum sources. Unlike free-space electromagnetic waves, whose polarization degeneracy enables flexible polarization manipulation, planar integrated optical structures lack such degree of freedom owing to intrinsic structural anisotropy. Here, we propose a planar optical ring resonator based on a subwavelength grating waveguide that supports two quasi-degenerate modes. We demonstrate that coupling of these modes in the ring resonator leads to the formation of the resonances with a predominant direction of electric-field rotation in the vicinity of the resonator, resulting in the non-zero transverse optical spin. The average degree of circular polarization in the proposed structures reaches values of up to 70%. The theoretical predictions are corroborated by experimental validation in the microwave spectral range. Our findings suggest a viable route toward realization of on-chip optical spintronic and valleytronic interfaces.</description>

      <title>The mixture of glycerin with tartrazine: a solution to reversibly increase tissue transparency for in vitro quantitative phase imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thick tissue sections strongly scatter and absorb light, which limits transmission-based label-free examination via quantitative phase imaging (QPI) modalities. Here we introduce a simple, room-temperature optical clearing medium - glycerol and tartrazine solution (GTS; 60 percent glycerol, 10 percent tartrazine) - that increases the transparency of 50-80 micron murine liver and kidney slices while preserving tissue morphology and enabling rapid, label-free quantitative phase imaging. Using Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM) and lensless digital holographic microscopy with pixel super-resolution (LDHM-PSR), we demonstrate markedly improved high-throughput visualization of microstructural features after GTS immersion compared with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The improvement is confirmed quantitatively by a significant increase in the one-pixel-lag autocorrelation of phase-gradient values, indicating reduced scattering-driven phase artifacts and enhanced structural continuity in reconstructed phase maps. We further show that GTS is stable for months at room temperature, provides instant yet durable clearing that improves over time, and can be removed by brief PBS washing, enabling downstream multimodal analyses on the same specimen. Finally, we benchmark GTS against the state-of-the-art clearing agent Ce3D, highlighting GTS as a low-cost, safe, operationally straightforward alternative with strong potential for routine, high-throughput QPI-based histopathology workflows.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous modes in dispersive laser cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified instantaneous-mode description for lasers with dispersive cavities, exploiting the separation of timescales between fast cavity fields and slow carrier dynamics. The resulting reduced rate equations retain the essential effects of frequency-dependent mirrors through a dynamic modal gain and an effective confinement factor determined directly by the mirror reflectivity. Applied to a Fano laser, the reduced description accurately reproduces the full dynamics and clarifies the physical origin of dispersive instabilities. More generally, the approach provides a transparent framework for reduced modeling and stability analysis of dispersive laser cavities.</description>

      <title>Probing Internal Dynamics of Spatiotemporal Optical Vortex Strings: Spatiotemporal Attraction and Filament Stretching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortex dynamics are intriguing and challenging across multiple physics fields. In optics, customized spatiotemporally structured optical fields, especially spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOV), offer the potential to tailor light via coupled space-time degrees of freedom. However, the interaction mechanisms between multiple transverse orbital angular momentum singularities within a single wave packet remain elusive. This study explores the intrinsic dynamics of a STOV with three phase singularities, observing a pronounced vortex singularity oscillation phenomena by tuning the temporal dispersion. We show that these phenomena originate from the counterintuitive spatiotemporal attractive effect between vortices, which is closely related to the singularity distance. Furthermore, the stretching into filaments and annihilation behaviors is observed by introducing antivortex in the center of the wavepacket. Experimentally, we propose a Full Interferometric Retrieval of Spatiotemporal Tomography (FIRST) method that enables the complete, single-shot capture of wave packets, with excellent agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results. To the best of our knowledge, the dynamics of transverse spatiotemporal singularities within a single wave packet are reported here for the first time. These findings confirm the existence of interesting interactions between STOV singularities, deepen our understanding of photonics and open a new direction for investigating the complex dynamics of vortex singularities in the spatiotemporal domain.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a special kind of nonreciprocal electromagnetic response which gives rise to backscattering suppression in the bulk, a long-sought feature in topological photonics, as well as nonreciprocal lensing - an effect when the same structure focuses light incident from one direction and defocuses light propagating in the opposite way. We predict this response in spin spirals and in specially designed metamaterials, validating the key predictions.</description>

      <title>Programmable and nonvolatile computing with composition tuning in thin film lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix-vector multiplications are fundamental operations in artificial intelligence and high-throughput computations, and are executed repeatedly during training and inference. Their high energy cost in electronic processors motivate scalable photonic computing approaches that reduce the energy required per operation. Thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) is a dominant photonic platform due to its large electro-optic effect. However, it lacks nonvolatile index tuning mechanisms, which promise to pave the way for energy-efficient photonic computing. Here, we explore electrochemical lithiation as a route to nonvolatile matrix-vector multiplications in TFLN. The LiNbO3 phase is stable at room temperature over a 2% Li composition window with an associated composition-dependent refractive index. We computationally demonstrate this as a programmable, low-loss approach to perform matrix-vector multiplications by using composition to control matrix weights. We design Mach-Zehnder interferometers to perform image processing tasks under realistic material loss constraints. We also design microring resonators for iterative weight updates, using gradient descent training to program target matrix operations with matrix-vector multiplication accuracy validated at 1.5% average relative error. These demonstrations show a facile route towards nonvolatile photonic computing in TFLN, addressing a critical requirement for energy-efficient photonic matrix operations at scale.</description>

      <title>Device-independent quantum key distribution over 100 km with single atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) is a key application of the quantum internet. We report the realization of DI-QKD between two single-atom nodes linked by 100-km fibers. To improve the entangling rate, single-photon interference is leveraged for entanglement heralding, and quantum frequency conversion is used to reduce fiber loss. A tailored Rydberg-based emission scheme suppresses the photon recoil effect on the atom without introducing noise. We achieved high-fidelity atom-atom entanglement and positive asymptotic key rates for fiber lengths up to 100 km. At 11 km, 1.2 million heralded Bell pairs were prepared over 624 hours, yielding an estimated extractable finite-size secure key rate of 0.112 bits per event against general attacks. Our results close the gap between proof-of-principle quantum network experiments and real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Intensity-based Segmentation of Tissue Images Using a U-Net with a Pretrained ResNet-34 Encoder: Application to Mueller Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manual annotation of the images of thin tissue sections remains a time-consuming step in Mueller microscopy and limits its scalability. We present a novel automated approach using only the total intensity M11 element of the Mueller matrix as an input to a U-Net architecture with a pretrained ResNet-34 encoder. The network was trained to distinguish four classes in the images of murine uterine cervix sections: background, internal os, cervical tissue, and vaginal wall. With only 70 cervical tissue sections, the model achieved 89.71% pixel accuracy and 80.96% mean tissue Dice coefficient on the held-out test dataset. Transfer learning from ImageNet enables accurate segmentation despite limited size of training dataset typical of specialized biomedical imaging. This intensity-based framework requires minimal preprocessing and is readily extensible to other imaging modalities and tissue types, with publicly available graphical annotation tools for practical deployment.</description>

      <title>Controlling the Flow of Information in Optical Metrology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical metrology has progressed beyond the Abbe-Rayleigh limit, unlocking (sub)atomic precision by leveraging nonlinear phenomena, statistical accumulation, and AI estimators trained on measurand variations. Here, we show that Fisher information, which defines the fundamental precision limit, can be viewed as a physical entity that propagates through space, and we derive a wave equation for sensitivity fields describing its flow, which can resonate, diffract, and interfere. We reveal how material composition, geometry, and environmental design dictate where information is generated and how it travels, analogous to antennas and metasurfaces sculpting electromagnetic energy. Plasmonic and dielectric resonances enhance information flow, while gratings and near-field structures reshape radiation patterns. This perspective reframes metrology as a discipline in which resolution can be engineered by tailoring information sources and flow for applications in atomic-scale diagnostics and beyond, including optimisation of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), remote sensing, and radar technologies.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Sensitivity to Blackbody Radiation in Spintronic Poisson Bolometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12490v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-sensitivity long-wave infrared (LWIR) detection is crucial for observing weak thermal radiation. Recently, the Poisson bolometer is proposed as a fundamentally new platform for uncooled infrared detection. In contrast to traditional analog detectors, where signal and noise are continuous currents or voltages, the Poisson bolometer has both signal and noise governed by Poissonian counting statistics regardless of the light source. In this work, uncooled infrared detection is advanced toward cryogenic-level sensitivity through the integration of spintronic materials and plasmonic materials. Specifically, a plasmonic absorber optimized for broadband LWIR absorption is experimentally integrated with a spintronic Poisson bolometer to enhance thermal coupling and temperature rise in the sensing layer. The plasmonic absorber exhibits an absorptance exceeding 60\% across the LWIR spectrum, matching the peak of room-temperature blackbody radiation. The device achieves a noise-equivalent temperature difference (NEDT) of 35 mK at a 50 Hz frame rate and multiple results close to or below 100 mK, demonstrating room-temperature performance comparable to the most sensitive uncooled LWIR detectors reported to date. This work opens up pathways to high-sensitivity LWIR detection and imaging applications, including remote sensing, high-speed imaging, and industrial monitoring, while eliminating bulky and expensive cooling requirements.</description>

      <title>Optical Response in Spintronic Poisson Bolometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14968v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analog bolometers based on temperature-dependent phase-transition materials such as vanadium oxide (VOx) and barium titanate (BTO) represent the state of the art in uncooled infrared detectors. Recently, the first room-temperature spintronic Poisson bolometer based on magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) was proposed and demonstrated as a promising infrared detector. Unlike conventional bolometers, the spintronic Poisson bolometer operates in a probabilistic regime dominated by Poissonian noise, where the response is governed by resistance fluctuations arising from thermally activated magnetization transitions. Spontaneous transitions between two metastable magnetic states occur even in the absence of incident light, and the transition probability increases under illumination. In this work, we experimentally study the statistical properties of the optical response of the spintronic Poisson bolometer under illumination. We demonstrate that transitions in spintronic Poisson bolometers, both in the absence and presence of light, exhibit Poissonian behavior, with transition rates and interarrival times modulated by incident radiation. Under illumination, we observe a 153% increase in the count rate accompanied by a 70% reduction in interarrival time. These results establish spintronic Poisson bolometers as a promising platform for probabilistic, high-speed, and high-sensitivity infrared detection at room temperature.</description>

      <title>From Disorder to Function: Entropy-Engineered Broadband Photonics with Ion-Transport-Stabilized Spectral Fidelity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The high-entropy halide-perovskite field has expanded rapidly, yet a key gap remains: configurational entropy is not yet a reliable, designable lever to co-deliver expanded photonic functionality and operational robustness with a composition-transferable mechanistic basis. Here we develop entropy-engineered rare-earth halide double-perovskite single crystals, Cs2Na(Sb, RE)Cl6 (RE3+ = Sc3+, Er3+, Yb3+, Tm3+), that simultaneously expand near-infrared (NIR) functionality and establish a mechanistic stability rule. Near-equiatomic B(III)-site alloying yields a single-phase high-entropy solid solution (Delta_Sconfig about 1.6R). Sb3+ serves as a sensitizer that unifies excitation and cooperatively activates multiple lanthanide channels, transforming the parent single-mode response into a broadband NIR output (~850-1600 nm) with three spectrally orthogonal fingerprint bands at 996, 1220, and 1540 nm. This tri-peak, self-referenced output enables redundancy-based ratiometric solvent identification and quantitative mixture sensing with reduced susceptibility to intensity drift. Accelerated aging under humidity and oxygen shows improved phase and emission stability versus single-component analogues. DFT and molecular dynamics attribute the robustness to strongly suppressed RE$^{3+}$/Cl$^-$ self-diffusion despite comparable H$_2$O/O$_2$ adsorption, kinetically impeding ion-migration-assisted reconstruction and degradation. Integration into a phosphor-converted LED delivers spectrally stable, broadband NIR illumination, establishing entropy engineering as a practical handle to couple expanded photonic functionality with mechanistically accountable durability in metal-halide photonics.</description>

      <title>Inverse design of multiresonance filters via quasi-normal mode theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a practical methodology for inverse design of compact high-order/multiresonance filters in linear passive 2-port wave-scattering systems, targeting any desired transmission spectrum (such as standard pass/stop-band filters). Our formulation allows for both large-scale topology optimization and few-variable parametrized-geometry optimization. It is an extension of a quasi-normal mode theory and analytical filter-design criteria (on the system resonances and background response) derived in our previous work. Our new optimization-oriented formulation relies solely on a scattering solver and imposes these design criteria as equality constraints with easily calculated (via the adjoint method) derivatives, so that our algorithm is numerically tractable, robust, and well-suited for large-scale inverse design. We demonstrate its effectiveness by designing 3rd- and 4th-order elliptic and Chebyshev filters for photonic metasurfaces, multilayer films, and electrical LC-ladder circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the inertial dynamics of magnetic skyrmions driven by circularly polarized light (CPL) via the inverse Faraday effect (IFE). By incorporating an inertial mass term into the Thiele equation and analytically deriving the optically induced magnetic fields and forces, we demonstrate fundamentally distinct dynamical regimes under continuous-wave (CW) versus pulsed excitation. Skyrmion inertia qualitatively transforms trajectories from smooth spirals to polygonal orbits under continuous driving, while enabling sustained post-pulse gyration that reveals the system's intrinsic relaxation dynamics. The handedness of the trajectory is determined by the topological charge and light helicity: left-circularly polarized (LCP) light attracts skyrmions toward the beam center, while right-circularly polarized (RCP) light repels them. Systematic parameter analysis reveals how Gilbert damping, optical intensity, frequency, and skyrmion mass control the transition between oscillatory and overdamped dynamical phases. Our work identifies inertia, topological charge, and light helicity as essential factors in ultrafast all-optical skyrmion manipulation and provides a theoretical model for designing topological spin textures with ultrafast light.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuously monitored quantum systems are emerging as promising platforms for quantum metrology, where a central challenge is to identify measurement strategies that optimally extract information about unknown parameters encoded in the complex quantum state of emitted radiation. Different measurement strategies effectively access distinct temporal modes of the emitted field, and the resulting choice of mode can strongly impact the information available for parameter estimation. While a ubiquitous approach in quantum optics is to select frequency modes through spectral filtering, the metrological potential of this technique has not yet been systematically quantified. We develop a theoretical framework to assess this potential by modeling spectral detection as a cascaded quantum system, allowing us to reconstruct the full density matrix of frequency-filtered photonic modes and to compute their associated Fisher information. This framework provides a minimal yet general method to benchmark the performance of spectral measurements in quantum optics, allowing to identify optimal filtering strategies in terms of frequency selection, detector linewidth, and metrological gain accessible through higher-order frequency-resolved correlations and mean-field engineering. These results lay the groundwork for identifying and designing optimal sensing strategies in practical quantum-optical platforms.</description>
