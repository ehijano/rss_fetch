      <title>Computing crossing numbers with topological and geometric restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing the crossing number of a graph is one of the most classical problems in computational geometry. Both it and numerous variations of the problem have been studied, and overcoming their frequent computational difficulty is an active area of research. Particularly recently, there has been increased effort to show and understand the parameterized tractability of various crossing number variants. While many results in this direction use a similar approach, a general framework remains elusive. We suggest such a framework that generalizes important previous results, and can even be used to show the tractability of deciding crossing number variants for which this was stated as an open problem in previous literature. Our framework targets variants that prescribe a partial predrawing and some kind of topological restrictions on crossings. Additionally, to provide evidence for the non-generalizability of previous approaches for the partially crossing number problem to allow for geometric restrictions, we show a new more constrained hardness result for partially predrawn rectilinear crossing number. In particular, we show W-hardness of deciding Straight-Line Planarity Extension parameterized by the number of missing edges.</description>

      <title>Optimizing generalized kernels of polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05995</link>
      <description>arXiv:1802.05995v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{O}$ be a set of $k$ orientations in the plane, and let $P$ be a simple polygon in the plane. Given two points $p,q$ inside $P$, we say that $p$ $\mathcal{O}$-\emph{sees} $q$ if there is an $\mathcal{O}$-\emph{staircase} contained in $P$ that connects $p$ and~$q$. The \emph{$\mathcal{O}$-Kernel} of the polygon $P$, denoted by $\mathcal{O}$-$\rm kernel(P)$, is the subset of points of $P$ which $\mathcal{O}$-see all the other points in $P$. This work initiates the study of the computation and maintenance of $\mathcal{O}$-$\rm kernel(P)$ as we rotate the set $\mathcal{O}$ by an angle $\theta$, denoted by $\mathcal{O}$-$\rm kernel_{\theta}(P)$. In particular, we consider the case when the set $\mathcal{O}$ is formed by either one or two orthogonal orientations, $\mathcal{O}=\{0^\circ\}$ or $\mathcal{O}=\{0^\circ,90^\circ\}$. For these cases and $P$ being a simple polygon, we design efficient algorithms for computing the $\mathcal{O}$-$\rm kernel_{\theta}(P)$ while $\theta$ varies in $[-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2})$, obtaining: (i)~the intervals of angle~$\theta$ where $\mathcal{O}$-$\rm kernel_{\theta}(P)$ is not empty, (ii)~a value of angle~$\theta$ where $\mathcal{O}$-$\rm kernel_{\theta}(P)$ optimizes area or perimeter. Further, we show how the algorithms can be improved when $P$ is a simple orthogonal polygon. In addition, our results are extended to the case of a set $\mathcal{O}=\{\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_k\}$.</description>

      <title>Maximum rectilinear convex subsets</title>

      <description>arXiv:1907.07441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a set of $n$ points in the plane. We consider a variation of the classical Erd\H{o}s-Szekeres problem, presenting efficient algorithms with $O(n^3)$ running time and $O(n^2)$ space complexity that compute: (1) A subset $S$ of $P$ such that the boundary of the rectilinear convex hull of $S$ has the maximum number of points from $P$, (2) a subset $S$ of $P$ such that the boundary of the rectilinear convex hull of $S$ has the maximum number of points from $P$ and its interior contains no element of $P$, (3) a subset $S$ of $P$ such that the rectilinear convex hull of $S$ has maximum area and its interior contains no element of $P$, and (4) when each point of $P$ is assigned a weight, positive or negative, a subset $S$ of $P$ that maximizes the total weight of the points in the rectilinear convex hull of $S$.
  We also revisit the problems of computing a maximum-area orthoconvex polygon and computing a maximum-area staircase polygon, amidst a point set in a rectangular domain. We obtain new and simpler algorithms to solve both problems with the same complexity as in the state of the art.</description>

      <title>On approximating shortest paths in weighted triangular tessellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.13912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the quality of weighted shortest paths when a continuous 2-dimensional space is discretized by a weighted triangular tessellation. In order to evaluate how well the tessellation approximates the 2-dimensional space, we study three types of shortest paths: a weighted shortest path $ \mathit{SP_w}(s,t) $, which is a shortest path from $ s $ to $ t $ in the space; a weighted shortest vertex path $ \mathit{SVP_w}(s,t) $, which is an any-angle shortest path; and a weighted shortest grid path $ \mathit{SGP_w}(s,t) $, which is a shortest path whose edges are edges of the tessellation.
  Given any arbitrary weight assignment to the faces of a triangular tessellation, thus extending recent results by Bailey et al. [Path-length analysis for grid-based path planning. Artificial Intelligence, 301:103560, 2021], we prove upper and lower bounds on the ratios $ \frac{\lVert \mathit{SGP_w}(s,t)\rVert}{\lVert \mathit{SP_w}(s,t)\rVert} $, $ \frac{\lVert \mathit{SVP_w}(s,t)\rVert}{\lVert \mathit{SP_w}(s,t)\rVert} $, $ \frac{\lVert \mathit{SGP_w}(s,t)\rVert}{\lVert \mathit{SVP_w}(s,t)\rVert} $, which provide estimates on the quality of the approximation.
  It turns out, surprisingly, that our worst-case bounds are independent of any weight assignment. Our main result is that $ \frac{\lVert \mathit{SGP_w}(s,t)\rVert}{\lVert \mathit{SP_w}(s,t)\rVert} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \approx 1.15 $ in the worst case, and this is tight. As a corollary, for the weighted any-angle path $ \mathit{SVP_w}(s,t) $ we obtain the approximation result $ \frac{\lVert \mathit{SVP_w}(s,t)\rVert}{\lVert \mathit{SP_w}(s,t)\rVert} \lessapprox 1.15 $.</description>

      <title>Geometry helps in routing scalability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) aims to address a myriad of significant networking challenges that appear in time-varying settings, such as mobile and satellite networks, wherein changes in network topology are frequent and often subject to environmental constraints. Within this paradigm, routing problems are often solved by extending classical graph-theoretic path finding algorithms, such as the Bellman-Ford or Floyd-Warshall algorithms, to the time-varying setting; such extensions are simple to understand, but they have strict optimality criteria and can exhibit non-polynomial scaling. Acknowledging this, we study time-varying shortest path problems on metric graphs whose vertices are traced by semi-algebraic curves. As an exemplary application, we establish a polynomial upper bound on the number of topological critical events encountered by a set of $n$ satellites moving along elliptic curves in low Earth orbit (per orbital period). Experimental evaluations on networks derived from STARLINK satellite TLE's demonstrate that not only does this geometric framework allow for routing schemes between satellites requiring recomputation an order of magnitude less than graph-based methods, but it also demonstrates metric spanner properties exist in metric graphs derived from real-world data, opening the door for broader applications of geometric DTN routing.</description>
