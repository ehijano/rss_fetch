      <title>Group Sparsity Methods for Compressive Space-Frequency Channel Estimation and Spatial Equalization in Fluid Antenna System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid Antenna System (FAS) unlocks unprecedented flexibility in wireless channel optimization through spatial reconfigurability. However, its practical deployment is hindered by the coupled challenges posed by high-dimensional channel estimation and real-time position optimization. This paper bridges wireless propagation physics with compressed sensing theory to address these challenges through three aspects. First, we establish a group-sparse recovery framework for space-frequency characteristics (SFC) in FAS, formally characterizing leakage-induced sparsity degradation from limited aperture and bandwidth as a structured group-sparsity problem. By deriving dictionary-adapted group restricted isometry property (D-GRIP), we prove tight recovery bounds for a convex $\ell_1/\ell_2$-mixed norm optimization formulation that preserves leakage-aware sparsity patterns. Second, we develop a Descending Correlation Group Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (DC-GOMP) algorithm that systematically relaxes leakage constraints to reduce subcoherence. This approach enables robust FSC recovery with accelerated convergence and superior performance compared to conventional compressive sensing methods like OMP or GOMP. Third, we formulate spatial equalization (SE) as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, ensuring optimality through the branch-and-bound method. To achieve real-time implementability while maintaining near-optimal performance, we complement this with a greedy algorithm.
  Simulation results demonstrate the proposed channel estimation algorithm effectively resolves energy misallocation and enables recovery of weak details, achieving superior recovery accuracy and convergence rate. The SE framework suppresses deep fading phenomena and reduces hardware deployment overhead while maintaining equivalent link reliability.</description>

      <title>OrbID: Identifying Orbcomm Satellite RF Fingerprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An increase in availability of Software Defined Radios (SDRs) has caused a dramatic shift in the threat landscape of legacy satellite systems, opening them up to easy spoofing attacks by low-budget adversaries. Physical-layer authentication methods can help improve the security of these systems by providing additional validation without modifying the space segment. This paper extends previous research on Radio Frequency Fingerprinting (RFF) of satellite communication to the Orbcomm satellite formation. The GPS and Iridium constellations are already well covered in prior research, but the feasibility of transferring techniques to other formations has not yet been examined, and raises previously undiscussed challenges.
  In this paper, we collect a novel dataset containing 8992474 packets from the Orbcom satellite constellation using different SDRs and locations. We use this dataset to train RFF systems based on convolutional neural networks. We achieve an ROC AUC score of 0.53 when distinguishing different satellites within the constellation, and 0.98 when distinguishing legitimate satellites from SDRs in a spoofing scenario. We also demonstrate the possibility of mixing datasets using different SDRs in different physical locations.</description>

      <title>MobRFFI: Non-cooperative Device Re-identification for Mobility Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WiFi-based mobility monitoring in urban environments can provide valuable insights into pedestrian and vehicle movements. However, MAC address randomization introduces a significant obstacle in accurately estimating congestion levels and path trajectories. To this end, we consider radio frequency fingerprinting and re-identification for attributing WiFi traffic to emitting devices without the use of MAC addresses.
  We present MobRFFI, an AI-based device fingerprinting and re-identification framework for WiFi networks that leverages an encoder deep learning model to extract unique features based on WiFi chipset hardware impairments. It is entirely independent of frame type. When evaluated on the WiFi fingerprinting dataset WiSig, our approach achieves 94% and 100% device accuracy in multi-day and single-day re-identification scenarios, respectively.
  We also collect a novel dataset, MobRFFI, for granular multi-receiver WiFi device fingerprinting evaluation. Using the dataset, we demonstrate that the combination of fingerprints from multiple receivers boosts re-identification performance from 81% to 100% on a single-day scenario and from 41% to 100% on a multi-day scenario.</description>

      <title>Low Complexity Frequency Domain Nonlinear Self-Interference Cancellation for Flexible Duplex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear self-interference (SI) cancellation is essential for mitigating the impact of transmitter-side nonlinearity on overall SI cancellation performance in flexible duplex systems, including in-band full-duplex (IBFD) and sub-band full-duplex (SBFD). Digital SI cancellation (SIC) must address the nonlinearity in the power amplifier (PA) and the in-phase/quadrature-phase (IQ) imbalance from up/down converters at the base station (BS), in addition to analog SIC. In environments with rich signal reflection paths, however, the required number of delayed taps for time-domain nonlinear SI cancellation increases exponentially with the number of multipaths, leading to excessive complexity. This paper introduces a novel, low-complexity, frequency domain nonlinear SIC, suitable for flexible duplex systems with multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) configurations. The key approach involves decomposing nonlinear SI into a nonlinear basis and categorizing them based on their effectiveness across any flexible duplex setting. The proposed algorithm is founded on our analytical results of intermodulation distortion (IMD) in the frequency domain and utilizes a specialized pilot sequence. This algorithm is directly applicable to orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) multi-carrier systems and offers lower complexity than conventional digital SIC methods. Additionally, we assess the impact of the proposed SIC on flexible duplex systems through system-level simulation (SLS) using 3D ray-tracing and proof-of-concept (PoC) measurement.</description>

      <title>Joint ML-Bayesian Approach to Adaptive Radar Detection in the presence of Gaussian Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the adaptive radar target detection problem in the presence of Gaussian interference with unknown statistical properties. To this end, the problem is first formulated as a binary hypothesis test, and then we derive a detection architecture grounded on the hybrid of Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Maximum A Posterior (MAP) approach. Specifically, we resort to the hidden discrete latent variables in conjunction with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms which cyclically updates the estimates of the unknowns. In this framework, the estimates of the a posteriori probabilities under each hypothesis are representative of the inherent nature of data and used to decide for the presence of a potential target. In addition, we prove that the developed detection scheme ensures the desired Constant False Alarm Rate property with respect to the unknown interference covariance matrix. Numerical examples obtained through synthetic and real recorded data corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and show that the MAP-based approach ensures evident improvement with respect to the conventional generalized likelihood ratio test at least for the considered scenarios and parameter setting.</description>

      <title>RACNN: Residual Attention Convolutional Neural Network for Near-Field Channel Estimation in 6G Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-field channel estimation is a fundamental challenge in sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication, where extremely large antenna arrays (ELAA) enable near-field communication (NFC) but introduce significant signal processing complexity. Traditional model-based methods suffer from high computational costs and limited scalability in large-scale ELAA systems, while existing learning-based approaches often lack robustness across diverse channel conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Residual Attention Convolutional Neural Network (RACNN), which integrates convolutional layers with self-attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction by focusing on key regions within the CNN feature maps. Experimental results show that RACNN outperforms both traditional and learning-based methods, including XLCNet, across various scenarios, particularly in mixed far-field and near-field conditions. Notably, in these challenging settings, RACNN achieves a normalized mean square error (NMSE) of 4.8*10^(-3) at an SNR of 20dB, making it a promising solution for near-field channel estimation in 6G.</description>

      <title>A Game-Theoretic Approach for High-Resolution Automotive FMCW Radar Interference Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear frequency hopping has emerged as a promising approach for mitigating interference and enhancing range resolution in automotive FMCW radar systems. Achieving an optimal balance between high range-resolution and effective interference mitigation remains challenging, especially without centralized frequency scheduling. This paper presents a game-theoretic framework for interference avoidance, in which each radar operates as an independent player, optimizing its performance through decentralized decision-making. We examine two equilibrium concepts--Nash Equilibrium (NE) and Coarse Correlated Equilibrium (CCE)--as strategies for frequency band allocation, with CCE demonstrating particular effectiveness through regret minimization algorithms. We propose two interference avoidance algorithms: Nash Hopping, a model-based approach, and No-Regret Hopping, a model-free adaptive method. Simulation results indicate that both methods effectively reduce interference and enhance the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Notably, No-regret Hopping further optimizes frequency spectrum utilization, achieving improved range resolution compared to Nash Hopping.</description>

      <title>A General Optimization Framework for Tackling Distance Constraints in Movable Antenna-Aided Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently emerged movable antenna (MA) shows great promise in leveraging spatial degrees of freedom to enhance the performance of wireless systems. However, resource allocation in MA-aided systems faces challenges due to the nonconvex and coupled constraints on antenna positions. This paper systematically reveals the challenges posed by the minimum antenna separation distance constraints. Furthermore, we propose a penalty optimization framework for resource allocation under such new constraints for MA-aided systems. Specifically, the proposed framework separates the non-convex and coupled antenna distance constraints from the movable region constraints by introducing auxiliary variables. Subsequently, the resulting problem is efficiently solved by alternating optimization, where the optimization of the original variables resembles that in conventional resource allocation problem while the optimization with respect to the auxiliary variables is achieved in closedform solutions. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we present three case studies: capacity maximization, latency minimization, and regularized zero-forcing precoding. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed optimization framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art schemes.</description>

      <title>Digital Linearizer Based on 1-Bit Quantizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel low-complexity memoryless linearizer for suppression of distortion in analog frontends. It is based on our recently introduced linearizer which is inspired by neural networks, but with orders-of-magnitude lower complexity than conventional neural-networks considered in this context, and it can also outperform the conventional parallel memoryless Hammerstein linearizer. Further, it can be designed through matrix inversion and thereby the costly and time consuming numerical optimization traditionally used when training neural networks is avoided. The linearizer proposed in this paper is different in that it uses 1-bit quantizations as nonlinear activation functions and different bias values. These features enable a look-up table implementation which eliminates all but one of the multiplications and additions required for the linearization. Extensive simulations and comparisons are included in the paper, for distorted multi-tone signals and bandpass filtered white noise, which demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed linearizer.</description>

      <title>S-R2D2: a spherical extension of the R2D2 deep neural network series paradigm for wide-field radio-interferometric imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the R2D2 paradigm, standing for ''Residual-to-Residual DNN series for high-Dynamic-range imaging'', was introduced for image formation in Radio Interferometry (RI) as a learned version of the traditional algorithm CLEAN. The first incarnations of R2D2 are limited to planar imaging on small fields of view, failing to meet the spherical-imaging requirement of modern telescopes observing wide fields. To address this limitation, we propose the spherical-imaging extension S-R2D2. Firstly, as R2D2, S-R2D2 encapsulates its minor cycles in existing 2D-Euclidean deep neural network (DNN) architectures, but adapts its iterative scheme to incorporate the wide-field measurement model mapping a spherical image to visibility data. We implemented this model as the composition of an efficient Fourier-based interpolator mapping the spherical image onto the equatorial plane, with the standard RI operator mapping the equatorial-plane image to visibility data. Importantly, the interpolation step must inevitably be performed at a lower-than-optimal resolution on the plane, to meet the high-resolution requirement on the sphere of wide-field imaging while preserving scalability. Therefore, secondly, we design S-R2D2's DNN training loss to jointly learn to correct the interpolation approximations and identify residual image structures on the sphere, ensuring consistency with the spherical ground truth using the adjoint plane-to-sphere interpolator. Finally, we demonstrate through simulations S-R2D2's capability to perform fast and accurate reconstructions of spherical monochromatic intensity images, across high-resolution, high-dynamic-range settings.</description>

      <title>Deficient Excitation in Parameter Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates parameter learning problems under deficient excitation (DE). The DE condition is a rank-deficient, and therefore, a more general evolution of the well-known persistent excitation condition. Under the DE condition, a proposed online algorithm is able to calculate the identifiable and non-identifiable subspaces, and finally give an optimal parameter estimate in the sense of least squares. In particular, the learning error within the identifiable subspace exponentially converges to zero in the noise-free case, even without persistent excitation. The DE condition also provides a new perspective for solving distributed parameter learning problems, where the challenge is posed by local regressors that are often insufficiently excited. To improve knowledge of the unknown parameters, a cooperative learning protocol is proposed for a group of estimators that collect measured information under complementary DE conditions. This protocol allows each local estimator to operate locally in its identifiable subspace, and reach a consensus with neighbours in its non-identifiable subspace. As a result, the task of estimating unknown parameters can be achieved in a distributed way using cooperative local estimators. Application examples in system identification are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results developed in this paper.</description>

      <title>Integrated Communication and Learned Recognizer with Customized RIS Phases and Sensing Durations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future wireless communication networks are expected to be smarter and more aware of their surroundings, enabling a wide range of context-aware applications. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are set to play a critical role in supporting various sensing tasks, such as target recognition. However, current methods typically use RIS configurations optimized once and applied over fixed sensing durations, limiting their ability to adapt to different targets and reducing sensing accuracy. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes an advanced wireless communication system that multiplexes downlink signals for environmental sensing and introduces an intelligent recognizer powered by deep learning techniques. Specifically, we design a novel neural network based on the long short-term memory architecture and the physical channel model. This network iteratively captures and fuses information from previous measurements, adaptively customizing RIS phases to gather the most relevant information for the recognition task at subsequent moments. These configurations are dynamically adjusted according to scene, task, target, and quantization priors. Furthermore, the recognizer includes a decision-making module that dynamically allocates different sensing durations, determining whether to continue or terminate the sensing process based on the collected measurements. This approach maximizes resource utilization efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques while minimizing the impact on communication performance, even when sensing and communication occur simultaneously.

      <title>Minimizing Age of Detection for a Markov Source over a Lossy Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitoring a process/phenomenon of specific interest is prevalent in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), remote healthcare, smart buildings, intelligent transport, industry 4.0, etc. A key building block of the monitoring system is a sensor sampling the process and communicating the status updates to a monitor for detecting events of interest. Measuring the freshness of the status updates is essential for the timely detection of events, and it has received significant research interest in recent times. In this paper, we propose a new freshness metric, Age of Detection (AoD), for monitoring the state transitions of a Discrete Time Markov Chain (DTMC) source over a lossy wireless channel. We consider the pull model where the sensor samples DTMC state whenever the monitor requests a status update. We formulate a Constrained Markov Decision Problem (CMDP) for optimising the AoD subject to a constraint on the average sampling frequency and solve it using the Lagrangian MDP formulation and Relative Value Iteration (RVI) algorithm. Our numerical results show interesting trade-offs between AoD, sampling frequency, and transmission success probability. Further, the AoD minimizing policy provides a lower estimation error than the Age of Information (AoI) minimizing policy, thus demonstrating the utility of AoD for monitoring DTMC sources.</description>

This work presents a sensing-aided communication channel estimation mechanism, where the sensing channel shares the same AOA with the uplink communication channel. First, we propose a novel orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)-based method for coarsely estimating the AOA in a sensing channel, offering improved accuracy compared to conventional methods that rely on rotational invariance techniques. Next, we refine the coarse estimates obtained in the first step by modifying the Space-Alternating Generalized Expectation Maximization algorithm for fine parameter estimation. Through simulations and mathematical analysis, we demonstrate that scenarios with shared AOA achieve a better Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) than those without sharing. This finding highlights the potential of leveraging joint sensing and communication channels to enhance parameter estimation accuracy, particularly in channel or location estimation applications.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Uplink ISAC Receiver Designs: Performance Analysis and Algorithm Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uplink integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems have recently emerged as a promising research direction, enabling simultaneous uplink signal detection and target sensing. In this paper, we propose flexible projection (FP)-type receivers that unify the projection-type receivers and the successive interference cancellation (SIC)-type receivers by using a flexible tradeoff factor to adapt to dynamically changing uplink ISAC scenarios. The FP-type receivers address the joint signal detection and target response estimation problem through two coordinated phases: 1) Communication signal detection using a reconstructed signal whose composition is controlled by the tradeoff factor, followed by 2) Target response estimation performed through subtraction of the detected communication signal from the received signal. With adjustable tradeoff factors, the FP-type receivers can balance the enhancement of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) with the reduction of correlation in the reconstructed signal for communication signal detection. The pairwise error probabilities (PEPs) are analyzed for both maximum likelihood (ML) and zero-forcing (ZF) detectors, revealing that the optimal tradeoff factor should be determined based on the adopted detection algorithm and the relative power of the sensing and communication (S&amp;C) signal. A homotopy optimization framework is first applied for the FP-type receivers with a fixed trade-off factor. This framework is then extended to develop dynamic FP (DFP)-type receivers, which iteratively adjust the trade-off factor for improved algorithm performance and environmental adaptability. Subsequently, two extensions are explored to further enhance the receivers' performance: parallel DFP (PDFP)-type receivers and a block-structured receiver design. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed receiver designs is verified via simulations.</description>

      <title>TReND: Transformer derived features and Regularized NMF for neonatal functional network Delineation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise parcellation of functional networks (FNs) of early developing human brain is the fundamental basis for identifying biomarker of developmental disorders and understanding functional development. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) enables in vivo exploration of functional changes, but adult FN parcellations cannot be directly applied to the neonates due to incomplete network maturation. No standardized neonatal functional atlas is currently available. To solve this fundamental issue, we propose TReND, a novel and fully automated self-supervised transformer-autoencoder framework that integrates regularized nonnegative matrix factorization (RNMF) to unveil the FNs in neonates. TReND effectively disentangles spatiotemporal features in voxel-wise rs-fMRI data. The framework integrates confidence-adaptive masks into transformer self-attention layers to mitigate noise influence. A self supervised decoder acts as a regulator to refine the encoder's latent embeddings, which serve as reliable temporal features. For spatial coherence, we incorporate brain surface-based geodesic distances as spatial encodings along with functional connectivity from temporal features. The TReND clustering approach processes these features under sparsity and smoothness constraints, producing robust and biologically plausible parcellations. We extensively validated our TReND framework on three different rs-fMRI datasets: simulated, dHCP and HCP-YA against comparable traditional feature extraction and clustering techniques. Our results demonstrated the superiority of the TReND framework in the delineation of neonate FNs with significantly better spatial contiguity and functional homogeneity. Collectively, we established TReND, a novel and robust framework, for neonatal FN delineation. TReND-derived neonatal FNs could serve as a neonatal functional atlas for perinatal populations in health and disease.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Maximum Likelihood Target Position Estimation for MIMO-ISAC Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter investigates target position estimation in integrated sensing and communication networks composed of multiple cooperating monostatic base stations (BSs). Each BS employs a MIMO-orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) scheme, enabling the coexistence of communication and sensing. A general cooperative maximum likelihood (ML) framework is derived, directly estimating the target position in a common reference system rather than relying on local range and angle estimates at each BS. Positioning accuracy is evaluated in single-target scenarios by varying the number of collaborating BSs, using root mean square error (RMSE), and comparing against the square root of the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound. Numerical results demonstrate that the ML framework significantly reduces the position RMSE as the number of cooperating BSs increases.</description>

      <title>Privacy Preservation in MIMO-OFDM Localization Systems: A Beamforming Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate an uplink MIMO-OFDM localization scenario where a legitimate base station (BS) aims to localize a user equipment (UE) using pilot signals transmitted by the UE, while an unauthorized BS attempts to localize the UE by eavesdropping on these pilots, posing a risk to the UE's location privacy. To enhance legitimate localization performance while protecting the UE's privacy, we formulate an optimization problem regarding the beamformers at the UE, aiming to minimize the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) for legitimate localization while constraining the CRB for unauthorized localization above a threshold. A penalty dual decomposition optimization framework is employed to solve the problem, leading to a novel beamforming approach for location privacy preservation. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach and demonstrate its superiority over existing benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Optimized Beamforming for Joint Bistatic Positioning and Monostatic Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the performance tradeoff between \textit{bistatic positioning (BP)} and \textit{monostatic sensing (MS)} in a multi-input multi-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing scenario. We derive the Cram\'er-Rao bounds (CRBs) for BP at the user equipment and MS at the base station. To balance these objectives, we propose a multi-objective optimization framework that optimizes beamformers using a weighted-sum CRB approach, ensuring the weak Pareto boundary. We also introduce two mismatch-minimizing approaches, targeting beamformer mismatch and variance matrix mismatch, and solve them distinctly. Numerical results demonstrate the performance tradeoff between BP and MS, revealing significant gains with the proposed methods and highlighting the advantages of minimizing the weighted-sum mismatch of variance matrices.</description>

      <title>Positioning-Aided Channel Estimation for Multi-LEO Satellite Downlink Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a multi-low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite system that simultaneously provides positioning and communication services to terrestrial user terminals. To address the challenges of channel estimation in LEO satellite systems, we propose a novel two-timescale positioning-aided channel estimation framework, exploiting the distinct variation rates of position-related parameters and channel gains inherent in LEO satellite channels. Using the misspecified Cramer-Rao bound (MCRB) theory, we systematically analyze positioning performance under practical imperfections, such as inter-satellite clock bias and carrier frequency offset. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate how position information derived from downlink positioning can enhance uplink channel estimation accuracy, even in the presence of positioning errors, through an MCRB-based analysis. To overcome the constraints of limited link budgets and communication rates associated with single-satellite-based communication, we develop a distributed beamforming strategy for downlink communication. This strategy allows LEO satellites to independently optimize their beamformers using local channel state information, eliminating the need for centralized processing while preserving the advantages of multi-satellite cooperative communication. Theoretical analyses and numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework in achieving high-precision downlink positioning under practical imperfections, facilitating uplink channel estimation, and enabling efficient downlink communication.</description>

      <title>Conformal Lyapunov Optimization: Optimal Resource Allocation under Deterministic Reliability Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces conformal Lyapunov optimization (CLO), a novel resource allocation framework for networked systems that optimizes average long-term objectives, while satisfying deterministic long-term reliability constraints. Unlike traditional Lyapunov optimization (LO), which addresses resource allocation tasks under average long-term constraints, CLO provides formal worst-case deterministic reliability guarantees. This is achieved by integrating the standard LO optimization framework with online conformal risk control (O-CRC), an adaptive update mechanism controlling long-term risks. The effectiveness of CLO is verified via experiments for hierarchal edge inference targeting image segmentation tasks in a networked computing architecture. Specifically, simulation results confirm that CLO can control reliability constraints, measured via the false negative rate of all the segmentation decisions made in the network, while at the same time minimizing the weighted sum of energy consumption and imprecision, with the latter accounting for the rate of false positives.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Multi-Target Tracking in Dynamic Environments: Distributed Flooding Control in the Random Finite Set Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tracking multiple targets in dynamic environments using distributed sensor networks is a challenging problem for situational awareness in connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). In such scenarios, the network of mobile sensors must coordinate their actions to accurately estimate the locations and trajectories of multiple targets, balancing limited computation and communication resources with multi-target tracking accuracy. Multi-sensor control methods can improve the performance of these networks by enabling efficient utilization of resources and enhancing the accuracy of the estimated target states. This paper proposes a novel multi-sensor control method that utilizes flooding-based communication to address this problem, ensuring distributed consensus of optimal sensor actions throughout the sensor network. Our method improves computational tractability and enables fully distributed control, ensuring the scalability and flexibility necessary for real-time CAV applications. Experimental results on several challenging multi-target tracking scenarios demonstrate that our approach significantly improves both multi-target tracking accuracy and computation time over competing methods.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Optimization for Continuous Aperture Array (CAPA)-based Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13677v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The beamforming optimization in continuous aperture array (CAPA)-based multi-user communications is studied. In contrast to conventional spatially discrete antenna arrays, CAPAs can exploit the full spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) by emitting information-bearing electromagnetic (EM) waves through continuous source current distributed across the aperture. Nevertheless, such an operation renders the beamforming optimization problem as a non-convex integral-based functional programming problem, which is challenging for conventional discrete optimization methods. A couple of low-complexity approaches are proposed to solve the functional programming problem. 1) Calculus of variations (CoV)-based approach: Closed-form structure of the optimal continuous source patterns are derived based on CoV, inspiring a low-complexity integral-free iterative algorithm for solving the functional programming problem. 2) Correlation-based zero-forcing (Corr-ZF) approach: Closed-form ZF source current patterns that completely eliminate the inter-user interference are derived based on the channel correlations. By using these patterns, the original functional programming problem is transformed to a simple power allocation problem, which can be solved using the classical water-filling approach with reduced complexity. Our numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed designs and reveal that: i) compared to the state-of-the-art Fourier-based discretization approach, the proposed CoV-based approach not only improves communication performance but also reduces computational complexity by up to hundreds of times for large CAPA apertures and high frequencies, and ii) the proposed Corr-ZF approach achieves asymptotically optimal performance compared to the CoV-based approach.</description>

      <title>DECT-2020 NR Link Distance Performance in Varying Environments: Models and Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications 2020 New Radio (DECT-2020 NR) has garnered recognition as an alternative for cellular 5G technology in the internet of things industry. This paper presents a study centered around the analysis of the link distance performance in varying environments for DECT-2020 NR. The study extensively examines and analyzes received signal strength indicator and resulting path loss values in comparison with theoretical models, as well as packet success rates (SR) and signal-to-noise ratio against varying distances. The measurements show that with an SR of over 90%, an antenna height of 1.5 m, indoor link distances with a single device-to-device connection with 0 dBm transmission (TX) power can reach over 60 m in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) areas and up to 190 m in LOS areas with smaller -8 dBm TX power. Similarly, for outdoor use cases, link distances of over 600 m can be reached with +19 dBm TX power.</description>
