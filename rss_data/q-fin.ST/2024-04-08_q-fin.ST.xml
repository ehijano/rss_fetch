      <title>A theoretical framework for dynamical fee choice in AMMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the ever evolving landscape of decentralized finance automated market makers (AMMs) play a key role: they provide a market place for trading assets in a decentralized manner. For so-called bluechip pairs, arbitrage activity provides a major part of the revenue generation of AMMs but also a major source of loss due to the so-called informed orderflow. Finding ways to minimize those losses while still keeping uninformed trading activity alive is a major problem in the field. In this paper we will investigate the mechanics of said arbitrage and try to understand how AMMs can maximize the revenue creation or in other words minimize the losses. To that end, we model the dynamics of arbitrage activity for a concrete implementation of a pool and study its sensitivity to the choice of fee aiming to maximize the value retention. We manage to map the ensuing dynamics to that of a random walk with a specific reward scheme that provides a convenient starting point for further studies.</description>

      <title>Regularization for electricity price forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most commonly used form of regularization typically involves defining the penalty function as a L1 or L2 norm. However, numerous alternative approaches remain untested in practical applications. In this study, we apply ten different penalty functions to predict electricity prices and evaluate their performance under two different model structures and in two distinct electricity markets. The study reveals that LQ and elastic net consistently produce more accurate forecasts compared to other regularization types. In particular, they were the only types of penalty functions that consistently produced more accurate forecasts than the most commonly used LASSO. Furthermore, the results suggest that cross-validation outperforms Bayesian information criteria for parameter optimization, and performs as well as models with ex-post parameter selection.</description>

      <title>Maximally Machine-Learnable Portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When it comes to stock returns, any form of predictability can bolster risk-adjusted profitability. We develop a collaborative machine learning algorithm that optimizes portfolio weights so that the resulting synthetic security is maximally predictable. Precisely, we introduce MACE, a multivariate extension of Alternating Conditional Expectations that achieves the aforementioned goal by wielding a Random Forest on one side of the equation, and a constrained Ridge Regression on the other. There are two key improvements with respect to Lo and MacKinlay's original maximally predictable portfolio approach. First, it accommodates for any (nonlinear) forecasting algorithm and predictor set. Second, it handles large portfolios. We conduct exercises at the daily and monthly frequency and report significant increases in predictability and profitability using very little conditioning information. Interestingly, predictability is found in bad as well as good times, and MACE successfully navigates the debacle of 2022.</description>
