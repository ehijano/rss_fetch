      <title>Temperature dependence of electronic conductivity from ab initio thermal simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a temperature-dependent extension of the approximate electronic conductivity formula of Hindley and Mott that leverages time-averaged fluctuations of the electronic density of states obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics. By thermally averaging the square of the density of states near the Fermi level, we obtain an estimate of the temperature dependence of the conductivity. This approach termed the thermally-averaged Hindley-Mott (TAHM) method was applied to five representative systems: crystalline aluminum (c-Al), aluminum with a grain boundary (AlGB), a four-layer graphene-aluminum composite (Al-Gr), amorphous silicon (a-Si) and amorphous germanium-antimony-telluride (a-GST). The method reproduces the expected Bloch-Gruneisen decrease in conductivity for c-Al and AlGB. Generally, the reduction (increase) in conductivity for metallic (semiconducting) materials are reproduced. It captures microstructure-induced, thermally activated conduction in multilayer Al-Gr, a-Si and a-GST. Overall, the approach provides a computationally efficient link between time-dependent electronic structure and temperature-dependent transport, offering a simple and approximate tool for exploring electronic conductivity trends in complex and disordered materials.</description>

      <title>Novel non-thermal Ablation Mechanics in the Laser Ablation of Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the non-thermal material dynamics of strongly excited silicon during ultra-fast laser ablation. In contrast to metals, silicon shows strongly excitation-dependent interatomic bonding strengths, which gives rise to a number of unique material dynamics like non-thermal melting, Coulomb explosions and altered carrier heat conduction due to charge carrier confinement. In this study, we report novel non-thermal ablation mechanisms in the ultra-fast single shot laser ablation of silicon and perform large scale massive multi-parallel simulations on experimentally achievable length scales with atomistic resolution. For this, we model the ultra-fast carrier dynamics utilizing the Thermal-Spike-Model coupled to Molecular Dynamics simulations and include the accompanied excitation-dependent nonthermal bonding strength manipulation by application of the excitation-dependent modified Tersoff Potential. Further, we present first results on the systematic construction of the excitation-dependent phase diagram of silicon by thermodynamic integration.</description>

      <title>Engineering altermagnetic symmetry to enable anomalous Hall response in Cr$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$Sb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets are a promising class of materials for spintronic applications. However, compounds that simultaneously combine the symmetry required to support an anomalous Hall effect with good metallic conductivity and magnetic ordering temperatures well above room temperature remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that partial substitution of Cr by Mn in epitaxial CrSb(100) thin films provides a viable route to engineer the combined structural and magnetic symmetry necessary to enable an otherwise symmetry-forbidden anomalous Hall effect. By systematically exploring the magnetic phase diagram Cr$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$Sb thin films, we identify a pronounced anomalous Hall effect in Cr$_{0.75}$Mn$_{0.25}$Sb. Guided by Landau theory, we model the field-driven reorientation of the N\'eel vector and the resulting anomalous Hall response, achieving good qualitative agreement with the experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Elevated-Temperature Strength in Refractory Complex Concentrated Alloys via Temperature-Induced Transition from Screw-to-Edge Dislocation Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refractory complex concentrated alloys (RCCAs) show promise for high-temperature applications but often lose strength due to screw-dislocation-controlled plasticity. We demonstrate a temperature-driven transition from screw- to edge-dislocation-controlled deformation in a single-phase NbTaTiV RCCA. Tensile tests from 298-1573 K reveal a pronounced intermediate-temperature strength plateau and yield strengths surpassing other ductile RCCAs and the Ni-based superalloy CMSX-4 above 1273 K. In-situ neutron diffraction, TEM, and molecular dynamics identify a crossover near ~900 K, where edge dislocation glide stabilized by V-induced lattice distortion dominates, enabling enhanced strength retention and a clear design strategy for ultrahigh-temperature applications.</description>

      <title>Thin-Film Stabilization and Magnetism in {\eta}-Carbide Type Iron Nitrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition-metal nitrides in {\eta}-carbide type structures exhibit unusual bonding motifs and proximity to magnetic instabilities. Yet they remain unexplored in thin-film form due to the difficulty of stabilizing nitrogen-poor ternaries among competing phases. Here, we report the thin-film synthesis and phase-stability mapping of the {\eta}-nitride systems Fe-W-N and Fe-Mo-N. Amorphous Fe-M-N (M = W, Mo) combinatorial libraries deposited by reactive co-sputtering crystallize upon rapid thermal annealing, enabling systematic identification of synthesis windows as a function of composition and annealing temperature. Using laboratory powder X-ray diffraction and synchrotron grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering, we establish that Fe3Mo3N-based {\eta}-carbide phases form over a substantially broader compositional and thermal range than W-based compositions, where {\eta}-structures are stabilized only when the films are Fe-rich. These trends are rationalized using mixed chemical-potential vs. composition phase diagrams that capture the narrow nitrogen chemical-potential stability of {\eta}-nitrides. Magnetic measurements reveal that ferromagnetism is induced in Fe-rich Fe3.54Mo2.46N with a small exchange-bias-like response that is absent in Fe3W3N-based compositions, highlighting the sensitivity of magnetic behavior to modest deviations from stoichiometry. This work establishes practical thin-film synthesis routes for {\eta}-nitride materials and demonstrates how composition can be tuned to access emergent magnetic phenomena in these complex nitrides.</description>

      <title>Observation of robust spin-phonon coupling and indication of hidden structural transition in the spin-driven ferroelectrics Mn4B_2O_9 (B= Nb, Ta)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report detailed Raman spectroscopic and magnetic susceptibility studies on the spin-driven ferroelectric compounds Mn4Nb2O9 (MNO) and Mn4Ta2O9 (MTO). Both systems exhibit strong spin-phonon coupling below the short-range magnetic ordering temperature (T(sro)=223 K), followed by further renormalization of several Raman modes at the long-range magnetic ordering temperatures (TN = 120 K for MNO and 110 K for MTO). Pronounced anomalies in Raman mode frequencies and linewidths, along with the emergence of octahedral modes between Tsro and TN, indicate a possible low-symmetry structural transition, more evident in MNO and closely linked to magnetic ordering in MTO. Distinct low-temperature evolutions of Raman mode shift, linewidth, and integrated intensity in MNO and MTO highlight the role of the nonmagnetic B-site cation in tuning spin-lattice coupling, driven by differences in spin-orbit coupling and orbital hybridization between Nb5+ (4d) and Ta5+ (5d). By combining Raman spectroscopy with nuclear magnetic resonance, and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, we further show that Mn-based systems possess a more distorted local structure than their Co analogues, while their electronic structures differ despite comparable band gaps. These results provide a comprehensive understanding of spin-lattice coupling in Mn- and Co-based A4B2O9 magnetoelectric systems.</description>

      <title>Disorder-induced symmetry breaking in moir\'e bands of marginally twisted bilayer MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted transition-metal dichalcogenides host highly tunable moir\'e potentials, flat bands, and correlated electronic phases, yet the role of disorder in shaping these emergent properties remains largely unresolved. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we investigate the impact of electrostatic disorder on the electronic structure of marginally twisted ($\theta \approx 0.95^\circ$) bilayer MoS$_2$. Differences of 15 meV in the onset energies of the valence and conduction bands between MX- and XM-stacked regions are observed and are unexpected based on symmetry considerations. We further observe spatially correlated disorder in the band onset energy that is consistent with a background random charge density of a few $10^{11}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. Continuum model calculations for twisted MoS$_2$ reveal dramatic changes in the low-energy moir\'e bands in response to an electric displacement field, in quantitative agreement with experiment. Moreover, the calculated local density of states including disorder broadening reproduces the experimental observations only when structural relaxation is taken into account. These results highlight the critical role of electrostatic disorder in determining the electronic structure of moir\'e materials at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Structural Distortions and Ferroelectricity in Antiperovskite Oxides with Tetrel Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiperovskites share the same structure as perovskites, but allow completely different chemistries and nominal charge states of anions to be stabilized. This gives rise to many interesting phenomena, including septet superconductivity and topological crystalline insulating phases in these systems. Despite this, the work on the crystal structural trends in these compounds are more limited compared to perovskites. In this study, we consider the family of antiperovskite oxides with tetrel elements (Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) and alkaline earth metals (Ca, Sr, Ba), and perform a detailed study of their crystal structures using first principles density functional theory. We show how tolerance factor arguments can be constructed to predict their structure in a way parallel to the perovskites, and furthermore, how heterostructuring (or cation-order) can be used to induce ferroelectricity in these systems which may provide an experimental knob to modify electronic structure. We conclude by a discussion of the electronic structure of antiperovskites, and show that they display interesting trends not observed in regular perovskites, including significant antibonding interactions between face-center ions, which might need to be taken into account building effective electronic models of these compounds.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial growth and magneto-transport properties of kagome metal FeGe thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic kagome metal FeGe has attracted tremendous attention in condensed matter physics due to the charge density wave (CDW) being well below its magnetic transition temperature. Up to now, numerous works on kagome FeGe have been based on single crystal bulk, but its thin film form has still not been reported. Here, we achieved epitaxial growth of FeGe thin films on Al2O3 substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. Structural characterization with x-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals single phase with flat surface of kagome FeGe thin films. Moreover, a N\'eel temperature of 397 K and a rapid variation of Hall coefficient and magnetoresistance around 100 K, which might be related to the CDW, were revealed via transport measurements. The high quality kagome FeGe thin films are expected to provide a versatile platform to study the mechanism of CDW and explore the application of FeGe in antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Origin of the Ultralow Lattice Thermal Conductivity in Vacancy-Ordered Halide Double Perovskites Cs$_2BX_6$ ($B$ = Zr, Pd, Sn, Te, Hf, and Pt; $X$= Cl, Br, and I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vacancy-ordered halide double perovskites Cs$_2BX_6$ have recently attracted significant attention due to their intrinsically ultralow lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$), which is highly desirable for thermal insulation and thermoelectric applications. In this work, we systematically investigate the anharmonic lattice dynamics and thermal transport properties of Cs$_2BX_6$ ($B$ = Zr, Pd, Sn, Te, Hf, and Pt; $X$ = Cl, Br, and I) using state-of-the-art first-principles calculations, based on a unified theory of thermal transport for crystals and glasses. All studied compounds are found to exhibit ultralow $\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$ below 1.0~W\,m$^{-1}$\,K$^{-1}$ at room temperature and large derivation from the conventional $T^{-1}$ temperature dependence. Our analysis combining with machine-learning approach show that low sound velocities (1100 -- 1600~m\,s$^{-1}$), which originates from the intrinsically weak chemical bonding, play a crucial role in suppressing heat transport of the most compounds, instead of the strong scattering of rattling phonon modes expected from the large void in the structure. Furthermore, the influence of $B$ and $X$-site elements on phonon dispersion, anharmonicity, and scattering phase space is clarified. Our results provide microscopic insights into the origin of ultralow $\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$ in Cs$_2BX_6$ and offer guiding principles for the rational design of halide-based materials with tailored thermal transport properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $Lu_2S_3$ material from the family of sesquisulfide hosts appears to be a promising low-phonon material for use as a laser gain medium allowing for a laser emission over a broad spectral range from ultraviolet to far mid-infrared wavelengths. In this paper, a praseodymium-ion doped $Lu_2S_3$ single crystal grown by micro-pulling down technique is investigated with focus on its spectroscopic properties. The Raman, excitation, and luminescence spectra are presented. By selective excitation of the main energy levels of $Pr^{3+}$-ions, 26 luminescence transitions of the $Pr:Lu_2S_3$ crystal spanning the 0.49 to 5.5 $\mu$m wavelength range have been identified. The correct assignment of the observed luminescence spectra to the respective $Pr^{3+}$ energy-level transitions was confirmed by the calculation of the optimized squared reduced-matrix elements for the tensor operators U(k) and L + gS.</description>

      <title>Bridgman method grown $Cs_2Li_3I_5$: an inter-alkali metal scintillator with high lithium content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we report on the growth of ternary caesium lithium iodide ($Cs_2Li_3I_5$, CLI) bulk crystals, both undoped and doped with thallium (Tl) and indium (In), using the miniaturised vertical Bridgman method (mVB). X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD) confirmed the presence of the ternary CLI phase in all three crystals, with CLI : In appearing homogeneous structure-wise throughout the entire ingot. Measurements of radioluminescence (RL), photoluminescence emission (PL), photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra, and photoluminescence decay kinetics (PL decay) demonstrated that the primary luminescence centers originate from the matrix itself. When doped with thallium, the efficiency of the luminescence was significantly increased. Furthermore, CLI : Tl and CLI : In crystals exhibited emission spectra similar to those of their doped caesium iodide counterparts, CsI : Tl and CsI : In, respectively. The main component of the PL decay was 523 ns, 557 ns, and 554 ns for the undoped, Tl+-doped, and In+-doped crystals, respectively. It is worthy of note that only CLI : Tl exhibited a single exponential decay. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) measurements revealed two endothermic peaks corresponding to the eutectic and liquidus temperature for CLI and CLI : In, indicating that this ternary compound has a congruent melting behaviour. Finally, the melting point of CLI was estimated to be approximately 220 {\deg}C.</description>

      <title>Optimized Photoemission from Organic Molecules in 2D Layered Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, hybrid organic-inorganic metal halides have been at the forefront of materials research. Typically, the functional (e.g., optoelectronic) properties of hybrid halides are derived from the inorganic structural part, whereas the organic structural units can add extra advantages in terms of stability, rigidity, and processability. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of two new hybrid materials in which the outstanding photophysical properties originate from the organic structural part. The new compounds, (C15H16N)2CdCl4 and ((Br)C15H15N)2CdCl4, have 2D layered Ruddlesden-Poppertype perovskite structures. These hybrids are blue-white light emitters just like their corresponding pure organic salts, but with much improved emission efficiencies. Optical spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) studies confirm that photoemission comes from the trans-stilbene organic cations. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) values of these new materials are among the highest known, 50.83 % and 26.60 % for (C15H16N)2CdCl4 and ((Br)C15H15N)2CdCl4, respectively. This is up to a 5-fold increase as compared to the light emission efficiency of the precursor salt C15H16NCl (PLQY of 10.33 %). Alongside their outstanding optical properties, their environmental and thermal stability allow their consideration for potential practical applications such as radiation detection. This work shows that hybrid metal halides can be compositionally and structurally engineered to have highly efficient photoemission originating from the organic components for fast scintillation applications.</description>

      <title>Damage accumulation induced metal-insulator transition through ion implantation of ScN thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion implantation is a powerful approach for tuning the electrical properties of materials through controlled doping and defect engineering, with applications in thermoelectrics and microelectronics. Scandium nitride (ScN) is particularly sensitive to irradiation-induced disorder, with transport properties spanning several orders of magnitude and multiple conduction mechanisms involved. In this study, we investigate the evolution of electrical transport in epitaxial ScN thin films undergoing accumulated irradiation damage at an initial defect state. A phenomenological damage-accumulation model was successfully combined with temperature dependent resistivity and Hall effect measurements to elucidate the impact of defect buildup on electrical transport and to provide physically grounded, quantitative insight into the nature and accumulation of irradiation-induced defects. It reveals two distinct defects-generation regimes of electrically active defects. At low doses, direct-impact damage produces stable and isolated acceptor-type complex defects, (VSc-X) with VSc a scandium vacancy and X denoting residual impurities, leading to a gradual increase in resistivity. At higher doses, defect accumulation dominates through a multi-hit process, giving rise to point-defect buildup and carrier localization, resulting in hopping-dominated transport. This localized regime is thermally unstable and recovers upon low-temperature annealing. We further demonstrate that the residual defect landscape strongly influences both the critical dose for the metal-insulator transition and the localization strength: films grown on Al2O3 exhibit an earlier transition and weaker localization than those grown on MgO. These results highlight ion implantation as an effective route for engineering disorder-induced localization in ScN, with the initial film quality playing a decisive role.</description>

      <title>Optomagnonic logic based on optical nonthermal magnetization switching in near-compensated iron-garnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a set of optomagnonic logic elements based on the effect of optical magnetization switching via the non-thermal inverse Faraday effect induced by femtosecond laser pulses in nearly compensated iron-garnet film with uniaxial anisotropy. Two equilibrium states in such a film are separated by a potential barrier that might be overpassed if the femtosecond pulse fluence exceeds a threshold value, so that magnetization is reversed after the pulse action. The switching threshold depends strongly on the value of applied in-plane external magnetic field, and is different for the two initial magnetization states and two opposite optical pulse helicites. This makes it possible to perform optomagnonic non-thermal deterministic writing of a magnetic bit. Such switching mechanism can be used for realizing reconfigurable optomagnonic logic elements without thermal assistance. Logical operations are implemented by encoding inputs in the amplitude and helicity of the optical pulses, while outputs are written as the magnetization state. The study demonstrates a pathway towards heating-free optomagnonic logic and memory devices.</description>

      <title>From Symmetry to Stability: Structural and Electronic Transformation in Cs$_2$KInI$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cs$_2$KInI$_6$ is a promising lead-free halide double perovskite with a calculated direct band gap of 1.24 eV, ideal for solar cell applications. Our first-principles calculations reveal that its cubic phase (Fm$\bar{3}$m) is dynamically unstable. Using an accelerated machine learning approach, we identify 42 dynamically stable structures and further validate these findings using first principles calculations on 11 of these. The most stable phase has Cmc$2_1$ symmetry with 20 atoms/unit cell. It lies 41.9 meV/atom below the cubic reference but lacks octahedral cation coordination. The most stable perovskite-like structure has P$\bar{3}$ symmetry with 10 atoms/unit cell and low octahedral connectivity. Structure-property trade-offs are highlighted, with calculated distortions generally widening the band gap, shifting it from direct to indirect, and flattening the band edges. This work showcases the synergy of genetic algorithms, machine-learned potentials, and first-principles validation for discovering stable, complex materials.</description>

Abstract: This manuscript presents an historical perspective prepared by Barry Ninham and Colin Pask in 1969 on the connection between quantum electrodynamics theory and nucleon interactions. A new theory of strong interactions based on electromagnetic considerations is proposed. Energy and force range magnitudes are correctly given. A new theory of the pion emerges and the pion mass and lifetime are calculated. No strong interaction coupling constant is required.</description>

      <title>Mechanics of hierarchical twisted and coiled polymer artificial muscles: Decoupling force from kinematic limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermally actuated twisted and coiled polymer (TCP) artificial muscles exhibit exceptional specific work capacities but are limited by an inherent competition between load-bearing capacity and actuation stroke. To address this limitation, we investigate a hierarchical helical structure designed to decouple force generation from kinematic limits. We propose a coupled thermo-mechanical model incorporating inter-filamentary contact mechanics and geometric nonlinearities to predict the assembly's equilibrium response. The results indicate that this hierarchical topology significantly amplifies isometric actuation stress compared to monofilament baselines, while maintaining a biological-like contraction stroke of approximately 22%. A critical topological threshold governed by the balance between cooperative load-sharing and geometric confinement is identified. Beyond an optimal bundle complexity, the geometric jamming dominates, as excessive inter-filamentary friction hinders actuation. Furthermore, we elucidate a stiffness-stroke synergy in homochiral configurations, where high helical angles amplify the thermal untwisting torque to overcome increased structural rigidity. Crucially, the volumetric energy density exhibits scale invariance regarding the hierarchical radius, implying that absolute force output can be linearly scaled through geometric upsizing without compromising efficiency. These findings provide a mechanics-based rationale for the structural programming, demonstrating that soft actuator performance limits are dictated by topological order rather than intrinsic material properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that periodic honeycomb networks of ballistic conducting channels generically host exact flat bands spanning the entire Brillouin zone. These flat bands are independent of microscopic vertex scattering, persist for any number of transverse modes, and occur in a universal $1\colon 2$ ratio with dispersive bands. Their existence is enforced by local $D_3$ vertex symmetry and lattice translations. We construct compact localized states obeying a Bohr-Sommerfeld-type quantization condition and demonstrate that flat bands survive in realistic antidot lattices, establishing honeycomb wire networks as a robust flat band platform relevant to gated high-mobility 2D electron gases and molecule-patterned metallic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity of 30.4 K and its Reemergence under Pressure in Fe1.11Se Synthesized via Ion-exchange and De-intercalation Reaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary stoichiometry FeSe (s-FeSe) is a well-known parent of high-temperature unconventional superconductors owing to its charge-neutral layer, highly tunable structure and electronic properties, and rich interplays among multiple electronic phases. Yet the s-FeSe synthesized via high-temperature equilibrium reactions bears the notorious interstitial Fe,where merely 3% of them is sufficient to kill the superconductivity. Here, we successfully synthesized a new non-stoichiometric Fe1.11Se single crystal with a superconducting onset temperature (Tconset) of 30.4 K through a hydrothermal ion-exchange and de-intercalation route. 11% interstitial Fe ions exceed the equilibrium phase diagram limit. Intriguingly, under physical pressure, the Tconset of exhibits a "V"-shaped evolution with a minimum at 2-2.6 GPa, and then upturning into a second superconducting region, reminiscent of the behaviors in FeSe intercalates. Furthermore, a pressure-induced possible magnetic order, previously only observed in pressurized s-FeSe, shows up. These results offer fresh insights into the role of interstitial Fe in governing superconducting and transport properties under non-equilibrium synthesis and tuning strategies.</description>

      <title>Direct laser writing of high aspect ratio nanochannels for nanofluidics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanochannels with high width-to-height aspect ratios are desirable for many applications, particularly those requiring optical access, but remain challenging to fabricate. In this work, the direct laser writing of such channels between diamond films and glass substrates is introduced. As previously reported, laser light can transform a portion of diamond film into a nanostrip. The strip induces delamination of the surrounding film, causing the formation of two nanochannels with triangular cross-sections. Here, it is demonstrated that nanochannels with rectangular cross-sections and width-to-height aspect ratios exceeding fifty can form between pairs of nanostrips. With atomic force microscopy, the maximum strip spacing that produces these nanochannels is investigated, and it is demonstrated that the reflectance of the channels can be measured by microspectrophotometry. The microstructure of the nanochannels, including nanostrips, and processes that occur during laser writing are inferred from transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. By fabricating a nanofluidic device and using microspectrophotometry, it is found that the nanochannels fill with water through capillary action, are resistant to clogging, and are mechanically stable against water filling. A versatile platform for producing high-aspect-ratio nanochannels that are optically accessible and fluidically functional is presented, thereby expanding opportunities for advanced applications.</description>

      <title>Shallow Trap States Control Electrical Performance of Amorphous Oxide Semiconductor Thin-Film Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of n-type amorphous oxide semiconductor thin-film transistors (TFTs) is largely controlled by the density of states (DoS) near the conduction band mobility edge. Here, the full subgap DoS of amorphous InGaZnO (a-IGZO) TFTs, used in display panels and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) development, is measured by ultrabroadband photoconduction (UP-DoS) microscopy to within 0.1 eV of the mobility edge. The measured subgap DoS for 25 TFT processing conditions accurately predicts each transfer curve, showing how shallow defect states are electron traps that rigidly tune subthreshold swing, threshold voltage and drift mobility. For a set of TFTs, the subthreshold transfer characteristics can be independently simulated from the experimental shallow defect DoS, with no adjustable parameters. The full transfer curve is simulated by introducing a single parameter: the conduction band tail energy. Additionally, the simulation reveals that the shallow trap density controlling subthreshold behavior can be directly extracted from transfer curves. Finally, a systematic In-enrichment study, combined with DFT+U DoS simulations, enables identification of vacancy cation coordination environments for all experimentally observed subgap peaks. The dominant trap controlling conventional a-IGZO TFT performance is centered at ~0.32 eV below the conduction band mobility edge and is assigned to a Ga-Ga-In oxygen vacancy defect.</description>

Abstract: Wavefront dislocations (WDs) -- phase singularities observed in quasiparticle interference (QPI) experiments -- have been widely interpreted as the definitive real-space signatures of Berry phases in graphene-family systems. Here, we disentangle the roles of topological charge and pseudospin texture in WD experiments. By investigating various way of the annihilation of quadratic band touchings (QBTs) in bilayer graphene and magneto-spin-orbit graphene systems, we demonstrate that WD evolution is governed exclusively by changes in the underlying pseudospin winding, while remaining insensitive to the topological charge (i.e., vorticity) of the band touching itself. Our results imply that WD measures wavefunction pseudospin texture rather than a diagnostic of topological charge and provide solid-state platforms in which WD evolution can be engineered and observed.</description>

Abstract: Twisted bilayers, featuring interfacial ferroelectricity in the form of array of polar domains, combined with incommensurate two-dimensional layers in a single van der Waals heterostructures allows for generation of purely electrostatic moir\'e superlattice potentials in the latter. We study electronic and optoelectronic properties of such heterostructures composed of graphene stacked with the twisted ferroelectric bilayers and show that doping of graphene substantially affects mini-band structures because of screening of free carriers. We demonstrate that formation of van Hove singularities in density of states modifies linear and second-order responses of the structures leading to resonant absorption and linear photovoltaic effect, respectively. The latter is generated solely by a shift photocurrent, arising only with account of virtual optical transitions, whereas an injection photocurrent is forbidden by symmetry.</description>

      <title>Chirality Driven Ratchet Currents in Two-Dimensional Tellurene with an Asymmetric Grating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of the terahertz (THz) ratchet effect is a rapidly expanding field of research that utilizes broken spatial symmetry in low-dimensional materials to rectify alternating current (AC) induced by THz fields into direct current (DC). This mechanism is highly promising for next-generation, room-temperature terahertz applications, particularly in high-speed, sensitive detection and imaging. In this work, we explore a ratchet effect generated in two dimensional tellurene, a novel promising semiconductor material consisting of helical atomic chains, creating a structure with inherent chirality. As a key result, the DC circular ratchet current flowing in the chiral axis direction $c$ is determined by the helicity of the radiation and can be reversed by switching the helicity from right to left handed. The circular ratchet effect excited by THz laser radiation is demonstrated for room temperature. The effect is demonstrated at various gate voltages when the Fermi level lies in vicinity of the Weyl point in the conduction band, in the band gap, and in the valence band with almost parabolic energy dispersion. The results are described by the developed microscopic theory based on the Boltzmann kinetic equation approach.</description>

Abstract: Chiral topological semimetals hosting multifold fermions and exotic surface states represent a frontier in topological materials research. Among them, noncentrosymmetric cubic B20 compounds-notably transition-metal silicides and germanides-offer a unique platform for realizing symmetry-protected topological phases and unconventional optoelectronic responses. Here, we report the physical properties of RhGe and CoGe single crystals with B20 structure in detail. Transport measurements reveal metallic behavior with characteristic Fermi-liquid scaling at low temperatures, while magnetization results confirm paramagnetism in both compounds. In addition, both of materials exhibit low carrier concentrations with small electronic specific heat coefficient, indicating their semimetal feature with weak electronic correlations. Such high-quality CoGe and RhGe single crystals provide a material platform to explore the evolution of multifold fermions and the instability of helicoid-arc surface states with spin-orbit coupling and surface environment in B20 material systems.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the Electronic Structure and Spin-State Crossover in LaCoO3 Using Photoemission Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoemission spectroscopy is a powerful technique for studying electronic structure and spin-state transitions, as it reveals changes in the orbital configuration accompanying a spin-state crossover. In this report, we combine excitation-energy-, temperature-, and geometry-dependent photoemission measurements to probe the electronic structure of LaCoO3 across its thermally driven spin-state transition. By systematically comparing valence-band spectra across a wide photon-energy window - from surface-sensitive soft x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (SXPS) to bulk-sensitive hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES) - we identify the Co 3d-derived feature (A) along with the O 2p-dominated features (B and C), and explain their relative evolution in terms of photon-energy-dependent photo-ionization cross-section ratios. The thermally induced spin-state crossover is demonstrated using temperature-dependent SXPS valence-band spectra, which show a progressive suppression of the feature A with heating. Geometry-dependent HAXPES measurements further clarify how the signature of the spin-state transition in LaCoO3 is intricately linked to the orbital-selective response of the t2g and eg states. Additionally, angular-dependent photo-ionization cross-section analysis provides a consistent description of the polarization dependence observed in HAXPES. Finally, configuration-interaction analysis of the Co 2p core-level spectra reveals that LaCoO3 evolves from a predominantly low-spin ground state at low temperature to a mixed low-spin/high-spin configuration at elevated temperatures, with the high-spin fraction reaching about 30 percent at 400 K. The temperature evolution of the core-level line shape thus establishes Co 2p photoemission as a sensitive quantitative probe of spin-state transitions in LaCoO3.</description>

      <title>Structural chirality measurements and computation of handedness in periodic solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16268v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare the various chirality measures most widely used in the literature to quantify chiral symmetry in extended solids, i.e., the continuous chirality measure, the Hausdorff distance, and the angular momentum. By studying these functions in an algebraically tractable case, we can evaluate their strengths and weaknesses when applied to more complex crystals. Going beyond those classical calculations, we propose a new method to quantify the handedness of a crystal based on a pseudoscalar function, i.e., the helicity. This quantity, borrowed from hydrodynamics, can be computed from the eigenvector carrying the system from the high-symmetry non-chiral phase to the low-symmetry chiral phase. Different model systems like K$_3$NiO$_2$, CsCuCl$_3$ and MgTi$_2$O$_4$ are used as test cases where we show the superior interest of using helicity to quantify chirality together with the handedness distinction.</description>

      <title>Learning Metal Microstructural Heterogeneity through Spatial Mapping of Diffraction Latent Space Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To leverage advancements in machine learning for metallic materials design and property prediction, it is crucial to develop a data-reduced representation of metal microstructures that surpasses the limitations of current physics-based discrete microstructure descriptors. This need is particularly relevant for metallic materials processed through additive manufacturing, which exhibit complex hierarchical microstructures that cannot be adequately described using the conventional metrics typically applied to wrought materials. Furthermore, capturing the spatial heterogeneity of microstructures at the different scales is necessary within such framework to accurately predict their properties. To address these challenges, we propose the physical spatial mapping of metal diffraction latent space features. This approach integrates (i) point diffraction data encoding via variational autoencoders or contrastive learning and (ii) the physical mapping of the encoded values. Together these steps offer a method offers a novel means to comprehensively describe metal microstructures. We demonstrate this approach on a wrought and additively manufactured alloy, showing that it effectively encodes microstructural information and enables direct identification of microstructural heterogeneity not directly possible by physics-based models. This data-reduced microstructure representation opens the application of machine learning models in accelerating metallic material design and accurately predicting their properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central problem in the deployment of quantum technologies is the realization of robust architectures for quantum interconnects. We propose to engineer interconnects in semiconductors and insulators by patterning spin qubits at dislocations, thus forming quasi one-dimensional lines of entangled point defects. To gain insight into the feasibility and control of dislocation-driven interconnects, we investigate the optical cycle and coherence properties of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, in proximity of dislocations, using a combination of advanced first-principles calculations. We show that one can engineer spin defects with properties similar to those of their bulk counterparts, including charge stability and a favorable optical cycle, and that NV centers close to dislocations have much improved coherence properties. Finally, we predict optically detected magnetic resonance spectra that may facilitate the experimental identification of specific defect configurations. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for the engineering of one-dimensional arrays of spin defects in the solid state.</description>

      <title>A Nonlocal Orientation Field Phase-Field Model for Misorientation- and Inclination- Dependent Grain Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01688v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to incorporate grain boundary (GB) anisotropy in phase-field modeling by extending the standard partial differential equations formulation to include a nonlocal functional of an orientation field. Regardless of the number of grains in the simulation, the model uses a single orientation field and incorporates grain misorientation and inclination information obtained from sampling the orientation field at optimized locations in the vicinity of the grain boundary. The formalism enables simple and precise tuning of GB energy anisotropy while reducing an extensive fitting procedure. The functional includes an explicit GB anisotropy function to control the GB energy as a function of both misorientation and inclination. The model is validated by reproducing the linear grain growth rate, Wulff shapes with varying misorientations and anisotropic coefficients, and analytical equilibrium dihedral angles at triple junctions. Polycrystalline simulations demonstrate grain growth, coalescence, triple junction behavior, and the influence of anisotropy on grain morphology.</description>

      <title>Design Rules and Discovery of Face-Sharing Hexagonal Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09088v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hexagonal perovskites with face-sharing octahedral connectivity are an underexplored class of materials. We propose quantitative design principles for stabilizing face-sharing ABX3 hexagonal perovskites based on a comparative analysis of oxides and sulfides. By mapping structural preferences across a phase-space defined by an electronegativity-corrected tolerance factor and the Shannon radius of the A-site cations, we identify distinct thresholds that separate hexagonal phases from competing cubic polymorphs having corner-sharing octahedral connectivity. Our analysis reveals that sulfides differ significantly from oxides due to the increased covalency of the transition metal-sulfur bonds, which enables broader compositional flexibility. Applying these principles, we predict a set of thermodynamically formable ABO3 and ABS3 compounds that are likely to adopt face-sharing octahedral connectivity. These findings establish a predictive framework for designing hexagonal perovskites, highlighting sulfides as promising candidates for obtaining quasi-one-dimensional materials having transition-metal cations for novel ferroic phenomena.</description>

      <title>exaPD: A highly parallelizable workflow for multi-element phase diagram (PD) construction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase diagrams (PDs) illustrate the relative stability of competing phases under varying conditions, serving as critical tools for synthesizing complex materials. Reliable phase diagrams rely on precise free energy calculations, which are computationally intensive. We introduce exaPD, a user-friendly workflow that enables simultaneous sampling of multiple phases across a fine mesh of temperature and composition for free energy calculations. The package employs standard molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) sampling techniques, as implemented in the LAMMPS package. Various interatomic potentials are supported, including the neural network potentials with near {\it ab initio} accuracy. A global controller, built with Parsl, manages the MD/MC jobs to achieve massive parallelization with near ideal scalability. The resulting free energies of both liquid and solid phases, including solid solutions, are integrated into CALPHAD modeling using the PYCALPHAD package for constructing the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Structural Chirality and Natural Optical Activity across the $\alpha$-to-$\beta$ Phase Transition in SiO$_2$ and AlPO$_4$ from first-principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Natural optical activity (NOA), the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light, has traditionally been associated with structural chirality. However, this relationship has often been oversimplified, leading to conceptual misunderstandings, particularly when attempts are made to directly correlate structural handedness with optical rotatory power. In reality, the relationship between chirality and NOA is more nuanced: optical activity can arise in both chiral and achiral crystal structures, and the sign of the rotation cannot necessarily be inferred from the handedness of the space group. % In this work, we conduct a first-principles investigation of natural optical activity in SiO$_2$ and AlPO$_4$ crystals, focusing on their enantiomorphic structural phase transition from high-symmetry hexagonal ($P6_422$ or $P6_222$) to low-symmetry trigonal ($P3_121$ or $P3_221$) space groups. This transition, driven by the condensation of a zone-center $\Gamma_3$ phonon mode, reverses the screw axis type given by the space group symbol while leaving the sign of the optical activity unchanged. By following the evolution of the structure and the optical response along the transition pathway, we clarify the microscopic origin of this behavior. We demonstrate that the sense of optical rotation is determined not by the nominal helicity of the screw axis given in the space group symbol, but by the atomic-scale helicity of the most polarizable atoms of the structure.</description>

      <title>A Room-Temperature Ferrotoroidic Material Exhibiting Magnetic Semiconductor Properties with Superhigh Hole Mobility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design and fabrication of room-temperature ferrotoroidic materials and magnetic semiconductors are recognized worldwide as a great challenge, and of both theoretical and practical importance in the field of condensed matter physics and information storage. Reported herein are ferrotoroidic crystal powder and film formed by supramolecular self-assembly based on uranyl and cyclodextrin, with the Curie temperature above room temperature. Experimental measurements and calculations demonstrate spontaneous vortex-like alignment of magnetic moments and furthermore a macroscopic long-range arrangement in the crystal, which breaks simultaneously space-inversion and time-reversal symmetries, exhibiting strong superexchange, spin-orbit coupling as well as anomalous Hall effect (AHE). The electrical measurements show the film with a superhigh carrier mobility of 3200 cm2*V-1*s-1 and a Hall resistivity as high as 0.32 mV*A-1*cm at room temperature. This work is expected to pave greatly the applied research on new-generation magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM), especially as flexible material.</description>

      <title>Confinement-induced Ultrafast Conductivity in 2D Perovskites resolved by correlative Terahertz-NIR Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum wells made of two-dimensional organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites (2D-PKs) offer a high degree of flexibility in tailoring optoelectronic properties through carrier confinement and functional interlayers. Compared to their 3D counterparts, 2D-PKs exhibit tunable photoluminescence, excitonic binding at room temperature and enhanced structural stability. However, the dynamics of photo-induced charge carriers and their transport properties are highly intertwined due to the interplay of diverse excitation species, charge carrier cooling, transport, and radiative and non-radiative recombination. In this study, we employ optical-pump terahertz-probe spectroscopy (OPTP) to analyze the local conductivity dynamics of 2D and 3D methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI) perovskites at timescales down to picoseconds. Remarkably, we observe an intensity-dependent, 2D-specific buildup of an ultrafast, few-picosecond decay in local conductivity. By combining OPTP with transient absorption (TA) and picosecond time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), we demonstrate the disentanglement of photoconductivity and carrier population. This allows us to attribute the 2D-specific ultrafast THz response to delayed hot-carrier cooling and subsequent exciton formation, which effectively reduces the free-carrier conductivity. This intensity-dependent, ultrafast THz response is a signature of the recently identified hot-carrier bottleneck in 3D MAPI, and this effect manifests itself in a unique form in the 2D material. These results encourage further investigations on the impact of functional organic interlayers and provide insights into designing tunable carrier responses for ultrafast devices via adapted heterostructures and confinement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop highly corrosion-resistant and conductive Ti-Nb-O coatings for metallic components -- bipolar plates (BPPs) and porous transport layers (PTLs) -- in PEM water electrolyzers. Using reactive high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS), we deposit compact 200 nm bilayer coatings onto SS316L substrates, systematically tailoring their composition. By precisely controlling oxygen partial pressure and Nb/Ti ratio, we adjust stoichiometry and structure, directly affecting electrical resistivity and corrosion resistance. We examine interfacial contact resistance (ICR) and electrochemical parameters before and after accelerated corrosion testing. Optimized coatings exhibit resistivity on the order of 10^-4 Ohmcm and extremely low corrosion current densities (J_corr = 0.01-0.08 uA/cm^2), well below the U.S. DOE 2026 target. Most importantly, these coatings enable the ICR target after accelerated corrosion testing with a Pt overlayer as thin as 5 nm, reducing Pt loading by up to two orders of magnitude compared to conventional approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The convergence of artificial intelligence and materials science presents a transformative opportunity, but achieving true acceleration in discovery requires moving beyond task-isolated, fine-tuned models toward agentic systems that plan, act, and learn across the full discovery loop. This survey advances a unique pipeline-centric view that spans from corpus curation and pretraining, through domain adaptation and instruction tuning, to goal-conditioned agents interfacing with simulation and experimental platforms. Unlike prior reviews, we treat the entire process as an end-to-end system to be optimized for tangible discovery outcomes rather than proxy benchmarks. This perspective allows us to trace how upstream design choices-such as data curation and training objectives-can be aligned with downstream experimental success through effective credit assignment.
  To bridge communities and establish a shared frame of reference, we first present an integrated lens that aligns terminology, evaluation, and workflow stages across AI and materials science. We then analyze the field through two focused lenses: From the AI perspective, the survey details LLM strengths in pattern recognition, predictive analytics, and natural language processing for literature mining, materials characterization, and property prediction; from the materials science perspective, it highlights applications in materials design, process optimization, and the acceleration of computational workflows via integration with external tools (e.g., DFT, robotic labs). Finally, we contrast passive, reactive approaches with agentic design, cataloging current contributions while motivating systems that pursue long-horizon goals with autonomy, memory, and tool use. This survey charts a practical roadmap towards autonomous, safety-aware LLM agents aimed at discovering novel and useful materials.</description>

      <title>Surface-Localized Magnetic Order in RuO2 Thin Films Revealed by Low-Energy Muon Probes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) has recently emerged as a candidate altermagnet, yet its intrinsic magnetic ground state, particularly in thin films, remains debated. This study aims to clarify the nature and spatial extent of the magnetic order in RuO2 thin films grown under different conditions. Thin films of RuO2 with thicknesses of 30 nm and 33 nm are fabricated by pulsed laser deposition and sputtering onto TiO2(110) and Al2O3(1-102) substrates, respectively. Low-energy muon spin rotation/relaxation (LE-muSR) with depth-resolved sensitivity measurements is performed in transverse magnetic fields (TF) from 4 K to 290 K. The muSR data collected with a muon implantation energy of 1 keV reveal that magnetic signals originate from the near-surface region of the film (&lt;10 nm), and the affected volume fraction is at most about 8.5%. The localized magnetic response is consistent across different substrates, growth techniques, and parameter sets, suggesting a common origin related to surface defects and dimensionality effects. The combined use of TF-muSR and the study of depth-dependent implantation with low-energy muons provides direct evidence for surface-confined, inhomogeneous static magnetic order in RuO2 thin films, helping reconcile discrepancies. These findings underscore the importance of considering reduced-dimensional contributions and motivate further investigation into the role of defects, strain, and stoichiometry on the magnetic properties of RuO2, especially at the surface.</description>

Abstract: This study demonstrates the first realization of wireless strain, temperature and crack growth sensing within 3D-printed metallic structures using standard electromagnetic inspection hardware. This establishes a path toward need-based maintenance for parts operating in harsh environments driven by accurate, real-time damage assessments instead of relying on regularly scheduled maintenance teardowns. To this end, we encapsulate and embed magnetoelastic and thermomagnetic materials during additive manufacturing. Mechanical and thermal stimuli affect the magnetic permeability of the embedded materials, which modulates the flux through a coil placed on or near the part's surface. We demonstrate strain sensing accurate to +/-27x10-6 and temperature sensing accurate to +/-0.75 oC. We highlight these sensors' capabilities by detecting the onset of plasticity and fatigue-driven crack growth thousands of cycles before critical failure.</description>

      <title>Ultrastable 2D glasses and packings explained by local centrosymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03770v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the most recent numerical data by Bolton-Lum \emph{et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 136, 058201 (2026)], we demonstrate that ideal ultrastable glasses in the athermal limit (or ultrastable ideal 2D disk packings) possess a remarkably high degree of local centrosymmetry. In particular, we find that the inversion-symmetry order parameter for local force transmission introduced in Milkus and Zaccone, [Phys. Rev. 93, 094204 (2016)], is as high as $F_{IS}= 0.84522$, to be compared with $F_{IS}=1$ for perfect centrosymmetric crystals free of defects, and with $F_{IS} \sim 0.3-0.5$ for standard random packings. This observation provides a clear, natural explanation for the ultra-high shear modulus of ideal packings and ideal glasses, because the high centrosymmetry prevents non-affine relaxations which decrease the shear modulus. The same mechanism explains the absence of boson peak-like soft vibrational modes. These results also confirm what was found previous work, i.e. that the bond-orientational order parameter is a very poor correlator for the vibrational and mechanical</description>

      <title>Observation of Orbit-Orbit Torques: Highly Efficient Torques on Orbital Moments Induced by Orbital Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the current-induced torques in bilayers composed of a light 3d metal, chromium, and a rare-earth ferromagnet with finite orbital moments, terbium, utilizing second-harmonic Hall-response measurements. The dampinglike torque efficiency of chromium is found to be positive and reaches ~3.66 in this system, in sharp contrast to the negative and subtle dampinglike torque efficiency in general Cr/ferromagnet heterostructures with quenched orbital moment. We suggest that the orbital currents generated by the orbital Hall effect in Cr can be injected into Tb with negligible loss at the interface and then efficiently interact with the orbital moments. We term such an exotic effect as the orbit-orbit torque (OOT). Our work implies that orbital currents could be harnessed to manipulate the orbital magnetization of materials, which would advance the development of orbitronics.</description>

      <title>Probing Anharmonic and Heterogeneous Carrier Dynamics Across Sublattice Melting in a Minimal Model Superionic Conductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite decades of research, the microscopic origin of sublattice melting and fast ion transport in superionic conductors remains elusive. Here, we introduce a chemically neutral minimal binary model consisting of a rigid host lattice stabilized by short-range steric repulsion and a soft carrier sublattice interacting via long-range Wigner-type forces. This contrast naturally produces distinct melting temperatures and an intermediate sublattice-melting phase in which carriers become fluidlike while the host remains crystalline. Molecular-dynamics simulations identify three dynamical regimes-crystalline, sublattice-melt, and fully molten-marked by sharp changes in diffusivity, structural correlations, and dynamic heterogeneity. Near sublattice melting, carrier motion is strongly anharmonic and spatially heterogeneous, beyond mean-field hopping descriptions. By tuning the density, we demonstrate that sublattice melting can be continuously controlled, establishing a direct link between lattice softness, anharmonicity, and collective ion transport. This work provides a unified microscopic foundation for designing mechanically robust, high-performance superionic conductors operable near ambient conditions.</description>
