      <title>Resolving the paradox of the Dirac equation: phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08009v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the results of F. Wilf on the need to take into account the quantum-mechanical correspondence rules in the Dirac equation for an electron, it was shown that the equation obtained by giving physical meaning to $\alpha$-Dirac operators should be considered as a phenomenological equation for a particle of non-zero size - the EM polaron, previously introduced by the author. This allows a solution to be found to the inherent paradox of the Dirac equation, which consists of the equality of the velocity of the moving particles to the speed of light $c$ in a vacuum, which is a priori unobtainable, and to understand the physical essence of spin as the intrinsic mechanical moment of an EM polaron. It is also shown that the Dirac-Wilf equation for a single spatial dimension can be considered a generalization of the Schrodinger equation for relativistic energies.</description>

      <title>Considerations about the measurement of the magnetic moment and electric dipole moment of the electron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15502v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of the measurement of the magnetic moment of the electron $\mu$, is to experimentaly determine the gyromagnetic ratio. The factor $g/2$ is computed by the accurate measurement of two frequencies, the spin precession frequency $\nu_s$, and the cyclotron frequency $\nu_c$, and is defined as $\nu_s/\nu_c=g/2$. These experiments are performed with a single electron confined inside a Penning trap. The existence of the electric dipole moment ${\bf d}_e$, involves the idea of an asymmetric charge distribution along the spin direction such that ${\bf d}_e=d_e{\bf S}/(\hbar/2)$. The energy shift $\Delta U=2{d}_eE_{eff}$ of the interaction of the electric dipole of electrons with a huge effective electric field ${\bf E}_{eff}$, close to the nucleus of heavy neutral atoms or molecules, is calculated by a spin precession measurement and the value $d_e$ is determined. By using a classical model of a spinning electron, which satisfies Dirac's equation when quantized, we determine classically the time average value of the electric and magnetic dipole moments of this electron model when moving in a uniform magnetic field and in a Penning trap, with the same fields as in the real experiments, and obtain an estimated value of these dipoles. We compare these results with the experimental data and make some interpretation of the measured dipoles. The conclusion is that experiments do not measure what they purport to measure.</description>
