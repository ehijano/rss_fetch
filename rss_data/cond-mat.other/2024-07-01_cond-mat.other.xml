      <title>Finite-temperature properties of string-net models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a refined version of the string-net model which assigns a different energy cost to each plaquette excitation. Using recent exact calculations of the energy-level degeneracies we compute the partition function of this model and investigate several thermodynamical quantities. In the thermodynamic limit, we show that the partition function is dominated by the contribution of special particles, dubbed pure fluxons, which trivially braid with all other (product of) fluxons. We also analyze the behavior of Wegner-Wilson loops associated to excitations and show that they obey an area law, indicating confinement, for any finite temperature except for pure fluxons that always remain deconfined. Finally, using a recently proposed conjecture, we compute the topological mutual information at finite temperature, which features a nontrivial scaling between system size and temperature.</description>

      <title>THz Control of Exchange Mode in a Ferrimagnetic Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of terahertz (THz) radiation with high-frequency spin resonances in complex magnetic materials is central for modern ultrafast magnonics. Here we demonstrate strong variations of the excitation efficiency of the sub-THz exchange magnon in a single crystal ferrimagnet (Gd,Bi)$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$. An enhancement of the exchange magnon amplitude is observed when its frequency matches an eigenmode of the cavity created by the sample interfaces. Moreover, this enhancement is accompanied by a 5-fold decrease in effective damping of the exchange mode. The THz-exchange magnon interaction in the cavity is analyzed within the developed Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert formalism for three coupled magnetization sublattices and cavity-enhanced THz field. This work presents a novel approach for the THz excitation of spin dynamics in ferrimagnets and outlines promising pathways for the controlled optimization of light-spin coupling in single crystals.</description>

      <title>Abnormal Frequency Response Determined by Saddle Points in Non-Hermitian Crystal Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In non-Hermitian crystal systems under open boundary condition (OBC), it is generally believed that the OBC modes with frequencies containing positive imaginary parts, when excited by external driving, will experience exponential growth in population, thereby leading to instability. However, our work challenges this conventional understanding. In such a system, we find an anomalous response that grows exponentially with the frequency aligned with those of saddle points. The frequencies of these saddle points on the complex plane are below the maximum imaginary part of OBC spectrum, but they can lie within or beyond the OBC spectrum. We derive general formulas of excitation-response relationships and find that this anomalous response can occur because the excitation of OBC modes eventually evolve toward these saddle points at long times. Only when the frequencies of all these saddle points are below the real axis do the non-Hermitian crystal systems remain stable under periodic excitation. Thus our results also provide new insights on the stability criterion of non-Hermitian crystal systems.</description>

      <title>$N$-bein formalism for the parameter space of quantum geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a geometrical object that generalizes the quantum geometric tensor; we call it $N$-bein. Analogous to the vielbein (orthonormal frame) used in the Cartan formalism, the $N$-bein behaves like a ``square root'' of the quantum geometric tensor. Using it, we present a quantum geometric tensor of two states that measures the possibility of moving from one state to another after two consecutive parameter variations. This new tensor determines the commutativity of such variations through its anti-symmetric part. In addition, we define a connection different from the Berry connection, and combining it with the $N$-bein allows us to introduce a notion of torsion and curvature \`{a} la Cartan that satisfies the Bianchi identities. Moreover, the torsion coincides with the anti-symmetric part of the two-state quantum geometric tensor previously mentioned, and thus, it is related to the commutativity of the parameter variations. We also describe our formalism using differential forms and discuss the possible physical interpretations of the new geometrical objects. Furthermore, we define different gauge invariants constructed from the geometrical quantities introduced in this work, resulting in new physical observables. Finally, we present two examples to illustrate these concepts: a harmonic oscillator and a generalized oscillator, both immersed in an electric field. We found that the new tensors quantify correlations between quantum states that were unavailable by other methods.</description>

      <title>Automated 1D Helmholtz coil design for cell biology: Weak magnetic fields alter cytoskeleton dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For more than fifty years, scientists have been gathering evidence of the biological impacts of weak magnetic fields. However, the lack of systematics in experimental studies has hampered research progress on this subject. To systematically quantify magnetic field effects in cell biology, it is crucial to produce fields that can be automatically adjusted and that are stable throughout an experiment's duration, usually operating inside an incubator. Here, we report on the design of a fully automated 1D Helmholtz coil setup that is internally water cooled, thus eliminating any confounding effects caused by temperature fluctuations. The coils also allow cells to be exposed to magnetic fields from multiple directions through automated controlled rotation. Preliminary data, acquired with the coils placed inside an incubator and on a rat vascular smooth muscle cell line, confirm previous reports that both microtubule and actin polymerization and dynamics are altered by weak magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Predicting Topological Entanglement Entropy in a Rydberg analog simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the dynamical properties of topological matter is a challenging task, not only in theoretical and experimental settings, but also numerically. This work proposes a variational approach based on a time-dependent correlated Ansatz, focusing on the dynamical preparation of a quantum-spin-liquid state on a Rydberg-atom simulator. Within this framework, we are able to faithfully represent the state of the system throughout the entire dynamical preparation protocol. The flexibility of our approach does not only allow one to match the physically correct form of the Rydberg-atom Hamiltonian but also the relevant lattice topology. This is unlike previous numerical studies which were constrained to simplified versions of the problem through the modification of both the Hamiltonian and the lattice. Our approach further gives access to global quantities such as the topological entanglement entropy ($\gamma$), providing insight into the topological properties of the system. This is achieved by the introduction of the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (t-VMC) technique to the dynamics of topologically ordered phases. Upon employing a Jastrow variational Ansatz with a scalable number of parameters, we are able to efficiently extend our simulations to system sizes matching state-of-the-art experiments and beyond. Our results corroborate experimental observations, confirming the presence of topological order during the dynamical state-preparation protocol, and additionally deepen our understanding of topological entanglement dynamics. We show that, while the simulated state exhibits (global) topological order and local properties resembling those of a resonating-valence-bond (RVB) state, it lacks the latter's characteristic topological entanglement entropy signature $\gamma = \ln(2)$, irrespective of the degree of adiabaticity of the protocol.</description>

      <title>Analytical evaluations of the Path Integral Monte Carlo thermodynamic and Hamiltonian energies for the harmonic oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By use of the recently derived $universal$ discrete imaginary-time propagator of the harmonic oscillator, both thermodynamic and Hamiltonian energies can be given analytically, and evaluated numerically at each imaginary time step, for $any$ short-time propagator. This work shows that, using only currently known short-time propagators, the Hamiltonian energy can be optimized to the twelfth order, converging to the ground state energy of the harmonic oscillator in as few as three beads. This study makes it absolutely clear that the widely used second-order primitive approximation propagator, when used in computing the thermodynamic energy, converges extremely slowly with increasing number of beads.</description>

      <title>A proposal to demonstrate non-abelian anyons on a NISQ device</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13129v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we present a proposal for realising non-Abelian anyons on a NISQ device. In particular we explore the feasibility of implementing the quantum double model $D(D_4)$. We propose techniques to drastically simplify the circuits for the manipulation and measurements of anyons. Numerical simulations with realistic noise models suggest that current NISQ technology is capable of probing signatures of non-Abelian anyons far beyond elemental properties such as the non-commutativity of braids. In particular, we conclude that experimentally measuring the full modular data of the model is feasible.</description>

      <title>On-chip microwave coherent source with in-situ control of the photon number distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent photon sources are key elements in different applications, ranging from quantum sensing to quantum computing. In the context of circuit quantum electrodynamics, there have been multiple proposals for potential coherent sources of photons, but a well established candidate is still missing. The possibility of designing and engineering superconducting circuits behaving like artificial atoms supports the realization of quantum optics protocols, including microwave photons generation. Here we propose and theoretically investigate a new design that allows a tunable photon injection directly on-chip. The scheme is based on initiating a population inversion in a superconducting circuit that will act as the photon source of one or multiple target resonators. The key novelty of the proposed layout consists in replacing the usual capacitive link between the source and the target cavity with a tunable coupler, with the advantage of having on-demand control on the injected steady-state photons. We validate the dynamical control of the generated coherent states under the effect of an external flux threading the tunable coupler and discuss the possibility of employing this scheme also in the context of multiple bosonic reservoirs.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Floquet dynamics in absorption spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A theory of the absorption of a laser field by an atomic or condensed matter medium is presented for the case where the medium is also interacting with a strong electromagnetic field. The rotating wave approximation is not assumed for the latter. It is shown that in the weak probe limit the Lindblad master equation reduces to a smaller system of linear equations for the relevant steady state coherences. In this limit, the complex susceptibility of the medium can be expressed in terms of individual contributions of decaying dressed states, the latter being eigenstates of a non-Hermitian Floquet Hamiltonian.</description>
