      <title>Unconventional Geometric Phase in Twisted Junction of Cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Originally introduced in optics, the Pancharatnam-Berry phase is a general concept of geometric phase defined for any two interfering polarization states. In electronic systems, however, its counterpart has long been overlooked due to the absence of electron polarization. Here, using large-scale first-principles calculations, we investigate the electronic structure of twisted bilayer Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8. We find spontaneous spin polarization and the emergence of hidden flat bands at the interface between atomic layers. Most notably, we discover an unconventional geometric phase analogous to the Pancharatnam-Berry phase in optics. This electronic geometric phase exerts opposite effects on superconducting currents of opposite chirality, enabling twisted cuprates to act as a filter for chiral superconducting current-even if the ground state itself is non-chiral.</description>

      <title>Flat band surface state superconductivity in thick rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rhombohedral multilayer graphene has recently emerged as a rich platform for studying correlation driven magnetic, topological and superconducting states. While most experimental efforts have focused on devices with N$\leq 9$ layers, the electronic structure of thick rhombohedral graphene features flat-band surface states even in the infinite layer limit. Here, we use layer resolved capacitance measurements to directly detect these surface states for $N\approx 13$ layer rhombohedral graphene devices. Using electronic transport and local magnetometry, we find that the surface states host a variety of ferromagnetic phases, including both valley imbalanced quarter metals and broad regimes of density in which the system spontaneously spin polarizes. We observe several superconducting states localized to a single surface state. These superconductors appear on the unpolarized side of the density-tuned spin transitions, and show strong violations of the Pauli limit consistent with a dominant attractive interaction in the spin-triplet, valley-singlet pairing channel. In contrast to previous studies of rhombohedral multilayers, however, we find that superconductivity can persist to zero displacement field where the system is inversion symmetric. Energetic considerations suggest that superconductivity in this regime is described by the existence of two independent surface superconductors coupled via tunneling through the insulating single crystal graphite bulk.</description>

      <title>Evolution of inhomogeneities in two-dimensional disordered superconductors in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging granularity in superconducting films by tuning disorder is a well-studied topic, both theoretically and experimentally. However, the orbital magnetic field generates a vortex lattice and contributes to the formation of periodic inhomogeneities. Here, we study superconducting films in the simultaneous presence of disorder and a magnetic field, examining how inhomogeneities in various superconducting correlations evolve under these two perturbations. By performing scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) on thin films of \ce{Sr2VO_{3-\text{x}}FeAs} layer structures under both zero and finite orbital magnetic fields, we report impressive similarities between our theoretical results and the experimental findings. Our results have strong implications for identifying the nature of vortices in disordered superconductors, demonstrating a crossover from Abrikosov to Josephson character with increasing disorder, and provide predictive guidance for interpreting STS and current mapping data in complex superconductors.</description>

      <title>A path to high temperature superconductivity via strong short range repulsion in spin polarized band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a two dimensional metal that is spin polarized and with strongly repulsive interaction. The interaction is short-ranged and controlled by a screening plane located a distance $d$ away. We consider the case where $d$ is less than the unit cell spacing $a$. We show that due to Pauli exclusion, a controlled expansion is possible despite the strong repulsion, and in many cases results in pairing. We demonstrate this for a tight-binding model on a triangular lattice with nearest neighbor repulsion. We also treat a second model on the triangular lattice with Wannier orbitals with size comparable to $a$. In this case we find $f$-wave pairing with order unity pairing strength, potentially leading to high $T_c$.</description>

      <title>Magnetically induced Josephson nano-diodes in field-resilient superconducting microwave circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of nonlinear and frequency-tunable superconducting microwave circuits for operation in large magnetic fields is of high relevance for hybrid quantum systems such as spin resonance spectrometers, microwave quantum magnonics, dark matter axion detectors or flux-mediated optomechanics. With these exciting perspectives in mind, we investigate niobium-based circuits with integrated nano-constriction quantum interferometers in magnetic in-plane fields up to several hundred mT. Our experiments reveal an unexpected and pronounced field-induced asymmetry in the bias-flux response of the circuits, which is demonstrated to originate from a field-induced Josephson-diode effect within the nano-constrictions and which considerably enhances the circuit figures of merit in a magnetic field. An intuitive macroscopic Josephson-diode model attributes the effect to inhomogeneous constriction properties and provides us with the diode current-phase relation as a function of the in-plane field. Finally, we demonstrate that in the diode-state the circuit Kerr nonlinearity is bimodal in frequency, not only eliminating alternative explanations for the bias-flux-asymmetries but also being potentially useful for quantum circuit applications. Overall, our report underlines that niobium nano-constriction circuits belong to the most promising candidates for high-field hybrid quantum systems and reveals the untapped potential of combining Josephson nano-diodes with microwave quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Basic cell for a quantum microwave router</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first experimental realization of a scalable basic cell for quantum routing, enabling coherent control and exchange of microwave photons between two spatially separated superconducting waveguides coupled via a single transmon qubit. The cell was characterized at 10 mK with an average input signal of approximately 1 photon at approximately 6 GHz, and with the qubit biased to its optimal point to minimize sensitivity to external magnetic fluctuations. By combining steady-state and time-domain measurements, we reconstructed the key parameters of the system, including qubit relaxation and dephasing, waveguide-qubit couplings, and cross-waveguide photon transfer efficiency. The observed performance is consistent with a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian formalism and demonstrates clear limits set by flux bias, temperature, and photon number, in agreement with flux- and temperature-induced dephasing models. Crucially, the cell operates reliably at the single-photon level, and in the high-photon regime we directly observe photon dressing induced by the qubit. These results establish a versatile platform for studying open quantum system phenomena and pave the way for scalable implementations of quantum routing and network nodes.</description>

      <title>Building 3D superconductor-based Josephson junctions using a via transfer approach</title>

Abstract: The coupling of superconductivity to unconventional materials may lead to novel quantum states and potential applications. Controlling the quality of the superconductor-normal metal interface is of crucial importance to the understanding and engineering of the superconducting proximity effect. In many cases, conventional lithography-based deposition methods introduce undesirable effects. Using the concept of via contact and dry transfer, we have constructed smooth, van der Waals-like contact between 3D superconducting NbN/Pd and graphene with low contact resistance of approximately 130 $\Omega \cdot \mu m$. Gate-tunable supercurrent, Fraunhofer pattern, and Andreev reflections are observed, the properties of which can be understood using an induced superconducting gap $\Delta$' in this planar contact geometry. We discuss potential mechanisms impacting the magnitude of $\Delta$' and suggest ways of further increasing the proximity coupling. This gentle, lithography-free contacting method can be applied to air- and damage-sensitive surfaces to engineer novel superconducting heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Impact of electronic correlations on the superconductivity of high-pressure CeH$_9$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rare-earth superhydrides have attracted considerable attention because of their high critical superconducting temperature under extreme pressures. They are known to have localized valence electrons, implying strong electronic correlations. However, such many-body effects are rarely included in first-principles studies of rare-earth superhydrides because of the complexity of their high-pressure phases. In this work, we use a combined density functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory approach to study both electrons and phonons in the prototypical rare-earth superhydride CeH$_9$, shedding light on the impact of electronic correlations on its critical temperature for phonon-mediated superconductivity. Our findings indicate that electronic correlations result in a larger electronic density at the Fermi level, a bigger superconducting gap, and softer vibrational modes associated with hydrogen atoms. Together, the inclusion of these correlation signatures increases the Migdal-Eliashberg superconducting critical temperature from 47 K to 96 K, close to the measured 95 K. Our results reconcile experimental observations and theoretical predictions for CeH$_9$ and herald a path towards the quantitative modeling of phonon-mediated superconductivity for interacting electron systems.</description>

      <title>Re-entrant unconventional superconductivity induced by rare-earth substitution in Nd1-xEuxNiO2 thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High temperature superconductivity is typically associated with strong coupling and a large superconducting gap, yet these characteristics have not been demonstrated in the nickelates. Here, we provide experimental evidence that Eu substitution in the spacer layer of Nd1-xEuxNiO2 (NENO) thin films enhances the superconducting gap, driving the system toward a strong-coupling regime. This is accompanied by a magnetic-exchange-driven magnetic-field-enhanced superconductivity. We investigate the upper critical magnetic field, Hc2, and superconducting gap of superconducting NENO thin films with x=0.2 to 0.35. Magnetoresistance measurements reveal magnetic-field-enhanced superconductivity in NENO films. We interpret this phenomenon as a result of interaction between magnetic Eu ions and superconducting states in the Ni dx2-y2 orbital. The upper critical magnetic field strongly violates the weak-coupling Pauli limit. Infrared spectroscopy confirms a large gap-to-Tc ratio $2 \Delta k_B T_c \approx 5 - 6$, indicating a stronger coupling pairing mechanism in NENO relative to the Sr-doped NdNiO2. The substitution of Eu in the rare-earth layer provides a method to modify the superconducting gap in Nd-based nickelates, an essential factor in engineering high-Tc superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e-induced gapped phases in twisted nodal superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the emergence of gapped phases driven by the moir\'{e} superlattice that trivialize the topological states in twisted nodal superconductors. The effect arises from umklapp tunneling between non-adjacent Dirac points in momentum space close to specific twist angles or chemical potentials, determined by the Fermi surface geometry. We confirm the robustness of the non-topological phase against interactions with self-consistent calculations and show that this gap competes with the previously predicted topological gapped phases, leading to topological phase transitions. These transitions were overlooked in prior literature, signifying the necessity of modifying the phase diagrams of topological phases exhibited in twisted nodal superconductors with and without an interlayer current. We also estimate the relevant twist angles and discuss experimental signatures, focusing on twisted Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$</description>
