      <title>Cross-system biological image quality enhancement based on the generative adversarial network as a foundation for establishing a multi-institute microscopy cooperative network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality fluorescence imaging of biological systems is limited by processes like photobleaching and phototoxicity, and also in many cases, by limited access to the latest generations of microscopes. Moreover, low temporal resolution can lead to a motion blur effect in living systems. Our work presents a deep learning (DL) generative-adversarial approach to the problem of obtaining high-quality (HQ) images based on their low-quality (LQ) equivalents. We propose a generative-adversarial network (GAN) for contrast transfer between two different separate microscopy systems: a confocal microscope (producing HQ images) and a wide-field fluorescence microscope (producing LQ images). Our model proves that such transfer is possible, allowing us to receive HQ-generated images characterized by low mean squared error (MSE) values, high structural similarity index (SSIM), and high peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values. For our best model in the case of comparing HQ-generated images and HQ-ground truth images, the median values of the metrics are 6x10-4, 0.9413, and 31.87, for MSE, SSIM, and PSNR, respectively. In contrast, in the case of comparison between LQ and HQ ground truth median values of the metrics are equal to 0.0071, 0.8304, and 21.48 for MSE, SSIM, and PSNR respectively. Therefore, we observe a significant increase ranging from 14% to 49% for SSIM and PSNR respectively. These results, together with other single-system cross-modality studies, provide proof of concept for further implementation of a cross-system biological image quality enhancement.</description>

      <title>Integrative Graph-Transformer Framework for Histopathology Whole Slide Image Representation and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In digital pathology, the multiple instance learning (MIL) strategy is widely used in the weakly supervised histopathology whole slide image (WSI) classification task where giga-pixel WSIs are only labeled at the slide level. However, existing attention-based MIL approaches often overlook contextual information and intrinsic spatial relationships between neighboring tissue tiles, while graph-based MIL frameworks have limited power to recognize the long-range dependencies. In this paper, we introduce the integrative graph-transformer framework that simultaneously captures the context-aware relational features and global WSI representations through a novel Graph Transformer Integration (GTI) block. Specifically, each GTI block consists of a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) layer modeling neighboring relations at the local instance level and an efficient global attention model capturing comprehensive global information from extensive feature embeddings. Extensive experiments on three publicly available WSI datasets: TCGA-NSCLC, TCGA-RCC and BRIGHT, demonstrate the superiority of our approach over current state-of-the-art MIL methods, achieving an improvement of 1.0% to 2.6% in accuracy and 0.7%-1.6% in AUROC.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-MRI-Guided PET Image Reconstruction Method Based on a Diffusion Probabilistic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anatomically guided PET reconstruction using MRI information has been shown to have the potential to improve PET image quality. However, these improvements are limited to PET scans with paired MRI information. In this work we employed a diffusion probabilistic model (DPM) to infer T1-weighted-MRI (deep-MRI) images from FDG-PET brain images. We then use the DPM-generated T1w-MRI to guide the PET reconstruction. The model was trained with brain FDG scans, and tested in datasets containing multiple levels of counts. Deep-MRI images appeared somewhat degraded than the acquired MRI images. Regarding PET image quality, volume of interest analysis in different brain regions showed that both PET reconstructed images using the acquired and the deep-MRI images improved image quality compared to OSEM. Same conclusions were found analysing the decimated datasets. A subjective evaluation performed by two physicians confirmed that OSEM scored consistently worse than the MRI-guided PET images and no significant differences were observed between the MRI-guided PET images. This proof of concept shows that it is possible to infer DPM-based MRI imagery to guide the PET reconstruction, enabling the possibility of changing reconstruction parameters such as the strength of the prior on anatomically guided PET reconstruction in the absence of MRI.</description>

      <title>Automated Report Generation for Lung Cytological Images Using a CNN Vision Classifier and Multiple-Transformer Text Decoders: Preliminary Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cytology plays a crucial role in lung cancer diagnosis. Pulmonary cytology involves cell morphological characterization in the specimen and reporting the corresponding findings, which are extremely burdensome tasks. In this study, we propose a report-generation technique for lung cytology images. In total, 71 benign and 135 malignant pulmonary cytology specimens were collected. Patch images were extracted from the captured specimen images, and the findings were assigned to each image as a dataset for report generation. The proposed method consists of a vision model and a text decoder. In the former, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to classify a given image as benign or malignant, and the features related to the image are extracted from the intermediate layer. Independent text decoders for benign and malignant cells are prepared for text generation, and the text decoder switches according to the CNN classification results. The text decoder is configured using a Transformer that uses the features obtained from the CNN for report generation. Based on the evaluation results, the sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 96.4%, respectively, for automated benign and malignant case classification, and the saliency map indicated characteristic benign and malignant areas. The grammar and style of the generated texts were confirmed as correct and in better agreement with gold standard compared to existing LLM-based image-captioning methods and single-text-decoder ablation model. These results indicate that the proposed method is useful for pulmonary cytology classification and reporting.</description>

      <title>Generative Medical Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid advancements in medical image segmentation performance have been significantly driven by the development of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). However, these models introduce high computational demands and often have limited ability to generalize across diverse medical imaging datasets. In this manuscript, we introduce Generative Medical Segmentation (GMS), a novel approach leveraging a generative model for image segmentation. Concretely, GMS employs a robust pre-trained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to derive latent representations of both images and masks, followed by a mapping model that learns the transition from image to mask in the latent space. This process culminates in generating a precise segmentation mask within the image space using the pre-trained VAE decoder. The design of GMS leads to fewer learnable parameters in the model, resulting in a reduced computational burden and enhanced generalization capability. Our extensive experimental analysis across five public datasets in different medical imaging domains demonstrates GMS outperforms existing discriminative segmentation models and has remarkable domain generalization. Our experiments suggest GMS could set a new benchmark for medical image segmentation, offering a scalable and effective solution. GMS implementation and model weights are available at https://github.com/King-HAW/GMS.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Image Transformers for Prostate Cancer Detection from Ultrasound Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PURPOSE: Deep learning methods for classifying prostate cancer (PCa) in ultrasound images typically employ convolutional networks (CNNs) to detect cancer in small regions of interest (ROI) along a needle trace region. However, this approach suffers from weak labelling, since the ground-truth histopathology labels do not describe the properties of individual ROIs. Recently, multi-scale approaches have sought to mitigate this issue by combining the context awareness of transformers with a CNN feature extractor to detect cancer from multiple ROIs using multiple-instance learning (MIL). In this work, we present a detailed study of several image transformer architectures for both ROI-scale and multi-scale classification, and a comparison of the performance of CNNs and transformers for ultrasound-based prostate cancer classification. We also design a novel multi-objective learning strategy that combines both ROI and core predictions to further mitigate label noise. METHODS: We evaluate 3 image transformers on ROI-scale cancer classification, then use the strongest model to tune a multi-scale classifier with MIL. We train our MIL models using our novel multi-objective learning strategy and compare our results to existing baselines. RESULTS: We find that for both ROI-scale and multi-scale PCa detection, image transformer backbones lag behind their CNN counterparts. This deficit in performance is even more noticeable for larger models. When using multi-objective learning, we can improve performance of MIL, with a 77.9% AUROC, a sensitivity of 75.9%, and a specificity of 66.3%. CONCLUSION: Convolutional networks are better suited for modelling sparse datasets of prostate ultrasounds, producing more robust features than transformers in PCa detection. Multi-scale methods remain the best architecture for this task, with multi-objective learning presenting an effective way to improve performance.</description>

      <title>H2ASeg: Hierarchical Adaptive Interaction and Weighting Network for Tumor Segmentation in PET/CT Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) combined with computed tomography (CT) imaging is routinely used in cancer diagnosis and prognosis by providing complementary information. Automatically segmenting tumors in PET/CT images can significantly improve examination efficiency. Traditional multi-modal segmentation solutions mainly rely on concatenation operations for modality fusion, which fail to effectively model the non-linear dependencies between PET and CT modalities. Recent studies have investigated various approaches to optimize the fusion of modality-specific features for enhancing joint representations. However, modality-specific encoders used in these methods operate independently, inadequately leveraging the synergistic relationships inherent in PET and CT modalities, for example, the complementarity between semantics and structure. To address these issues, we propose a Hierarchical Adaptive Interaction and Weighting Network termed H2ASeg to explore the intrinsic cross-modal correlations and transfer potential complementary information. Specifically, we design a Modality-Cooperative Spatial Attention (MCSA) module that performs intra- and inter-modal interactions globally and locally. Additionally, a Target-Aware Modality Weighting (TAMW) module is developed to highlight tumor-related features within multi-modal features, thereby refining tumor segmentation. By embedding these modules across different layers, H2ASeg can hierarchically model cross-modal correlations, enabling a nuanced understanding of both semantic and structural tumor features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of H2ASeg, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on AutoPet-II and Hecktor2022 benchmarks. The code is released at https://github.com/G14nTDo4/H2ASeg.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Segmentation and Classification of Red Blood Cells Using a Large Multi-Scanner Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital pathology has recently been revolutionized by advancements in artificial intelligence, deep learning, and high-performance computing. With its advanced tools, digital pathology can help improve and speed up the diagnostic process, reduce human errors, and streamline the reporting step. In this paper, we report a new large red blood cell (RBC) image dataset and propose a two-stage deep learning framework for RBC image segmentation and classification. The dataset is a highly diverse dataset of more than 100K RBCs containing eight different classes. The dataset, which is considerably larger than any publicly available hematopathology dataset, was labeled independently by two hematopathologists who also manually created masks for RBC cell segmentation. Subsequently, in the proposed framework, first, a U-Net model was trained to achieve automatic RBC image segmentation. Second, an EfficientNetB0 model was trained to classify RBC images into one of the eight classes using a transfer learning approach with a 5X2 cross-validation scheme. An IoU of 98.03% and an average classification accuracy of 96.5% were attained on the test set. Moreover, we have performed experimental comparisons against several prominent CNN models. These comparisons show the superiority of the proposed model with a good balance between performance and computational cost.</description>

      <title>HEMIT: H&amp;E to Multiplex-immunohistochemistry Image Translation with Dual-Branch Pix2pix Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational analysis of multiplexed immunofluorescence histology data is emerging as an important method for understanding the tumour micro-environment in cancer. This work presents HEMIT, a dataset designed for translating Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) sections to multiplex-immunohistochemistry (mIHC) images, featuring DAPI, CD3, and panCK markers. Distinctively, HEMIT's mIHC images are multi-component and cellular-level aligned with H&amp;E, enriching supervised stain translation tasks. To our knowledge, HEMIT is the first publicly available cellular-level aligned dataset that enables H&amp;E to multi-target mIHC image translation. This dataset provides the computer vision community with a valuable resource to develop novel computational methods which have the potential to gain new insights from H&amp;E slide archives.
  We also propose a new dual-branch generator architecture, using residual Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Swin Transformers which achieves better translation outcomes than other popular algorithms. When evaluated on HEMIT, it outperforms pix2pixHD, pix2pix, U-Net, and ResNet, achieving the highest overall score on key metrics including the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), Pearson correlation score (R), and Peak signal-to-noise Ratio (PSNR). Additionally, downstream analysis has been used to further validate the quality of the generated mIHC images. These results set a new benchmark in the field of stain translation tasks.</description>

      <title>CT-3DFlow : Leveraging 3D Normalizing Flows for Unsupervised Detection of Pathological Pulmonary CT scans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised pathology detection can be implemented by training a model on healthy data only and measuring the deviation from the training set upon inference, for example with CNN-based feature extraction and one-class classifiers, or reconstruction-score-based methods such as AEs, GANs and Diffusion models. Normalizing Flows (NF) have the ability to directly learn the probability distribution of training examples through an invertible architecture. We leverage this property in a novel 3D NF-based model named CT-3DFlow, specifically tailored for patient-level pulmonary pathology detection in chest CT data. Our model is trained unsupervised on healthy 3D pulmonary CT patches, and detects deviations from its log-likelihood distribution as anomalies. We aggregate patches-level likelihood values from a patient's CT scan to provide a patient-level 'normal'/'abnormal' prediction. Out-of-distribution detection performance is evaluated using expert annotations on a separate chest CT test dataset, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Bound-Guided Hierarchical VAE for Neural Image Codecs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies reveal a significant theoretical link between variational autoencoders (VAEs) and rate-distortion theory, notably in utilizing VAEs to estimate the theoretical upper bound of the information rate-distortion function of images. Such estimated theoretical bounds substantially exceed the performance of existing neural image codecs (NICs). To narrow this gap, we propose a theoretical bound-guided hierarchical VAE (BG-VAE) for NIC. The proposed BG-VAE leverages the theoretical bound to guide the NIC model towards enhanced performance. We implement the BG-VAE using Hierarchical VAEs and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments. Along with advanced neural network blocks, we provide a versatile, variable-rate NIC that outperforms existing methods when considering both rate-distortion performance and computational complexity. The code is available at BG-VAE.</description>

Abstract: We performed pairwise comparisons by human raters of JPEG images from MozJPEG, libjpeg-turbo and our new Jpegli encoder. When compressing images at a quality similar to libjpeg-turbo quality 95, the Jpegli images were 54% likely to be preferred over both libjpeg-turbo and MozJPEG images, but used only 2.8 bits per pixel compared to libjpeg-turbo and MozJPEG that used 3.8 and 3.5 bits per pixel respectively. The raw ratings and source images are publicly available for further analysis and study.</description>

      <title>Do High-Performance Image-to-Image Translation Networks Enable the Discovery of Radiomic Features? Application to MRI Synthesis from Ultrasound in Prostate Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the foundational characteristics of image-to-image translation networks, specifically examining their suitability and transferability within the context of routine clinical environments, despite achieving high levels of performance, as indicated by a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) exceeding 0.95. The evaluation study was conducted using data from 794 patients diagnosed with Prostate cancer. To synthesize MRI from Ultrasound images, we employed five widely recognized image to image translation networks in medical imaging: 2DPix2Pix, 2DCycleGAN, 3DCycleGAN, 3DUNET, and 3DAutoEncoder. For quantitative assessment, we report four prevalent evaluation metrics Mean Absolute Error, Mean Square Error, Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio. Moreover, a complementary analysis employing Radiomic features (RF) via Spearman correlation coefficient was conducted to investigate, for the first time, whether networks achieving high performance, SSIM greater than 0.9, could identify low-level RFs. The RF analysis showed 76 features out of 186 RFs were discovered via just 2DPix2Pix algorithm while half of RFs were lost in the translation process. Finally, a detailed qualitative assessment by five medical doctors indicated a lack of low level feature discovery in image to image translation tasks.</description>

      <title>A vascular synthetic model for improved aneurysm segmentation and detection via Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We hereby present a full synthetic model, able to mimic the various constituents of the cerebral vascular tree: the cerebral arteries, the bifurcations and the intracranial aneurysms. By building this model, our goal was to provide a substantial dataset of brain arteries which could be used by a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to either segment or detect/recognize various vascular diseases (such as artery dissection/thrombosis) or even some portions of the cerebral vasculature, such as the bifurcations or aneurysms. In this study, we will particularly focus on Intra-Cranial Aneurysm (ICA) detection and segmentation. The cerebral aneurysms most often occur on a particular structure of the vascular tree named the Circle of Willis. Various studies have been conducted to detect and monitor the ICAs and those based on Deep Learning (DL) achieve the best performances. Specifically, in this work, we propose a full synthetic 3D model able to mimic the brain vasculature as acquired by Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA), and more particularly the Time Of Flight (TOF) principle. Among the various MRI modalities, the MRA-TOF allows to have a relatively good rendering of the blood vessels and is non-invasive (no contrast liquid injection). Our model has been designed to simultaneously mimic the arteries geometry, the ICA shape and the background noise. The geometry of the vascular tree is modeled thanks to an interpolation with 3D Spline functions, and the statistical properties of the background MRI noise is collected from MRA acquisitions and reproduced within the model. In this work, we thoroughly describe the synthetic vasculature model, we build up a neural network designed for ICA segmentation and detection, and finally, we carry out an in-depth evaluation of the performance gap gained thanks to the synthetic model data augmentation.</description>

      <title>Interpretable cancer cell detection with phonon microscopy using multi-task conditional neural networks for inter-batch calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) show great potential in revealing underlying information from phonon microscopy (high-frequency ultrasound) data to identify cancerous cells. However, this technology suffers from the 'batch effect' that comes from unavoidable technical variations between each experiment, creating confounding variables that the AI model may inadvertently learn. We therefore present a multi-task conditional neural network framework to simultaneously achieve inter-batch calibration, by removing confounding variables, and accurate cell classification of time-resolved phonon-derived signals. We validate our approach by training and validating on different experimental batches, achieving a balanced precision of 89.22% and an average cross-validated precision of 89.07% for classifying background, healthy and cancerous regions. Classification can be performed in 0.5 seconds with only simple prior batch information required for multiple batch corrections. Further, we extend our model to reconstruct denoised signals, enabling physical interpretation of salient features indicating disease state including sound velocity, sound attenuation and cell-adhesion to substrate.</description>

      <title>R2D2 image reconstruction with model uncertainty quantification in radio astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ``Residual-to-Residual DNN series for high-Dynamic range imaging'' (R2D2) approach was recently introduced for Radio-Interferometric (RI) imaging in astronomy. R2D2's reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images, iteratively estimated as outputs of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) taking the previous iteration's image estimate and associated data residual as inputs. In this work, we investigate the robustness of the R2D2 image estimation process, by studying the uncertainty associated with its series of learned models. Adopting an ensemble averaging approach, multiple series can be trained, arising from different random DNN initializations of the training process at each iteration. The resulting multiple R2D2 instances can also be leveraged to generate ``R2D2 samples'', from which empirical mean and standard deviation endow the algorithm with a joint estimation and uncertainty quantification functionality. Focusing on RI imaging, and adopting a telescope-specific approach, multiple R2D2 instances were trained to encompass the most general observation setting of the Very Large Array (VLA). Simulations and real-data experiments confirm that: (i) R2D2's image estimation capability is superior to that of the state-of-the-art algorithms; (ii) its ultra-fast reconstruction capability (arising from series with only few DNNs) makes the computation of multiple reconstruction samples and of uncertainty maps practical even at large image dimension; (iii) it is characterized by a very low model uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Every Shot Counts: Using Exemplars for Repetition Counting in Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video repetition counting infers the number of repetitions of recurring actions or motion within a video. We propose an exemplar-based approach that discovers visual correspondence of video exemplars across repetitions within target videos. Our proposed Every Shot Counts (ESCounts) model is an attention-based encoder-decoder that encodes videos of varying lengths alongside exemplars from the same and different videos. In training, ESCounts regresses locations of high correspondence to the exemplars within the video. In tandem, our method learns a latent that encodes representations of general repetitive motions, which we use for exemplar-free, zero-shot inference. Extensive experiments over commonly used datasets (RepCount, Countix, and UCFRep) showcase ESCounts obtaining state-of-the-art performance across all three datasets. On RepCount, ESCounts increases the off-by-one from 0.39 to 0.56 and decreases the mean absolute error from 0.38 to 0.21. Detailed ablations further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Image Deraining via Self-supervised Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quality of images captured outdoors is often affected by the weather. One factor that interferes with sight is rain, which can obstruct the view of observers and computer vision applications that rely on those images. The work aims to recover rain images by removing rain streaks via Self-supervised Reinforcement Learning (RL) for image deraining (SRL-Derain). We locate rain streak pixels from the input rain image via dictionary learning and use pixel-wise RL agents to take multiple inpainting actions to remove rain progressively. To our knowledge, this work is the first attempt where self-supervised RL is applied to image deraining. Experimental results on several benchmark image-deraining datasets show that the proposed SRL-Derain performs favorably against state-of-the-art few-shot and self-supervised deraining and denoising methods.</description>

      <title>Direct mineral content prediction from drill core images via transfer learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep subsurface exploration is important for mining, oil and gas industries, as well as in the assessment of geological units for the disposal of chemical or nuclear waste, or the viability of geothermal energy systems. Typically, detailed examinations of subsurface formations or units are performed on cuttings or core materials extracted during drilling campaigns, as well as on geophysical borehole data, which provide detailed information about the petrophysical properties of the rocks. Depending on the volume of rock samples and the analytical program, the laboratory analysis and diagnostics can be very time-consuming. This study investigates the potential of utilizing machine learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN), to assess the lithology and mineral content solely from analysis of drill core images, aiming to support and expedite the subsurface geological exploration. The paper outlines a comprehensive methodology, encompassing data preprocessing, machine learning methods, and transfer learning techniques. The outcome reveals a remarkable 96.7% accuracy in the classification of drill core segments into distinct formation classes. Furthermore, a CNN model was trained for the evaluation of mineral content using a learning data set from multidimensional log analysis data (silicate, total clay, carbonate). When benchmarked against laboratory XRD measurements on samples from the cores, both the advanced multidimensional log analysis model and the neural network approach developed here provide equally good performance. This work demonstrates that deep learning and particularly transfer learning can support extracting petrophysical properties, including mineral content and formation classification, from drill core images, thus offering a road map for enhancing model performance and data set quality in image-based analysis of drill cores.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Limitations with Sparse Inputs by Variational Frameworks (BLIss) in Terahertz Super-Resolution 3D Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data acquisition, image processing, and image quality are the long-lasting issues for terahertz (THz) 3D reconstructed imaging. Existing methods are primarily designed for 2D scenarios, given the challenges associated with obtaining super-resolution (SR) data and the absence of an efficient SR 3D reconstruction framework in conventional computed tomography (CT). Here, we demonstrate BLIss, a new approach for THz SR 3D reconstruction with sparse 2D data input. BLIss seamlessly integrates conventional CT techniques and variational framework with the core of the adapted Euler-Elastica-based model. The quantitative 3D image evaluation metrics, including the standard deviation of Gaussian, mean curvatures, and the multi-scale structural similarity index measure (MS-SSIM), validate the superior smoothness and fidelity achieved with our variational framework approach compared with conventional THz CT modal. Beyond its contributions to advancing THz SR 3D reconstruction, BLIss demonstrates potential applicability in other imaging modalities, such as X-ray and MRI. This suggests extensive impacts on the broader field of imaging applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wide-angle cameras are widely used in photogrammetry and autonomous systems which rely on the accurate metric measurements derived from images. To find the geometric relationship between incoming rays and image pixels, geometric camera calibration (GCC) has been actively developed. Aiming to provide practical calibration guidelines, this work surveys the existing GCC tools and evaluates the representative ones for wide-angle cameras. The survey covers camera models, calibration targets, and algorithms used in these tools, highlighting their properties and the trends in GCC development. The evaluation compares six target-based GCC tools, namely, BabelCalib, Basalt, Camodocal, Kalibr, the MATLAB calibrator, and the OpenCV-based ROS calibrator, with simulated and real data for wide-angle cameras described by four parametric projection models. These tests reveal the strengths and weaknesses of these camera models, as well as the repeatability of these GCC tools. In view of the survey and evaluation, future research directions of wide-angle GCC are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: Brain metastases are a complication of primary cancer, representing the most common type of brain tumor in adults. The management of multiple brain metastases represents a clinical challenge worldwide in finding the optimal treatment for patients considering various individual aspects. Managing multiple metastases with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is being increasingly used because of quality of life and neurocognitive preservation, which do not present such good outcomes when dealt with whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT). After treatment, analyzing the progression of the disease still represents a clinical issue, since it is difficult to determine a standard schedule for image acquisition. A solution could be the applying artificial intelligence, namely predictive models to forecast the incidence of new metastases in post-treatment images. Although there aren't many works on this subject, this could potentially bennefit medical professionals in early decision of the best treatment approaches.</description>

Abstract: Undoubtedly breast cancer identifies itself as one of the most widespread and terrifying cancers across the globe. Millions of women are getting affected each year from it. Breast cancer remains the major one for being the reason of largest number of demise of women. In the recent time of research, Medical Image Computing and Processing has been playing a significant role for detecting and classifying breast cancers from ultrasound images and mammograms, along with the celestial touch of deep neural networks. In this research, we focused mostly on our rigorous implementations and iterative result analysis of different cutting-edge modified versions of EfficientNet architectures namely EfficientNet-V1 (b0-b7) and EfficientNet-V2 (b0-b3) with ultrasound image, named as CEIMVEN. We utilized transfer learning approach here for using the pre-trained models of EfficientNet versions. We activated the hyper-parameter tuning procedures, added fully connected layers, discarded the unprecedented outliers and recorded the accuracy results from our custom modified EfficientNet architectures. Our deep learning model training approach was related to both identifying the cancer affected areas with region of interest (ROI) techniques and multiple classifications (benign, malignant and normal). The approximate testing accuracies we got from the modified versions of EfficientNet-V1 (b0- 99.15%, b1- 98.58%, b2- 98.43%, b3- 98.01%, b4- 98.86%, b5- 97.72%, b6- 97.72%, b7- 98.72%) and EfficientNet-V2 (b0- 99.29%, b1- 99.01%, b2- 98.72%, b3- 99.43%) are showing very bright future and strong potentials of deep learning approach for the successful detection and classification of breast cancers from the ultrasound images at a very early stage.

      <title>A2V: A Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation Framework for Brain Vessel Segmentation via Two-Phase Training Angiography-to-Venography Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a semi-supervised domain adaptation framework for brain vessel segmentation from different image modalities. Existing state-of-the-art methods focus on a single modality, despite the wide range of available cerebrovascular imaging techniques. This can lead to significant distribution shifts that negatively impact the generalization across modalities. By relying on annotated angiographies and a limited number of annotated venographies, our framework accomplishes image-to-image translation and semantic segmentation, leveraging a disentangled and semantically rich latent space to represent heterogeneous data and perform image-level adaptation from source to target domains. Moreover, we reduce the typical complexity of cycle-based architectures and minimize the use of adversarial training, which allows us to build an efficient and intuitive model with stable training. We evaluate our method on magnetic resonance angiographies and venographies. While achieving state-of-the-art performance in the source domain, our method attains a Dice score coefficient in the target domain that is only 8.9% lower, highlighting its promising potential for robust cerebrovascular image segmentation across different modalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10345v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learned image compression (LIC) is becoming more and more popular these years with its high efficiency and outstanding compression quality. Still, the practicality against modified inputs added with specific noise could not be ignored. White-box attacks such as FGSM and PGD use only gradient to compute adversarial images that mislead LIC models to output unexpected results. Our experiments compare the effects of different dimensions such as attack methods, models, qualities, and targets, concluding that in the worst case, there is a 61.55% decrease in PSNR or a 19.15 times increase in bpp under the PGD attack. To improve their robustness, we conduct adversarial training by adding adversarial images into the training datasets, which obtains a 95.52% decrease in the R-D cost of the most vulnerable LIC model. We further test the robustness of H.266, whose better performance on reconstruction quality extends its possibility to defend one-step or iterative adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Data Consistency with Diffusion Purification for Image Restoration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06054v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained traction as a powerful class of deep generative priors, excelling in a wide range of image restoration tasks due to their exceptional ability to model data distributions. To solve image restoration problems, many existing techniques achieve data consistency by incorporating additional likelihood gradient steps into the reverse sampling process of diffusion models. However, the additional gradient steps pose a challenge for real-world practical applications as they incur a large computational overhead, thereby increasing inference time. They also present additional difficulties when using accelerated diffusion model samplers, as the number of data consistency steps is limited by the number of reverse sampling steps. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based image restoration solver that addresses these issues by decoupling the reverse process from the data consistency steps. Our method involves alternating between a reconstruction phase to maintain data consistency and a refinement phase that enforces the prior via diffusion purification. Our approach demonstrates versatility, making it highly adaptable for efficient problem-solving in latent space. Additionally, it reduces the necessity for numerous sampling steps through the integration of consistency models. The efficacy of our approach is validated through comprehensive experiments across various image restoration tasks, including image denoising, deblurring, inpainting, and super-resolution.</description>

      <title>Step-Calibrated Diffusion for Biomedical Optical Image Restoration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-quality, high-resolution medical imaging is essential for clinical care. Raman-based biomedical optical imaging uses non-ionizing infrared radiation to evaluate human tissues in real time and is used for early cancer detection, brain tumor diagnosis, and intraoperative tissue analysis. Unfortunately, optical imaging is vulnerable to image degradation due to laser scattering and absorption, which can result in diagnostic errors and misguided treatment. Restoration of optical images is a challenging computer vision task because the sources of image degradation are multi-factorial, stochastic, and tissue-dependent, preventing a straightforward method to obtain paired low-quality/high-quality data. Here, we present Restorative Step-Calibrated Diffusion (RSCD), an unpaired image restoration method that views the image restoration problem as completing the finishing steps of a diffusion-based image generation task. RSCD uses a step calibrator model to dynamically determine the severity of image degradation and the number of steps required to complete the reverse diffusion process for image restoration. RSCD outperforms other widely used unpaired image restoration methods on both image quality and perceptual evaluation metrics for restoring optical images. Medical imaging experts consistently prefer images restored using RSCD in blinded comparison experiments and report minimal to no hallucinations. Finally, we show that RSCD improves performance on downstream clinical imaging tasks, including automated brain tumor diagnosis and deep tissue imaging. Our code is available at https://github.com/MLNeurosurg/restorative_step-calibrated_diffusion.</description>

Abstract: The effectiveness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) heavily relies on the abundance and accuracy of available training data. However, collecting and annotating data on a large scale is often both costly and time-intensive, particularly in medical cases where practitioners are already occupied with their duties. Moreover, ensuring that the model remains robust across various scenarios of image capture is crucial in medical domains, especially when dealing with ultrasound images that vary based on the settings of different devices and the manual operation of the transducer. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel pipeline called MEDDAP, which leverages Stable Diffusion (SD) models to augment existing small datasets by automatically generating new informative labeled samples. Pretrained checkpoints for SD are typically based on natural images, and training them for medical images requires significant GPU resources due to their heavy parameters. To overcome this challenge, we introduce USLoRA (Ultrasound Low-Rank Adaptation), a novel fine-tuning method tailored specifically for ultrasound applications. USLoRA allows for selective fine-tuning of weights within SD, requiring fewer than 0.1\% of parameters compared to fully fine-tuning only the UNet portion of SD. To enhance dataset diversity, we incorporate different adjectives into the generation process prompts, thereby desensitizing the classifiers to intensity changes across different images. This approach is inspired by clinicians' decision-making processes regarding breast tumors, where tumor shape often plays a more crucial role than intensity. In conclusion, our pipeline not only outperforms classifiers trained on the original dataset but also demonstrates superior performance when encountering unseen datasets.

Abstract: We propose a new approach for non-Cartesian magnetic resonance image reconstruction. While unrolled architectures provide robustness via data-consistency layers, embedding measurement operators in Deep Neural Network (DNN) can become impractical at large scale. Alternative Plug-and-Play (PnP) approaches, where the denoising DNNs are blind to the measurement setting, are not affected by this limitation and have also proven effective, but their highly iterative nature also affects scalability. To address this scalability challenge, we leverage the "Residual-to-Residual DNN series for high-Dynamic range imaging (R2D2)" approach recently introduced in astronomical imaging. R2D2's reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images, iteratively estimated as outputs of DNNs taking the previous iteration's image estimate and associated data residual as inputs. The method can be interpreted as a learned version of the Matching Pursuit algorithm. We demonstrate R2D2 in simulation, considering radial k-space sampling acquisition sequences. Our preliminary results suggest that R2D2 achieves: (i) suboptimal performance compared to its unrolled incarnation R2D2-Net, which is however non-scalable due to the necessary embedding of NUFFT-based data-consistency layers; (ii) superior reconstruction quality to a scalable version of R2D2-Net embedding an FFT-based approximation for data consistency; (iii) superior reconstruction quality to PnP, while only requiring few iterations.</description>
