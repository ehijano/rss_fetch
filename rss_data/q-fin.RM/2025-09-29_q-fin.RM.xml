      <title>General CoVaR Based on Entropy Pooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a general CoVaR framework that extends the traditional CoVaR by incorporating diverse expert views and information, such as asset moment characteristics, quantile insights, and perspectives on the relative loss distribution between two assets. To integrate these expert views effectively while minimizing deviations from the prior distribution, we employ the entropy pooling method to derive the posterior distribution, which in turn enables us to compute the general CoVaR. Assuming bivariate normal distributions, we derive its analytical expressions under various perspectives. Sensitivity analysis reveals that CoVaR exhibits a linear relationship with both the expectations of the variables in the views and the differences in expectations between them. In contrast, CoVaR shows nonlinear dependencies with respect to the variance, quantiles, and correlation within these views.
  Empirical analysis of the US banking system during the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes demonstrates the effectiveness of the general CoVaR when expert views are appropriately specified. Furthermore, we extend this framework to the general $\Delta$CoVaR, which allows for the assessment of risk spillover effects from various perspectives.</description>

      <title>Causal analysis of extreme risk in a network of industry portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive review of causal dependence through a max-linear structural equation model. Such models express each node variable as a max-linear function of its parental node variables in a directed acyclic graph and some exogenous innovation. We reformulate results on structure learning and estimation, which we apply to a network of financial data. A new method, based on hard-thresholding and on the Hamming distance, estimates a sparse DAG for extreme risk~propagation.</description>

      <title>Design and hedging of unit linked life insurance with environmental factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of designing and hedging unit-linked life policies whose benefits depend on an investment fund that incorporates environmental criteria in its selection process. Offering these products poses two key challenges: constructing a green investment fund and developing a hedging strategy for policies written on that fund. We address these two problems separately. First, we design a portfolio selection rule driven by firms' carbon intensity that endogenously selects assets and avoids ad hoc pre-screens based on ESG scores. The effectiveness of our new portfolio selection method is tested using real market data. Second, we adopt the perspective of an insurance company issuing unit-linked policies written on this fund. Such contracts are exposed to market, carbon, and mortality risk, which the insurer seeks to hedge. Due to market incompleteness, we address the hedging problem via a quadratic approach aimed at minimizing the tracking error. We also make a numerical analysis to assess the performance of the hedging strategy. For our simulation study, we use an efficient weak second-order scheme that allows for variance reduction.</description>
