      <title>CodeEdu: A Multi-Agent Collaborative Platform for Personalized Coding Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable potential in improving coding education by providing support for code writing, explanation, and debugging. However, existing LLM-based approaches generally fail to assess students' abilities, design learning plans, provide personalized material aligned with individual learning goals, and enable interactive learning. Current work mostly uses single LLM agents, which limits their ability to understand complex code repositories and schedule step-by-step tutoring. Recent research has shown that multi-agent LLMs can collaborate to solve complicated problems in various domains like software engineering, but their potential in the field of education remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce CodeEdu, an innovative multi-agent collaborative platform that combines LLMs with tool use to provide proactive and personalized education in coding. Unlike static pipelines, CodeEdu dynamically allocates agents and tasks to meet student needs. Various agents in CodeEdu undertake certain functions specifically, including task planning, personalized material generation, real-time QA, step-by-step tutoring, code execution, debugging, and learning report generation, facilitated with extensive external tools to improve task efficiency. Automated evaluations reveal that CodeEdu substantially enhances students' coding performance.</description>

      <title>H-NeiFi: Non-Invasive and Consensus-Efficient Multi-Agent Opinion Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The openness of social media enables the free exchange of opinions, but it also presents challenges in guiding opinion evolution towards global consensus. Existing methods often directly modify user views or enforce cross-group connections. These intrusive interventions undermine user autonomy, provoke psychological resistance, and reduce the efficiency of global consensus. Additionally, due to the lack of a long-term perspective, promoting local consensus often exacerbates divisions at the macro level. To address these issues, we propose the hierarchical, non-intrusive opinion guidance framework, H-NeiFi. It first establishes a two-layer dynamic model based on social roles, considering the behavioral characteristics of both experts and non-experts. Additionally, we introduce a non-intrusive neighbor filtering method that adaptively controls user communication channels. Using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), we optimize information propagation paths through a long-term reward function, avoiding direct interference with user interactions. Experiments show that H-NeiFi increases consensus speed by 22.0% to 30.7% and maintains global convergence even in the absence of experts. This approach enables natural and efficient consensus guidance by protecting user interaction autonomy, offering a new paradigm for social network governance.</description>

      <title>From Firms to Computation: AI Governance and the Evolution of Institutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of agential artificial intelligence into socioeconomic systems requires us to reexamine the evolutionary processes that describe changes in our economic institutions. This article synthesizes three frameworks: multi-level selection theory, Aoki's view of firms as computational processes, and Ostrom's design principles for robust institutions. We develop a framework where selection operates concurrently across organizational levels, firms implement distributed inference via game-theoretic architectures, and Ostrom-style rules evolve as alignment mechanisms that address AI-related risks. This synthesis yields a multi-level Price equation expressed over nested games, providing quantitative metrics for how selection and governance co-determine economic outcomes. We examine connections to Acemoglu's work on inclusive institutions, analyze how institutional structures shape AI deployment, and demonstrate the framework's explanatory power via case studies. We conclude by proposing a set of design principles that operationalize alignment between humans and AI across institutional layers, enabling scalable, adaptive, and inclusive governance of agential AI systems. We conclude with practical policy recommendations and further research to extend these principles into real-world implementation.</description>

      <title>Scalable Submodular Policy Optimization via Pruned Submodularity Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Reinforcement Learning (abbreviated as RL), an agent interacts with the environment via a set of possible actions, and a reward is generated from some unknown distribution. The task here is to find an optimal set of actions such that the reward after a certain time step gets maximized. In a traditional setup, the reward function in an RL Problem is considered additive. However, in reality, there exist many problems, including path planning, coverage control, etc., the reward function follows the diminishing return, which can be modeled as a submodular function. In this paper, we study a variant of the RL Problem where the reward function is submodular, and our objective is to find an optimal policy such that this reward function gets maximized. We have proposed a pruned submodularity graph-based approach that provides a provably approximate solution in a feasible computation time. The proposed approach has been analyzed to understand its time and space requirements as well as a performance guarantee. We have experimented with a benchmark agent-environment setup, which has been used for similar previous studies, and the results are reported. From the results, we observe that the policy obtained by our proposed approach leads to more reward than the baseline methods.</description>

      <title>A Minimalist Controller for Autonomously Self-Aggregating Robotic Swarms: Enabling Compact Formations in Multitasking Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of simple emergent behaviors in swarm robotics has been well-rehearsed in the literature. A recent study has shown how self-aggregation is possible in a multitask approach -- where multiple self-aggregation task instances occur concurrently in the same environment. The multitask approach poses new challenges, in special, how the dynamic of each group impacts the performance of others. So far, the multitask self-aggregation of groups of robots suffers from generating a circular formation -- that is not fully compact -- or is not fully autonomous. In this paper, we present a multitask self-aggregation where groups of homogeneous robots sort themselves into different compact clusters, relying solely on a line-of-sight sensor. Our multitask self-aggregation behavior was able to scale well and achieve a compact formation. We report scalability results from a series of simulation trials with different configurations in the number of groups and the number of robots per group. We were able to improve the multitask self-aggregation behavior performance in terms of the compactness of the clusters, keeping the proportion of clustered robots found in other studies.</description>

      <title>Acceleration of Gossip Algorithms through the Euler-Poisson-Darboux Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.10742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gossip algorithms and their accelerated versions have been studied exclusively in discrete time on graphs. In this work, we take a different approach, and consider the scaling limit of gossip algorithms in both large graphs and large number of iterations. These limits lead to well-known partial differential equations (PDEs) with insightful properties. On lattices, we prove that the non-accelerated gossip algorithm of Boyd et al. [2006] converges to the heat equation, and the accelerated Jacobi polynomial iteration of Berthier et al. [2020] converges to the Euler-Poisson-Darboux (EPD) equation - a damped wave equation. Remarkably, with appropriate parameters, the fundamental solution of the EPD equation has the ideal gossip behaviour: a uniform density over an ellipsoid, whose radius increases at a rate proportional to t - the fastest possible rate for locally communicating gossip algorithms. This is in contrast with the heat equation where the density spreads on a typical scale of $\sqrt{t}$. Additionally, we provide simulations demonstrating that the gossip algorithms are accurately approximated by their limiting PDEs.</description>

      <title>Agentic Neural Networks: Self-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems via Textual Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging multiple Large Language Models(LLMs) has proven effective for addressing complex, high-dimensional tasks, but current approaches often rely on static, manually engineered multi-agent configurations. To overcome these constraints, we present the Agentic Neural Network(ANN), a framework that conceptualizes multi-agent collaboration as a layered neural network architecture. In this design, each agent operates as a node, and each layer forms a cooperative "team" focused on a specific subtask. Agentic Neural Network follows a two-phase optimization strategy: (1) Forward Phase-Drawing inspiration from neural network forward passes, tasks are dynamically decomposed into subtasks, and cooperative agent teams with suitable aggregation methods are constructed layer by layer. (2) Backward Phase-Mirroring backpropagation, we refine both global and local collaboration through iterative feedback, allowing agents to self-evolve their roles, prompts, and coordination. This neuro-symbolic approach enables ANN to create new or specialized agent teams post-training, delivering notable gains in accuracy and adaptability. Across four benchmark datasets, ANN surpasses leading multi-agent baselines under the same configurations, showing consistent performance improvements. Our findings indicate that ANN provides a scalable, data-driven framework for multi-agent systems, combining the collaborative capabilities of LLMs with the efficiency and flexibility of neural network principles. We plan to open-source the entire framework.</description>
