      <title>YuE: Scaling Open Foundation Models for Long-Form Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We tackle the task of long-form music generation--particularly the challenging \textbf{lyrics-to-song} problem--by introducing YuE, a family of open foundation models based on the LLaMA2 architecture. Specifically, YuE scales to trillions of tokens and generates up to five minutes of music while maintaining lyrical alignment, coherent musical structure, and engaging vocal melodies with appropriate accompaniment. It achieves this through (1) track-decoupled next-token prediction to overcome dense mixture signals, (2) structural progressive conditioning for long-context lyrical alignment, and (3) a multitask, multiphase pre-training recipe to converge and generalize. In addition, we redesign the in-context learning technique for music generation, enabling versatile style transfer (e.g., converting Japanese city pop into an English rap while preserving the original accompaniment) and bidirectional generation. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that YuE matches or even surpasses some of the proprietary systems in musicality and vocal agility. In addition, fine-tuning YuE enables additional controls and enhanced support for tail languages. Furthermore, beyond generation, we show that YuE's learned representations can perform well on music understanding tasks, where the results of YuE match or exceed state-of-the-art methods on the MARBLE benchmark.

      <title>Boundary Regression for Leitmotif Detection in Music Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leitmotifs are musical phrases that are reprised in various forms throughout a piece. Due to diverse variations and instrumentation, detecting the occurrence of leitmotifs from audio recordings is a highly challenging task. Leitmotif detection may be handled as a subcategory of audio event detection, where leitmotif activity is predicted at the frame level. However, as leitmotifs embody distinct, coherent musical structures, a more holistic approach akin to bounding box regression in visual object detection can be helpful. This method captures the entirety of a motif rather than fragmenting it into individual frames, thereby preserving its musical integrity and producing more useful predictions. We present our experimental results on tackling leitmotif detection as a boundary regression task.</description>

      <title>FilmComposer: LLM-Driven Music Production for Silent Film Clips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we implement music production for silent film clips using LLM-driven method. Given the strong professional demands of film music production, we propose the FilmComposer, simulating the actual workflows of professional musicians. FilmComposer is the first to combine large generative models with a multi-agent approach, leveraging the advantages of both waveform music and symbolic music generation. Additionally, FilmComposer is the first to focus on the three core elements of music production for film-audio quality, musicality, and musical development-and introduces various controls, such as rhythm, semantics, and visuals, to enhance these key aspects. Specifically, FilmComposer consists of the visual processing module, rhythm-controllable MusicGen, and multi-agent assessment, arrangement and mix. In addition, our framework can seamlessly integrate into the actual music production pipeline and allows user intervention in every step, providing strong interactivity and a high degree of creative freedom. Furthermore, we propose MusicPro-7k which includes 7,418 film clips, music, description, rhythm spots and main melody, considering the lack of a professional and high-quality film music dataset. Finally, both the standard metrics and the new specialized metrics we propose demonstrate that the music generated by our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality, consistency with video, diversity, musicality, and musical development.

      <title>ESPnet-SDS: Unified Toolkit and Demo for Spoken Dialogue Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in audio foundation models (FMs) have fueled interest in end-to-end (E2E) spoken dialogue systems, but different web interfaces for each system makes it challenging to compare and contrast them effectively. Motivated by this, we introduce an open-source, user-friendly toolkit designed to build unified web interfaces for various cascaded and E2E spoken dialogue systems. Our demo further provides users with the option to get on-the-fly automated evaluation metrics such as (1) latency, (2) ability to understand user input, (3) coherence, diversity, and relevance of system response, and (4) intelligibility and audio quality of system output. Using the evaluation metrics, we compare various cascaded and E2E spoken dialogue systems with a human-human conversation dataset as a proxy. Our analysis demonstrates that the toolkit allows researchers to effortlessly compare and contrast different technologies, providing valuable insights such as current E2E systems having poorer audio quality and less diverse responses. An example demo produced using our toolkit is publicly available here: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Siddhant/Voice_Assistant_Demo.</description>

      <title>Mellow: a small audio language model for reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Audio-Language Models (ALMs) can understand and reason over both audio and text. Typically, reasoning performance correlates with model size, with the best results achieved by models exceeding 8 billion parameters. However, no prior work has explored enabling small audio-language models to perform reasoning tasks, despite the potential applications for edge devices. To address this gap, we introduce Mellow, a small Audio-Language Model specifically designed for reasoning. Mellow achieves state-of-the-art performance among existing small audio-language models and surpasses several larger models in reasoning capabilities. For instance, Mellow scores 52.11 on MMAU, comparable to SoTA Qwen2 Audio (which scores 52.5) while using 50 times fewer parameters and being trained on 60 times less data (audio hrs). To train Mellow, we introduce ReasonAQA, a dataset designed to enhance audio-grounded reasoning in models. It consists of a mixture of existing datasets (30% of the data) and synthetically generated data (70%). The synthetic dataset is derived from audio captioning datasets, where Large Language Models (LLMs) generate detailed and multiple-choice questions focusing on audio events, objects, acoustic scenes, signal properties, semantics, and listener emotions. To evaluate Mellow's reasoning ability, we benchmark it on a diverse set of tasks, assessing on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, including audio understanding, deductive reasoning, and comparative reasoning. Finally, we conduct extensive ablation studies to explore the impact of projection layer choices, synthetic data generation methods, and language model pretraining on reasoning performance. Our training dataset, findings, and baseline pave the way for developing small ALMs capable of reasoning.</description>

      <title>MAD Speech: Measures of Acoustic Diversity of Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative spoken language models produce speech in a wide range of voices, prosody, and recording conditions, seemingly approaching the diversity of natural speech. However, the extent to which generated speech is acoustically diverse remains unclear due to a lack of appropriate metrics. We address this gap by developing lightweight metrics of acoustic diversity, which we collectively refer to as MAD Speech. We focus on measuring five facets of acoustic diversity: voice, gender, emotion, accent, and background noise. We construct the metrics as a composition of specialized, per-facet embedding models and an aggregation function that measures diversity within the embedding space. Next, we build a series of datasets with a priori known diversity preferences for each facet. Using these datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed metrics achieve a stronger agreement with the ground-truth diversity than baselines. Finally, we showcase the applicability of our proposed metrics across several real-life evaluation scenarios. MAD Speech is made publicly accessible.</description>

      <title>Video-to-Audio Generation with Hidden Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07464v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating semantically and temporally aligned audio content in accordance with video input has become a focal point for researchers, particularly following the remarkable breakthrough in text-to-video generation. In this work, we aim to offer insights into the video-to-audio generation paradigm, focusing on three crucial aspects: vision encoders, auxiliary embeddings, and data augmentation techniques. Beginning with a foundational model built on a simple yet surprisingly effective intuition, we explore various vision encoders and auxiliary embeddings through ablation studies. Employing a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that emphasizes generation quality and video-audio synchronization alignment, we demonstrate that our model exhibits state-of-the-art video-to-audio generation capabilities. Furthermore, we provide critical insights into the impact of different data augmentation methods on enhancing the generation framework's overall capacity. We showcase possibilities to advance the challenge of generating synchronized audio from semantic and temporal perspectives. We hope these insights will serve as a stepping stone toward developing more realistic and accurate audio-visual generation models.</description>

      <title>AV-Link: Temporally-Aligned Diffusion Features for Cross-Modal Audio-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose AV-Link, a unified framework for Video-to-Audio (A2V) and Audio-to-Video (A2V) generation that leverages the activations of frozen video and audio diffusion models for temporally-aligned cross-modal conditioning. The key to our framework is a Fusion Block that facilitates bidirectional information exchange between video and audio diffusion models through temporally-aligned self attention operations. Unlike prior work that uses dedicated models for A2V and V2A tasks and relies on pretrained feature extractors, AV-Link achieves both tasks in a single self-contained framework, directly leveraging features obtained by the complementary modality (i.e. video features to generate audio, or audio features to generate video). Extensive automatic and subjective evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves a substantial improvement in audio-video synchronization, outperforming more expensive baselines such as the MovieGen video-to-audio model.</description>

      <title>CBW: Towards Dataset Ownership Verification for Speaker Verification via Clustering-based Backdoor Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing adoption of deep learning in speaker verification, large-scale speech datasets have become valuable intellectual property. To audit and prevent the unauthorized usage of these valuable released datasets, especially in commercial or open-source scenarios, we propose a novel dataset ownership verification method. Our approach introduces a clustering-based backdoor watermark (CBW), enabling dataset owners to determine whether a suspicious third-party model has been trained on a protected dataset under a black-box setting. The CBW method consists of two key stages: dataset watermarking and ownership verification. During watermarking, we implant multiple trigger patterns in the dataset to make similar samples (measured by their feature similarities) close to the same trigger while dissimilar samples are near different triggers. This ensures that any model trained on the watermarked dataset exhibits specific misclassification behaviors when exposed to trigger-embedded inputs. To verify dataset ownership, we design a hypothesis-test-based framework that statistically evaluates whether a suspicious model exhibits the expected backdoor behavior. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, verifying the effectiveness and robustness of our method against potential adaptive attacks. The code for reproducing main experiments is available at https://github.com/Radiant0726/CBW</description>
