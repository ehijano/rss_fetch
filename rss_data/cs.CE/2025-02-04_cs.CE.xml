      <title>AK-SLRL: Adaptive Krylov Subspace Exploration Using Single-Life Reinforcement Learning for Sparse Linear System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a single-life reinforcement learning (SLRL) approach to adaptively select the dimension of the Krylov subspace during the generalized minimal residual (GMRES) iteration. GMRES is an iterative algorithm for solving large and sparse linear systems of equations in the form of \(Ax = b\) which are mainly derived from partial differential equations (PDEs). The proposed framework uses RL to adjust the Krylov subspace dimension (m) in the GMRES (m) algorithm. This research demonstrates that altering the dimension of the Krylov subspace in an online setup using SLRL can accelerate the convergence of the GMRES algorithm by more than an order of magnitude. A comparison of different matrix sizes and sparsity levels is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of adaptive Krylov subspace exploration using single-life RL (AK-SLRL). We compare AK-SLRL with constant-restart GMRES by applying the highest restart value used in AK-SLRL to the GMRES method. The results show that using an adjustable restart parameter with single-life soft-actor critic (SLSAC) and an experience replay buffer sized to half the matrix dimension converges significantly faster than the constant restart GMRES with higher values. Higher values of the restart parameter are equivalent to a higher number of Arnoldi iterations to construct an orthonormal basis for the Krylov subspace $ K_m(A, r_0) $. This process includes constructing $m$ orthonormal vectors and updating the Hessenberg matrix $H$. Therefore, lower values of $m$ result in reduced computation needed in GMRES minimization to solve the least-squares problem in the smaller Hessenberg matrix. The robustness of the result is validated through a wide range of matrix dimensions and sparsity. This paper contributes to the series of RL combinations with numerical solvers to achieve accelerated scientific computing.</description>

      <title>GO-GAN: Geometry Optimization Generative Adversarial Network for Achieving Optimized Structures with Targeted Physical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents GO-GAN, a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture for geometry optimization (GO), specifically to generate structures based on user-specified input parameters. The architecture for GO-GAN proposed here combines a \texttt{Pix2Pix} GAN with a new input mechanism, involving a dynamic batch gradient descent-based training loop that leverages dataset symmetries. The model, implemented here using \texttt{TensorFlow} and \texttt{Keras}, is trained using input images representing scalar physical properties generated by a custom MatLab code. After training, GO-GAN rapidly generates optimized geometries from input images representing scalar inputs of the physical properties. Results demonstrate GO-GAN's ability to produce acceptable designs with desirable variations. These variations are followed by the influence of discriminators during training and are of practical significance in ensuring adherence to specifications while enabling creative exploration of the design space.</description>

      <title>Offshore wind farm layout optimization using mathematical programming techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offshore wind power is a renewable energy of growing relevance in current electric energy systems, presenting favorable wind conditions in comparison with the sites on land. However, the higher energy yield has to compensate the increment in installation and maintenance costs, thus the importance of optimizing resources. One relevant aspect to increase profitability is the wind farm layout. The aim of this paper is to propose a new method to maximize the expected power production of offshore wind farms by setting the appropriate layout, i.e. minimizing the wake effects. The method uses a sequential procedure for global optimization consisting of two steps: i) an heuristic method to set an initial random layout configuration, and ii) the use of nonlinear mathematical programming techniques for local optimization, which use the random layout as an initial solution. The method takes full advantage of the most up-to-date mathematical programming techniques while performing a global optimization approach, which can be easily parallelized. The performance of the proposed procedure is tested using the German offshore wind farm Alpha Ventus, located in the North Sea, yielding an increment of expected annual power production of 3.52% with respect to the actual configuration. According to current electricity prices in Germany, this constitutes an expected profit increment of almost 1 M per year.</description>

      <title>Mixed extreme wave climate model for reanalysis databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hindcast or wave reanalysis databases (WRDB) constitute a powerful source with respect to instrumental records in the design of offshore and coastal structures, since they offer important advantages for the statistical characterization of wave climate variables, such as continuous long time records of significant wave heights, mean and peak periods, etc. However, reanalysis data is less accurate than instrumental records, making extreme data analysis derived from WRDB prone to under predict design return period values. This paper proposes a mixed extreme value model to deal with maxima, which takes full advantage of both (i) hindcast or wave reanalysis and (ii) instrumental records, reducing the uncertainty in its predictions. The resulting mixed model consistently merges the information given by both kinds of data sets, and it can be applied to any extreme value analysis distribution, such as generalized extreme value, peaks over threshold or Pareto-Poisson. The methodology is illustrated using both synthetically generated and real data, the latter taken from a given location on the northern Spanish coast.</description>

      <title>Assessment of ChatGPT for Engineering Statics Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT hold potential for automating engineering analysis, yet their reliability in solving multi-step statics problems remains uncertain. This study evaluates the performance of ChatGPT-4o and ChatGPT-o1-preview on foundational statics tasks, from simple calculations of Newton's second law of motion to beam and truss analyses and compares their results to first-year engineering students on a typical statics exam. To enhance accuracy, we developed a Custom GPT, embedding refined prompts directly into its instructions. This optimized model achieved an 82% score, surpassing the 75% student average, demonstrating the impact of tailored guidance. Despite these improvements, LLMs continued to exhibit errors in nuanced or open-ended problems, such as misidentifying tension and compression in truss members. These findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of AI in structural analysis, emphasizing the need for improved reasoning, multimodal capabilities, and targeted training data for future AI-driven automation in civil and mechanical engineering.</description>

      <title>Data Fusion for Full-Range Response Reconstruction via Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately capturing the full-range response of structures is crucial in structural health monitoring (SHM) for ensuring safety and operational integrity. However, limited sensor deployment due to cost, accessibility, or scale often hinders comprehensive monitoring. This paper presents a novel data fusion framework utilizing diffusion models to reconstruct the full-range structural response from sparse and heterogeneous sensor measurements. We incorporate Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) into the reconstruction framework, using sensor measurements as probabilistic constraints to guide the sampling process. A lightweight neural network serves as the surrogate forward model within the DPS algorithm, which maps full-range structural responses to local sensor data. This approach enables flexibility in sensor configurations while reducing computational costs. The proposed framework is validated on a steel plate shear wall exhibiting nonlinear responses. Comparative experiments are conducted with three forward models. Among these, the neural network surrogate model achieves a desirable reconstruction accuracy, with a weighted mean absolute percentage error (WMAPE) as low as 1.57%, while also demonstrating superior adaptability and computational efficiency. Additional experiments explore the impact of sensor placement strategies and noise levels. Results show that even under sparse measurements or high noise conditions, the WMAPE remains capped at 15%, demonstrating the robustness in challenging scenarios. The proposed framework shows new possibilities for probabilistic modeling and decision-making in SHM, offering a novel data fusion approach for full-range monitoring of structures.</description>

      <title>Extending the Lattice Boltzmann Method to Non-linear Solid Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work outlines a Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) for geometrically and constitutively nonlinear solid mechanics to simulate large deformations under dynamic loading conditions. The method utilizes the moment chain approach, where the nonlinear constitutive law is incorporated via a forcing term. Stress and deformation measures are expressed in the reference configuration. Finite difference schemes are employed for gradient and divergence computations, and Neumann- and Dirichlet-type boundary conditions are introduced.
  Numerical studies are performed to assess the proposed method and illustrate its capabilities. Benchmark tests for weakly dynamic uniaxial tension and simple shear across a range of Poisson's ratios demonstrate the feasibility of the scheme and serve as validation of the implementation. Furthermore, a dynamic test case involving the propagation of bending waves in a cantilever beam highlights the potential of the method to model complex dynamic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Multiphysics Continuous Shape Optimization of the TAP Reactor Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transatomic Power (TAP) reactor has an unusual design for a molten salt reactor technology, building upon the foundation laid by the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE). This design introduces three key modifications to enhance efficiency and compactness: a revised fuel salt composition, an alternative moderator material, and moderator pins surrounded by the molten salt fuel. Unlike traditional solid-fueled reactors that rely on excess positive reactivity at the beginning of life, the TAP concept employs a dynamic approach. The core's design, featuring a cylindrical geometry with square assemblies of moderator rods surrounded by flowing fuel salt, provides flexibility in adjusting the moderator-to-fuel ratio during operation - using movable moderator rods - further adding criticality control capability in addition to the control rods system. Shape optimization of the core can play a crucial role in enhancing performance and efficiency. By applying multiphysics continuous shape optimization techniques to key components, such as the unit cells of the TAP reactor or its moderator assemblies, we can fine-tune the reactor's geometry to achieve optimal performance in key physics like neutronics and thermal hydraulics. We explore this aspect using the optimization module in the Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) framework which allows for multiphysics continuous shape optimization. The results reported here illustrate the benefits of applying continuous shape optimization in the design of nuclear reactor components and can help in extending the TAP reactor's performance.</description>

      <title>Computational modelling of cancer nanomedicine: Integrating hyperthermia treatment into a multiphase porous-media tumour model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat-based cancer treatment, so-called hyperthermia, can be used to destroy tumour cells directly or to make them more susceptible to chemotherapy or radiation therapy. To apply heat locally, iron oxide nanoparticles are injected into the bloodstream and accumulate at the tumour site, where they generate heat when exposed to an alternating magnetic field. However, the temperature must be precisely controlled to achieve therapeutic benefits while avoiding damage to healthy tissue. We therefore present a computational model for nanoparticle-mediated hyperthermia treatment fully integrated into a multiphase porous-media model of the tumour and its microenvironment. We study how the temperature depends on the amount of nanoparticles accumulated in the tumour area and the specific absorption rate of the nanoparticles. Our results show that host tissue surrounding the tumour is also exposed to considerable doses of heat due to the high thermal conductivity of the tissue, which may cause pain or even unnecessary irreversible damage. Further, we include a lumped and a discrete model for the cooling effect of blood perfusion. Using a discrete model of a realistic microvasculature reveals that the small capillaries do not have a significant cooling effect during hyperthermia treatment and that the commonly used lumped model based on Pennes' bioheat equation overestimates the effect: within the specific conditions analysed, the difference between lumped and discrete approaches is approximatively 0.75{\deg}C, which could influence the therapeutic intervention outcome. Such a comprehensive computational model, as presented here, can provide insights into the optimal treatment parameters for nanoparticle-mediated hyperthermia and can be used to design more efficient treatment strategies.</description>

      <title>Neural Preconditioning Operator for Efficient PDE Solves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Neural Preconditioning Operator (NPO), a novel approach designed to accelerate Krylov solvers in solving large, sparse linear systems derived from partial differential equations (PDEs). Unlike classical preconditioners that often require extensive tuning and struggle to generalize across different meshes or parameters, NPO employs neural operators trained via condition and residual losses. This framework seamlessly integrates with existing neural network models, serving effectively as a preconditioner to enhance the performance of Krylov subspace methods. Further, by melding algebraic multigrid principles with a transformer-based architecture, NPO significantly reduces iteration counts and runtime for solving Poisson, Diffusion, and Linear Elasticity problems on both uniform and irregular meshes. Our extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that NPO outperforms traditional methods and contemporary neural approaches across various resolutions, ensuring robust convergence even on grids as large as 4096, far exceeding its initial training limits. These findings underscore the potential of data-driven preconditioning to transform the computational efficiency of high-dimensional PDE applications.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Model for Psychological Resilience Prediction based on Neurological Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Psychological resilience, defined as the ability to rebound from adversity, is crucial for mental health. Compared with traditional resilience assessments through self-reported questionnaires, resilience assessments based on neurological data offer more objective results with biological markers, hence significantly enhancing credibility. This paper proposes a novel data-efficient model to address the scarcity of neurological data. We employ Neuro Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks as the structure of the prediction model. In the training stage, a new trait-informed multimodal representation algorithm with a smart chunk technique is proposed to learn the shared latent space with limited data. In the test stage, a new noise-informed inference algorithm is proposed to address the low signal-to-noise ratio of the neurological data. The proposed model not only shows impressive performance on both public datasets and self-constructed datasets but also provides some valuable psychological hypotheses for future research.</description>

      <title>TwinMarket: A Scalable Behavioral and SocialSimulation for Financial Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of social emergence has long been a central focus in social science. Traditional modeling approaches, such as rule-based Agent-Based Models (ABMs), struggle to capture the diversity and complexity of human behavior, particularly the irrational factors emphasized in behavioral economics. Recently, large language model (LLM) agents have gained traction as simulation tools for modeling human behavior in social science and role-playing applications. Studies suggest that LLMs can account for cognitive biases, emotional fluctuations, and other non-rational influences, enabling more realistic simulations of socio-economic dynamics. In this work, we introduce TwinMarket, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages LLMs to simulate socio-economic systems. Specifically, we examine how individual behaviors, through interactions and feedback mechanisms, give rise to collective dynamics and emergent phenomena. Through experiments in a simulated stock market environment, we demonstrate how individual actions can trigger group behaviors, leading to emergent outcomes such as financial bubbles and recessions. Our approach provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between individual decision-making and collective socio-economic patterns.</description>

      <title>Restless Multi-armed Bandits under Frequency and Window Constraints for Public Service Inspections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Municipal inspections are an important part of maintaining the quality of goods and services. In this paper, we approach the problem of intelligently scheduling service inspections to maximize their impact, using the case of food establishment inspections in Chicago as a case study. The Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) inspects thousands of establishments each year, with a substantial fail rate (over 3,000 failed inspection reports in 2023). To balance the objectives of ensuring adherence to guidelines, minimizing disruption to establishments, and minimizing inspection costs, CDPH assigns each establishment an inspection window every year and guarantees that they will be inspected exactly once during that window. These constraints create a challenge for a restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) approach, for which there are no existing methods. We develop an extension to Whittle index-based systems for RMABs that can guarantee action window constraints and frequencies, and furthermore can be leveraged to optimize action window assignments themselves. Briefly, we combine MDP reformulation and integer programming-based lookahead to maximize the impact of inspections subject to constraints. A neural network-based supervised learning model is developed to model state transitions of real Chicago establishments using public CDPH inspection records, which demonstrates 10\% AUC improvements compared with directly predicting establishments' failures. Our experiments not only show up to 24\% (in simulation) or 33\% (on real data) reward improvements resulting from our approach but also give insight into the impact of scheduling constraints.</description>

      <title>Forecasting VIX using interpretable Kolmogorov-Arnold networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the use of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for forecasting the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). Unlike traditional MLP-based neural networks that are often criticized for their black-box nature, KAN offers an interpretable approach via learnable spline-based activation functions and symbolification. Based on a parsimonious architecture with symbolic functions, KAN expresses a forecast of the VIX as a closed-form in terms of explanatory variables, and provide interpretable insights into key characteristics of the VIX, including mean reversion and the leverage effect. Through in-depth empirical analysis across multiple datasets and periods, we show that KANs achieve competitive forecasting performance while requiring significantly fewer parameters compared to MLP-based neural network models. Our findings demonstrate the capacity and potential of KAN as an interpretable financial time-series forecasting method.</description>

      <title>The Local Subtraction Approach For EEG and MEG Forward Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: EDIT: A revised version of this article has been published in the SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, see https://epubs.siam.org/doi/full/10.1137/23M1582874. In the revised version, the name of the approach was changed from "localized subtraction" to "local subtraction".
  In FEM-based EEG and MEG source analysis, the subtraction approach has been proposed to simulate sensor measurements generated by neural activity. While this approach possesses a rigorous foundation and produces accurate results, its major downside is that it is computationally prohibitively expensive in practical applications. To overcome this, we developed a new approach, called the local subtraction approach. This approach is designed to preserve the mathematical foundation of the subtraction approach, while also leading to sparse right-hand sides in the FEM formulation, making it efficiently computable. We achieve this by introducing a cut-off into the subtraction, restricting its influence to the immediate neighborhood of the source. In this work, this approach will be presented, analyzed, and compared to other state-of-the-art FEM right-hand side approaches. We perform validation in multi-layer sphere models where analytical solutions exist. There, we demonstrate that the local subtraction approach is vastly more efficient than the subtraction approach. Moreover, we find that for the EEG forward problem, the local subtraction approach is less dependent on the global structure of the FEM mesh when compared to the subtraction approach. Additionally, we show the local subtraction approach to rival, and in many cases even surpass, the other investigated approaches in terms of accuracy. For the MEG forward problem, we show the local subtraction approach and the subtraction approach to produce highly accurate approximations of the volume currents close to the source.</description>

      <title>Multi-level B\'{e}zier extraction of truncated hierarchical B-splines for isogeometric analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multivariate B-splines and Non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) lack adaptivity due to their tensor product structure. Truncated hierarchical B-splines (THB-splines) provide a solution for this. THB-splines organize the parameter space into a hierarchical structure, which enables efficient approximation and representation of functions with different levels of detail. The truncation mechanism ensures the partition of unity property of B-splines and defines a more scattered set of basis functions without overlapping on the multi-level spline space. Transferring these multi-level splines into B\'{e}zier elements representation facilitates straightforward incorporation into existing finite element (FE) codes. By separating the multi-level extraction of the THB-splines from the standard B\'{e}zier extraction, a more general independent framework applicable to any sequence of nested spaces is created. The operators for the multi-level structure of THB-splines and the operators of B\'{e}zier extraction are constructed in a local approach. Adjusting the operators for the multi-level structure from an element point of view and multiplying with the B\'{e}zier extraction operators of those elements, a direct map between B\'{e}zier elements and a hierarchical structure is obtained. The presented implementation involves the use of an open-source Octave/MATLAB isogeometric analysis (IGA) code called GeoPDEs. A basic Poisson problem is presented to investigate the performance of multi-level B\'{e}zier extraction compared to a standard THB-spline approach.</description>

      <title>Crystalline Material Discovery in the Era of Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08044v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystalline materials, with symmetrical and periodic structures, exhibit a wide spectrum of properties and have been widely used in numerous applications across electronics, energy, and beyond. For crystalline materials discovery, traditional experimental and computational approaches are time-consuming and expensive. In these years, thanks to the explosive amount of crystalline materials data, great interest has been given to data-driven materials discovery. Particularly, recent advancements have exploited the expressive representation ability of deep learning to model the highly complex atomic systems within crystalline materials, opening up new avenues for fast and accurate materials discovery. These works typically focus on four types of tasks, including physicochemical property prediction, crystalline material synthesis, aiding characterization, and accelerating theoretical computations. Despite the remarkable progress, there is still a lack of systematic investigation to summarize their distinctions and limitations. To fill this gap, we systematically investigated the progress made in recent years. We first introduce several data representations of the crystalline materials. Based on the representations, we summarize various fundamental deep learning models and their tailored usages in various material discovery tasks. Finally, we highlight the remaining challenges and propose future directions.</description>

      <title>PyTOPress: Python code for topology optimization with design-dependent pressure loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Python is a low-cost and open-source substitute for the MATLAB programming language. This paper presents ``\texttt{PyTOPress}", a compact Python code meant for pedagogical purposes for topology optimization for structures subjected to design-dependent fluidic pressure loads. \texttt{PyTOPress}, based on the ``\texttt{TOPress}" MATLAB code \cite{kumar2023topress}, is built using the \texttt{NumPy} and \texttt{SciPy} libraries. The applied pressure load is modeled using the Darcy law with the conceptualized drainage term. From the obtained pressure field, the constant nodal loads are found. The employed method makes it easier to compute the load sensitivity using the adjoint-variable method at a low cost. The topology optimization problems are solved herein by minimizing the compliance of the structure with a constraint on material volume. The method of moving asymptotes is employed to update the design variables. The effectiveness and success of \texttt{PyTOPress} code are demonstrated by optimizing a few design-dependent pressure loadbearing problems. The code is freely available at https://github.com/PrabhatIn/PyTOPress.</description>

      <title>Topology optimization of contact-aided compliant mechanisms for tracing multi-kink paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a topology optimization approach to design 2D contact-aided compliant mechanisms (CCMs) that can trace the desired output paths with more than one kink while experiencing self and/or external contacts. Such CCMs can be used as mechanical compliant switches. Hexagonal elements are used to parameterize the design domain. Negative circular masks are employed to remove material beneath them and generate rigid contact surfaces. Each mask is assigned five design variables. The first three decide the location and radius of the mask, whereas the last two determine the presence of the contact surface and its radius. To ensure continuity in contacting surfaces' normal, we employ a boundary smoothing scheme. The augmented Lagrange multiplier method is employed to incorporate self and mutual contact. An objective is formulated using the Fourier shape descriptors with the permitted resource constraint. The hill-climber optimization technique is utilized to update the design variables. An in-house code is developed for the entire process. To demonstrate the method's efficacy, a CCM is optimized with a two-kink path. The desired and obtained paths are compared.</description>

      <title>Concentration in Governance Control Across Decentralised Finance Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blockchain-based systems are frequently governed through tokens that grant their holders voting rights over core protocol functions and funds. The centralisation occurring in Decentralised Finance (DeFi) protocols' token-based voting systems is typically analysed by examining token holdings' distribution across addresses. In this paper, we expand this perspective by exploring shared token holdings of addresses across multiple DeFi protocols. We construct a Statistically Validated Network (SVN) based on shared governance token holdings among addresses. Using the links within the SVN, we identify influential addresses that shape these connections and we conduct a post-hoc analysis to examine their characteristics and behaviour. Our findings reveal persistent influential links over time, predominantly involving addresses associated with institutional investors who maintain significant token supplies across the sampled protocols. Finally, we observe that token holding patterns and concentrations tend to shift in response to speculative market cycles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) tasks in English and general domains are widely available and are often used to evaluate pre-trained language models. In contrast, fewer tasks are available for languages other than English and in the financial domain. Particularly, tasks in the Japanese and financial domains are limited. We develop two large datasets using data published by a Japanese central government agency. The datasets provide three Japanese financial NLP tasks, including 3- and 12-class classifications for categorizing sentences, along with a 5-class classification task for sentiment analysis. Our datasets are designed to be comprehensive and updated by leveraging an automatic update framework that ensures that the latest task datasets are publicly always available.</description>

      <title>Global Public Sentiment on Decentralized Finance: A Spatiotemporal Analysis of Geo-tagged Tweets from 150 Countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi) are reshaping global financial systems. Despite their impact, the spatial distribution of public sentiment and its economic and geopolitical determinants are often overlooked. This study analyzes over 150 million geo-tagged, DeFi-related tweets from 2012 to 2022, sourced from a larger dataset of 7.4 billion tweets. Using sentiment scores from a BERT-based multilingual classification model, we integrated these tweets with economic and geopolitical data to create a multimodal dataset. Employing techniques like sentiment analysis, spatial econometrics, clustering, and topic modeling, we uncovered significant global variations in DeFi engagement and sentiment. Our findings indicate that economic development significantly influences DeFi engagement, particularly after 2015. Geographically weighted regression analysis revealed GDP per capita as a key predictor of DeFi tweet proportions, with its impact growing following major increases in cryptocurrency values such as bitcoin. While wealthier nations are more actively engaged in DeFi discourse, the lowest-income countries often discuss DeFi in terms of financial security and sudden wealth. Conversely, middle-income countries relate DeFi to social and religious themes, whereas high-income countries view it mainly as a speculative instrument or entertainment. This research advances interdisciplinary studies in computational social science and finance and supports open science by making our dataset and code available on GitHub, and providing a non-code workflow on the KNIME platform. These contributions enable a broad range of scholars to explore DeFi adoption and sentiment, aiding policymakers, regulators, and developers in promoting financial inclusion and responsible DeFi engagement globally.</description>

      <title>Mixture of Knowledge Minigraph Agents for Literature Review Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06159v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Literature reviews play a crucial role in scientific research for understanding the current state of research, identifying gaps, and guiding future studies on specific topics. However, the process of conducting a comprehensive literature review is yet time-consuming. This paper proposes a novel framework, collaborative knowledge minigraph agents (CKMAs), to automate scholarly literature reviews. A novel prompt-based algorithm, the knowledge minigraph construction agent (KMCA), is designed to identify relations between concepts from academic literature and automatically constructs knowledge minigraphs. By leveraging the capabilities of large language models on constructed knowledge minigraphs, the multiple path summarization agent (MPSA) efficiently organizes concepts and relations from different viewpoints to generate literature review paragraphs. We evaluate CKMAs on three benchmark datasets. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, further revealing promising applications of LLMs in scientific research.</description>

      <title>Beyond Monte Carlo: Harnessing Diffusion Models to Simulate Financial Market Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a highly efficient and accurate methodology for generating synthetic financial market data using a diffusion model approach. The synthetic data produced by our methodology align closely with observed market data in several key aspects: (i) they pass the two-sample Cramer - von Mises test for portfolios of assets, and (ii) Q - Q plots demonstrate consistency across quantiles, including in the tails, between observed and generated market data. Moreover, the covariance matrices derived from a large set of synthetic market data exhibit significantly lower condition numbers compared to the estimated covariance matrices of the observed data. This property makes them suitable for use as regularized versions of the latter. For model training, we develop an efficient and fast algorithm based on numerical integration rather than Monte Carlo simulations. The methodology is tested on a large set of equity data.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Neural ODEs for Gene Regulatory Network Discovery under Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern high-throughput biological datasets with thousands of perturbations provide the opportunity for large-scale discovery of causal graphs that represent the regulatory interactions between genes. Differentiable causal graphical models have been proposed to infer a gene regulatory network (GRN) from large scale interventional datasets, capturing the causal gene regulatory relationships from genetic perturbations. However, existing models are limited in their expressivity and scalability while failing to address the dynamic nature of biological processes such as cellular differentiation. We propose PerturbODE, a novel framework that incorporates biologically informative neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) to model cell state trajectories under perturbations and derive the causal GRN from the neural ODE's parameters. We demonstrate PerturbODE's efficacy in trajectory prediction and GRN inference across simulated and real over-expression datasets.</description>
