      <title>Implications for dark energy of cosmic transparency in light of DESI data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distance duality relation (DDR) between luminosity and angular diameter distances holds if gravity is described by a metric theory and the universe is transparent. Recent cosmological inferences using Type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia), baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations have suggested that dark energy may evolve in time. We test how the assumption of distance duality impacts dark energy inference. Marginalizing over the absolute SNe~Ia luminosity, we find no deviation from the DDR, independent of the SN~Ia compilation used, or the assumed dark energy model. This corresponds a maximum deviation in the SN~Ia luminosity of $\Delta m \sim 0.05$ mag at the highest redshift. Allowing for deviations in the DDR increases the errors in the dark energy equation of state parameters (EoS) by 30-50$\%$. For the Pantheon+ compilation the constraints on dark energy are within $2\sigma$ of $\Lambda$CDM when applying a more realistic minimum redshift cut $z_{\rm min} &gt;0.023$. We constrain possible physical scenarios that can impact cosmic transparency, specifically photon-axion mixing and the presence of (gray) intergalactic (IG) dust, in the latter case limiting the dust density to $\Omega_{\rm dust}&lt;2 \times 10^{-4}$ at 95\% C.L. When using the local Cepheid calibration of the SNe~Ia absolute luminosity, a significant deviation from the DDR relation (for which $\epsilon=0$) is preferred. However, the best fit parameter value $\epsilon = -0.091 \pm 0.024$ requires the SNe~Ia to be brighter than the case with DDR valid, therefore, neither of the physical scenarios which dim the SNe can explain the high $H_0$. Constraints on the photon-axion interaction length scale suggest a limit on the coupling constant of $g_{a\gamma} &lt; 10^{-12}\,{\rm GeV}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Blending effects on shear measurement synergy between Euclid-like and LSST-like surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak gravitational lensing is a powerful probe for constraining cosmological parameters, but its success relies on accurate shear measurements. In this paper, we use image simulations to investigate how a joint analysis of high-resolution space-based and deep ground-based imaging can improve shear estimation. We simulate two scenarios: a grid-based setup, where galaxies are placed on a regular grid to mimic an idealised, blending-free scenario, and a random setup, where galaxies are randomly distributed to capture the impact of blending. Comparing these cases, we find that blending introduces significant biases, particularly in LSST-like data due to its larger point spread function. This highlights the importance of including realistic blending effects when evaluating the performance of joint analyses. Using simulations that account for blending, we find that the most effective catalogue-level synergy is achieved by combining all galaxies detected in either survey. This approach yields an effective galaxy number density of $44.08~\rm arcmin^{-2}$ over the magnitude range of 20.0 to 27.5, compared to $39.17~\rm arcmin^{-2}$ for LSST-like data alone and $30.31~\rm arcmin^{-2}$ for \textit{Euclid}-like data alone. Restricting the analysis to only the overlapping sources detected in both surveys results in a gain of ${\sim}12\%$ compared to using either survey alone. While this joint-object approach is suboptimal at the catalogue level, it may become more effective in pixel-level analyses, where a joint fit to individual galaxy shapes can better leverage the complementary strengths of both data sets. Studying such pixel-level combinations, with realistic blending effects properly accounted for, remains a promising direction for future work.</description>

      <title>Exploring the signature of assembly bias and modified gravity using small-scale clusterings of galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply a halo velocity bias model, $\gamma_{f}$, within the Aemulus simulation suite for General Relativity (GR) to investigate its efficacy in identifying the signature of assembly bias and Modified Gravity (MG). In the investigation of assembly bias, utilizing galaxy clustering data ranging from scales of $0.1 - 60 \text{Mpc}\,h^{-1}$, we discover that our emulator model accurately recreates the cosmological parameters, $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$, along with the velocity bias $\gamma_{f}$, staying well within the 1-$\sigma$ error margins, provided that assembly bias is considered. Ignoring assembly bias can considerably alter our model constraints on parameters $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ if the test sample includes assembly bias. Using our emulator for MG simulations, which encompasses two Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati models (DGP; N1, N5) and two $f(R)$ models (F4, F6), we can effectively identify a robust signature of modified gravity, for models such as DGP-N1 and $f(R)$-F4, as indicated by a noticeable deviation of $\gamma_{f}$ from unity. Using the velocity dispersion of dark matter halos to effectively represent the underlying strength of the velocity field of these MG simulations, we find that the simple $\gamma_{f}$ model can recover the truth with minimal bias. These evaluations indicate that our simple halo-velocity bias model is capable of detecting significant MG characteristics, although additional methodologies should be pursued to improve model constraints.</description>

      <title>Examining statistical isotropy of CMB low multipoles from Planck PR4 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low multipoles ($l$) in cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropies have shown some `peculiarities' when examined since the release of the full sky CMB maps, using a variety of tests. In this paper, we concern ourselves with the very first peculiarities seen in CMB data viz., a breakdown of statistical isotropy in the form of axiality and planarity of these low-$l$ modes, and preferred alignments among them. We scrutinize the latest CMB data from ESA's Planck mission, PR4, to evaluate the current status of these deviations. We employ the Power tensor method which allows an invariant characterization of the distribution of power in a given multipole, and apply it to probe the first sixty multipoles i.e., $l=2$ to 61. We find that there are significant number of modes that are intrinsically anisotropic with a cumulative probability of $0.3\%$. However since the planarity study reveals that those modes that are unusually planar are subset of these anisotropic modes, we conclude that they may not be intrinsically planar. The quadrupole is still well aligned with the octopole. Besides, $l=3$, higher multipoles aligned with quadrupole are found to be insignificant. Interestingly, the collective alignment axis of the first sixty multipoles is found to be broadly closer to the axis of dipole, quadrupole, octopole and other modes aligned with $l=2$.</description>

      <title>Probing foreground residuals in cleaned CMB temperature maps from Planck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maps of cosmic microwave background (CMB) are extracted from multi-frequency observations using a variety of cleaning procedures. However, in regions of strong microwave emission, particularly in the galactic plane from our own galaxy Milky Way and some extended or point sources, the recovered CMB signal is not reliable. Thus, a galactic mask is provided along with the \emph{cleaned} CMB sky for use with that CMB map which excises sky regions that may still be potentially contaminated even after cleaning. So, to avoid bias in our inferences, we impose such a foreground mask. In this paper, we analyze a cleaned CMB map from Planck PR4 to probe for any foreground residuals that may still be present \emph{outside} the galactic mask where the derived CMB sky is considered clean. To that end, we employ a local cross-correlation coefficient statistic where we cross-correlate widely used foreground templates that trace galactic synchrotron, free-free, and thermal dust emission from our galaxy with the cleaned CMB sky. Using simulations, we find that few regions of the derived CMB sky are still contaminated and have to be omitted. Based on this study, we derived a mask that could be used in conjugation with the standard mask to further improve the purpose of galactic masks.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing dark energy with model independent methods after DESI DR2 BAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ two model-independent approaches, including redshift binning method and polynomial interpolation method, to reconstruct dark energy (DE) equation of state (EoS) $w(z)$ and DE density function $f(z)$. Our analysis incorporates data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) data release 2, Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distance priors from Planck 2018 and Atacama Cosmology Telescope data release 6, and three Type Ia supernovae (SN) compilations (PantheonPlus, Union3, and DESY5). To ensure model independence, we adopt three redshift binning schemes (n=3, 4, 5) and three polynomial interpolation schemes with the same number of nodes (n=3, 4, 5). Our main conclusions are as follows: 1) After taking into account DESI data, there is a clear trend that DE should evolve with redshift (with deviations from the cosmological constant reaching at least a $2.13\sigma$ confidence level), indicating that current observations favor a dynamical DE. 2) In the redshift range $0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.5$, the DE EoS w(z) exhibits a decreasing trend and crosses the phantom divide $w=-1$, suggesting quintom-like behavior. 3) The DE density f(z) first increases at low redshift, reaching a hump around $z\approx 0.5$, and then decreases at $0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.5$, with a rapid decrease at $z&gt;1.0$. 4) For $z &gt; 1.5$, current data are insufficient to place strong constraints on the evolution of DE, resulting in large uncertainties in the DE reconstruction. It must be emphasized that, these four main conclusions are independent of specific reconstruction models, and are insensitive to the choice of SN compilations.</description>

      <title>Resolving the negative neutrino mass with cosmic birefringence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent measurement of baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) reveals a mild tension with observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) within the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. This discrepancy leads to a preference for a total neutrino mass that is lower than the minimum value inferred from neutrino oscillation experiments. Alternatively, this tension can be eased within $\Lambda$CDM by assuming a higher optical depth ($\tau \simeq 0.09$), but such a value conflicts with large-scale CMB polarization data. We point out that cosmic birefringence, as suggested by recent Planck reanalyses, resolves this discrepancy if the birefringence angle varies significantly during reionization. Specifically, we consider the fact that the measured cosmic birefringence angle $\beta_0=0.34\pm0.09\,(1\,\sigma)\,$deg has the phase ambiguity, i.e., the measured rotation angle is described by $\beta=\beta_0+180n\,$deg ($n\in \mathbb{Z}$). We show that cosmic birefringence induced by axion-like particles with nonzero $n$ suppresses the reionization bump, allowing a higher $\tau$ consistent with data. We provide a viable parameter space where the birefringence effect simultaneously accounts for the low-$\ell$ polarization spectra, the Planck $EB$ correlations, and the elevated value of $\tau$, suggesting a key role for cosmic birefringence in current cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>Effects of Large Optical Depth on CD HI 21-cm Non-Gaussian Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the Cosmic Dawn (CD), the HI 21-cm optical depth ($\tau$ ) in the intergalactic medium can become significantly large. Consequently, the second and higher-order terms of $\tau$ appearing in the Taylor expansion of the HI 21-cm differential brightness temperature ($\delta T_{\rm b}$ ) become important. This introduces additional non-Gaussianity into the signal. We study the impact of large $\tau$ on statistical quantities of HI 21-cm signal using a suite of standard numerical simulations that vary X-ray heating efficiency and the minimum halo mass required to host radiation sources. We find that the higher order terms suppress statistical quantities such as skewness, power-spectrum and bispectrum. However, the effect is found to be particularly strong on the non-Gaussian signal. We find that the change in skewness can reach several hundred percent in low X-ray heating scenarios. For moderate and high X-ray heating models changes are around $\sim40\%$ and $60\%$, respectively, for $M_{\rm h,min}=10^{9}\, {\rm M}_{\odot}$. This change is around $\sim 75\%$, $25\%$ and $20\%$ for low, moderate and high X-ray heating models, respectively, for $M_{\rm h,min}=10^{10}\, {\rm M}_{\odot}$. The change in bispectrum in both the halo cutoff mass scenarios ranges from $\sim 10\%$ to $\sim 300\%$ for low X-ray heating model. However, for moderate and high X-ray heating models the change remains between $\sim 10\%$ to $\sim 200\%$ for both equilateral and squeezed limit triangle configuration. Finally, we find that up to third orders of $\tau$ need to be retained to accurately model $\delta T_{\rm b}$, especially for capturing the non-Gaussian features in the HI 21-cm signal.</description>

      <title>ACT DR6 Leads to Stronger Evidence for Dynamical Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter is fundamental to the composition, structure, and evolution of the universe. Combining the ACT's cosmic microwave background, DESI's baryon acoustic oscillations with DESY5 type Ia supernova observations, we find a $3.4\,\sigma$ evidence for dynamical dark matter (DDM) with an equation of state, $\omega_{dm}(a)=\omega_{dm0}+\omega_{dma}(1-a)$. Independent of the Planck measurements, the ACT data confirms the linear relation $\omega_{dma}=-\omega_{dm0}$, inducing that the equation of state of dark matter is directly proportional to the scale factor $a$. Furthermore, the effects of DDM on the large-scale structure observables are thoroughly studied. Our findings are of great significance for understanding cosmic acceleration, structure growth, and the fate of the universe.</description>

      <title>Correlation between H$\alpha$ emitters and their cosmic web environment at $z \sim 1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future near-infrared spectroscopic galaxy surveys will target high-redshift emission-line galaxies (ELGs) to test cosmological models. Deriving optimal constraints from emission-line galaxy clustering hinges on a robust understanding of their environmental dependence. Using the TNG300-1 simulation, we explore the correlation between properties of H$\alpha$ emitters and their environment anisotropy rather than traditional density-based measures. Our galactic H$\alpha$ emission model includes contributions from the warm interstellar medium. The environment anisotropy and type are assigned using a halo mass-dependent smoothing scale. We find that most luminous ELGs ($L_{\rm{H}\alpha}&gt;10^{42}\ \rm{erg\ s^{-1}}$) reside in filaments and knots. More generally, ELGs are more biased in strongly anisotropic environments. While correlations with galactic properties are found to be weak, they are statistically significant for host halo masses $M\lesssim 10^{12}\ M_\odot/h$. Our analysis motivates further investigation into how environmental anisotropy influences galaxy evolution, and highlights the potential for leveraging these effects in the analyses of upcoming cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>What Prevents Resolving the Hubble Tension through Late-Time Expansion Modifications?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) observations impose the critical constraint for resolving the Hubble tension through late-time expansion modifications. Applying the Fisher-bias optimization framework to cosmic chronometers (CC), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from DESI DR2, Planck CMB, and Pantheon+ data, we find that: (i) deformations in $H(z \lesssim 3)$ (via $w(z)$ reconstruction) can reconcile tensions between CC, Planck, DESI BAO, and SH0ES measurements while maintaining or improving fit quality ($\Delta\chi^2 &lt; 0$ relative to $\Lambda$CDM); (ii) In the neighborhood of Planck best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model, no cosmologically viable solutions targeting $H_0 \gtrsim 69$ satisfy SNe Ia constraints. MCMC validation confirms the maximum achievable $H_0 = 69.09\pm0.30$ ($\chi^2_{\rm BF} \approx \chi^2_{\Lambda\rm CDM}$) across all data combinations, indicating that the conflict between late-time $w(z)$ modifications and SNe Ia observations prevents complete resolution of the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>On the validity of separate-universe approach in transient ultra-slow-roll inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the breakdown of the separate-universe approximation during transitions in transient ultra-slow-roll inflation by analyzing the evolution of the comoving curvature perturbation ${\cal R}$ and its conjugate momentum $\Pi$. It is well known that spatial gradient terms lead to a failure of this approximation, particularly at the transition from slow-roll to ultra-slow-roll phase. We show that a similar breakdown also occurs during the second transition back to slow-roll when considering the evolution of $\Pi$. Interestingly, while the homogeneous solution for $\Pi$ accurately captures the dynamics across the first transition, it is the homogeneous solution for ${\cal R}$ that becomes valid across the second. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the spatial curvature term introduced in the extended $\delta N$ formalism of \cite{Artigas:2024ajh} can be interpreted as arising from the contribution of $\Pi$ to the energy density perturbation. Importantly, this modification of the local Hubble parameter is valid only when the first slow-roll parameter is both small and strictly constant.</description>

      <title>Scalar-induced gravitational waves from coherent initial states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of statistical inhomogeneity and anisotropy in primordial scalar perturbations on the scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW). Assuming inflationary quantum fluctuations originate from a coherent state, the resulting primordial scalar perturbations acquire a non-zero space-dependent mean, violating statistical homogeneity, statistical isotropy, and parity. As a consequence of statistical inhomogeneities, SIGW acquires distinct scale-dependent features in its correlation function. Statistical anisotropies further lead to possible parity violation and correlation between different polarization modes in the tensor perturbations. Therefore, detection of these signatures in the stochastic gravitational wave background would offer probes to the statistical nature of primordial scalar perturbations beyond the scales accessible to CMB observations.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Thermodynamic Framework for Third-Order Galaxy Correlation Functions: From Theory to Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive thermodynamic derivation and observational validation of the third-order galaxy correlation function, extending the seminal work of Iqbal et al [ 1, 2]. Using the statistical mechanics framework for gravitating systems, we derive the governing partial differential equation and provide explicit analytical solutions. Our enhanced framework includes: (1) comparison with N-body simulations and SDSS/BOSS galaxy survey data showing excellent agreement (\c{hi}2/dof = 1.27), (2) systematic methodology for determining model parameters from observational constraints, (3) detailed analysis of scale-dependent behaviour across linear and nonlinear regimes, (4) direct connections to standard cosmological parameters ({\sigma}8, {\Omega}m, fN L), (5) comprehensive treatment of redshift-space distortions, and (6) analysis of observational systematics. We demonstrate that our third-order correlation parameter b3 provides independent constraints complementary to two-point analyses, with potential to break degeneracies in dark energy and modified gravity studies. Explicit quantitative limitations regarding cosmic expansion effects and equilibrium assumptions are provided, along with comparisons to alternative methodologies and extensions for next-generation surveys.</description>

      <title>Listening Across the Cosmic Time: Standard Sirens from Ground- and Space-Based Missions in the Next Decade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise measurement of the Hubble parameter will enable stringent tests of the standard model for cosmology. Standard sirens, using the luminosity distances measured by gravitational-wave observations of compact binary mergers, are expected to provide such measurements independently in the next decade. With the ground- and space-based gravitational wave observatories, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), different types of standard sirens altogether will place constraints across a wide redshift range. In this paper, we forecast the precisions of standard siren Hubble parameter measurements and compare various scenarios, accounting for the dominant sources of systematic uncertainty. Specifically, we find a $2\%$ constraint on $H_0$, a $1.5-3\%$ constraint on $H(z)$ at $z=1$, and a $3-5\%$ constraint on $H(z)$ at $z=7$ when combining LVK and LISA standard sirens with precise redshift measurements from electromagnetic counterpart observations. We do not find a significant improvement when including standard sirens with no EM counterpart, but which rely on features in the black hole mass distribution, and the potential systematics introduced by the possible redshift evolution of such features could further degrade the measurement accuracy if not properly accounted for.</description>

      <title>Constraining self-interacting ultrahigh-energy neutrinos by cosmic microwave background spectral distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutrino telescopes have firmly established the existence of ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos. Observations of these neutrinos offer a unique probe of neutrino self-interactions. This work investigates how the self-interacting neutrinos, mediated by scalar bosons, inject energy into the medium through radiative scattering with the cosmic neutrino background, leaving an imprint on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectrum. The energy injection into plasma in redshift ranges, $5\times10^4\lesssim z\lesssim2\times10^6$ and $ z\lesssim5\times10^4$, leads to $\mu$-type and $y$-type of CMB spectral distortions, respectively. Using observational constraints from Cosmic Background Explorer/Far Infrared Absolute Spectrophotometer (COBE/FIRAS) and projected sensitivities from Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE) experiments for $\mu$-type and $y$-type CMB distortions, we derive the stringent upper bounds on the self-interaction coupling strength as a function of mediator mass for neutrino interactions. We focus on flavor-specific self-interaction related to muon neutrinos and sub-GeV mass mediators ($m_{\phi}$). We find the upper bound on the self-interaction coupling strength to be $\sim 3.1\times 10^{-5}$ for the muon neutrino, considering UHE muon neutrino energy to be 1 PeV and PIXIE projected upper bounds on $\mu$-type CMB spectral distortion. The bound remains constant till the mediator mass reaches the center of mass energy, and after that, it gets relaxed and becomes proportional to the mediator mass. We have also compared our results with existing bounds in the literature. Our findings indicate that CMB spectral distortion could play a decisive role in exploring neutrino physics beyond the standard model of particle physics, and future missions like PIXIE can provide valuable insights.</description>

      <title>Constraining Cubic Curvature Corrections to General Relativity with Quasi-Periodic Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate observational constraints on cubic curvature corrections to general relativity by analyzing quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in accreting black hole systems. In particular, we study Kerr black hole solution corrected by cubic curvature terms parameterized by $\beta_5$ and $\beta_6$. While $\beta_6$ corresponds to a field-redefinition invariant structure, the $\beta_5$ term can in principle be removed via a field redefinition. Nonetheless, since we work in the frame where the accreting matter minimally couples to the metric, $\beta_5$ is in general present. Utilizing the corrected metric, we compute the QPO frequencies within the relativistic precession framework. Using observational data from GRO J1655$-$40 and a Bayesian analysis, we constrain the coupling parameters to $|\beta_5| &lt; (27.73\,\mathrm{km})^4$ and $|\beta_6| &lt; (15.34\,\mathrm{km})^4$. These bounds improve upon existing constraints from big-bang nucleosynthesis and the speed of gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Assisted Fibre Inflation in Perturbative LVS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a multi-field fiber inflation scenario in type IIB perturbative large volume compactifications, showing that the multi-field dynamics suppresses trans-Planckian displacements of the canonical inflaton. Considering a concrete K3-fibred Calabi-Yau (CY) threefold with $h^{1,1}({\rm CY})=3$ and having certain underlying symmetries, we show that the presence of multi-fibre moduli creates an assisted inflation scenario where multiple moduli collectively help in producing the cosmological observables consistent with the experimental observations. We further argue that individual field range excursions $(\Delta\phi_n)$ corresponding to each of the inflaton fields can be estimated as $\Delta\phi_n = \Delta\phi/\sqrt{n}$, where $\Delta\phi$ denotes to the effective single-field inflaton range needed to generate the desired cosmological observables, and $n$ is the number of moduli assisting the multi-fibre inflation. We also present various numerical benchmark models consistently producing cosmological observables in the lights of the recent ACT experiments.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Induced Neutron Production Search Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An independent indirect detection search for Dark Matter-Matter (DM-M) interactions is undertaken to set cross section limits based on neutron production data collected by the NMDS-II detector for 1440 hours at 1166 m.w.e. and 6504 hours at 583 m.w.e.. The detector system consists of a 30 cm cube Pb-target instrumented with 60 $^3$He neutron counters. The neutron detector system calibrated with a $^{252}$Cf source yields a single particle detection efficiency of 23.2\%$\pm$1.2\%. During data collection, the highest neutron multiplicity event observed 54 neutrons. The neutron multiplicity, n, distribution, fits well to a power law $k \times n^{-p}$, for both the data and cosmic ray muon induced neutron production in Geant4 simulations. Two DM-M interaction models were used to set limits. The first, a spallation model, assumes a single proton with kinetic energy equal to the DM-M interaction energy. The other, a fire-ball model assumes an annihilation between DM-M producing pions with a limiting Hagedorn temperature. The two extreme models produce similar upper DM-M cross section limits over the DM mass range between 300 MeV to 100 GeV. Limits assume all the DM energy is deposited in the Pb-target. Spin independent limits, proportional to A$^{-2}$, are at the level ~10$^{-45}~ cm^2$. Spin dependent limits, proportional to A$^{-1}$, are at the level, $2\times 10^{-42}~cm^2$.</description>

      <title>Probing Binary Neutron Star Merger Ejecta and Remnants with Gravitational Wave and Radio Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study aimed at quantifying the detectability of radio counterparts of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers with total masses $\lesssim 3$\,M$_{\odot}$, which may form neutron star (NS) remnants. We focus on mergers localized by gravitational-wave (GW) observations to sky areas $\lesssim 10$\,deg$^2$, a precision that greatly facilitates optical counterpart identification and enables radio discovery even without detections at other wavelengths. Widely separated GW detectors are essential for building samples of well-localized BNS mergers accessible to US-based radio telescopes, with minimum yearly detection rates (assuming the smallest values of the BNS local merger rate) ranging from a few with current GW detectors to hundreds with next-generation GW instruments. Current GW networks limit well-localized detections to $z\lesssim 0.2$, while next-generation GW detectors extend the reach to $z\lesssim 0.8$, encompassing the median redshift of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). With next-generation radio arrays operating at a several tens of GHz and providing an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity compared to the most sensitive ones available today, short GRB-like jet afterglows can be detected for a large fraction of the considered BNS mergers. At lower radio frequencies, detections with current radio interferometric arrays are feasible, though subject to synchrotron self-absorption effects. The enhanced sensitivity and survey speed of future radio interferometers operating at a few GHz, combined with the higher detection rate of well-localized BNSs enabled by next-generation GW observatories, are key to probing disk-wind and dynamical ejecta afterglows, as well as remnant diversity.</description>

      <title>A unified origin for dark energy and resonant dark matter from strongly-coupled gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a single strongly coupled gauge theory naturally gives rise to a unified description of the dark sector, simultaneously addressing the origin of dark energy at the meV scale and self-interacting dark matter at the TeV scale. Building on the density-responsive scalar field framework that resolves cosmological singularities and generates dark energy without fine-tuning, we show that the same underlying SU(3) gauge theory with $N_f = 10$ flavors predicts complete dark matter phenomenology. The theory generates not only the required anomalous dimension $\gamma \approx 0.50\pm0.05$ for the dark-energy mechanism, but also produces a composite particle spectrum featuring a TeV-scale dark matter candidate ($m_\chi \approx 600$~GeV) and a heavier scalar meson. Remarkably, the mass ratio $m_{\Phi_h}/m_\chi \approx 2$ naturally emerges from the dynamics of confinement, without any fine-tuning. This resonance condition, which initially appears as a coincidence, is revealed to be a robust prediction of the gauge dynamics, completely resolving the long-standing tension between achieving the correct relic abundance and solving small-scale structure problems through self-interactions. The framework makes sharp, testable predictions: a narrow scalar resonance at $\sim 1.2$~TeV accessible at HL-LHC, dark matter self-interactions of $\sigma_T/m \sim 1$~cm$^2$/g at dwarf galaxy velocities, and a stochastic gravitational wave background from the confinement phase transition. By deriving both dark energy and dark matter from a single microscopic theory, our work demonstrates how 95\% of the universe's energy content can emerge from one underlying strongly-coupled gauge theory, providing a complete and predictive framework for dark sector physics across 15 orders of magnitude in energy.</description>

      <title>Generating Moving Field Initial Conditions with Spatially Varying Boost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel class of algorithms, the ``spatially varying boost'', for generating dynamical field initial conditions with prescribed bulk velocities. Given (non-moving) initial field data, the algorithm generates new initial data with the given velocity profile by performing local Lorentz boosts. This algorithm is generic, with no restriction on the type of the field, the equation of motion, and can endow fields with ultra-relativistic velocities. This algorithm enables new simulations in different branches of physics, including cosmology and condensed matter physics. For demonstration, we used this algorithm to (1) boost two Sine-Gordon solitons to ultra-relativistic speeds for subsequent collision, (2) generate a relativistic transverse Proca field with random velocities, and (3) set up a spin-$1$ Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson field with velocity and density perturbations consistent with dark matter in matter dominated universe.</description>

      <title>Running scalar spectral index in warm natural inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The validity of inflation models is mainly evaluated according to the consistency of the predicted scalar spectral index $n_{\mathrm{s}}$, the tensor scalar ratio $r$, and the running scalar spectral index $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ with cosmic microwave background observations. In warm inflation (WI) scenarios, one can find exact analytical solutions for $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ in principle, but long expressions may be obtained. Previous studies for WI scenarios have only shown approximate analytical solutions or numerical results for $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$. In this study, we present a general analytical expression of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ without approximation in WI. The obtained analytical expression of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ is used in the study of warm natural inflation (WNI). Although $n_{\mathrm{s}}$ and $r$ have been previously investigated, $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ is omitted in previous studies on WNI. Our study of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ completes previous phenomenological studies on WNI. In particular, the lower limit of the symmetry-breaking scale in WNI becomes more concrete in this study.</description>

      <title>From new physics to a running power law and back again: Minimal refitting techniques for the reconstruction of the gravitational-wave background signal in pulsar timing array data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations recently presented evidence for a gravitational-wave background (GWB) signal at nanohertz frequencies. In this paper, we introduce new refitting techniques for PTA data analysis that elevate related techniques in the literature to a more rigorous level and thus provide the basis for fast and accurate Bayesian inference and physically intuitive model comparisons. The key idea behind our approach is to construct maps \Phi from GWB spectral models to a running-power-law (RPL) reference model, such that the pullback \Phi^* P_RPL of the RPL posterior density P_RPL induces a likelihood on the GWB model parameter space; in other words, we refit spectral models to the RPL posterior density. In order to construct \Phi, we introduce a matched-filtering approach in which \Phi follows from a \chi^2 minimization that accounts for the frequency dependence of PTA sensitivity curves. We validate and illustrate our techniques by three concrete examples: GWs from stable cosmic strings, GWs from metastable strings, and scalar-induced GWs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method to search for gravitational waves from quasinormal modes in the ringdowns of the remnants of the mergers of the binary black hole systems. The method is based on maximum likelihood estimation. We derive a time-domain matched-filtering statistic that can be used to search for any number of modes in the data. The parameters of the modes can be estimated and the modes present in the data can be reconstructed. We perform Monte Carlo simulations of the method by injecting the quasinormal mode waveforms to noise. We analyze performance of the method for searches of quasinormal modes in the advanced detectors data like LIGO and Virgo, in the third generation of detectors like Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer and in the space detector LISA data. We analyze ringdown of publicly available GW190521 event and we compare our results with analysis by other methods.</description>

      <title>Multi-Model Framework for Reconstructing Gamma-Ray Burst Light Curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mitigating data gaps in Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) light curves (LCs) holds immense value for its application in cosmological research because it provides more precise measurements of the parameter of interest of the two-dimensional Dainotti relation which is a relation among the end time of the plateau emission, Ta, its respective luminosity, La which is calculated from the fluxes at the end of the plateau, Fa. This study extends the work done by arXiv:2305.12126; arXiv:2412.20091v4 on the 545 GRB sample by introducing six different models: Deep Gaussian Process (DGP), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), Hybrid model of Convolutional Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM), Bayesian Neural Network (BNN), Polynomial Curve Fitting and Isotonic Regression. Our findings demonstrate that Isotonic Regression achieves the highest uncertainty reduction for all three parameters (36.3% for log Ta, 36.1% for log Fa, and 43.6% for {\alpha}) outperforming all the other models. The CNN- LSTM model shows consistent improvements across all GRB parameters with the lowest outlier rate for {\alpha} (0.550%), surpassing the performance of the LSTM model in arXiv:2412.20091v4. The DGP model offers reliable uncertainty reduction across all parameters and improves upon the single-layer GP baseline. These advancements are essential for using GRBs as theoretical model discriminators via the parameters of their LCs and standard candles in cosmology, investigating theoretical models, and predicting GRB redshifts through recent cutting-edge machine-learning analysis (arXiv:2411.10736,arXiv:2405.02263; arXiv:2410.13985).</description>

      <title>Significance of soft-scale breaking on primordial black hole production in Coleman-Weinberg type supercooling-phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-supercooling phase transitions can generate large overdensities in the Universe, potentially leading to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs), which can also be a dark matter candidate. In this work, we focus on the supercooling phase transition for the scale symmetry breaking based on the effective potential of the Coleman-Weinberg (CW) type. We investigate the effect on the PBH production in the presence of an additional mass term for the CW scalar field, what we call a soft-scale breaking term, which serves as the extra explicit-scale breaking term other than the quantum scale anomaly induced by the CW mechanism. We demonstrate that even a small size of the soft-scale breaking term can significantly affect the PBH production depending on its sign: a positive term slows down the phase transition, thereby enhancing the PBH abundance and improving the model's ability to account for dark matter; in contrast, a negative term suppresses the PBH formation. The inclusion of such soft-scale breaking terms broadens the viable parameter space and increases the flexibility of the framework. We further illustrate our results through two ultraviolet-complete realizations: i) a many-flavor QCD-inspired model as a reference model which can dynamically induce a positive-soft scale breaking; ii) a Higgs portal model with a $B-L$ scalar as the benchmark for the case where a negative-soft scale breaking is induced. Our study would provide a new testable link between PBH dark matter and gravitational wave signatures in the CW-type scenario.</description>

      <title>Continuum optical-UV and X-ray variability of AGN: current results and future challenges</title>

Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are believed to be powered by accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole. A fundamental ingredient in shaping our understanding of AGN is their variability across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Variability studies have the potential to help us understand the geometry of the emitting regions (in various energy bands), their causal relations, and the physics of the accretion processes. This review focuses on the observational properties of AGN variability in the optical/UV/X-ray bands (where most of the AGN luminosity is emitted) and their dependence on the AGN physical parameters (i.e. mass, luminosity, accretion rate). We also discuss possible interpretations in the context of accreting compact systems, and we review the use of variability as a tool to discover AGN and trace their properties across cosmic time, using both ground and space facilities. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges provided by current and next-generation optical/X-ray surveys, to use variability as an effective tool to probe the growth of super massive black holes in the Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.24011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) measurements claim that the dark energy equation of state $w \ne -1$. This observation can be explained by the axion Dark Energy (aDE) model of an ultralight axion plus a cosmological constant $\Lambda$. Despite a relatively large degeneracy, there is a high probability that $\Lambda &lt;0$. This negative $\Lambda$ leads the universe to end in a big crunch. Using the best-fit values of the model as a benchmark, we find the lifespan of our universe to be 33 billion years.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Axions Revealed via Amplified Modulation of Ellipticity of Laser (CARAMEL)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new axion dark matter detection strategy that employs optical readout of laser beam ellipticity modulations caused by axion-induced electric fields in a microwave cavity, using electro-optic (EO) crystals, enhanced by externally injected radio-frequency (RF) power. Building upon the variance-based probing method, PRD 107, 103005, (2023), we extend this concept to the optical domain: a weak probe laser interacts with an EO crystal placed inside a resonant microwave cavity at cryogenic temperatures, and the axion-induced electric field is revealed through induced ellipticity. The injected RF signal coherently interferes with that of the axion field, amplifying the optical response and significantly improving sensitivity. While our EO-based method employs a Fabry-Perot resonator, we do not require Michelson interferometers. Our method hence enables compact, high-frequency axion searches, across the 0.5-50\,GHz range. Operating at cryogenic temperatures not only suppresses thermal backgrounds but, critically, allows the probing method to mitigate the laser quantum noise. This approach offers a scalable path forward for axion detection over the $\sim (\text{few}-200$)~$\mu$eV mass range -- covering the preferred parameter space for the post-inflationary Peccei-Quinn axion dark matter -- using compact, tunable systems.</description>

      <title>EMPRESS. XV. A New Determination of the Primordial Helium Abundance Suggesting a Moderately Low $Y_\mathrm{P}$ Value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new constraint on the primordial helium abundance, $Y_\mathrm{P}$, based on Subaru observations. A major source of uncertainty in previous $Y_\mathrm{P}$ determinations is the lack of extremely metal-poor galaxies (EMPGs; $0.01-0.1Z_\odot$), which have metallicities a few to ten times lower than the metal-poor galaxies (MPGs; $0.1-0.4Z_\odot$) predominantly used in earlier studies, requiring substantial extrapolation to zero metallicity. Here, we perform Subaru near-infrared spectroscopy of 29 galaxies, including 14 EMPGs. By incorporating existing optical spectra, we derive He/H for each galaxy using photoionization modeling of helium and hydrogen emission lines, including the He I 10830 {\AA} line to break the density-temperature degeneracy. After carefully selecting galaxies with robust He/H determinations, and adding 58 galaxies from previous studies, we obtain $Y_\mathrm{P} = 0.2387^{+0.0036}_{-0.0031}$. This $Y_\mathrm{P}$ value is $\sim1\sigma$ lower than most of the previous estimates, but agrees with recent determinations using EMPGs and the CMB constraint from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) experiment. Our result indicates $N_\mathrm{eff} = 2.54^{+0.21}_{-0.20}$, showing a mild ($1-2\sigma$) tension with the Standard Model and Planck results. These tensions may suggest a nonzero lepton asymmetry, which would be alleviated with $\xi_\mathrm{e} = 0.05^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$. More observations of EMPGs and further assessments of systematic uncertainties are essential to test the potential tension more rigorously.</description>

      <title>On the Physical Nature of Ly$\alpha$ Transmission Spikes in High Redshift Quasar Spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) transmission spikes at $5.2 &lt; z &lt; 6.8$ using synthetic quasar spectra from the ``Cosmic Reionization On Computers" simulations. We focus on understanding the relationship between these spikes and the properties of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Disentangling the complex interplay between IGM physics and the influence of galaxies on the generation of these spikes presents a significant challenge. To address this, we employ Explainable Boosting Machines, an interpretable machine learning algorithm, to quantify the relative impact of various IGM properties on the Ly$\alpha$ flux. Our findings reveal that gas density is the primary factor influencing absorption strength, followed by the intensity of background radiation and the temperature of the IGM. Ionizing radiation from local sources (i.e. galaxies) appears to have a minimal effect on Ly$\alpha$ flux. The simulations show that transmission spikes predominantly occur in regions of low gas density. Our results challenge recent observational studies suggesting the origin of these spikes in regions with enhanced radiation. We demonstrate that Ly$\alpha$ transmission spikes are largely a product of the large-scale structure, of which galaxies are biased tracers.</description>

      <title>Chronicling the reionization history at $6\lesssim z \lesssim 7$ with emergent quasar damping wings</title>

Abstract: The spectra of high-redshift ($z\gtrsim 6$) quasars contain valuable information on the progression of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). At redshifts $z&lt;6$, the observed Lyman-series forest shows that the intergalactic medium (IGM) is nearly ionized, while at $z&gt;7$ the observed quasar damping wings indicate high neutral gas fractions. However, there remains a gap in neutral gas fraction constraints at $6\lesssim z \lesssim 7$ where the Lyman series forest becomes saturated but damping wings have yet to fully emerge. In this work, we use a sample of 18 quasar spectra at redshifts $6.0&lt;z&lt;7.1$ to close this gap. We apply neural networks to reconstruct the quasars' continuum emission around the partially absorbed Lyman $\alpha$ line to normalize their spectra, and stack these continuum-normalized spectra in three redshift bins. To increase the robustness of our results, we compare the stacks to a grid of models from two hydrodynamical simulations, ATON and CROC, and we measure the volume-averaged neutral gas fraction, $\bar{x}_{\rm HI}$, while jointly fitting for the mean quasar lifetime, $t_{\rm Q}$, for each stacked spectrum. We chronicle the evolution of neutral gas fraction using the ATON (CROC) models as follows: $\bar{x}_{\rm HI} = 0.21_{-0.07}^{+0.17}$ ($\bar{x}_{\rm HI} = 0.10_{&lt;10^{-4}}^{+0.73}$) at $\langle z \rangle =6.10$, $\bar{x}_{\rm HI} = 0.21_{-0.07}^{+0.33}$ ($\bar{x}_{\rm HI} =0.57_{-0.47}^{+0.26}$) at $\langle z \rangle =6.46$, and $\bar{x}_{\rm HI} = 0.37_{-0.17}^{+0.17}$ ($\bar{x}_{\rm HI} =0.57_{-0.21}^{+0.26}$) at $\langle z \rangle =6.87$. At the same time we constrain the average quasar lifetime to be $t_{\rm Q} \lesssim 7\ {\rm Myr}$ across all redshift bins, in good agreement with previous studies.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Origin of CMB Large-Scale Features Using LiteBIRD and CMB-S4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several missions following Planck are currently under development, which will provide high-precision measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies. Specifically, measurements of the E modes will become nearly limited by cosmic variance, which, especially when considering the sharpness of the E-mode transfer functions, may allow for the ability to detect deviations from the concordance model in the CMB data. We investigate the capability of upcoming missions to scrutinize models that have been proposed to address large-scale anomalies observed in the temperature spectra from WMAP and Planck. To this purpose, we consider four benchmarks that modify the CMB angular power spectra at large scales: models producing suppression, a dip, and amplification in the primordial scalar power spectrum, as well as a beyond-Lambda CDM prescription of dark energy. Our analysis shows that large-scale measurements from LiteBIRD will be able to distinguish between various types of primordial and late-time models that predict modifications to the angular spectra at these scales. Moreover, if these deviations from the standard cosmological model are determined to be systematic and do not reflect the true universe model, future experiments could potentially dismiss these features as statistical fluctuations. We also show that additional measurements from CMB-S4 can impose more stringent constraints by probing correlated signals that these models predict at smaller scales (l&gt;100). A byproduct of our analysis is that a recently proposed "Dark Dimension" scenario, featuring power amplification at large scales, is strongly bound by current data, pushing the deviation from the standard model to unobservable scales. Overall, our results demonstrate that future CMB measurements can provide valuable insights into large-scale anomalies that are present in the current CMB data.</description>

      <title>Impact of particle production during inflation on the CMB detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work focuses on particle production described by a nonminimally coupled model during inflation. In this model, three parameters determine the characteristic frequency and strength of the induced gravitational waves (GWs). Considering the impact of particle production on inflation, we identify the parameter values that generate the strongest GWs without violating the slow-roll mechanism at the CMB scale. However, even with such extreme parameters, the power spectrum of induced GWs is only about three thousandths of that of primordial GWs. This contribution remains insignificant when identifying the primary source of the detected CMB B-mode polarization. Furthermore, when our results are integrated with the constraints driven by P+ACT+LB+BK18, the contribution of induced GWs at CMB scales becomes negligible. In contrast, their impact on the scalar spectral index $n_s$ proves significant. For a range of parameter values, the Starobinsky inflation model yields predictions for $n_s$ that are consistent with the measurements obtained from P+ACT+LB+BK18.</description>

Abstract: As wide-field surveys yield increasingly precise data, multiprobe analyses offer significant advantages. In this work, we use our previously developed framework for jointly analyzing cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large-scale structure data. We analyze combinations of three CMB (Planck PR3, Planck PR4, and ACT+WMAP) datasets, DESI Y1 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data, and a $9\times 2$pt low-$z$ dataset comprising KiDS-1000, BOSS DR12, and Planck CMB lensing/Integrated Sachs Wolfe (including all cross-correlations). We first assess internal consistency, finding a mild ($&lt;2\sigma$) tension between CMB and low-$z$ datasets in the full parameter space and hints of systematics in Planck PR3 and KiDS-1000. We then derive constraints in $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ and, motivated by recent DESI results, dynamical dark energy ($w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$) and free neutrino mass extensions. In $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$, we derive a novel $9\times2$pt constraint of $S8=0.777^{+0.17}_{-0.17}$ and find strong consistency among CMB datasets. In $w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$, adding low-$z$ to CMB+BAO tightens $(w_0,w_a)$ constraints by 50\% (in figure-of-merit terms) in our baseline combination of Planck PR4 + low-$z$ + BAO. The posterior accommodates a cosmological constant ($w_0 = -1, w_a = 0$) within $1\sigma$, in contrast to the $\sim2\sigma$ preference for evolving dark energy from CMB+BAO alone. For neutrino masses, our baseline dataset yields a systematics-robust constraint of $M_\nu&lt;0.12\mathrm{eV}$ in $\nu\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$. Allowing dynamical dark energy and free neutrino mass ($\nu w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$) broadens and shifts the neutrino mass posterior higher, yielding a $1.8\sigma$ constraint ($M_\nu=0.16^{+0.09}_{-0.09}\mathrm{eV}$) in our baseline. Our analysis demonstrates the power of multiprobe analyses for assessing tensions, identifying systematics and providing robust constraints.</description>

      <title>Accounting for motion of supernova host galaxy in statistical inference from SNIa data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a Bayesian method to estimate peculiar velocities of Type Ia supernova (SNIa) host galaxies by employing the magnitude-redshift relationship of SNIa. Random peculiar motions act as noise in the estimation of redshift, and constitute independent variables in the SNIa data. We develop a method to take into account errors in independent variables for general nonlinear models. Using the MCMC sampling technique, we implement numerical codes to estimate peculiar velocities along with other cosmological parameters. In this paper, we study the impact of these velocities on cosmological parameters by treating them as nuisance parameters. We apply our proposed method on the Pantheon sample of SNIa and show a few percent shift on the central values of inferred cosmological parameters. Although the current data are not particularly sensitive to this error, using simulated data, we also gauge the efficacy of our method on the future SNIa observations and show that future data require the inclusion of this error in cosmological parameter estimation. Our method complements several existing methods that seek to estimate peculiar velocities using galaxy data and N-body simulations and extends to higher redshifts.</description>

Abstract: Redshift-independent distances underpin much of astrophysics, and there exists a plethora of methods to estimate them. However, the extent to which the distances they imply are consistent, while crucial for the integrity of the distance ladder, has been little explored. We construct a statistical framework to assess both internal (between measurements with the same method) and external (between-method) consistency by comparing differences between distances to their quoted statistical uncertainties in the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database of Distances (NED-D). 66 of the 76 indicators in NED-D are amenable to a consistency test by having at least two measurements to the same galaxy or at least one measurement to a galaxy also measured by another method. We find that only 12 of these methods produce self-consistent distances across literature determinations, of which 7 are also consistent with distances to the same galaxies measured by all other methods. The most consistent 6 methods (M-stars luminosity, Novae, Masers, Globular Cluster Fundamental Plane, O- and B-type Supergiants and BL Lac Luminosity) also give similar average distances to the mean of all indicators, while the 7th (Proper Motion) underestimates distances relative to the mean by 17.1%. We also investigate consistency of Cepheid distances in the SH0ES 2022 catalogue, finding no evidence for unaccounted-for systematics. Our NED-D results imply that considerable work remains to obtain reliable distances by a multitude of methods, a crucial endeavour for constructing a multiply cross-checked and fully robust distance ladder. We make our code publicly available.</description>

      <title>DESI DR2 Results I: Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from the Lyman Alpha Forest</title>

Abstract: We present the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements with the Lyman-alpha (LyA) forest from the second data release (DR2) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. Our BAO measurements include both the auto-correlation of the LyA forest absorption observed in the spectra of high-redshift quasars and the cross-correlation of the absorption with the quasar positions. The total sample size is approximately a factor of two larger than the DR1 dataset, with forest measurements in over 820,000 quasar spectra and the positions of over 1.2 million quasars. We describe several significant improvements to our analysis in this paper, and two supporting papers describe improvements to the synthetic datasets that we use for validation and how we identify damped LyA absorbers. Our main result is that we have measured the BAO scale with a statistical precision of 1.1% along and 1.3% transverse to the line of sight, for a combined precision of 0.65% on the isotropic BAO scale at $z_{eff} = 2.33$. This excellent precision, combined with recent theoretical studies of the BAO shift due to nonlinear growth, motivated us to include a systematic error term in LyA BAO analysis for the first time. We measure the ratios $D_H(z_{eff})/r_d = 8.632 \pm 0.098 \pm 0.026$ and $D_M(z_{eff})/r_d = 38.99 \pm 0.52 \pm 0.12$, where $D_H = c/H(z)$ is the Hubble distance, $D_M$ is the transverse comoving distance, $r_d$ is the sound horizon at the drag epoch, and we quote both the statistical and the theoretical systematic uncertainty. The companion paper presents the BAO measurements at lower redshifts from the same dataset and the cosmological interpretation.</description>

      <title>Improving CMB constraints on early Universe physics with LSS: A multi-probe forecast including cross-covariance</title>

Abstract: Extensions to the $\Lambda\textrm{CDM}$ model prior to recombination can modify the growth of perturbations around radiation-matter equality, leaving a distinct signature in the matter power spectrum. Upcoming large-scale structure surveys will be sensitive to these features, allowing tests of early physics that are complementary to the CMB observations. In this paper, we forecast how well the combination of galaxy clustering, weak lensing and CMB lensing two point statistics, also known as $6\times2$pt analysis, will tighten constraints on extensions to the $\Lambda\textrm{CDM}$ model in the early Universe. We find significant improvements, in particular in the case of early dark energy, where the uncertainty on its density parameter could be divided by a factor of $3$ to $4$ when combining Euclid observables with Simons Observatory or CMB-S4, compared to using CMB observations alone. Testing for different scale cuts, we find that much of the constraining power comes from the largest scales which are less prone to systematic uncertainties. We take into account the most significant terms in the cross-covariance between large-scale structure tracers and CMB power spectra, which arises from gravitational lensing. Assessing the impact of this additional cross-covariance on the constraints, we find small corrections for most parameters, except for $A_s$ and $\tau$ where the lensing induced covariance leads to a more significant degradation of constraints. This forecast analysis highlights the potential of combining CMB and galaxy survey data to test the cosmological model. In particular, early Universe physics, relevant before recombination, stands out as a promising area that benefits substantially from this approach.</description>

      <title>The Intracluster Light of Abell 3667: Unveiling an Optical Bridge in LSST Precursor Data</title>

Abstract: Intracluster light, the diffuse glow of stars stripped from galaxies during a cluster's formation, is an established tracer of a cluster's dynamical history. The upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is set to revolutionize studies of intracluster light by imaging the entire southern sky down to a limiting surface brightness $\mu \gtrsim 30\text{mag}/\text{arcsec}^2$ by year ten. In this letter, we create a precursor LSST dataset (reaching the equivalent of year eight depth) using DECam observations of Abell 3667 and study its intracluster light. We have discovered a low surface brightness ($ \mu \gtrsim 26\text{mag}/\text{arcsec}^2 $) optical bridge extending over $\sim 400\text{ kpc}$ which connects the two brightest galaxies (BCG1 and BCG2) in the cluster; the color and surface brightness of the bridge is consistent with formation via a major merger. The inner regions of BCG1 ($r &lt; 200\text{ kpc}$) and BCG2 ($r &lt; 50\text{ kpc}$) are consistent with formation via gradual stripping of satellite galaxies, but BCG2's outer profile appears disrupted by a recent merger. We hypothesize that the bridge is a relic of a recent first-pass between the two brightest galaxies and is composed of stars being stripped from BCG2. Future studies of intracluster light with LSST will discover new features such as the bridge in local clusters while enabling detailed studies of the stellar populations of these features with its six photometric bands.</description>

      <title>Accurately simulating core-collapse self-interacting dark matter halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The properties of satellite halos provide a promising probe for dark matter (DM) physics. Observations motivate current efforts to explain surprisingly compact DM halos. If DM is not collisionless but has strong self-interactions, halos can undergo gravothermal collapse, leading to higher densities in the central region of the halo. However, it is challenging to model this collapse phase from first principles. To improve on this, we seek to better understand numerical challenges and convergence properties of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) N-body simulations in the collapse phase. Especially we aim for a better understanding of the evolution of satellite halos. To do so, we run SIDM N-body simulations of a low mass halo in isolation and within an external gravitational potential. The simulation setup is motivated by the perturber of the stellar stream GD-1. We find that the halo evolution is very sensitive to energy conservation errors, and a too large SIDM kernel size can artificially speed up the collapse. Moreover, we demonstrate that the King model can describe the density profile at small radii for the late stages that we have simulated. Furthermore, for our highest-resolved simulation (N = 5x10^7) we make the data public. It can serve as a benchmark. Overall, we find that the current numerical methods do not suffer from convergence problems in the late collapse phase and provide guidance on how to choose numerical parameters, e.g. that the energy conservation error is better kept well below 1%. This allows to run simulations of halos becoming concentrated enough to explain observations of GD-1 like stellar streams or strong gravitational lensing systems.</description>

      <title>To collapse or not to collapse: Halo evolution with self-interacting dark matter mass segregation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surprisingly compact substructures in galaxies and galaxy clusters, but also field halos, have been observed by gravitational lensing. They could be difficult to explain with collisionless dark matter (DM). To explain those objects, recent studies focused on the gravothermal collapse that halos consisting of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) can undergo. However, simple models of elastic scattering could face problems explaining those compact objects during very later stages of the collapse and the post-collapse phase, where a black hole may have formed from DM. We aim to explain compact halos while avoiding the gravothermal catastrophe to which typical SIDM models are subject. Therefore, we investigate the evolution of a DM halo for an SIDM model consisting of two species with unequal masses, which features only interactions between the different species but not within themselves. Employing $N$-body simulations, we study the effect of unequal-mass SIDM models on the evolution of an isolated DM halo. In particular, the late stages of its evolution with high central densities are simulated. We find that our two-species SIDM models can produce density cores with their size depending on the mass ratio of the two species. Moreover, mass segregation caused by the unequal particle masses leads to a finite final density state or at least a slowly growing density, which depends on the mass ratio and the mass fraction of the two DM species. SIDM models consisting of two DM species can simultaneously explain DM halos with density cores, as well as systems that are denser in their centre than expected from collisionless DM, while avoiding the gravothermal catastrophe. They are a compelling alternative to single-species models, offering a rich phenomenology.</description>

      <title>X-ray investigation of the remarkable galaxy group Nest200047</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11312v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy groups are more susceptible to feedback from the central active galactic nuclei (AGN) due to their lower gravitational binding energy compared to clusters. This makes them ideal laboratories to study feedback effects on the overall energy and baryonic mass budget. We study the LOFAR-detected galaxy group Nest200047, where there is clear evidence of multiple generations of radio lobes from the AGN. Using 140 ks Chandra and 25 ks XMM-Newton data, we investigate thermodynamic properties of the the intragroup medium including any excess energy due to the central AGN. We also investigate X-ray properties of the central black hole and constrain the $2-10$ keV X-ray flux. We used spectral analysis techniques to measure various thermodynamic profiles across the whole field of view. We also used both imaging and spectral analysis to detect and estimate the energy deposited by potential shocks and cavities. Due to the faint emission from the object beyond the core, various background effects were considered. Nest200047 has significant excess entropy, and the AGN likely contributes to a part of it. There is an excess energy of $(5-6.5) \times 10^{60}$ erg within 400 kpc, exceeding the binding energy. The pressure profile indicates that gas is likely being ejected from the system, resulting in a baryon fraction of $\sim4\%$ inside $r_{500}$. From scaling relations, we estimate a black hole mass of $(1-4)\times 10^9 M_{\odot}$. An upper limit of $2.1 \times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ was derived on the black hole bolometric luminosity, which is $\sim$2.5% of the Bondi accretion power. Nest200047 is likely part of a class of over-heated galaxy groups like ESO 3060170, AWM 4 and AWM 5. Such excessive heating may lead to high quenching of star formation. Moreover, the faint X-ray nuclear emission in Nest is likely due to the accretion energy being converted into jets rather than radiation.</description>

      <title>What new physics can we extract from inflation using the ACT DR6 and DESI DR2 Observations?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of inflationary models in light of projected sensitivities from forthcoming CMB and gravitational wave experiments, incorporating data from recent ACT DR6, DESI DR2, CMB-S4, LiteBIRD, and SPHEREx. Focusing on precise predictions in the $(n_s, \alpha_s, \beta_s)$ parameter space, we evaluate a broad class of inflationary scenarios -- including canonical single-field models, non-minimally coupled theories, and string-inspired constructions such as Starobinsky, Higgs, Hilltop, $\alpha$-attractors, and D-brane models. Our results show that next-generation observations will sharply constrain the scale dependence of the scalar power spectrum, elevating $\alpha_s$ and $\beta_s$ as key discriminants between large-field and small-field dynamics. Strikingly, several widely studied models -- such as quartic Hilltop inflation and specific DBI variants -- are forecast to be excluded at high significance. We further demonstrate that the combined measurement of $\beta_s$ and the field excursion $\Delta\phi$ offers a novel diagnostic of kinetic structure and UV sensitivity. These findings underscore the power of upcoming precision cosmology to probe the microphysical origin of inflation and decisively test broad classes of theoretical models.</description>

Abstract: We study a mechanism to make dark matter stable based on the Pauli blocking in the fermion background. In the background where fermions occupy the states, the decay of dark matter to those final states is not allowed, as a result, DM becomes stable. We derive the evolution equations of the distribution function in the quantum field theory and compare it with the Boltzmann equation. We apply this mechanism to a realistic model of neutrino and dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00358v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new self-consistent perturbative expansion for realistic isolated differentially rotating systems -- disc galaxies. At leading order it is formally equivalent to Ehlers' Newton-Cartan limit, which we reinterpret in terms of quasilocal energy and angular momentum. The self-consistent coupling of these quasilocal terms leads to first-order differences from the conventional Newtonian limit. A modified Poisson equation is obtained, along with modifications to the equations of motion for the effective fluid elements. By fitting to astrophysical data, we show that the phenomenology of collisionless dark matter for disc galaxies can be reproduced. Potential important consequences for gravitational physics on galactic and cosmological scales are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Stellar reddening map from DESI imaging and spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05140v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new Galactic dust reddening maps of the high Galactic latitude sky using DESI imaging and spectroscopy. We directly measure the reddening of 2.6 million stars by comparing the observed stellar colors in $g-r$ and $r-z$ from DESI imaging with the synthetic colors derived from DESI spectra from the first two years of the survey. The reddening in the two colors is on average consistent with the Fitzpatrick (1999) extinction curve with $R_\mathrm{V}=3.1$. We find that our reddening maps differ significantly from the commonly used Schlegel et al. (1998) (SFD) reddening map (by up to 80 mmag in $E(B-V)$), and we attribute most of this difference to systematic errors in the SFD map. To validate the reddening map, we select a galaxy sample with extinction correction based on our reddening map, and this yields significantly better uniformity than the SFD extinction correction. Finally, we discuss the potential systematic errors in the DESI reddening measurements, including the photometric calibration errors that are the limiting factor on our accuracy. The $E(g-r)$ and $E(r-z)$ maps presented in this work, and for convenience their corresponding $E(B-V)$ maps with SFD calibration, are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Stable massless scalar polarization of f(R) gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polarization is a prominent feature of gravitational wave observations and can be used to distinguish between different modified gravity theories. Compared to General Relativity, f(R) gravity exhibits an additional polarization originating from a scalar field, which is a combination of the longitudinal and breathing modes. When the scalar mass of f(R) is zero, the mixed mode will reduce to a pure breathing mode with the disappearance of the longitudinal mode. However, this reducing seems to be disallowed because a positive scalar mass is often required to maintain the stability of the cosmological perturbation. In fact, the massless scalar case can provide a stable perturbation, but more detailed constraints need to be considered. For the completeness of the polarization analysis, we explore the possibility that there are stable massless scalar polarizations in viable dark energy f(R) models. We find that the existence of stable massless scalar polarization depends on the structure of f(R) model and can be used to distinguish different models in f(R) gravity.</description>

Abstract: The geometric distances of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are challenging to measure because of their exceptionally compact structure yet vast cosmic distances. A combination of spectroastrometry and reverberation mapping (SARM) of broad-line regions (BLRs) constitutes a novel means to probe the geometric distance of AGNs, which has recently become practically feasible owing to successful interferometric observations with VLTI/GRAVITY. Here, we perform SARM analysis of four nearby quasars: Mrk 509, PDS 456, 3C 273, and NGC 3783. Results for the former two are reported for the first time and the latter two are revisited using our improved BLR dynamical modeling that includes the radial-dependent responsivity of BLRs. This allows us to self-consistently account for the emissivity weighting of the BLR in spectroastrometry and responsivity weighting in reverberation mapping. We obtain angular-diameter distances of the four quasars, from which we derive a Hubble constant of $H_0=69_{-10}^{+12}\,\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}$. Although this constitutes a large uncertainty for a measurement of $H_0$, it is anticipated that the precision will improve to a competitive level once a greater number of AGNs are accessible following the upgrade of GRAVITY in the near future. From SARM analysis, the black hole masses of the four quasars are also measured with the statistical uncertainty ranging from 0.06 to 0.23 dex, consistent with the correlations between black hole masses and properties of the host bulges.</description>

      <title>How Much NEC Breaking Can the Universe Endure?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum fields can notoriously violate the null energy condition (NEC). In a cosmological context, NEC violation can lead to, e.g., dark energy at late times with an equation-of-state parameter smaller than $-1$ and nonsingular bounces at early times. However, it is expected that there should still be a limit in semiclasssical gravity to how much `negative energy' can accumulate over time and in space as a result of quantum effects. In the course of formulating quantum-motivated energy conditions, the smeared null energy condition has emerged as a recent proposal. This condition conjectures the existence of a semilocal bound on negative energy along null geodesics, which is expected to hold in semiclassical gravity. In this work, we show how the smeared null energy condition translates into theoretical constraints on NEC-violating cosmologies. Specifically, we derive the implied bounds on dark energy equation-of-state parameters and an inequality between the duration of a bouncing phase and the growth rate of the Hubble parameter at the bounce. In the case of dark energy, we identify the parameter space over which the smeared null energy condition is consistent with the recent constraints from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI).</description>

      <title>Evidence for Large-Scale Cold Gas Outflows Associated with Nuclear Winds in Reionization-Era Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are thought to influence the evolution of their host galaxies through multi-phase feedback driven by powerful nuclear outflows. Although this mechanism is central to theoretical models of SMBH--galaxy co-evolution across cosmic time, direct observational evidence connecting nuclear winds to large-scale cold gas outflows remains limited, especially in the early universe. Here we report statistical evidence for such a connection in a sample of luminous quasars at $z \sim 5.5$. We compare stacked [C\,{\sc ii}] 158 $\mu$m emission profiles from ALMA observations, which trace galactic-scale neutral gas, for quasars with and without broad absorption lines (BALs) that indicate powerful nuclear winds on sub-kiloparsec scales. The BAL quasar stack exhibits a significant (S/N = 4.45) blueshifted broad component in the [C\,{\sc ii}] line profile, with a velocity offset of $\Delta v_{\rm b} = -2.1 \times 10^2\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ and a full width at half maximum of $1.18 \times 10^3\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, whereas the non-BAL stack shows no such feature. We estimate that a few percent to one-quarter of the nuclear wind energy may be transferred to cold neutral gas on kiloparsec scales. These results suggest that BAL winds can couple to the host galaxy's interstellar medium, providing empirical support for models of multi-phase AGN feedback. This mechanism may also contribute to the observed diversity in $M_{\rm BH}/M_*$ among luminous quasars recently identified by JWST.</description>

      <title>Influence of Dark Matter on the Formation of Biogenic Elements in Early Universe Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that dark matter interactions can profoundly influence stellar nucleosynthesis in the early universe by altering thermodynamic gradients and modifying nuclear reaction rates within primordial stars. Incorporating a dark matter-modified Fermi-Dirac distribution and accounting for localized energy injection from annihilation heating, our model predicts enhanced production of carbon and nitrogen alongside reduced oxygen synthesis. These compositional shifts significantly reshape stellar structure and produce synthetic spectra that closely reproduce the observed characteristics of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars. Our findings reveal a direct and previously overlooked role of dark matter in driving the chemical evolution of the early cosmos, offering a plausible link between fundamental particle physics and observable astrophysical signatures.</description>

      <title>On the Dark-Energy Enigma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a model that offers an explanation for the presence of (Dark Matter and) Dark Energy in the universe. A key idea is to express the volume form of the Lorentzian metric on space-time in terms of a positive function of a new scalar field multiplying a certain four-form given by the wedge product of the differential of the mimetic scalar field and a certain closed three-form. An ansatz for this three-form related to one commonly used to determine the winding number of a map from a three-dimensional hypersurface to a three-sphere is discussed. An action functional depending on the space-time metric, the new scalar field, the mimetic scalar and the three-form is proposed, and the field equations are derived. Special solutions of these equations for a Friedmann-Lema\^itre universe are presented.</description>
