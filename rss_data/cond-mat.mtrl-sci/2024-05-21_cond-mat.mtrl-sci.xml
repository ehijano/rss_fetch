      <title>Integration of Scanning Probe Microscope with High-Performance Computing: fixed-policy and reward-driven workflows implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of computation power and machine learning algorithms has paved the way for automating scientific discovery with a scanning probe microscope (SPM). The key elements towards operationalization of automated SPM are the interface to enable SPM control from Python codes, availability of high computing power, and development of workflows for scientific discovery. Here we build a Python interface library that enables controlling an SPM from either a local computer or a remote high-performance computer (HPC), which satisfies the high computation power need of machine learning algorithms in autonomous workflows. We further introduce a general platform to abstract the operations of SPM in scientific discovery into fixed-policy or reward-driven workflows. Our work provides a full infrastructure to build automated SPM workflows for both routine operations and autonomous scientific discovery with machine learning.</description>

      <title>Beyond Lithium-Ion Batteries: Are Effective Electrodes Possible for Alkaline and Other Alkali Elements? Exploring Ion Intercalation in Surface-Modified Few-Layer Graphene and Examining Layer Quantity and Stages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the quest for better energy storage solutions, the role of designing effective electrodes is crucial. Previous research has shown that using materials like single-side fluorinated graphene can improve the stability of ion insertion in few-layer graphene (FLG), which is vital as we move beyond lithium-ion batteries. Alternatives such as sodium and potassium, which are more abundant on Earth, appear promising, but thorough studies on how these ions insert into electrodes in stages are still needed. Our research focuses on the initial three alkali (Li, Na, K) and alkaline (Be, Mg, Ca) earth metals. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) with advanced calculations, we've investigated how these ions interact with modified graphene at various stages of insertion. This method provides more precise electrical data and has helped us understand the complex interactions involved. Specifically, we found a new site for ion insertion that is energetically favorable. We also explored how modifying the graphene surface affects ions of different sizes and charges and examined how the number of graphene layers influences these interactions. Our discoveries are crucial for developing new materials that could replace lithium-ion batteries and provide a foundation for adjusting electrical properties in battery design through ion staging and surface modifications.</description>

      <title>Ultraclean suspended graphene by radiolysis of adsorbed water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Access to intrinsic properties of a 2D material is challenging due to the absence of a bulk that would dominate over surface contamination, and this lack of bulk also precludes effective conventional cleaning methods that are almost always sacrificial. Suspended graphene and carbon contaminants represent the most salient challenge. This work has achieved ultraclean graphene, attested by electron energy loss (EEL) spectra unprecedentedly exhibiting fine-structure features expected from bonding and band structure. In the cleaning process in a transmission electron microscope, radicals generated by radiolysis of intentionally adsorbed water remove organic contaminants, which would otherwise be feedstock of the notorious electron irradiation induced carbon deposition. This method can be readily adapted to other experimental settings and other materials, to enable previously inhibited undertakings that rely on the intrinsic properties or ultimate thinness of 2D materials. Importantly, the method is surprisingly simple and robust, easily implementable with common lab equipment.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional mapping and electronic origin of large altermagnetic splitting near Fermi level in CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a new kind of collinear magnetism, dubbed altermagnetism, has attracted considerable interests. A key characteristic of altermagnet is the momentum-dependent band and spin splitting without net magnetization. However, finding altermagnetic materials with large splitting near the Fermi level, which necessarily requires three-dimensional k-space mapping and is crucial for spintronic applications and emergent phenomena, remains challenging. Here by employing synchrotron-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and model calculations, we uncover a large altermagnetic splitting, up to ~1.0 eV, near the Fermi level in CrSb. We verify its bulk-type g-wave altermagnetism through systematic three-dimensional kspace mapping, which unambiguously reveals the altermagnetic symmetry and associated nodal planes. The ARPES results are well captured by density functional theory calculations. In addition, tight-binding model analysis indicate that the large altermagnetic splitting arises from strong third-nearest-neighbor hopping mediated by Sb ions, which breaks both the space-time reversal symmetry and the translational spin-rotation symmetry. The large band/spin splitting near Fermi level in metallic CrSb, together with its high TN (up to 705 K) and simple spin configuration, paves the way for exploring emergent phenomena and spintronic applications based on altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Observation of Spin Splitting in Room-Temperature Metallic Antiferromagnet CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, unconventional antiferromagnets that enable the splitting of electronic spins have been theoretically proposed and experimentally realized, where the magnetic sublattices containing moments pointing at different directions are connected by a novel set of symmetries. Such spin splitting (SS) is substantial, $k$-dependent, and independent of the spin-orbit coupling strength, making these magnets promising materials for antiferromagnetic spintronics. Here, combined with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we perform a systematic study on CrSb, a metallic spin-split antiferromagnet candidate with $T_N$ = 703 K. Our data reveals the electronic structure of CrSb along both out-of-plane and in-plane momentum directions, which renders anisotropic $k$-dependent SS and agrees well with the calculational results. The magnitude of such SS reaches up to at least 0.8 eV at non-high-symmetry momentum points, which is significantly higher than the largest known SOC-induced SS. This compound expands the choice of materials in the field of antiferromagnetic spintronics and is likely to stimulate subsequent investigations of high-efficiency spintronic devices that are functional at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Large band-splitting in $g$-wave type altermagnet CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism (AM), a newly discovered magnetic state, ingeniously integrates the properties of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, representing a significant breakthrough in the field of magnetic materials. Despite experimental verification of some typical AM materials, such as MnTe and MnTe$_2$, the pursuit of AM materials that feature larger spin splitting and higher transition temperature is still essential. Here, our research focuses on CrSb, which possesses N{\'e}el temperature of up to 700K and giant spin splitting near the Fermi level ($E_F$). Utilizing high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we meticulously map the three-dimensional electronic structure of CrSb. Our photoemission spectroscopic results on both (0001) and (10$\overline{1}$0) cleavages of CrSb collaboratively reveal unprecedented details on AM-induced band splitting, and subsequently pin down its unique bulk $g$-wave symmetry through quantitative analysis of the angular and photon-energy dependence of spin splitting. Moreover, the observed spin splitting reaches the magnitude of 0.93~eV near $E_F$, the most substantial among all confirmed AM materials. This study not only validates the nature of CrSb as a prototype $g$-wave like AM material but also underscores its pivotal role in pioneering applications in spintronics.</description>

      <title>A phonon-driven mechanism for an emergent and reversible chirality in crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate from first-principles calculations applied to the K$_{3}$NiO$_{2}$ crystal that a structural phase transition from an achiral to a chiral phase can be mediated by a soft zone boundary phonon and that it can be controlled by pressure and epitaxial strain. Calculations in the presence of an electric field hint at a rich physics dominated by the competition between chirality, polar, and achiral distortions. Induced by the interaction between chiral, polar, and axial phonons, an optimal parameter window for the permanent reversal of chirality is observed.</description>

      <title>Dark-Field X-Ray Microscopy with Structured Illumination for Three-Dimensional Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a structured illumination technique for dark-field x-ray microscopy optimized for three-dimensional imaging of ordered materials at sub-micrometer length scales. Our method utilizes a coded aperture to spatially modulate the incident x-ray beam on the sample, enabling the reconstruction of the sample's 3D structure from images captured at various aperture positions. Unlike common volumetric imaging techniques such as tomography, our approach casts a scanning x-ray silhouette of a coded aperture for depth resolution along the axis of diffraction, eliminating any need for sample rotation or rastering, leading to a highly stable imaging modality. This modification provides robustness against geometric uncertainties during data acquisition, particularly for achieving sub-micrometer resolutions where geometric uncertainties typically limit resolution. We introduce the image reconstruction model and validate our results with experimental data on an isolated twin domain within a bulk single crystal of an iron pnictide obtained using a dark-field x-ray microscope. This timely advancement aligns with the enhanced brightness upgrade of the world's synchrotron radiation facilities, opening unprecedented opportunities in imaging.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous antiferroelectric ordering in NaNbO3-SrSnO3 ceramics revealed by direct superstructure imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NaNbO3-based antiferroelectric materials offer a promising pathway towards greener and more cost-effective energy storage devices. However, their intrinsic structural instabilities often lead to reduced energy density that compromises their performance and longevity. In this brief communication, we demonstrate how Dark-Field X-ray Microscopy, when carried out on the characteristically weak 1/4{843}pc superstructure reflection, can map the antiferroelectric phase and its strain heterogeneity in typically small, deeply-embedded grains of a NaNbO3 and 0.95NaNbO3-0.05SrSnO3 ceramics, representative of different phase transition behavior. Our results clearly evidences the stabilizing effect of SrSnO3 on the antiferroelectric phase by enhancing the degree of mesostructural order. In doing so, our method establishes a new platform for exploring the impact of disorder on the long-range strain heterogeneity within antiferroelectrics and other materials with modulated crystal structures.</description>

      <title>Engineering band structures of two-dimensional materials with remote moire ferroelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stacking order and twist angle provide abundant opportunities for engineering band structures of two-dimensional materials, including the formation of moire bands, flat bands, and topologically nontrivial bands. The inversion symmetry breaking in rhombohedral-stacked transitional metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) endows them with an interfacial ferroelectricity associated with an out-of-plane electric polarization. By utilizing twist angle as a knob to construct rhombohedral-stacked TMDCs, antiferroelectric domain networks with alternating out-of-plane polarization can be generated. Here, we demonstrate that such spatially periodic ferroelectric polarizations in parallel-stacked twisted WSe2 can imprint their moire potential onto a remote bilayer graphene. This remote moire potential gives rise to pronounced satellite resistance peaks besides the charge-neutrality point in graphene, which are tunable by the twist angle of WSe2. Our observations of ferroelectric hysteresis at finite displacement fields suggest the moire is delivered by a long-range electrostatic potential. The constructed superlattices by moire ferroelectricity represent a highly flexible approach, as they involve the separation of the moire construction layer from the electronic transport layer. This remote moire is identified as a weak potential and can coexist with conventional moire. Our results offer a comprehensive strategy for engineering band structures and properties of two-dimensional materials by utilizing moire ferroelectricity.</description>

      <title>Phase-field analysis for brittle fracture in ferroelectric materials with flexoelectric effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of brittle failure in ferroelectric materials is essential, but difficult due to the complex interaction between mechanical and electrical concentrated fields near the crack tip. In this work, an extended phase-field model incorporating multiple order parameters is constructed to analyze the coupled evolution of fracture and domain behavior in ferroelectric materials. The strain gradient is incorporated into the governing equations to evaluate the impact of the flexoelectric effect during the crack propagation process. Our advanced phase-field model demonstrated that, with the consideration of the flexoelectric effect, both the crack extension rate and crack path are related to the initial polarization direction. This phenomenon is associated with the eigenstrain induced by the flexoelectric effect. This study provides in-depth insight into the fracture behavior of ferroelectric materials. The developed model framework can also be employed to investigate electromechanical coupling failures in more complex ferroelectric structures.</description>

      <title>Spin dependent bandgap renormalization and state filling effect in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ observed by ultrafast Kerr rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ultrafast spin dynamics of the prototypical topological insulator $\mathrm{Bi_{2}Se_{3}}$ using time-resolved Kerr-rotation (polarization-change) measurements across near-infrared wavelengths. The Kerr-rotation angle $\Delta \theta_{K}$ of $\mathrm{Bi_{2}Se_{3}}$ was found to significantly depend on photon energy around a resonance transition ($\sim 1.0\ \mathrm{eV}$) of bulk states, as well as the ellipticity of the pump light, in the presence of spin excitation. The observed photon-energy dependence of $\Delta \theta_{K}$ can be well simulated by assuming spin-dependent refractive-index changes in the presence of band-gap renormalization and state-filling effect upon photoexcitation. Our study delivers comprehensive insights into the opto-spintronic properties of bulk $\mathrm{Bi_{2}Se_{3}}$ and the fundamental physical processes underlying polarization changes. These findings are expected to be crucial in developing ultrafast magneto-optical memory devices, which can perform read-and-write operations in the Terahertz regime.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial RuO$_2$ and IrO$_2$ films by pulsed laser deposition on TiO$_2$(110)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic growth study of epitaxial RuO$_2$(110) and IrO$_2$(110) on TiO$_2$(110) substrates by pulsed laser deposition. We describe the main challenges encountered in the growth process, such as a deteriorating material flux due to laser induced target metallization or the delicate balance of under- vs over-oxidation of the 'stubborn' Ru and Ir metals. We identify growth temperatures and oxygen partial pressures of 700 K, $1\times 10^{-3}$ mbar for RuO$_2$ and 770 K, $5\times 10^{-4}$ mbar for IrO$_2$ to optimally balance between metal oxidation and particle mobility during nucleation. In contrast to IrO$_2$, RuO$_2$ exhibits layer-by-layer growth up to 5 unit cells if grown at high deposition rates. At low deposition rates, the large lattice mismatch between film and substrate fosters initial 3D island growth and cluster formation. In analogy to reports for RuO$_2$ based on physical vapor deposition, we find these islands to eventually merge and growth to continue in a step flow mode, resulting in highly crystalline, flat, stoichiometric films of RuO$_2$(110) (up to 30 nm thickness) and IrO$_2$(110) (up to 13 nm thickness) with well defined line defects.</description>

      <title>Emergent Ferromagnetism at LaFeO3/SrTiO3 Interface Arising from Strain-induced Spin-State Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating new interfacial magnetic states with desired functionalities is attractive for fundamental studies and spintronics applications. The emergence of interfacial magnetic phases demands the fabrication of pristine interfaces and the characterization and understanding of atomic structure as well as electronic, magnetic, and orbital degrees of freedom at the interface. Here, we report a novel interfacial insulating ferromagnetic order in antiferromagnetic LaFeO3 grown on SrTiO3, characterized by a combination of electron microscopy and spectroscopy, magnetometry, and density functional theory. The epitaxial strain drives a spin-state disproportionation in the interfacial layer of LaFeO3, which leads to a checkerboard arrangement of low- and high-spin Fe3+ ions inside smaller and larger FeO6 octahedra, respectively. Ferromagnetism at the interface arises from superexchange interactions between the low- and high-spin Fe3+. The detailed understanding of creation of emergent magnetism illustrates the potential of designing and controlling orbital degrees of freedom at the interface to realize novel phases and functionalities for future spin-electronic applications.</description>

      <title>Multi-task learning for molecular electronic structure approaching coupled-cluster accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) plays an important role in quantum chemistry, providing fast-to-evaluate predictive models for various properties of molecules. However, as most existing ML models for molecular electronic properties use density function theory (DFT) databases as the ground truth in training, their prediction accuracy cannot go beyond the DFT. In this work, we developed a unified ML method for electronic structures of organic molecules using the gold-standard CCSD(T) calculations as training data. Tested on hydrocarbon molecules, our model outperforms the DFT with the widely-used B3LYP functional in both computation costs and prediction accuracy of various quantum chemical properties. We apply the model to aromatic compounds and semiconducting polymers on both ground state and excited state properties, demonstrating its accuracy and generalization capability to complex systems that are hard to calculate using CCSD(T)-level methods.</description>

      <title>Mimicking Negative Mass Properties</title>

Abstract: In the present work, one analyzes two systems trying to obtain physical conditions where some properties attributed to negative mass can be mimicked by positive mass particles. The first one is the well-known 1/2-spin system described by the Dirac equation in the presence of an external electromagnetic field. Assuming some physical restrictions, one obtains that the use of $e\rightarrow-e$ can lead to the same results as using $m\rightarrow-m$. In particular, for a null dielectric function, it is possible to obtain a negative mass behavior from a positive mass system composed of negatively charged particles. The second system is based on the de Broglie matter wave. The dispersion relation of such a wave can be negative (real or imaginary valued) if one assumes an imaginary wavenumber. The consequence is the emergence of a negative refractive index for positive mass particles. However, this behavior is generally attributed to a negative mass system.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic growth of tantalum thin films for low-loss superconducting circuits</title>

Abstract: Motivated by recent advancements highlighting Ta as a promising material in low-loss superconducting circuits and showing long coherence times in superconducting qubits, we have explored the effect of cryogenic temperatures on the growth of Ta and its integration in superconducting circuits. Cryogenic growth of Ta using a low temperature molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) system is found to stabilize single phase $\alpha$-Ta on several different substrates, which include Al$\mathrm{_2}$O$\mathrm{_3}$(0001), Si(001), Si(111), SiN${_x}$, and GaAs(001). The substrates are actively cooled down to cryogenic temperatures and remain &lt; 20 K during the Ta deposition. X-ray $\theta$-2$\theta$ diffraction after warming to room temperature indicates the formation of polycrystalline $\alpha$-Ta. The 50 nm $\alpha$-Ta films grown on Al$\mathrm{_2}$O$\mathrm{_3}$(0001) at a substrate manipulator temperature of 7 K have a room temperature resistivity ($\mathrm{\rho _{300 K}}$) of 13.4 $\mathrm{\mu \Omega}$cm, a residual resistivity ratio (RRR) of 17.3 and a superconducting transition temperature (T$_C$) of 4.14 K, which are comparable to bulk values. In addition, atomic force microscopy (AFM) indicates that the film grown at 7 K with an RMS roughness of 0.45 nm was significantly smoother than the one grown at room temperature. Similar properties are found for films grown on other substrates. Results for films grown at higher substrate manipulator temperatures show higher $\mathrm{\rho _{300 K}}$, lower RRR and Tc, and increased $\beta$-Ta content. Coplanar waveguide resonators with a gap width of 3 $\mathrm{\mu}$m fabricated from cryogenically grown Ta on Si(111) and Al$\mathrm{_2}$O$\mathrm{_3}$(0001) show low power Q$_i$ of 1.9 million and 0.7 million, respectively, indicating polycrystalline $\alpha$-Ta films may be promising for superconducting qubit applications even though they are not fully epitaxial.</description>

      <title>The transition-metal-dichalcogenide family as a superconductor tuned by charge density wave strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metallic transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), consisting of H-NbSe$_2$, H-NbS$_2$, H-TaSe$_2$ and H-TaS$_2$, remain superconducting down to a thickness of a single layer. In these materials, thickness affects a variety of properties, including Ising protection, two-band superconductivity, and the critical temperature $T_C$, which decreases for the Nb-based, and increases for the Ta-based materials. This contradicting trend is puzzling, and has precluded the development of a unified theory. We approach the question of thickness-evolution of $T_C$ and the superconducting gap $\Delta$ by measuring high-resolution tunneling spectra in TaS$_2$-based stacked devices. Our measurements allow for simultaneous evaluation of $\Delta$, $T_C$, and the upper critical field $H_{C2}$. The latter, we find, is strongly enhanced towards the single-layer limit, following a $H_{C2} \propto \Delta^2$ proportionality ratio. Our main finding is that the same ratio holds for the entire family of metallic TMDs: TaS$_2$ and NbSe$_2$ of all thicknesses, bulk TaSe$_2$ and bulk NbS$_2$, extending over 4 orders of magnitude in $H_{C2}$ and covering both clean and dirty limits. We propose that this tunability across the TMD family is controlled by the competing charge density wave (CDW) phase. Using Gor'kov's theory, we calculate how a CDW order affects the quasiparticle density of states and the resulting $T_C$ and $H_{C2}$. Our results suggest that CDW is the key determinant factor limiting $T_C$ in the TMD family. They also show that $H_{C2}$ is universally enhanced by a factor of two orders of magnitude above the expected value, an effect that remains an open question.</description>

      <title>Quantum confinement theory of the heat capacity of thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theory and mechanistic understanding of the thermal properties of solids under nanoscale confinement are currently missing. We develop a theoretical quantum confinement description of thin films which predicts a new physical law for the heat capacity. In particular, due to the suppression of vibrational modes caused by the thin film confinement, the vibrational density of states (VDOS) deviates from the Debye quadratic law in frequency and is, instead, cubic in frequency. This leads to a temperature dependence of the heat capacity which is $\sim T^4$ instead of Debye's $\sim T^3$ law. Furthermore, the new theory predicts a linear increase of the heat capacity upon increasing the nanometric film thickness. Both dependencies are found in excellent agreement with recent experimental data on NbTiN thin films.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Discovery for Robust Optimization of Semiconductor Nanowire Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active wavelength-scale optoelectronic components are widely used in photonic integrated circuitry, however coherent sources of light -- namely optical lasers -- remain the most challenging component to integrate. Semiconductor nanowire lasers represent a flexible class of light source where each nanowire is both gain material and cavity; however, strong coupling between these properties and the performance leads to inhomogeneity across the population. While this has been studied and optimized for individual material systems, no architecture-wide insight is available. Here, nine nanowire laser material systems are studied and compared using 55,516 nanowire lasers to provide statistically robust insight into performance. These results demonstrate that, while it may be important to optimise internal quantum efficiency for certain materials, cavity effects are always critical. Our study provides a roadmap to optimize the performance of nanowire lasers made from any material: this can be achieved by ensuring a narrow spread of lengths and end-facet reflectivities.</description>

      <title>Observation of the Tetragonal-Orthorhombic transition in polycrystalline YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+\delta}$ samples during the oxidation process at constant temperature via thermogravimetry and differential thermometry analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work examines the oxygenation process of polycrystalline powder of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+\delta}$ superconductor material through constant temperature thermogravimetric analysis. Starting from completely deoxygenated samples ($\delta$ = 0), both the mass evolution in an oxygen atmosphere and a differential temperature value referenced to an inert sample (alumina powder) subjected to the same experimental conditions are recorded. The oxygenation process itself is identified as an exothermic process accompanied by a second also exothermic associated process. This second process is identified as the Tetragonal-Orthorhombic transition present in the material. Based on the obtained results, the structural phase diagram of the material is reconstructed. Issues of metastability of the structural phases, as well as the potential of the equipment used to obtain these results comparable to those obtained in large facilities, are discussed. Reinterpretations of previously discussed works in the literature are inferred.</description>

      <title>Correlated magnetism of moir\'e exciton-polaritons on a triangular electron-spin lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate evidence of correlated magnetism for exciton-polaritons in a MoSe$_{2}$/WS$_{2}$ moir\'e heterostructure with near-parallel alignment subject to electron doping. In our experiments, interactions between electrons and moir\'e excitons are controlled electrostatically by field-effect doping, and the polaritonic regime of strong light-matter coupling is established in an open cryogenic microcavity. Remarkably, at filling fractions around one electron per moir\'e cell, we observe drastic and nonlinear enhancement of the effective polariton Land\'e factor as a hallmark of correlated magnetism, which is cavity-controlled via resonance tuning of light and matter polariton constituents. Our work establishes moir\'e van der Waals heterostructures as an outstanding platform for studies of correlated phenomena in the presence of strong light-matter coupling and many-body phases of lattice-ordered excitons, charges and spins.</description>

      <title>Defect-assisted reversible phase transition in mono- and few-layer ReS$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) materials have attracted substantial interest due to their remarkable excitonic, optical, electrical, and mechanical properties, which are highly dependent on their crystal structure. Controlling the crystal structure of these materials is essential for fine-tuning their performance, $\textit{e.g.}$, linear and nonlinear optical, as well as charge transport properties. While various phase-switching TMD materials, like molybdenum telluride (MoTe$_2$), are available, their transitions are often irreversible. Here, we investigate the mechanism of a light-induced reversible phase transition in mono- and bilayer flakes of rhenium disulfide (ReS$_2$). Our observations, based on scanning transmission electron microscopy, nonlinear spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations, reveal a transition from the ground T$''$ (double distorted T) to the metastable H$'$ (distorted H) phase under femtosecond laser irradiation or influence of highly-energetic electrons. We show that the formation of sulfur vacancies facilitates this phenomenon. Our findings pave the way towards actively manipulating the crystal structure of ReS$_2$ and possibly its heterostructures.</description>

Abstract: Single crystals of U$_2$Mn$_3$Ge and and U$_2$Fe$_3$Ge with a Kagome lattice structure were synthesized using a high-temperature self-flux crystal growth method. The physical properties of these crystals were characterized through measurements of resistivity, magnetism, and specific heat. U$_2$Fe$_3$Ge exhibits ferromagnetic ground state and Anomalous Hall Effect, and U$_2$Mn$_3$Ge demonstrates a complex magnetic structure. Both compounds exhibit large Sommerfeld coefficient, indicating coexistence of heavy Fermion behavior with magnetism. Our results suggest that this U$_2$TM$_3$Ge (TM = Mn, Fe, Co) family is a promising platform to investigate the interplay of magnetism, Kondo physics and the Kagome lattice.</description>

      <title>A semiclassical model for charge transfer along ion chains in silicates</title>

Abstract: It has been observed in fossil tracks and experiments in the layered silicate mica muscovite the transport of charge through the cation layers sandwiched between the layers of tetrahedra-octahedra-tetrahedra. A classical model for the propagation of anharmonic vibrations along the cation chains has been proposed based on first principles and empirical functions. In that model, several propagating entities have been found as kinks or crowdions and breathers, both with or without wings, the latter for specific velocities and energies. Crowdions are equivalent to moving interstitials and transport electric charge if the moving particle is an ion, but they also imply the movement of mass, which was not observed in the experiments. Breathers, being just vibrational entities, do not transport charge. In this work, we present a semiclassical model obtained by adding a quantum particle, electron or hole to the previous model. We present the construction of the model based on the physics of the system. In particular, the strongly nonlinear vibronic interaction between the nuclei and the extra electron or hole is essential to explain the localized charge transport, which is not compatible with the adiabatic approximation. The formation of vibrational localized charge carriers breaks the lattice symmetry group in a similar fashion to the Jahn-Teller Effect, providing a new stable dynamical state. We study the properties and the coherence of the model through numerical simulations from initial conditions obtained by tail analysis and other means. We observe that although the charge spreads from an initial localization in a lattice at equilibrium, it can be confined basically to a single particle when coupled to a chaotic quasiperiodic breather. This is coherent with the observation that experiments imply that a population of charge is formed due to the decay of potassium unstable isotopes.</description>

      <title>Imaging the suppression of ferromagnetism in LaMnO$_3$ by metallic overlayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LaMnO$_3$ (LMO) thin films epitaxially grown on SrTiO$_3$ (STO) usually exhibit ferromagnetism above a critical layer thickness. We report the use of scanning SQUID microscopy (SSM) to study the suppression of the ferromagnetism in STO/LMO/metal structures. By partially covering the LMO surface with a metallic layer, both covered and uncovered LMO regions can be studied simultaneously. While Au does not significantly influence the ferromagnetic order of the underlying LMO film, a thin Ti layer induces a strong suppression of the ferromagnetism, over tens of nanometers, which increases with time on a timescale of days. Detailed EELS analysis of the Ti-LaMnO$_3$ interface reveals \textcolor{black}{the presence of Mn$^{2+}$ and} an evolution of the Ti valence state from Ti$^0$ to Ti$^{4+}$ over approximately 5 nanometers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by patterning Ti/Au overlayers, we can locally suppress the ferromagnetism and define ferromagnetic structures down to sub-micrometer scales.</description>

      <title>Going for Gold(-Standard): Attaining Coupled Cluster Accuracy in Oxide-Supported Nanoclusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The structure of oxide-supported metal nanoclusters plays an essential role in their sharply enhanced catalytic activity over bulk metals. Simulations provide the atomic-scale resolution needed to understand these systems. However, the sensitive mix of metal-metal and metal-support interactions which govern their structure puts stringent requirements on the method used, requiring going beyond standard density functional theory (DFT). The method of choice is coupled cluster theory [specifically CCSD(T)], but its computational cost has so far prevented applications. In this work, we showcase two approaches to make CCSD(T) accuracy readily achievable in oxide-supported nanoclusters. First, we leverage the SKZCAM protocol to provide the first benchmarks of oxide-supported nanoclusters, revealing that it is specifically metal-metal interactions that are challenging to capture with DFT. Second, we propose a CCSD(T) correction ($\Delta$CC) to the metal-metal interaction errors in DFT, reaching comparable accuracy to the SKZCAM protocol at significantly lower cost. This forges a path towards studying larger systems at reliable accuracy, which we highlight by identifying a ground state structure in agreement with experiments for Au$_{20}$ on MgO; a challenging system where DFT models have yielded conflicting predictions.</description>

      <title>Topological magnon gap engineering in van der Waals CrI$_3$ ferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The microscopic origin of the topological magnon band gap in CrI$_3$ ferromagnets has been a subject of controversy for years since two main models with distinct characteristics, i.e., Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) and Kitaev, provided possible explanations with different outcome implications. Here we investigate the angular magnetic field dependence of the magnon gap of CrI$_3$ by elucidating what main contributions play a major role in its generation. We implement stochastic atomistic spin dynamics simulations to compare the impact of these two spin interactions on the magnon spectra. We observe three distinct magnetic field dependencies between these two gap opening mechanisms. First, we demonstrate that the Kitaev-induced magnon gap is influenced by both the direction and amplitude of the applied magnetic field, while the DM-induced gap is solely affected by the magnetic field direction. Second, the position of the Dirac cones within the Kitaev-induced magnon gap shifts in response to changes in the magnetic field direction, whereas they remain unaffected by the magnetic field direction in the DM-induced gap scenario. Third, we find a direct-indirect magnon band-gap transition in the Kitaev model by varying the applied magnetic field direction. These differences may distinguish the origin of topological magnon gaps in CrI$_3$ and other van der Waals magnetic layers. Our findings pave the way for exploration and engineering topological gaps in van der Waals materials.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by recent experimental synthesis of the two-dimensional Janus material MoSH, we have performed extensive first-principles calculations to investigate the characteristics of all possible Janus two-dimensional transition metal hydrosulfides (JTMSHs), in both the 2H and 1T phases. Our investigations revealed that the JTMSHs can form a unique family of two-dimensional materials with intriguing physical and chemical properties. In details, we have found that JTMSHs can exist in various states, exhibiting metallic, semiconducting, and magnetic character. One particularly intriguing finding considered identification of electride states with distinct bonding characteristics in the 2H-JTMSHs for TM=V, Nb, Ta, Mo, W and Tc. Additionally, we have observed evidence of charge density wave scenario in 1T-JTMSH with TM=Tc, Re, and W and 2H-JTMSH with TM = Tc. Importantly, by applying compressive strain to these materials, the charge density wave can be completely suppressed, eventually leading to the superconducting phase. In particular, we have shown that when subjected to a compressive strain within 10%, the superconducting transition temperature (TC) of 1T-WSH, 1T-TcSH and 2H-TcSH can reach values of 13.8, 16.2 and 24.2 K respectively. Moreover, our investigation also unveiled two intrinsic phonon-mediated superconductors, namely 2H-WSH and 1T-RuSH with TC of 17.0 and 8 K, respectively.</description>

      <title>Maximizing bipolar sensitivity for anomalous Nernst thermopiles in heat flux sensing in amorphous GdCo alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04259</link>

Abstract: A Heat Flux Sensor (HFS) facilitates the visualization of heat flow, unlike a temperature sensor, and is anticipated to be a key technology in managing waste heat. Recently, an HFS utilizing the Anomalous Nernst Effect (ANE) has been proposed garnering significant interest in enhancing the transverse Seebeck coefficient. However, ideal materials for HFS not only require a large transverse Seebeck coefficient but also meet several criteria including low thermal conductivity and a bipolar nature of the transverse Seebeck coefficient, especially a negative coefficient. In this study, we have investigated ANE in amorphous ferrimagnetic GdCo alloys, revealing their numerous advantages as HFS materials. These include a large transverse Seebeck coefficient, extremely low thermal conductivity, large negative sensitivity, unparalleled bipolar sensitivity, versatility for deposition on various substrates, and a small longitudinal Seebeck coefficient. These qualities position GdCo films as promising candidates for the advancement of HFS technology.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic power diagrams for polycrystal modelling: efficient generation of curved grains via optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The microstructure of metals and foams can be effectively modelled with anisotropic power diagrams (APDs), which provide control over the shape of individual grains. One major obstacle to the wider adoption of APDs is the computational cost that is associated with their generation. We propose a novel approach to generate APDs with prescribed statistical properties, including fine control over the size of individual grains. To this end, we rely on fast optimal transport algorithms that stream well on Graphics Processing Units (GPU) and handle non-uniform, anisotropic distance functions. This allows us to find large APDs that best fit experimental data and generate synthetic high-resolution microstructures in (tens of) seconds. This unlocks their use for computational homogenisation, which is especially relevant to machine learning methods that require the generation of large collections of representative microstructures as training data.

      <title>Gauge theory of giant phonon magnetic moment in doped Dirac semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quantum theory of phonon magnetic moment in doped Dirac semimetals. Our theory is based on an emergent gauge field approach to the electron-phonon coupling, applicable to both gapless and gapped systems. We find that the magnetic moment is directly proportional to the electrical Hall conductivity through the phonon Hall viscosity. Our theory is combined with the first-principles calculations, allowing us to quantitatively implement it to realistic materials. Magnetic moments are found to be on the order of Bohr magneton for certain phonon modes in graphene and $\text{Cd}_3 \text{As}_2$. Our results provide practical guidance for the dynamical generation of large magnetization in the topological quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-guided data-driven discovery of native quantum defects in two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drawing on their atomically thin structure, two-dimensional (2D) materials present a groundbreaking avenue for the precision fabrication and systematic manipulation of quantum defects. Through a method grounded in site-symmetry principles, we devise a comprehensive workflow to pinpoint potential native quantum defects across the entire spectrum of known binary 2D materials. Leveraging both symmetry principles and data-driven approaches markedly enhances the identification of spin defects exhibiting triplet ground states. This advancement is pivotal in discovering NV-like quantum defects in 2D materials, which are instrumental in facilitating a set of quantum functionalities. For discerning the multifaceted functionalities of these quantum defect candidates, their magneto-optical properties are comprehensively estimated using high-throughput computations. Our findings underscore that antisite defects in diverse hosts emerge as prospective quantum defects of significance. Crucially, based on our research, we advocate that the 16 antisites present in post-transition metal monochalcogenides (PTMCs) stand out as a prominent 2D-material-based quantum defect platforms, by their precise defect levels, optimal magneto-optical attributes, and the readily accessible nature of their host materials. This work substantially broadens the repertoire of quantum defects within the 2D material landscape, presenting profound implications for the advancement of quantum information science and technologies.</description>

      <title>The Spin Point Groups and their Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin point groups are finite groups whose elements act on both real space and spin space. Among these groups are the magnetic point groups in the case where the real and spin space operations are locked to one another. The magnetic point groups are central to magnetic crystallography for strong spin-orbit coupled systems and the spin point groups generalize these to the intermediate and weak spin-orbit coupled cases. The spin point groups were introduced in the 1960's and enumerated shortly thereafter. In this paper, we complete the theory of spin point groups by presenting an account of these groups and their representation theory. Our main findings are that the so-called nontrivial spin point groups (numbering 598 groups) have co-irreps corresponding exactly to the (co-)irreps of regular or black and white groups and we tabulate this correspondence for each nontrivial group. However a total spin group, comprising the product of a nontrivial group and a spin-only group, has new co-irreps in cases where there is continuous rotational freedom. We provide explicit co-irrep tables for all these instances. We also discuss new forms of spin-only group extending the Litvin-Opechowski classes. To exhibit the usefulness of these groups to physically relevant problems we discuss a number of examples from electronic band structures of altermagnets to magnons.</description>

      <title>Competing Lattice Instability and Magnetism on the Surface of Kagome Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08771v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Only a few magnetic kagome materials exhibit lattice instabilities among the large kagome material array. In this work, we find that kagome magnets $R$Mn$_6$Sn$_6$ ($R$ = rare-earth elements) and their non-magnetic counterparts $R$V$_6$Sn$_6$ exhibit intriguing interplay between magnetism and lattice dynamics on their surfaces. Notably, $R$V$_6$Sn$_6$ surfaces terminated by kagome layers demonstrate pronounced lattice instabilities, manifesting as $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ and $2 \times 2$ surface charge orders (SCOs). These instabilities are absent on corresponding magnetic materials $R$Mn$_6$Sn$_6$. Here, the SCO is suppressed by magnetism. Otherwise, surface distortions would significantly reduce the spin polarization, elevating the energy via Hund's rule. Thus, SCOs are energetically unfavorable on magnetic surfaces. The competition of magnetism and lattice instability is further substantiated by observing SCOs on V-substituted $R$Mn$_6$Sn$_6$ kagome surfaces, contrasting with their absence on Mn-substituted $R$V$_6$Sn$_6$ surfaces. Our findings reveal unexpected surface instability and profound spin-lattice coupling in these kagome magnets, highlighting the complex dynamics hidden within magnetic materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spatiotemporal dynamics of ultrafast electron spin transport across nanometer-thick copper layers using broadband terahertz spectroscopy. Our analysis of temporal delays, broadening and attenuation of the spin-current pulse revealed ballistic-like propagation of the pulse peak, approaching the Fermi velocity, and diffusive features including a significant velocity dispersion. A comparison to the frequency-dependent Ficks law identified the diffusion-dominated transport regime for distances larger than 2 nm. The findings lie the groundwork for designing future broadband spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>A Generative Model for Accelerated Inverse Modelling Using a Novel Embedding for Continuous Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11343v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In materials science, the challenge of rapid prototyping materials with desired properties often involves extensive experimentation to find suitable microstructures. Additionally, finding microstructures for given properties is typically an ill-posed problem where multiple solutions may exist. Using generative machine learning models can be a viable solution which also reduces the computational cost. This comes with new challenges because, e.g., a continuous property variable as conditioning input to the model is required. We investigate the shortcomings of an existing method and compare this to a novel embedding strategy for generative models that is based on the binary representation of floating point numbers. This eliminates the need for normalization, preserves information, and creates a versatile embedding space for conditioning the generative model. This technique can be applied to condition a network on any number, to provide fine control over generated microstructure images, thereby contributing to accelerated materials design.</description>
