      <title>Tunable Sub-THz and THz lasing effect using FETs at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I report on the first observed self-amplification by stimulated emission of 0.2THz and 1.63THz radiation using InGaAs/GaAs HEMT operating in the deep saturation regime at room temperature. I demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that the Sub-THz and THz FETs response is due to rectification of the nonlinear dependence of the device current-voltage characteristics. FETs do operate as a nonlinear THz mixers and rectifiers and its open-drain responsivity is given by a similar expression to that of zero-bias Schottky diode detector. However, operating FETs deep in the saturation regime does allow the accurate tuning of the device to the resonance condition or the negative resistance mode at room temperature, hence FETs can be tuned in the deep saturation regime to enable sub-THz and THz lasing effect. This observed sub-THz and THz laser phenomena using FETs will revolutionize human technology in all fields of life in the near future.</description>

      <title>xeSFQ: Clockless SFQ Logic with Zero Static Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ERSFQ circuits eliminate the dominant portion of static power consumption in RSFQ circuits by using current-limiting Josephson junctions and inductors instead of bias resistors. In practice, these junctions still contribute to static power consumption through switching required to correct phase imbalances across the circuit, with their contributions sometimes comparable to dynamic power. This paper presents a new SFQ family variant, called xeSFQ, that combines the clock-free alternating SFQ logic with ERSFQ's biasing. By ensuring a single pulse per line per logical cycle, xeSFQ eliminates even the residual switching due to phase imbalance, achieving truly zero static power consumption. Detailed analog simulations and synthesis results for various circuits, from single gates to ISCAS85 and EPFL benchmarks, validate the above hypothesis and showcase the all-around benefits of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Applicability of a Snapshot Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometer for the Prediction of Brix and pH of Grapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a recently developed snapshot hyperspectral imaging (HSI) system based on Computed Tomography Imaging Spectroscopy (CTIS) is utilized to determine Brix and pH values in Sheegene 20 table grapes through Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) modeling. The performance of the CTIS system is compared with that of a state-of-the-art line scan HSI system by imaging 100 grapes across both platforms. Reference measurements of Brix and pH values are obtained directly using a refractometer and a pH meter, as these parameters are essential for assessing the quality of table and wine grapes. The findings indicate that the spectra captured by the CTIS camera correlate well with the reference measurements, despite the system's narrower spectral range. The CTIS camera's advantages, including its lower cost, portability, and reduced susceptibility to motion errors, highlight its potential for promising in-field applications in grape quality assessment.</description>

      <title>Suppression of Phase Separation in AlGaInAs Compositionally Graded Buffers for 1550 nm Photovoltaic Converters on GaAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate strategies to suppress phase separation and reduce threading dislocation densities (TDD) in AlGaInAs compositionally graded buffers (CGBs) that span the lattice constant range from GaAs to InP. Combining results from high resolution x-ray diffraction, cathodoluminescence, transmission electron microscopy, and photovoltaic device measurements, we correlate choices of epitaxial growth conditions with the defect structure of the CGBs and subsequent device performance. Both the use of substrates with high misorientation off (100) towards the (111)A plane and Zn-doping instead of Si-doping are shown to suppress phase separation and reduce TDD. We demonstrate a 0.74 eV GaInAs device grown on a (411)A GaAs substrate using a Zn-doped AlGaInAs CGB with TDD = 3.5 +/- 0.2 x 106 cm^-2 that has a bandgap-open circuit voltage offset of only 0.434 V measured under the AM1.5G solar spectrum. We characterized this device under high-intensity irradiance from a 1570 nm laser and measured a 31.9% peak efficiency laser power conversion efficiency at 3.6 W/cm2. These results provide a roadmap to the manufacture of laser- and thermal-power conversion devices with the performance and cost-effectiveness needed to drive adoption of these technologies at scale.</description>

      <title>Hot Electron-Driven Structural Expansion and Magnetic Collapse in Bilayer FeSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum phenomena emerging from the interaction of light and matter in low-dimensional systems hold great potential for future quantum technologies. Here, using first-principles calculations incorporating non-local van der Waals interactions and Hubbard corrections, we report simultaneous structural expansion and magnetic collapse in bilayer FeSe induced by photoexcited hot electrons. Our calculations reveal that, while bulk FeSe is paramagnetic, as observed experimentally, double-layer FeSe exhibits robust {\it staggered} antiferromagnetic order at low temperatures with a net site magnetization of $\sim 2.75~\mu_B$/Fe. However, increasing the density of photoexcited electrons systematically enhances the internal electronic entropy, leading to a complete collapse of antiferromagnetic order accompanied by an abrupt expansion of the interlayer separation. Our findings suggest the structural and magnetic properties of FeSe thin films can be finely tuned via ultrafast laser excitation, offering a pathway to control quantum phases in iron-based compounds through electronic temperature.</description>

      <title>Towards Monte Carlo based Full Spectrum Modeling of Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This monograph presents advancements in Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry (AGRS), a critical tool for emergency response to radiological incidents such as severe nuclear accidents or nuclear weapon detonations. Current AGRS calibration and data evaluation methods struggle to accurately quantify many radioactive materials expected in radiological emergencies, limiting the risk assessment and, hence, the effectiveness of emergency response actions. To address these limitations, this work introduces a full spectrum numerical modeling approach that features three key innovations: high-fidelity Monte Carlo simulations that combine an advanced scintillation physics model with detailed geometric representations of the aircraft and detector system; a surrogate model that replicates the Monte Carlo simulations with significantly reduced computation time; and a data evaluation methodology that leverages the surrogate model within a Bayesian inversion framework, enabling the quantification of arbitrarily complex gamma-ray fields. The methodology presented here, rigorously validated through laboratory and field measurements, achieves not only a significant improvement in accuracy and sensitivity over traditional methods but also substantially expands the operational capabilities of AGRS systems for both emergency response scenarios and geophysical surveys. These innovations lay the groundwork for establishing a new global standard for AGRS, ultimately supporting better-informed protective actions and reducing health risks during radiological emergencies.</description>

      <title>Integrated lithium niobate photonic computing circuit based on efficient and high-speed electro-optic conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we show a photonic computing accelerator utilizing a system-level thin-film lithium niobate circuit which overcomes this limitation. Leveraging the strong electro-optic (Pockels) effect and the scalability of this platform, we demonstrate photonic computation at speeds up to 1.36 TOPS while consuming 0.057 pJ/OP. Our system features more than 100 thin-film lithium niobate high-performance components working synergistically, surpassing state-of-the-art systems on this platform. We further demonstrate binary-classification, handwritten-digit classification, and image classification with remarkable accuracy, showcasing our system's capability of executing real algorithms. Finally, we investigate the opportunities offered by combining our system with a hybrid-integrated distributed feedback laser source and a heterogeneous-integrated modified uni-traveling carrier photodiode. Our results illustrate the promise of thin-film lithium niobate as a computational platform, addressing current bottlenecks in both electronic and photonic computation. Its unique properties of high-performance electro-optic weight encoding and conversion, wafer-scale scalability, and compatibility with integrated lasers and detectors, position thin-film lithium niobate photonics as a valuable complement to silicon photonics, with extensions to applications in ultrafast and power-efficient signal processing and ranging.</description>

      <title>An information-matching approach to optimal experimental design and active learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficacy of mathematical models heavily depends on the quality of the training data, yet collecting sufficient data is often expensive and challenging. Many modeling applications require inferring parameters only as a means to predict other quantities of interest (QoI). Because models often contain many unidentifiable (sloppy) parameters, QoIs often depend on a relatively small number of parameter combinations. Therefore, we introduce an information-matching criterion based on the Fisher Information Matrix to select the most informative training data from a candidate pool. This method ensures that the selected data contain sufficient information to learn only those parameters that are needed to constrain downstream QoIs. It is formulated as a convex optimization problem, making it scalable to large models and datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various modeling problems in diverse scientific fields, including power systems and underwater acoustics. Finally, we use information-matching as a query function within an Active Learning loop for material science applications. In all these applications, we find that a relatively small set of optimal training data can provide the necessary information for achieving precise predictions. These results are encouraging for diverse future applications, particularly active learning in large machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Towards high-performance photodetectors based on quasi-2D Ruddlesden-Popper mixed-n perovskite nanomaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The excellent optoelectronic properties, straightforward synthesis, and robust material stability of quasi-2D metal halide perovskites have made them a hot research topic for optoelectronic devices. In layered organic-inorganic perovskites, the optoelectronic properties are greatly influenced by morphology and quantum confinement, which are crucial for their photodetection performance and offer an excellent tunability tool. Here we investigated the optoelectronic properties and photodetection performance of quasi-2D methylammonium lead bromide perovskites with three different morphologies nanoplatelets, nanosheets, and nanostripes produced by colloidal hot injection technique. The structural and optical characterization reveals the mixed-n phases with varying extents of confinement. Our study shows that nanostripes with the weak confinement effect exhibit superior photodetection performance. They demonstrate highest photoresponsivity, EQE, and detectivity of 183 mA/W, 56 % and 2.9*10^11 Jones respectively. They also show the highest on/off ratio and fastest photoresponse (tau_r=3.4 ms and tau_f=4.3 ms) in comparison to nanoplatelets and nanosheets. Our study will aid in realizing an inexpensive high-performance photodetector based on nanoparticles of quasi-2D perovskites.</description>

      <title>Quantum machine learning for multiclass classification beyond kernel methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning is considered one of the current research fields with immense potential. In recent years, Havl\'i\v{c}ek et al. [Nature 567, 209-212 (2019)] have proposed a quantum machine learning algorithm with quantum-enhanced feature spaces, which effectively addressed a binary classification problem on a superconducting processor and offered a potential pathway to achieving quantum advantage. However, a straightforward binary classification algorithm falls short in solving multiclass classification problems. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm that rigorously demonstrates that quantum kernel methods enhance the efficiency of multiclass classification in real-world applications, providing a clear quantum advantage. To demonstrate quantum advantage, we design six distinct quantum kernels within the quantum algorithm to map input data into quantum state spaces and estimate the corresponding quantum kernel matrices. The results from quantum simulations reveal that the quantum algorithm outperforms its classical counterpart in handling six real-world multiclass classification problems. Furthermore, we leverage a family of performance metrics to comprehensively evaluate the classification performance of the quantum algorithm. The results indicate that the quantum algorithm achieves satisfactory classification accuracy and excels in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score for macroaverage, microaverage, and weighted average methods.</description>

      <title>Dynamic switching of ferrocene and plasmonic interactions in Au/self-assembled monolayer/single Ag nanocube molecular junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the redox switching of ferrocene moieties embedded in a double tunnel barrier plasmonic cavity fabricated from a click-chemistry self-assembled monolayers of ferrocenyl-alkylthiol on ultra flat gold surfaces, connected to a single poly(vinylpyrrolidone) capped silver nanocube, AgNC, which is contacted by the tip of a conductive-AFM to study the electron transport properties in the dark and under light irradiation at the plasmonic resonance wavelengths. We observe a dual behavior in the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics in the dark: a large hysteresis loop at positive voltages and an hysteretic negative differential conductance (NDC) at negative voltages, due to the redox switching of ferrocene between its oxidized (Fc+) and neutral (Fc0) states. The I-V curves are analyzed by a generalized combined Marcus-Landauer model. We determine the highest occupied molecular orbital of the Fc+ and Fc0 states at 0.54 and 0.42 eV below the Fermi energy, respectively, with a weak reorganization energy &lt; 0.1 eV upon switching. Under plasmonic excitation, the hysteresis and NDC behaviors are no longer observed and the I-V characteristics of the Au-ferrocenyl-alkylthiol/AgNC junctions become similar to Au-ferrocenyl-alkylthiol SAMs. A virtual molecular orbital due to the plasmon-induced coupling (fast electron transfer) between the two redox states of the Fc is determined at 0.46 eV. This dynamic behavior opens perspectives in artificial synaptic devices for neuromorphic computing with the additional function to turn on/off this synaptic behavior on-demand by light.</description>

      <title>Engineering band selective absorption with epsilon-near-zero media in the infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Band-selective absorption and emission of thermal radiation in the infrared are of interest due to applications in emissivity coatings, infrared sensing, thermo-photovoltaics and solar energy harvesting. The broadband nature of thermal radiation presents distinct challenges in achieving spectral and angular selectivity, which are difficult to address by prevalent optical strategies, often yielding restrictive responses. We explore a tri-layer coating employing a nanostructured grating of epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) material, indium tin oxide (ITO), atop a dielectric (silicon dioxide) and metal (gold) underlayer, which shows wide-angle (0-60 degrees) and band-selective (1800 - 2800 nm) high absorption (&gt; 0.8). Numerical simulations and experimental results reveal that the ENZ response of ITO combined with its localized plasmon resonances define the high absorption bandwidth, aided by the sandwiched dielectric's optical properties, elucidating the tunability of the absorption bandwidth. Thermal imaging in the mid-infrared highlights the relevance of the ENZ grating, emphasizing the potential of this coating design as a thermal emitter. This study offers valuable insights into light-matter interactions and opens avenues for practical applications in thermal management and energy harvesting.</description>

      <title>A low-temperature synthesis of strongly thermochromic W and Sr co-doped VO2 films with a low transition temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reversible semiconductor-to-metal transition of vanadium dioxide (VO2) makes VO2-based coatings a promising candidate for thermochromic smart windows, reducing the energy consumption of buildings. We report low-temperature (320 degC) depositions of thermochromic V1-x-yWxSryO2 films with a thickness of 71-73 nm onto 170-175 nm thick Y-stabilized ZrO2 layers on a 1 mm thick conventional soda-lime glass. The developed deposition technique is based on reactive high-power impulse magnetron sputtering with a pulsed O2 flow feedback control allowing us to prepare crystalline W and Sr co-doped VO2 films of the required stoichiometry without any substrate bias or post-deposition annealing. The W doping of VO2 decreases the transition temperature below 25 degC, while the Sr doping of VO2 increases the integral luminous transmittance, Tlum, significantly due to widening of the visible-range optical band gap, which is consistent with lowering of the absorption coefficient of films. We present the discussion of the effect of the Sr content in the metal sublattice of VO2 on the electronic and crystal structure of V1-x-yWxSryO2 films, and on their temperature-dependent optical and electrical properties. An optimized V0.855W0.018Sr0.127O2 film exhibits a high Tlum = 56.8% and modulation of the solar energy transmittance deltaTsol = 8.3%, which are 1.50 times and 1.28 times, respectively, higher compared with those of the V0.984W0.016O2 film. The achieved results constitute an important step toward a low-temperature synthesis of large-area thermochromic VO2-based coatings for future smart-window applications, as it is easy to further increase the Tlum and deltaTsol by &gt;6% and &gt;3%, respectively, using a 280 nm thick top SiO2 antireflection layer.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable SWCNT ferroelectric field-effect transistor arrays</title>

Abstract: Reconfigurable devices have garnered significant attention for alleviating the scaling requirements of conventional CMOS technology, as they require fewer components to construct circuits with similar function. Prior works required continuous voltage application for programming gate terminal(s) in addition to the primary gate terminal, which undermines the advantages of reconfigurable devices in realizing compact and power-efficient integrated circuits. Here, we realize reconfigurable devices based on a single-gate field-effect transistor (FET) architecture by integrating semiconducting channels consisting of a monolayer film of highly aligned SWCNTs with a ferroelectric AlScN gate dielectric, all compatible with CMOS back-end-of-line (BEOL) processing. We demonstrated these SWCNT ferroelectric FETs (FeFETs) in a centimeter-scale array (~1 cm^2) comprising ~735 devices, with high spatial uniformity in device characteristics across the array. The devices exhibited ambipolar transfer characteristics with high on-state currents and current on/off ratios exceeding 10^5, demonstrating an excellent balance between electron and hole conduction (~270 {\mu}A/{\mu}m at a drain voltage of 3 V. When functioning as a non-volatile memory, the SWCNT FeFETs demonstrated large memory windows of 0.26 V/nm and 0.08 V/nm in the hole and electron conduction regions, respectively, combined with excellent retention behavior for up to 10^4 s. Repeated reconfiguration between p-FET and n-FET modes was also enabled by switching the spontaneous polarization in AlScN and operating the transistor within a voltage range below the coercive voltage. We revealed through circuit simulations that reconfigurable SWCNT transistors can realize ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM) with far fewer devices compared to circuits based on silicon CMOS technology or based on resistive non-volatile devices.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators in monolayer Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family</title>

Abstract: The Rashba effect in Janus structures, accompanied by nontrivial topology, plays an important role in spintronics and even photovoltaic applications, which are receiving increasing attention. However, less effort has been devoted to searching for the Rashba effect in conjunction with nontrivial topology, from the perspective of material design and in establishing universal rules. Herein, through first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the geometric stability and electronic structures of the Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family derived from two-dimensional MA2Z4 (M=Mg, Ga, Sr; A=Al, Ga; Z=S, Se, Te) monolayers, designed numerous Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators with Rashba splitting. As the total atomic number rises, the bandgaps of Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) decrease continuously from 2.14 eV for MgAl2S3Se. The decrease persists until the bandgap, combined with strong spin-orbit coupling, becomes small enough to lead to the band inversion with nontrivial topology. In specific Janus systems, pz orbitals near the Fermi level, in conjunction with band inversion, could create a hybrid spin texture with double Rashba splitting. Importantly, the Rashba effect, nontrivial topological states and unique spin textures in the MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) systems can be significantly tuned through small biaxial strain. Our work not only develops the abundant Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family with multifunctional application prospects, but also reveals the designing rules of Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric nontrivial topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Wiedemann-Franz Law and Thermoelectric Inequalities: Effective ZT and Single-leg Efficiency Overestimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a thermoelectric inequality in thermoelectric conversion between the material figure of merit (ZT) and the module effective ZT using the Constant Seebeck-coefficient Approximation combining with the Wiedemann-Franz law. In a P-N leg-pair module, the effective ZT lies between the individual ZT values of the P- and N-legs. In a single-leg module, however, the effective ZT is less than approximately one-third of the leg's ZT. This reduction results from the need for an external wire to complete the circuit, introducing additional thermal and electrical losses. Multi-dimensional numerical analysis shows that, although structural optimization can mitigate these losses, the system efficiency remains limited to below half of the ideal single-leg material efficiency. Our findings explain the single-leg efficiency overestimation and highlight the importance of optimizing the P-N leg-pair module structure. They also underscore the need for thermoelectric leg-compatibility, particularly with respect to Seebeck coefficients.</description>
