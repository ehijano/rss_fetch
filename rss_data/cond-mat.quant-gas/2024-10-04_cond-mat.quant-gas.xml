      <title>Superfluids in expanding backgrounds and attractor times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the behavior of an out-of-equilibrium superfluid, composed of a $U(1)$ Goldstone mode coupled to hydrodynamic modes in a M\"uller-Israel-Stewart theory, in expanding backgrounds relevant to heavy ion collision experiments and cosmology. For suitable initial conditions, the evolution of the hydrodynamic variables leads to a change in the potential of the Goldstone mode, spontaneously breaking the symmetry. After some time, the condensate becomes small, leading the system evolution to be well described via hydrodynamic attractors for a timescale that we determine in Bjorken and Gubser flows. We define this new timescale as the \textit{attractor time} and show its dependence on initial conditions. In the case of the Gubser flow, we provide for the first time a complete description of the nonlinear evolution of the system, including a novel nonlinear regime of constant anisotropy not found in the Bjorken evolution. Finally, we consider the superfluid in the dynamical FLRW (Friedmann-Lemaitre-Roberston-Walker) background, where we observe a similar attractor behavior, dependent on the initial conditions, that at late times approaches a regime dominated by the condensate.</description>

      <title>The peaks of the correlation function in acoustic black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Renaud Parentani was one of the leading figures in Quantum Field Theory in curved spacetime, in particular concerning its applications to Hawking-like radiation in analogue models. In this paper dedicated to him, we discuss the features of the characteristic peaks appearing in the correlation functions in an acoustic black hole formed by a Bose-Einstein condensate, considered as signature of the presence of Hawking radiation in this system.</description>

      <title>Information theoretic measures on quantum droplets in ultracold atomic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02848v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Shannon entropy, Fisher information, R\'enyi entropy, and Tsallis entropy to study the quantum droplet phase in Bose-Einstein condensates. In the beyond mean-field description, the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with Lee-Huang-Yang correction gives a family of quantum droplets with different chemical potentials. At a larger value of chemical potential, quantum droplet with sharp-top probability density distribution starts to form while it becomes flat top for a smaller value of chemical potential. We show that entropic measures can distinguish the shape change of the probability density distributions and thus can identify the onset of the droplet phase. During the onset of droplet phase, the Shannon entropy decreases gradually with the decrease of chemical potential and attains a minimum in the vicinity where a smooth transition from flat-top to sharp-top QDs occurs. At this stage, the Shannon entropy increases abruptly with the lowering of chemical potential. We observe an opposite trend in the case of Fisher information. These results are found to be consistent with the R\'enyi and Tsallis entropic measures.</description>

      <title>Quantum turbulence, superfluidity, non-Markovian dynamics, and wave function thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While quantum turbulence has been addressed both experimentally (predominantly for superfluid $^4$He and $^3$He) and theoretically, the dynamics of various ensembles of quantized vortices was followed in time only until the vortices decay into phonons. How this ``thermalization'' is achieved is still an unaddressed and thus an unelucidated question. The Unitary Fermi Gas (UFG) is a unique quantum system, which has no classical counterpart and of relevance to neutron stars, cold atoms, condensed matter and nuclear many-body systems. The non-Markovian evolution of an isolated UFG is put in evidence and its entire non-equilibrium evolution can be studied theoretically within a unified theoretical framework. The initial lattice of quantum vortices and anti-vortices evolves through a couple of vortex tangles and excitation of Kelvin waves, where vortices cross and reconnect, until very slowly thermalization sets in.</description>

      <title>Interactions mediated by atoms, photons, electrons, and excitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13795v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interactions between quasiparticles mediated by a surrounding environment are ubiquitous and lead to a range of important effects from collective modes of low temperature quantum gases, superconductivity, to the interaction between elementary particles at high energies. This perspective article is motivated by experimental progress in the fields of quantum degenerate atomic gases, cavity QED, and two-dimensional (2D) semi-conductors, which enable a systematic exploration of mediated interactions in new settings and regimes. We first describe how to microscopically calculate the quasiparticle interaction using perturbation theory, diagrammatics, and the path integral, highlighting the key role played by the quantum statistics of the quasiparticles. Recent theoretical and experimental insights into quasiparticle and mediated interactions in general obtained from atomic gases are then discussed, after which we focus on hybrid light-atom systems where a remarkable long range photon mediated interaction can be realised. Next, we describe new and puzzling results regarding the interaction between quasiparticles in 2D semiconductors. We then discuss how mediated interactions open up ways to realise new quantum phases in atomic and hybrid atom-photon systems as well as 2D semiconductors, and the perspective ends by posing some open questions and outlook.</description>

      <title>Virial expansion for the optical response of doped two-dimensional semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum virial expansion for the optical response of a doped two-dimensional semiconductor. As we show, this constitutes a perturbatively exact theory in the high-temperature or low-doping regime, where the electrons' thermal wavelength is smaller than their interparticle spacing. The virial expansion predicts new features of the photoluminescence, such as a non-trivial shape of the attractive branch related to universal low-energy exciton-electron scattering and an associated shift of the attractive peak from the trion energy. Our results are in excellent agreement with recent experiments on doped monolayer MoSe2 [Zipfel et al., Phys. Rev. B 105, 075311 (2022)] and they imply that the trion binding energy is likely to have been overestimated in previous measurements. Our theory furthermore allows us to formally unify two distinct theoretical pictures that have been applied to this system, with the conventional trion picture results emerging as a high-temperature and weak-interaction limit of Fermi polaron theory.</description>

      <title>Amplitude, phase, and topological fluctuations shaping the complex phase diagram of two-dimensional superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15728v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the amplitude and phase fluctuations of the Ginzburg-Landau quasiorder parameter for superconductors in two spatial dimensions. Starting from the mean-field critical temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}0}$, we calculate the beyond-mean-field critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$ by including thermal fluctuations of the quasiorder parameter within the Gaussian level. Moreover, from our beyond-mean-field results, we derive the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless critical temperature $T_{\rm BKT}$, which takes into account topological vortex-antivortex excitations in the phase fluctuations as well as the amplitude fluctuations, to obtain the shifts of transition temperatures. We elucidate how the Gaussian thermal fluctuations and phase fluctuations associated with vortex excitations affect thermodynamic properties by determining the $H$-$T$ phase diagram for a type-II superconductor and computing the critical behaviors of the heat capacity, which are experimentally accessible, allowing the characterization of the cascade of different kinds of fluctuations in 2D superconductors.</description>

      <title>Condensation phenomena of ions in an electrostatic logarithmic trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effects of an electrostatic logarithmic trap (ELT) on an ionic gas confined in a cylindric chamber are studied in detail, with special reference to the effects of the ion-ion Coulombic interactions and the resulting low-temperature thermodynamics. The collapse of the ions in radially localized states, about the axial cathode, is shown to cause an abrupt (but not critical) transition from non degeneration to strong degeneration, at a special temperature $T_c$. This transition could actually involve both Bosons and Fermions and is not to be confused with a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), which is excluded in principle. However, while for Bosons the resulting effects on the pressure are observable in the ultra high vacuum (UHV) regime, the Fermions' density should fall well below UHV, for the pressure change to be observable. This is because the ion-ion \emph{exchange} interactions increase the kinetic energy along the axial cathode, which makes the Fermi level and the non degeneration threshold temperature increase accordingly.</description>
