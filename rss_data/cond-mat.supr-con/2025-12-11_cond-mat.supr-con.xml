      <title>Gate-Tunable Superconducting Spin Valve in a van der Waals Ferromagnet/Superconductor/Ferromagnet Trilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate a gate-tunable superconducting spin valve effect (SVE) in a van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure composed of a monolayer superconductor (S) sandwiched between two ferromagnetic (F) monolayers (F/S/F). By electrostatically gating the ferromagnetic layers to modulate their chemical potentials, the system can be continuously tuned between the standard, inverse and triplet (non-monotonic) SVE regimes within the same device. This tunability originates from the gate-controlled hybridization between the superconducting and ferromagnetic electronic spectra, which determines the effective exchange field induced in the S-layer. Furthermore, we reveal that gating enables exotic, non-BCS temperature dependencies of the superconducting order parameter, including reentrant superconductivity, bistable states, first-order phase transitions, and the emergence of superconductivity at finite temperatures. Our results establish vdW F/S/F trilayers as a versatile and highly controllable platform for superconducting spintronics, where external gate voltages can selectively activate different spin-valve functionalities and unconventional superconducting states.</description>

      <title>Bulk superconductivity in the kagome metal YRu3B2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials with a kagome sublattice have been heavily studied recently for their exotic electronic band structure, structural frustration, high-temperature charge order transitions, and unconventional electron-phonon coupling. In LaRu3Si2, it was proposed that electronic flat bands conspire with the characteristic phonon spectrum of the kagome lattice to drive enhanced superconductivity at Tc = 7 K. Here, we report bulk superconductivity in the structural analogue YRu3B2, which hosts a structurally pristine kagome lattice. We observe a superconducting transition at Tc = 0.7 K through magnetization, resistivity, and heat-capacity measurements in this novel kagome metal.</description>

      <title>Influence of strong electron irradiation on fluctuation conductivity and pseudogap in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$--$\delta$ single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of high-energy electron irradiation on the temperature dependences of the resistivity $\rho(T)$, fluctuation conductivity (FLC), and pseudogap (PG) $\Delta^{*}(T)$ of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$--$\delta$ (YBCO) single crystals without twins was studied. Irradiation causes a linear increase in $\rho(T)$ and a decrease in the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ with dose $\phi$. For small $\phi$, the reduction of $T_c$ follows the Abrikosov--Gorkov (AG) pair-breaking theory, while for large $\phi$ it is described by the Emery--Kivelson (EK) model, where quantum phase fluctuations dominate. At $\phi_3 = 2.5 \times 10^{19}$ e/cm$^2$, which corresponds to the AG--EK crossover, the spacing between CuO$_2$ planes $d_{01}$, the coherence length $\xi_c(0)$, and the fluctuation region $T_{\mathrm{fl}}$ increase sharply, and the two-dimensional Maki--Thompson (2D--MT) contribution is replaced by the Aslamazov--Larkin (2D--AL) term. Surprisingly, no signatures of the crossover appear in $\rho(\phi)$ or $T_c(\phi)$. At the same $\phi_3$, a sharp rise in the pseudogap opening temperature $T^{*}$ and in $\Delta^{*}$ indicates a possible reduction of the density of states. With further increase in $\phi$, both PG parameters and their energy scale decrease markedly, and $\Delta^{*}(T)$ acquires an unusual form. However, at $\phi_5 = 5.6 \times 10^{19}$ e/cm$^2$, the temperature dependences of FLC and PG again show behavior typical of well-structured YBCO, regardless of defect density.</description>

      <title>Checkerboard-type Zhang-Rice States in Overdoped Cuprate Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cuprate superconductors remain central to condensed matter physics due to their technological relevance and unconventional, incompletely understood electronic behavior. While the canonical phase diagram and low-energy models have been shaped largely by studies of underdoped and moderately doped cuprates, the overdoped regime has received comparatively limited attention.Here, we track the evolution of the electronic structure from optimal to heavy overdoping in La2-xSrxCuO4(LSCO) using broadband optical spectroscopy across x=0.15-0.60. The measured spectral changes--including the redistribution of Zhang-Rice-related spectral weigh--are in qualitative agreement with determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the three-orbital Emery model, which together indicate a pronounced reconstruction of the electronic structure beyond hole concentrations x&gt;0.2. Guided by these observations, we propose a spontaneous checkerboard-type Zhang-Rice electronic configuration that captures the coexistence of itinerant and localized carriers characteristic of the heavily overdoped state. Our results refine the doping-dependent Zhang-Rice-based framework for cuprates, illuminate how correlations persist deep into the overdoped regime, and provide new constraints on microscopic mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity, with broader implications for correlated transition-metal oxides.</description>

      <title>Study of fluctuation conductivity in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$--$\delta$ films in strong magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the effect of the \emph{ab}-plane magnetic field $B$ up to $8\,\mathrm{T}$ on the resistivity $\rho(T)$ and fluctuation conductivity $\sigma'(T)$ in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ thin films. As expected, up to $\sim 2.5\,\mathrm{T}$ the magnetic field monotonously increases $\rho$, the width of the resistive transition $\Delta T_c$, and the coherence length along the $c$ axis, $\xi_c(0)$, but decreases both $T_c$ and the range of superconducting (SC) fluctuations $\Delta _{\mathrm{fl}}$. The fluctuation conductivity exhibits a crossover at characteristic temperature $T_0$ from the 3D Aslamazov--Larkin (AL) theory near $T_c$ to the 2D fluctuation theory of Maki--Thompson (MT). However, at $B = 3\,\mathrm{T}$, the MT term is completely suppressed, and above $T_0$ $\sigma'(T)$ is unexpectedly described by the fluctuation contribution of 2D AL, suggesting the formation of a two-dimensional vortex lattice in the film under the action of a magnetic field. At the same time, $\Delta T_{\mathrm{fl}}$ sharply increases by a factor of about 7, and $\xi_c(0)$ demonstrates a very unusual dependence on $T_c$ when $B$ increases above $3\,\mathrm{T}$. Our results demonstrate the possibility of the formation of a vortex state in YBCO and its evolution with increasing $B$.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the pseudogap and excess conductivity of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ single crystals in the course of long-term aging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The temperature dependences of both fluctuation conductivity (FLC) $\sigma^\prime(T)$ and pseudogap (PG) $\Delta^*(T)$ derived from measurements of resistivity $\rho(T)$ of an optimally doped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ single crystal subjected to long-term storage have been studied. The as-grown sample S1 exhibits characteristics typical of optimally doped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ single crystals containing twins and twin boundaries. Analysis of both FLC and PG showed an unexpected improvement in all characteristics of the sample after 6 years of storage (sample S2), indicating that the effect of twin boundaries is somehow limited. After 17 years of storage, all characteristics of the sample changed dramatically, which indicates a strong influence of internal defects formed during the aging process. For the first time, the temperature dependences of both FLC and PG were obtained after 17 years of storage.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity and geometric superfluid weight of a tunable flat band system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study superconductivity and superfluid weight of the two-dimensional $\alpha$-$\mathcal{T}_3$ lattice with on-site asymmetries, hosting an isolated quasi-flat band with tunable bandwidth via a parameter $\alpha$. Within a mean-field approximation of the attractive Hubbard model, we obtain the superconducting order parameters on the three inequivalent sublattices and show their strong dependence on $\alpha$, interaction strength, and electron filling. At quasi-flat band filling, a superconducting gap opens and grows power-law fast with interaction strength, instead of the usual slow exponential growth, due to diverging density of states. We calculate the superfluid weight from linear response theory and study its band dispersion and geometric contributions. While the conventional part proportional to band derivatives is suppressed in the quasi-flat band regime, the contribution dominated by the quantum metric grows linearly for small interaction strength. We further demonstrate how tuning $\alpha$ enhances the quantum metric and thus the geometric superfluid weight especially near half-filling, while increasing on-site asymmetries increases the conventional contribution by broadening the quasi-flat band. We obtain the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature and demonstrate its strong dependence and enhancement with the parameter $\alpha$. Our results establish a tunable flat band system, the $\alpha$-$\mathcal{T}_3$ lattice model, as a candidate for tunable quantum geometry and superfluid weight and as a prototype of related behavior in tunable quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic scattering rates in strain-tuned Sr$_2$RuO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments, we analyze the temperature, frequency, and momentum dependence of the single-particle scattering rate in a model of the $\gamma$-band of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ under strain, with particular emphasis on the behavior near the Lifshitz transition where the Fermi energy crosses a single Van Hove point. While the scattering rate is only moderately anisotropic at zero strain, we find that it becomes strongly anisotropic at the Lifshitz point. At the lowest energies, we recover the expected universal behavior: the scattering rate varies (ignoring logarithmic corrections) as $\tau^{-1}\sim \omega $ at the Van Hove point and as $\tau^{-1}\sim \omega^{3/2}$ away from it. At higher energies, however, corrections of order $\omega^2$ become important in both regimes. We show that the experimentally observed behavior $\tau^{-1} \sim \omega^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha \approx 1.4(2)$ at the Van Hove point can be quantitatively explained by a superposition of linear and quadratic contributions to the scattering rate, which are comparable in magnitude at the intermediate energies probed by experiment, rather than in terms of a new universal power law. We further predict a distinctive anisotropy, strain dependence, and a non-monotonic frequency dependence of the scattering rate at a Lifshitz transition, all of which may be directly tested in experiments.</description>

      <title>How a bilayer Nickelate superconducts: a Quantum Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using determinant Quantum Monte Carlo, we investigate the interplay between doping, inter-layer tunneling and onsite Hund's coupling in stabilizing superconductivity (SC) in a two-orbital model for the bilayer Nickelate $\text{La}_3\text{Ni}_2\text{O}_7$. With realistic dispersion and for certain values of the interaction parameters, the auxiliary-field-decoupled fermion Hamiltonian has Kramers anti-unitary symmetries which guarantee the absence of a sign problem. The same anti-unitary symmetries can also be used to show there is a second instability towards $(\pi,\pi)$ exciton condensation in the strong interaction limit. We indicate the possible connection between this exciton order and the enigmatic density wave state observed in experiment, and clarify the decisive role played by the inter-layer tunneling in the competition between SC and exciton condensation. Finally, possible directions on how to enhance the SC transition temperature and stabilize the SC phase are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Advanced microwave SQUID multiplexer model incorporating readout power effects and Josephson junction inhomogeneities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an advanced model for describing the readout power dependence of the resonance characteristics of a microwave SQUID multiplexer. Our model proves valid for SQUID screening parameters up to $\beta_\mathrm{L}&lt;1$, hence covering the full range of practically relevant design parameters. We demonstrate that our model significantly improves agreement with experimental data compared to the existing models, thereby enabling optimization beyond the previously accessible parameter space. Moreover, our model supports non-sinusoidal current-phase relations of the rf-SQUID's Josephson junction, allowing, for the first time, for the modeling of devices based on Josephson tunnel junctions with inhomogeneous tunnel barriers. We show that the effects of such inhomogeneities are qualitatively similar to, yet distinct from, those of the screening parameter, making their inclusion essential for accurate characterization. Incorporating these effects yields great improved agreement with measurements, even at readout power conditions well beyond typical operating parameters.</description>

      <title>Topological boundaries in non-Hermitian p-wave Kitaev chains with Rashba spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the combined effects of Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) and non-Hermiticity on topological phase transitions in spinful p-wave Kitaev chains. While previous studies have separately examined non-Hermitian (NH) extensions of Kitaev chains and the effects of RSOC in Hermitian systems, the interplay between these two mechanisms remains largely unexplored. We analyze this interplay by considering two distinct types of complex on-site potentials: (i) a uniform gain/loss term and (ii) a complex quasiperiodic potential. We demonstrate that the impact of RSOC is highly model-dependent. In particular, RSOC does not affect the topological phase boundary in the Hermitian limit of the uniform gain/loss model (provided the spin-flip hopping is weaker than the pairing strength), but significantly alters the topological landscape in the NH regime. In contrast, for the quasiperiodic model, RSOC modifies the phase boundaries in both the Hermitian and non-Hermitian cases. Notably, we find that the combined interplay of non-Hermiticity and RSOC drives topological transitions at significantly lower potential strengths compared to the Hermitian limit. We derive analytical expressions for the topological phase transitions in both cases and validate our predictions through numerical calculations of energy spectra and real-space winding numbers. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of how non-Hermiticity and RSOC cooperatively reshape topological phase diagrams in one-dimensional superconducting systems.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the localization properties of Majorana states (MSs) in proximitized, planar Josephson Junctions (JJs) oriented along different crystallographic orientations and in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field and Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings. We show that two types of MSs may emerge when the junction transits into the topological superconducting state. In one case, referred to as end-like MSs, the Majorana quasiparticles are mainly localized inside the normal region at the opposite ends of the junction. In contrast, edge-like MSs extend along the opposite edges of the system, perpendicular to the junction channel. We show how the MSs can transit from end-like to edge-like and vice versa by tuning the magnetic field strength and/or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. In the case of phase-unbiased JJs the transition may occur as the ground state phase difference self-adjusts its value when the Zeeman field is varied. We propose exploiting the extended nature of edge-like MSs as effective interconnects enabling the coupling between topological states in adjacent planar JJs. The impact of electrostatic disorder on the MSs is also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Upper critical field and pairing symmetry of Ising superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the fact that the measured critical field $H_{c2}$ in various transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) superconductors is poorly understood, we reexamine its scaling behavior with temperature and spin-orbit coupling (SOC). By computing the spin-susceptibility in a multipocket system, we find that segments of the Fermi Surface (FS) at which the SOC has nodal points can have a contribution orders of magnitude larger than the remaining FS, hence setting the $H_{c2}$, assuming the presence of a conventional singlet superconducting order parameter. Nodal lines of an Ising SOC in the Brillouin zone are imposed by symmetry, so they cause such nodal points whenever they intersect an FS pocket, which is indeed the case in monolayer NbSe$_2$ and TaS$_2$, but not in gated MoS$_2$ and WS$_2$. Our analysis reinterprets existing measurements, concluding that a dominant singlet-order parameter on pockets with SOC nodes is consistent with the $H_{c2}(T)$ data for all monolayer Ising superconductors, in contrast to previous contradictory pairing assumptions. Finally, we predict a doping-dependent experimental signature of our theory.</description>

      <title>Dynamical signatures and control of time-reversal breaking in twisted nodal superconductors</title>

Abstract: Recent observations of time-reversal breaking superconductivity at twisted cuprate interfaces motivate the development of new approaches to better characterize this emergent phenomenon. Here we study the dynamical properties of the order parameters at the twisted unconventional superconductor interfaces. We reveal the emergence of a soft collective mode (Josephson plasmon) at the time-reversal breaking transition, which can be tuned by temperature, twist angle or magnetic field. Furthermore, nonlinear dynamical responses contain direct signatures of both the transition and the broken symmetry itself. In particular, we show that the generation of a second harmonic voltage under alternating current driving is a necessary and sufficient signature of time-reversal symmetry breaking. Finally, we demonstrate that strong nonlinear driving induces dynamical phase transitions between phases with and without spontaneous symmetry breaking, introducing a tool for their out-of-equilibrium control. We discuss the signatures of our predictions in AC current-driven experiments on twisted Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ interfaces.</description>

      <title>A Landau Theory for Pair Density Modulation in Fe(Te,Se) flakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments reporting a pair-density modulation (PDM) in FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$, we develop a Landau theory to elucidate the physical origin of this phenomenon. We analyze the PDM in terms of the screw symmetry of the single layer, interpreting it as a hybridized state of two order parameters of opposite glide and screw parity. Discussing the absence of PDM in the bulk where both glide and screw symmetry are present, we argue that the absence of glide symmetry on the surface allows nematic order to selectively stabilize the PDM in thin flakes. Finally, we discuss the symmetry constraints on the microscopic pairing mechanism, pointing out the opposite glide and screw parities of the order parameters favor a site, rather than a bond-based paring mechanism. This suggests that pairing in iron-based superconductors may be local to the iron atoms, possibly driven by Hunds coupling.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation of Bipolaron Superconductivity in Extended Hubbard--Holstein models on Face-Centered-Cubic and Body-Centered-Cubic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate superlight pairing of bipolarons driven by electron-phonon interactions (EPIs) in face-center-cubic (FCC) and body-center-cubic (BCC) lattices using a continuous-time path-integral quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm. The EPIs are of the Holstein and extended Holstein types, and a Hubbard interaction is also included. Effects of adiabaticity are calculated. The number of phonons associated with the bipolaron, inverse mass, and radius are calculated and used to construct a phase diagram for bipolaron pairing (identifying the regions of pairing into intersite bipolarons and onsite bipolarons). From the inverse mass we determine that for the extended interaction, there is a region of light pairing associated with intersite bipolarons formed in both BCC and FCC lattices. Intersite bipolarons in the extended model at intermediate phonon frequency and large Coulomb repulsion become superlight due to first order hopping effects. We estimate the transition temperature, determining that intersite bipolarons are associated with regions of high transition temperatures.</description>
