      <title>Synergistic Sensing: Application of SiNWs-PANI:MO$_x$ Heterostructures for Human Respiratory Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we investigate novel hybrid structure of silicon nanowires (SiNWs) coated with PANI:metaloxide(MO$_x$) nanoparticles i.e., WO$_3$ and TiO$_2$. The SiNWs were fabricated using MACE, whereas PANI:MO$_x$ were deposited using chemical oxidative polymerization method on SiNWs. To this date little attempts has been done to utilize such hybrid structures for respiratory sensing. The structures were characterized using RAMAN spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Electron disperssive spectroscopy, and Scanning electron microscopy. The electrical characterization to obtain respiratory sensing reveals excellent response compared to those obtained for SiNWs:MO$_x$ and SiNWs:PANI. Such enhancement in sensitivity is attributed to formation p-n heterojunction along side with wider conduction channel provided of PANI, increased porosity in SiNWs/PANI:WO$_3$ hybrid structures, providing active sites, increased oxygen vacancies and large surface area compared to that of pure MO$_x$ nanoparticles. Further, an improved drift in base line and sensor stability was established for the structure with PANI:WO$_3$ as compared to the PANI:TiO$_2$.</description>

      <title>Optimal Demodulation Domain for Microwave SQUID Multiplexers in Presence of Readout System Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Microwave SQUID Multiplexer ({\mu}MUX) is the device of choice for the readout of a large number of Low-Temperature Detectors in a wide variety of experiments within the fields of astronomy and particle physics. While it offers large multiplexing factors, the system noise performance is highly dependent on the cold and warm-readout electronic systems used to read it out, as well as the demodulation domain and parameters chosen. In order to understand the impact of the readout systems in the overall noise performance, first we extended the available {\mu}MUX simulation frameworks including additive and multiplicative noise sources in the probing tones (i.e. phase and amplitude noise), along with the capability of demodulating the scientific data, either in resonator's phase or amplitude. Then, considering the additive noise as a dominant noise source, the optimum readout parameters to achieve minimum system noise were found for both open-loop and flux-ramp demodulation schemes in the aforementioned domains. Later, we evaluated the system noise sensitivity to multiplicative noise sources under the optimum readout parameters. Finally, as a case study, we evaluated the optimal demodulation domain and expected system noise level for a typical Software-Defined Radio (SDR) readout system. This work leads to an improved system performance prediction and noise engineering based on the available readout electronics and selected demodulation domain.</description>

      <title>Current-readout technique for ultra-high-rate experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study developed a new current-readout technique capable of handling measurements with high count rates exceeding 1 Gcps. By directly capturing the output current of a photomultiplier as a digitized waveform, we estimated event rates, overcoming the limitations imposed by pulse pileup constraints. This innovative method was applied to a muon spin rotation/relaxation/resonance experiment at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex, demonstrating its anticipated performance. Furthermore, we explored methods for estimating statistical uncertainty and investigated potential applications in analog-logic OR/AND gates. Overall, our findings reveal that the developed technique opens up avenues for the development of future non-binary logic circuits operating based on n-adic numbers.</description>

      <title>Scintillation Light in SBND: Simulation, Reconstruction, and Expected Performance of the Photon Detection System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SBND is the near detector of the Short-Baseline Neutrino program at Fermilab. Its location near to the Booster Neutrino Beam source and relatively large mass will allow the study of neutrino interactions on argon with unprecedented statistics. This paper describes the expected performance of the SBND photon detection system, using a simulated sample of beam neutrinos and cosmogenic particles. Its design is a dual readout concept combining a system of 120 photomultiplier tubes, used for triggering, with a system of 192 X-ARAPUCA devices, located behind the anode wire planes. Furthermore, covering the cathode plane with highly-reflective panels coated with a wavelength-shifting compound recovers part of the light emitted towards the cathode, where no optical detectors exist. We show how this new design provides a high light yield and a more uniform detection efficiency, an excellent timing resolution and an independent 3D-position reconstruction using only the scintillation light. Finally, the whole reconstruction chain is applied to recover the temporal structure of the beam spill, which is resolved with a resolution on the order of nanoseconds.</description>

      <title>Increased accuracy and signal-to-noise ratio through recent improvements in Infra-Red Video Bolometer fabrication and calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Infra-Red Video Bolometer (IRVB) is a diagnostic equipped with an infra-red camera that measures the total radiated power in thousands of LOSs within a large field of view (FOV). Recently validated in MAST-U, it offers a high spatial resolution map of the radiated power in the divertor region, where large gradients are expected. The IRVB's sensing element comprises a thin layer of high Z absorbing material, typically Platinum, usually coated with Carbon to reduce reflections. It is here explored the possibility of using a relatively inert material like Titanium, that can be produced in layers up to 1mum compared to 2.5mum for Pt, and then coat it with Pt of the desired thickness (0.3mum per side here) and Carbon. This leads to a higher temperature signal (2 to 3 times), and better spatial resolution (about 4 times), resulting in higher accuracy in the measured power. This assembly is also expected to improve foil uniformity, as the Pt layer is obtained via deposition rather than mechanical processes. Given its multi-material composition, measuring the thermal properties of the foil assembly is vital. Various methods using a calibrated laser as a heat source have been developed, analysing the temperature profile shape or fitting the calculated laser power for different intensities and frequencies. It is here presented a simpler approach, that relies on analysing the separate components of the foil heat equation for a single laser exposure in a given area. This can then be iterated over the entire foil to capture local deviations.</description>

      <title>High-performance in-vacuum optical system for quantum optics experiments in a Penning-trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate measurements with implications in many branches in Physics have been accessed using Penning traps and conventional techniques within a temperature regime where each eigenmotion of a charged particle is still a classical harmonic oscillator. Cooling the particle directly or indirectly with lasers allows reaching the quantum regime of each oscillator, controlling subtle effects in the precision frontier by detecting photons instead of electric current. In this paper, we present a new in-vacuum optical system designed to detecting 397-nm fluorescence photons from individual calcium ions and Coulomb crystals in a 7-T Penning trap. Based on the outcome of computer simulations, our design shows diffraction-limited performance. The system has been characterized using a single laser-cooled ion as a point-like source, reaching a final resolution of 3.69(3) $\mu$m and 2.75(3) $\mu$m for the trap's axial and radial directions, respectively, after correcting aberrations.</description>

      <title>Transforming a rare event search into a not-so-rare event search in real-time with deep learning-based object detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based object detection algorithms enable the simultaneous classification and localization of any number of objects in image data. Many of these algorithms are capable of operating in real-time on high resolution images, attributing to their widespread usage across many fields. We present an end-to-end object detection pipeline designed for real-time rare event searches for the Migdal effect, using high-resolution image data from a state-of-the-art scientific CMOS camera in the MIGDAL experiment. The Migdal effect in nuclear scattering, crucial for sub-GeV dark matter searches, has yet to be experimentally confirmed, making its detection a primary goal of the MIGDAL experiment. Our pipeline employs the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm and is trained on real data to enhance the detection efficiency of nuclear and electronic recoils, particularly those exhibiting overlapping tracks that are indicative of the Migdal effect. When deployed online on the MIGDAL readout PC, we demonstrate our pipeline to process and perform the rare event search on 2D image data faster than the peak 120 frame per second acquisition rate of the CMOS camera. Applying these same steps offline, we demonstrate that we can reduce a sample of 20 million camera frames to around 1000 frames while maintaining nearly all signal that YOLOv8 is able to detect, thereby transforming a rare search into a much more manageable search. Our studies highlight the potential of pipelines similar to ours significantly improving the detection capabilities of experiments requiring rapid and precise object identification in high-throughput data environments.</description>

      <title>Importance of the X-ray edge singularity for the detection of relic neutrinos in the PTOLEMY project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.07406v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct detection of relic neutrinos in a beta-decay experiment is an ambitious goal that has long been beyond the reach of available technology. One of the most challenging practical difficulties for such an experiment is managing a large amount of radioactive material without compromising the energy resolution required to distinguish useful events from the substantial beta-decay background. The PTOLEMY project offers an innovative solution to this problem by depositing radioactive material on graphene. While this approach is expected to address the main challenge, it introduces new issues due to the proximity of the beta decayers to a solid-state system. In this work, we focus on the effect of the shakeup of the graphene electron system caused by a beta-decay event. We calculate the distortion of the relic neutrino peaks resulting from this shakeup, analyze the impact of the distortion on the visibility of neutrino capture events, and discuss potential technological solutions to enhance the visibility of these events.</description>

      <title>Suitability of Magnetic Microbolometers based on Paramagnetic Temperature Sensors for CMB Polarization Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.06088v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High resolution maps of polarization anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) are in high demand, since the discovery of primordial B-Modes in the polarization patterns would confirm the inflationary phase of the Universe that would have taken place before the last scattering of the CMB at the recombination epoch. Transition Edge Sensors (TES) and Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKID) are the predominant detector technologies of cryogenic detector array based CMB instruments that search for primordial B-Modes. In this paper we propose another type of cryogenic detector to be used for CMB survey: A magnetic microbolometer (MMB) that is based on a paramagnetic temperature sensor. It is an adaption of state-of-the-art metallic magnetic calorimeters (MMCs) that are meanwhile a key technology for high resolution $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ and X-ray spectroscopy as well as the study of neutrino mass. The effort to adapt MMCs for CMB surveys is triggered by their lack of Johnson noise associated with the detector readout, the possibility of straightforward calibration and higher dynamic range given it possesses a broad and smooth responsivity dependence with temperature and the absence of Joule dissipation which simplifies the thermal design. A brief proof of concept case study is analyzed, taking into account typical constraints in CMB measurements and reliable microfabrication processes. The results show that MMBs provide a promising technology for CMB polarization survey as their sensitivity can be tuned for background limited detection of the sky while simultaneously maintaining a low time response to avoid distortion of the point-source response of the telescope. As the sensor technology and its fabrication techniques are compatible with TES based bolometric detector arrays, a change of detector technology would even come with very low cost.</description>
