      <title>Granular drag and lift force on a flexible fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the forces acting on a flexible fiber dragged through a granular bed. Using discrete element simulations, we observe that, after a sufficiently large displacement, the system reaches a steady state in which both the fiber's shape and the forces acting on it become, on average, constant. Under these conditions, we identify two characteristic lengths that describe the fiber's shape and propose unique scaling laws for the drag and lift forces, valid across a wide range of fiber flexibilities, from highly deformable to nearly rigid, based on these lengths. We highlight that the fiber-grains interaction is governed by a single dimensionless elastogranular parameter, defined as the ratio of the fiber's elastic properties to the granular pressure. Finally, we demonstrate that both the forces and the characteristic lengths can be expressed solely as functions of this dimensionless parameter. Our findings offer a fundamental insight into the behavior of a flexible fiber interacting with a granular medium.</description>

      <title>Vorticity-induced surfing and trapping in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microorganisms often encounter strong confinement and complex hydrodynamic flows while navigating their habitats. Combining finite-element methods and stochastic simulations, we study the interplay of active transport and heterogeneous flows in dense porous channels. We find that swimming always slows down the traversal of agents across the channel, giving rise to robust power-law tails of their exit-time distributions. These exit-time distributions collapse onto a universal master curve with a scaling exponent of $\approx 3/2$ across a wide range of packing fractions and motility parameters, which can be rationalized by a scaling relation. We further identify a new motility pattern where agents alternate between surfing along fast streams and extended trapping phases, the latter determining the power-law exponent. Unexpectedly, trapping occurs in the flow backbone itself -- not only at obstacle boundaries -- due to vorticity-induced reorientation in the highly-heterogeneous fluid environment. These findings provide a fundamentally new active transport mechanism with direct implications for biofilm clogging and the design of novel microrobots capable of operating in heterogeneous media.</description>

      <title>Adhesive strength of bio-inspired fibrillar arrays in the presence of contact defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of bio-inspired fibrillar adhesives can be compromised by surface roughness, manufacturing imperfections or impurities. Previous studies investigated the cases of distributed defects on the array, and defects at the level of single fibrils. However, the influence of localized, macroscopic defects remains largely unexplored. Using numerical simulations of a discrete mechanical model for a fibrillar adhesive with a thick backing layer, we investigate how the size and location of a single circular defect affect the established scaling law between the adhesion force ($F$) and the effective compliance of the system ($\beta$), \ie, $F \propto \beta^{-1/2}$. We find that edge defects are generally more detrimental than central ones, as they act as pre-cracks that amplify stress concentrations at the adhesive's edge, accelerating a crack-like failure. Consequently, the established adhesion scaling law is preserved, with the defect only reducing the effective contact area. In contrast, a central defect fundamentally alters the mechanics of detachment. By transforming the contact geometry into an annulus, it promotes more uniform load sharing across the remaining fibrils and mitigates the edge-dominated failure mechanism. This change makes the adhesive strength less sensitive to the compliance of the system, as reflected by a less negative scaling exponent. The transition between these two regimes appears to occur for defects whose boundary merges with the one of the adhesive. These results provide practical guidance for the design, engineering and quality control of bio-inspired fibrillar adhesives.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic active matter under confinement: dynamical heterogeneity, bursts, and glassy behavior in a few-body system of self-propelling camphor surfers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a few-body system composed of self-propelling camphor surfers confined within a circular boundary. These millimeter-sized particles move in a regime where inertia and long-ranged interactions play a significant role, leading to surprisingly complex and subtle collective dynamics. These dynamics include self-organized bursts and glassy behavior at intermediate densities--phenomena not apparent from ensemble-averaged steady-state measures. By analyzing quantities like the overlap order parameter, we observe that the system exhibits dynamical slowing down as particle density increases. This slowdown is also reflected in the bursting activity, where both the amplitude and frequency of bursts decrease with increasing particle density. A minimal inertial active-particle model reproduces these dynamical steady states, revealing the importance of a new intermediate length scale--larger than the particle size. This intermediate scale is critical for the formation of structures resembling caging and plays a key role in the glass-like transition. Our results describe a macroscopic analog of an active glass with the additional phenomena of bursting.</description>

      <title>Universal behavior at the Lifshitz Points of an active Malthusian Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lifshitz points (LPs) are multicritical points where ordered, disordered, and patterned phases meet. Originally studied in equilibrium magnetic systems, LPs have since been identified in soft matter and even cosmological settings. Their role in active, living matter, however, remains entirely unexplored. Here we address this gap by introducing and analyzing LPs in the Active Malthusian Ising Model (AMIM) -- a minimal model of living matter that incorporates motility together with birth-death dynamics. Despite its simplicity, the AMIM provides direct experimental relevance. We show that the system generically exhibits two distinct LPs and elucidate their universal behavior using a dynamic renormalization group analysis with the $\epsilon$-expansion method at one loop. Our results yield testable predictions for future simulations and experiments, establishing LPs as a fertile testing ground for novel physics in active matter.</description>

      <title>Nanofluidic logic based on chiral skyrmion flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle-like chiral magnetic skyrmions can flow in nanotracks and behave like chiral fluids. Using interacting flows to perform logical operations is an important topic in microfluidics and nanofluidics. Here, we report a basic nanofluidic logic computing system based on chiral magnetic skyrmions flowing in parallel pipelines connected by an H-shaped junction. The flow behaviors could be manipulated by adjusting the spin polarization angle, which controls the intrinsic skyrmion Hall angle. We demonstrate that within certain range of the spin polarization angle, fully developed skyrmion flows could lead to fluidic logical operations, which significantly reduce the complexity of skyrmion logic as there is no need for deterministic creation, precise control, and detection of a single isolated skyrmion. Our results suggest that the chiral flow behaviors of magnetic quasiparticles may offer possibilities for spintronic and nanofluidic functions.</description>

      <title>Non-Locally Controllable but Trackable Magnetic Head Flagellated Swimmer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike macroscopic swimmers, microswimmers operate in a low-Reynolds-number regime dominated by viscous forces. This paper investigates the controllability of a magnetic microswimmer composed of a spherical magnetic head and an elastic, non-magnetic flagellum. The swimmer evolves in a Stokes flow and is modeled using the resistive force theory. We prove that, under planar motion, the system is not small-time locally controllable and numerically identify regions that remain inaccessible. Nevertheless, simulations show that trajectory tracking can still be achieved via Bayesian optimization, though it requires large-amplitude transverse deformations.</description>

      <title>The elusive fluid-and-crystal coexistence state in simulations of monodisperse, hard-sphere colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05422v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monodisperse, purely repulsive, hard spheres (MPRHS) are an important model system for mechanistically exploring phase behavior in atomic systems and colloids. Since the 1940s, phase transitions in these systems have been obtained via simulation, theory, and experiments. But there is a gap in this literature: despite decades of reports of phase transition from one pure state to another, no computational studies report spontaneous phase separation into coexisting domains of liquid and crystal regions. This gap owes its origin to the underlying mechanism of entropically-driven phase separation in MPRHS - the competition between short-range entropy and long-range entropy. Frenkel proposed that spontaneous phase separation in simulations of up to 1,000,000 particles would require more than 317,000,000 years to sample enough microstates to converge to phase separated macrostate. Some brute-force simulations do show brief spontaneous coexistence but a metastable crystal or fluid subsequently overtakes the system. To bypass these difficulties, many studies use seeding, gravity, or direct construction of liquid and solid phases to study interfacial energy and nucleation rates of MPRHS systems. WCA potentials have also been used to bypass metastability, where softness provides free volume, lowers osmotic pressure and the energy barrier. It is argued that the transition path taken in bypassing metastability is mechanistically the same as without triggers. But as acknowledged by Alder &amp; Wainwright, explicit observation of spontaneous coexistence is central to computational prediction of first-order transition. Such observation would provide satisfying demonstration of Frenkel's entropy exchange mechanism. We explore literature revealing these interesting behaviors and conclude that computational demonstration of Frenkel's mechanism for MPRHS awaits large systems with careful hardness perturbations.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Diffusion of Superparamagnetic Walkers with Tailored Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13960v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From life sciences and ecology to quantum physics and finance, anomalous diffusion appears in countless complex systems as a signature of emergent transport properties beyond Brownian motion. Despite substantial theoretical progress, the experimental study of real-world systems exhibiting anomalous diffusion remains challenging due to an intrinsically elusive ground truth and the limited information contained in typical single trajectories. Here, unlike previous experimental systems, we demonstrate the controlled generation of two-dimensional trajectories with fully tailored statistics spanning the entire spectrum of anomalous diffusion, from subdiffusion to superdiffusion, and over statistically significant temporal and spatial scales (covering at least two decades). We achieve this feat by simultaneously tuning the step-length distribution and, critically, the velocity autocorrelation function of microscopic superparamagnetic colloidal walkers with magnetic fields during extended acquisitions. Supported by theoretical reasoning, fine control of these two quantities combined allows us to generate trajectories compatible with L\'evy walks and fractional Brownian motion with tailored anomalous diffusion exponents. We envisage our approach will offer a robust, controllable experimental framework for validating and advancing theoretical models, analysis techniques, and predictive tools to study anomalous diffusion in real-life phenomena. These include transport in physical and biological systems, animal movement, human ecology, and financial markets.</description>

      <title>Relevance of the Computational Models of Bacterial Interactions in the simulation of Biofilm Growth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the application of elongated particle interaction models, traditionally used in liquid crystal phase research, in the context of early bacterial biofilm development. Through computer simulations using an agent-based model, we have investigated the possibilities and limitations of modeling biofilm formation and growth using different models for interaction between bacteria, such as the Hertz model, Soft Repulsive Spherocylindrical (SRS) model, and attractive Kihara model. Our approach focuses on understanding how mechanical forces due to the interaction between cells, in addition to growth and diffusive parameters, influence the formation of complex bacterial communities. By comparing such force models, we evaluate their impact on the structural properties of bacterial microcolonies. The results indicate that, although the specific force model has some effect on biofilm properties, the intensity of the interaction between bacteria is the most important determinant. This study highlights the importance of properly selecting interaction strength in simulations to obtain realistic representations of biofilm growth, and suggests which adapted models of rod-shaped bacterial systems may offer a valid approach to study the dynamics of complex biofilms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microstructurally arrested matter, from molecular glasses to soft glassy materials, can retain a memory of their thermal or mechanical (shear) histories. Their history-dependent and nonlinear microstructural recoveries have been studied within the Kovacs framework. Here, we applied the temperature ramps of varying magnitudes to dense colloidal suspensions of thermoresponsive, deformable and compressible microgel particles should serve as an effective strategy to probe the nonlinear path-dependent structural recovery of these systems. We synthesised Poly (N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgel particles using the free radical precipitation polymerisation method. Using oscillatory rheology, we studied the relaxations of the viscoelastic moduli of dense PNIPAM suspensions that were heated and cooled at various temperature ramp rates. Path-dependent structural recovery was quantified by studying the asymmetric approach of the suspension elastic modulus toward the target temperature during the heating and cooling temperature ramps. The loss modulus peaks, observed at the times of initiation and termination of the temperature ramps, were understood to arise from energy dissipation due to microgel rearrangement events. The heights of the peaks were found to be inversely correlated with the asymmetry in the elastic response. Our work highlights the important role of energy dissipation through microgel rearrangements in eliminating path-dependent asymmetries in the storage moduli of dense PNIPAM suspensions subjected to thermal shocks. By tuning the applied temperature ramp rate and particle packing density, therefore, asymmetric storage modulus relaxations in dense systems can be modulated via adjustments of the accessible free volume.</description>

      <title>Tuneable ion selectivity in vermiculite membranes intercalated with unexchangeable ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Membranes selective to ions of the same charge are increasingly sought for wastewater processing and valuable element recovery. However, while narrow channels are known to be essential, other membrane parameters remain difficult to identify and control. Here we show that Zr$^{4+}$, Sn$^{4+}$, Ir$^{4+}$, and La$^{3+}$ ions intercalated into vermiculite laminate membranes become effectively unexchangeable, creating stable channels, one to two water layers wide, that exhibit robust and tuneable ion selectivity. Ion permeability in these membranes spans five orders of magnitude, following a trend dictated by the ions' Gibbs free energy of hydration. Unexpectedly, different intercalated ions lead to two distinct monovalent ion selectivity sequences, despite producing channels of identical width. The selectivity instead correlates with the membranes' stiffness and the entropy of hydration of the intercalated ions. These results introduce a new ion selectivity mechanism driven by entropic and mechanical effects, beyond classical size and charge exclusion.</description>

      <title>Poroelasticity in the presence of active fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a model for characterizing porous, deformable media embedded with magnetorheological fluids (MRFs). These active fluids exhibit tunable mechanical and rheological properties that can be controlled through the application of a magnetic field, which induces a phase transition from a liquid to a solid-like state. This transition profoundly affects both stress transmission and fluid flow within the composite, leading to a behaviour governed by a well-defined threshold that depends on the ratio between the pore size and the characteristic size of clusters of magnetic particles, and can be triggered by adjusting the magnetic field intensity. These effects were confirmed through an experimental campaign conducted on a prototype composite obtained by imbibing a selected MRF into commercial sponges. To design and optimize this new class of materials, a linear poroelastic formulation is proposed and validated through comparison with experimental results. The constitutive relationships, i.e. overall elastic constitutive tensor and permeability, of the model are updated from phenomenological observations, exploiting the experimental data obtained for both the pure fluid and the composite material. The findings demonstrate that the proposed simplified formulation is sufficiently robust to predict and optimize the behaviour of porous media containing MRFs. Such materials hold significant promise for a wide range of engineering applications, including adaptive exosuits for human tissue and joint rehabilitation, as well as innovative structural systems.</description>
