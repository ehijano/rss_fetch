      <title>Nondistortionary belief elicitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A researcher wants to ask a decision-maker about a belief related to a choice the decision-maker made; examples include eliciting confidence or cognitive uncertainty. When can the researcher provide incentives for the decision-maker to report her belief truthfully without distorting her choice? We identify necessary and sufficient conditions for nondistortionary elicitation and fully characterize all incentivizable questions in three canonical classes of problems. For these problems, we show how to elicit beliefs using variants of the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak mechanism.</description>

      <title>A House Monotonic and Droop Proportional Ranked Candidate Voting Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Ranked candidate voting methods based on Phragmen's procedure is described that can be used to produce a top-down proportional candidate list. The method complies with the Droop proportionality criterion satisfied by Single Transferable Vote. It also complies with house monotonicity and independence of irrelevant ballots, properties that are the ranked-candidate analogs of the divisor methods properties of always avoiding the Alabama and New State paradoxes. The highest ranked candidate in the list is the Instant Runoff winner, which is in at least one Droop proportional set of N winners for all N.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence in Team Dynamics: Who Gets Replaced and Why?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the effects of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption in organizations. We ask: (1) How should a principal optimally deploy limited AI resources to replace workers in a team? (2) In a sequential workflow, which workers face the highest risk of AI replacement? (3) How does substitution with AI affect both the replaced and non-replaced workers' wages? We develop a sequential team production model in which a principal can use peer monitoring -- where each worker observes the effort of their predecessor -- to discipline team members. The principal may replace some workers with AI agents, whose actions are not subject to moral hazard. Our analysis yields four key results. First, the optimal AI strategy involves the stochastic use of AI to replace workers. Second, the principal replaces workers at the beginning and at the end of the workflow, but does not replace the middle worker, since this worker is crucial for sustaining the flow of information obtained by peer monitoring. Third, the principal may choose not to fully exhaust the AI capacity at her discretion. Fourth, the optimal AI adoption increases average wages and reduces intra-team wage inequality.</description>

      <title>Perfect Secrecy in the Wild: A Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alice wishes to reveal the state $X$ to Bob, if he knows some other information $Y$ also known to her. If Bob does not, she wishes to reveal nothing about $X$ at all. When can Alice accomplish this? We provide a simple necessary and sufficient condition on the joint distribution of $X$ and $Y$. Shannon's result on the perfect secrecy of the one-time pad follows as a special case.</description>

      <title>Who's in? Household-targeted Government Policies and the Role of Financial Literacy in Market Participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines how household-targeted government policies influence financial market participation conditional on financial literacy, focusing on potential Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) adoption. Due to the lack of empirical CBDC data, I use the introduction of retail Treasury bonds in Italy as a proxy to investigate how financial literacy affects households' likelihood to engage with the new instrument. Using the Bank of Italy's Survey on Household Income and Wealth, I explore how financial literacy influenced households' participation in the Treasury bond market following the 2012 introduction of retail Treasury bonds, showing that households with some but low financial literacy are more likely to participate than other household groups. Based on these findings, I develop a theoretical model to explore the potential implications of financial literacy for CBDC adoption, showing that low-literate households with limited access to risky assets allocate more wealth to CBDC, while high-literate households use risky assets to safeguard against income risk. These results highlight the role of financial literacy in shaping portfolio choices and CBDC adoption.</description>

      <title>Selling Certification, Content Moderation, and Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a model of content moderation for sale, where a platform can channel attention in two ways: direct steering that makes content visible to consumers and certification that controls what consumers know about the content. The platform optimally price discriminates using both instruments. Content from higher willingness-to-pay providers enjoys higher quality certification and more views. The platform cross-subsidizes content: the same certificate is assigned to content from low willingness-to-pay providers that appeals to consumers and content from higher willingness-to-pay providers that does not. Cross-subsidization can benefit consumers by making content more diverse; regulation enforcing accurate certification may be harmful.</description>

      <title>Buyer-Optimal Algorithmic Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12122v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In markets where algorithmic data processing is increasingly prevalent, recommendation algorithms can substantially affect trade and welfare. We consider a setting in which an algorithm recommends a product based on its value to the buyer and its price. We characterize an algorithm that maximizes the buyer's expected payoff and show that it strategically biases recommendations to induce lower prices. Revealing the buyer's value to the seller leaves overall payoffs unchanged while leading to more dispersed prices and a more equitable distribution of surplus across buyer types. These results extend to all Pareto-optimal algorithms and to multiseller markets, with implications for AI assistants and e-commerce ranking systems.</description>

      <title>Robust Pricing for Quality Disclosure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06019v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A platform charges a producer for disclosing quality evidence to consumers before trade. It aims to maximize its revenue guarantee across potentially multiple equilibria which arise from the interdependence of producer purchase decisions and consumer beliefs. The platform's optimal pricing strategy entrenches itself as a market gatekeeper: it induces a unique equilibrium in which non-disclosed products' perceived values are lower than the production cost. To achieve this goal, this pricing strategy iteratively destabilizes under-disclosure equilibria by luring producers to disclose slightly more. Higher-quality producers receive higher rents as their disclosure is prioritized. Despite losing rents, the platform optimally induces socially efficient information transmission for any given evidence structure, and it never benefits from garbling evidence. Compared to the non-robust benchmark, our framework generates more intuitive comparative statics: the platform's ability to extract surplus increases with its value as an information intermediary.</description>

      <title>Markets for Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the prevalence of prediction problems in the economy, we study markets in which firms sell models to a consumer to help improve their prediction. Firms decide whether to enter, choose models to train on their data, and set prices. The consumer can purchase multiple models and use a weighted average of the models bought. Market outcomes can be expressed in terms of the \emph{bias-variance decompositions} of the models that firms sell. We give conditions when symmetric firms will choose different modeling techniques, e.g., each using only a subset of available covariates. We also show firms can choose inefficiently biased models or inefficiently costly models to deter entry by competitors.</description>
