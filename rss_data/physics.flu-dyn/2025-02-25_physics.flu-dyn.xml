      <title>A diffuse boundary method for phase boundaries in viscous compressible flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many physical systems of interest involve the close interaction of a flow in a domain with complex, time-varying boundaries. Treatment of boundaries of this nature is cumbersome due to the difficulty in explicitly tracking boundaries that may exhibit topological transitions and high curvature. Such conditions can also lead to numerical instability. Diffuse boundary methods such as the phase field method are an attractive way to describe systems with complex boundaries, but coupling such methods to hydrodynamic flow solvers is nontrivial. This work presents a systematic approach for coupling flow to arbitrary implicitly-defined diffuse domains. It is demonstrated that all boundary conditions of interest can be expressed as suitable fluxes, noting that angular momentum flux is necessary in order to account for cases such as the no-slip condition. Moreover, it is shown that the diffuse boundary formulation converges exactly to the sharp interface solution, resulting in a well-defined error bound. The method is applied in a viscous compressible flow solver with block-structured adaptive mesh refinement, and the convergence properties are shown. Finally, the efficacy of the method is demonstrated by coupling to other classical flow problems (vortex shedding), problems in solidification (coupling to dendritic growth), and flow through eroding media (coupling to the Allen Cahn equation).</description>

      <title>Data-driven turbulence modelling for magnetohydrodynamic flows in annular pipes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a data-driven approach to Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes turbulence closure modelling in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows. In these flows the magnetic field interacting with the conductive fluid induces unconventional turbulence states such as quasi two-dimensional (2D) turbulence, and turbulence suppression, which are poorly represented by standard Boussinesq models. Our data-driven approach uses time-averaged Large Eddy Simulation (LES) data of annular pipe flows, at different Hartmann numbers, to derive corrections for the $k$-$\omega$ SST model. Correction fields are obtained by injecting time averaged LES fields into the MHD RANS equations, and examining the remaining residuals. The correction to the Reynolds-stress anisotropy is approximated with a modified Tensor Basis Neural Network (TBNN). We extend the generalised eddy hypothesis with a traceless antisymmetric tensor representation of the Lorentz force to obtain MHD flow features, thus keeping Galilean and frame invariance while including MHD effects in the turbulence model. The resulting data-driven models are shown to reduce errors in the mean flow, and to generalise to annular flow cases with different Hartmann numbers from those of the training cases.</description>

      <title>Transition to inverse cascade in turbulent rotating convection in absence of the large-scale vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent convection under strong rotation can develop an inverse cascade of kinetic energy from smaller to larger scales. In the absence of an effective dissipation mechanism at the large scales, this leads to the pile-up of kinetic energy at the largest available scale, yielding a system-wide large-scale vortex (LSV). Earlier works have shown that the transition into this state is abrupt and discontinuous. Here, we study the transition to the inverse cascade in the case where the inverse energy flux is dissipated before it reaches the system scale, suppressing the LSV formation. We demonstrate how this can be achieved in direct numerical simulations by using an adapted form of hypoviscosity on the horizontal manifold. We find that in the absence of the LSV, the transition to the inverse cascade becomes continuous. This shows that it is the interaction between the LSV and the background turbulence that is responsible for the observed discontinuity. We furthermore show that the inverse cascade in absence of the LSV has a more local signature compared to the case with LSV.</description>

      <title>Direct Numerical Simulation of Hydrogen Combustion in a Real-Size IC Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the first Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of hydrogen combustion in a real-size internal combustion engine, investigating the complex dynamics of ignition, flame propagation, and flame-wall interaction under engine-relevant conditions. The simulation focuses on ultra-lean hydrogen operation at equivalence ratio $\phi=0.4$ and 800 rpm, utilizing a state-of-the-art spectral element solver optimized for GPU architectures. The computational domain encompasses the full engine geometry. Results highlight the strong coupling between the flame dynamics and the coherent flow structures during early flame kernel development, while differential diffusion effects lead to increased reactivity at positive flame curvatures, a phenomenon that has only been studied in canonical configurations of freely propagating hydrogen/air flames. As the flame approaches the walls, distinct behavior is observed during head-on and side-wall quenching scenarios, characterized by different spatial distributions of wall heat flux. The findings provide insights into hydrogen combustion in real engines, essential for the development of clean and efficient hydrogen-fueled powertrains.</description>

      <title>Analysis of In-cylinder Flow Structures and Turbulence in a Laboratory Scale Engine using Direct Numerical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-cylinder flow structures and turbulence characteristics are investigated using direct numerical simulations (DNS) in a laboratory-scale engine at technically relevant engine speeds (1500 and 2500 rpm at full load). The data is computed for 12 compression-expansion cycles at each engine speed with initial conditions derived from precursor large eddy simulations (LES) validated against experimental data. Analysis of the tumble ratio indicates significant cycle-to-cycle variation, with lower variability found at higher engine speed. The process of tumble breakdown, quantified by the evolution of mean and turbulent kinetic energy, reveals distinct features between operating conditions, with delayed turbulence peaks observed at lower engine speed. Analysis of the Reynolds stress tensor demonstrates higher stress values at higher engine speed, with pronounced anisotropy near the walls and higher values around the tumble vortex core. Examination of the anisotropic Reynolds stress invariants through Lumley triangles reveals predominantly isotropic turbulence during mid-compression, transitioning to distinct anisotropic states near top dead center (TDC). The lower engine speed exhibits a stronger tendency toward one-component turbulence due to partial tumble dissipation, while the higher speed maintains a more balanced anisotropy. These findings extend previous numerical and experimental studies on turbulence development and in-cylinder flow structures during the compression stroke, providing insights for improving turbulence modeling in practical engine simulations.</description>

      <title>Turbulent-like flows in quasi two-dimensional dense suspensions of motile colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense bacterial suspensions exhibit turbulent-like flows at low Reynolds numbers, driven by the activity of the microswimmers. In this study, we develop a model system to examine these dynamics using motile colloids that mimic bacterial locomotion. The colloids are powered by the Quincke instability, which causes them to spontaneously roll in a random-walk pattern when exposed to a square-wave electric field. We experimentally investigate the flow dynamics in dense suspensions of these Quincke random walkers under quasi two-dimensional conditions, where the particle size is comparable to the gap between the electrodes. Our results reveal an energy spectrum scaling at high wavenumbers as $ \sim k^{-4}$, which holds across a broad range of activity levels -- controlled by the field strength -- and particle concentrations. We observe that velocity time correlations decay within a single period of the square-wave field, yet an anti-correlation appears between successive field applications, indicative of a dynamic structural memory of the ensemble.</description>

      <title>Update hydrological states or meteorological forcings? Comparing data assimilation methods for differentiable hydrologic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) enables hydrologic models to update their internal states using near-real-time observations for more accurate forecasts. With deep neural networks like long short-term memory (LSTM), using either lagged observations as inputs (called "data integration") or variational DA has shown success in improving forecasts. However, it is unclear which methods are performant or optimal for physics-informed machine learning ("differentiable") models, which represent only a small amount of physically-meaningful states while using deep networks to supply parameters or missing processes. Here we developed variational DA methods for differentiable models, including optimizing adjusters for just precipitation data, just model internal hydrological states, or both. Our results demonstrated that differentiable streamflow models using the CAMELS dataset can benefit strongly and equivalently from variational DA as LSTM, with one-day lead time median Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) elevated from 0.75 to 0.82. The resulting forecast matched or outperformed LSTM with DA in the eastern, northwestern, and central Great Plains regions of the conterminous United States. Both precipitation and state adjusters were needed to achieve these results, with the latter being substantially more effective on its own, and the former adding moderate benefits for high flows. Our DA framework does not need systematic training data and could serve as a practical DA scheme for whole river networks.</description>

      <title>Quantum lattice Boltzmann method for simulating nonlinear fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing holds great promise to accelerate scientific computations in fluid dynamics and other classical physical systems. While various quantum algorithms have been proposed for linear flows, developing quantum algorithms for nonlinear problems remains a significant challenge. We introduce a novel node-level ensemble description of lattice gas for simulating nonlinear fluid dynamics on a quantum computer. This approach combines the advantages of the lattice Boltzmann method, which offers low-dimensional representation, and lattice gas cellular automata, which provide linear collision treatment. Building on this framework, we propose a quantum lattice Boltzmann method that relies on linear operations with medium dimensionality. We validated the algorithm through comprehensive simulations of benchmark cases, including vortex-pair merging and decaying turbulence on $2048^2$ computational grid points. The results demonstrate remarkable agreement with direct numerical simulation, effectively capturing the essential nonlinear mechanisms of fluid dynamics. This work offers valuable insights into developing quantum algorithms for other nonlinear problems, and potentially advances the application of quantum computing across various transport phenomena in engineering.</description>

      <title>Effects of reflection distance on Richtmyer-Meshkov instability in the reshock process: A discrete Boltzmann study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Richtmyer-Meshkov (RM) instability occurs when a perturbed interface between two fluids undergoes impulsive acceleration due to a shock wave. In this paper, a numerical investigation of the RM instability during the reshock process is conducted using the two-component discrete Boltzmann method. The influence of reflection distance on the RM instability, including both hydrodynamic and thermodynamic non-equilibrium effects, is explored in detail. The interaction time between the reflected shock wave and the material interface varies with different reflection distances. Larger reflection distances lead to a longer evolution time of the material interface before reshock, resulting in more complex effects on the interface deformation, the mixing extent of the fluid system, and non-equilibrium behaviors after reshock. Additionally, while the reflection distance has a minimal impact on mixing entropy before the secondary impact, a significant difference emerges after the secondary impact. This suggests that the secondary impact enhances the evolution of the RM instability. Furthermore, non-equilibrium behaviors or quantities exhibit complex dynamics due to the influence of the transmitted shock wave, transverse waves, rarefaction waves, material interfaces, and dissipation/diffusion processes.</description>

      <title>Flow and Noise Control of a Cylinder with Annular Plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing demand for electricity and increasing interest in renewable energy, wind turbine noise pollution has become a more pressing issue. Aerodynamic noise not only impacts human well-being but also affects wildlife. This study investigates the aeroacoustics and aerodynamics of a two-dimensional circular cylinder exposed to turbulent flow at a fixed Reynolds number of 22,000. A key novelty of this research is the introduction of a passive control technique, achieved by designing a structure with two thin annular plates positioned around the cylinder in the circumferential space. The numerical analysis is conducted using unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) methods in combination with the Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings (FW-H) acoustic analogy. The control assessments reveal substantial performance improvements, with reductions of 89.46% in the mean drag coefficient and 86.6% in the Strouhal number for the modified cylinder. From an acoustic perspective, the passive control method achieves a maximum noise reduction of 39 dB, with a notable drag reduction of 50.62% in a specific case. This innovative design offers a highly efficient and cost-effective solution for noise reduction and wake control in wind turbine applications. Its eco-friendly nature, ease of implementation, and maintenance-free operation make it a promising approach for enhancing wind turbine performance without additional energy consumption.</description>

      <title>Thermal Conductance Correlations of Static Lubricated Ball Bearings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ball bearings are commonly used to reduce the friction in rotating mechanical components. The present work reports improved numerical approaches to model bearing thermal conductance in the absence of convection. We start by modeling the thermal pathway across a single ball-to-race pathway for a simplified geometry, an azimuthally symmetric ball in contact with a flat surface (ball-on-flat). A first-principles approach is used to calculate the static lubricant meniscus shape using a custom-developed Python code. We apply the finite element method (FEM) to extract total thermal conductance of the lubricated ball-on-flat system. Using similar methods, we also present a three-dimensional numerical model of the lubricant meniscus in a static angular contact ball bearing section (ball-on-race). By generating thermal conductance correlations for Yovanovich's classic lubricated model, our two-dimensional multiphysics model, and our three-dimensional multiphysics model, we enable comparison of the results of all three models. To compare them, parametric studies are conducted to illustrate the effect of lubricant volume and applied load on the total thermal conductance for each model. The hierarchical methodology reported here improves both the fidelity of tribo-thermo-mechanical modeling and establishes a reference for the accuracy of commonly used geometric approximations for thermal transport in spacecraft ball bearings.</description>

      <title>Central-moment-based discrete Boltzmann modeling of compressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a central-moment-based discrete Boltzmann method (CDBM) is constructed for fluid flows with variable specific heat ratios. The central kinetic moments are employed to calculate the equilibrium discrete velocity distribution function in the CDBM. In comparison to previous incompressible central-moment-based lattice Boltzmann method, the CDBM possesses the capability of investigating compressible flows with thermodynamic nonequilibrium effects beyond conventional hydrodynamic models. Unlike all existing DBMs which are constructed in raw-moment space, the CDBM stands out by directly providing the nonequilibrium effects related to the thermal fluctuation. The proposed method has been rigorously validated using benchmarks of the Sod shock tube, Lax shock tube, shock wave phenomena, two-dimensional sound wave, and the Taylor-Green vortex flow. The numerical results exhibit an exceptional agreement with theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Deep-reinforcement-learning-based separation control in a two-dimensional airfoil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this study is to discover new active-flow-control (AFC) techniques for separation mitigation in a two-dimensional NACA 0012 airfoil at a Reynolds number of 3000. To find these AFC strategies, a framework consisting of a deep-reinforcement-learning (DRL) agent has been used to determine the action strategies to apply to the flow. The actions involve blowing and suction through jets at the airfoil surface. The flow is simulated with the numerical code Alya, which is a low-dissipation finite-element code, on a high-performance computing system. Various control strategies obtained through DRL led to 43.9% drag reduction, while others yielded an increase in aerodynamic efficiency of 58.6%. In comparison, periodic-control strategies demonstrated lower energy efficiency while failing to achieve the same level of aerodynamic improvements as the DRL-based approach. These gains have been attained through the implementation of a dynamic, closed-loop, time-dependent, active control mechanism over the airfoil.</description>

      <title>Droplet coalescence kinetics: Coalescence mechanisms and thermodynamic non-equilibrium effects under isothermal and non-isothermal conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the droplet coalescence mechanisms and the interplay between various thermodynamic non-equilibrium (TNE) effects under isothermal and non-isothermal conditions kinetically. The main findings include: (1) Coalescence initiation and cut-through mechanisms: In non-isothermal conditions, the temperature rise caused by the release of latent heat during phase transition slightly increases the surface tension gradient (driving force) near the contact point of the two droplets, while significantly enhancing the pressure gradient (resistance). This results in a significantly prolonged coalescence initiation time compared to the isothermal case. In both cases, pressure extends the liquid-vapor interface in opposite directions, promoting the growth of the liquid bridge. (2) TNE effects: Latent heat-induced temperature rise significantly refrains the TNE intensity in thermal case. Before and after droplet contact, non-equilibrium quantities driven by the temperature gradient and those driven by the velocity gradient, alternate in dominating the coalescence process. This competition and interplay result in a more complex spatial and spatiotemporal evolution of TNE effects compared to the isothermal case. (3) Entropy production mechanisms: In the non-isothermal case, entropy production is contributed not only by $\bm {\Delta}^{\ast}_2$ but also by $\bm {\Delta}^{\ast}_{3,1}$, with the former being the dominant contributor. The temperature field reduces the entropy production rate, while extends its duration, and increases the total entropy production. This research provides kinetic insights for dynamic, cross-scale regulation and multifunctional integration of coalescence processes in industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Rotational effects on the small-scale dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using direct numerical simulations of forced rotating turbulence, we study the effect of rotation on the growth rate and the saturation level of the small-scale dynamo. For slow rotation rates, increasing the rotation rate reduces both the growth rate and the saturation level. Once the rotation rate crosses a threshold, large-scale vortices are formed which enhance the growth rate and the saturation level. Below this threshold, the suppression of the small-scale dynamo with increasing rotation is explained by the fact that at scales close to, but smaller than, the forcing scale, rotating turbulence is one-dimensionalized, with the velocity component along the rotation axis being larger than the other two components. This is due to the rotational destabilization of vortices produced by the forcing function. While the rotational effect on the growth rate becomes small at high Re, the ratio of the steady-state magnetic to kinetic energies remains suppressed by up to 35% as compared to the non-rotating case.</description>

      <title>Statistical machine learning tools for probabilistic closures of turbulence models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent flow remains a challenging subject, despite extensive efforts to find analytical descriptions. Modeling small scales of motion is crucial for saving time and resources in numerical simulations, particularly in industrial applications. Here we attempt to model small scales of motion by creating closures for a Shell model of turbulence, more specifically for Sabra. Shell models are infinite dimensional dynamical systems that retain most key properties of Navier-Stokes equation, such as energy cascade and intermittency, while being computationally treatable. To account for Sabra's intermittent fluctuations we employ a set of scaling relations that recover a hidden symmetry and leaves us with universal statistics across the inertial range. On data from these rescaled variables we then adapt and apply two machine learning tools, a variational auto-encoder and sparse identification of non-linear dynamics. We estimate the data's densities and dynamics in order to then generate new instances of data. Given a mid-inertial range cutoff scale, we evolve reduced models in time, resolving only scales of motion larger than the cutoff scale, closing the reduced model with data generated by the machine learning tools. We compare statistics of our reduced models against a Sabra's fully resolved simulation to evaluate each closure's performances. Our results show improvement regarding previous work, and all our closures are probabilistic and cutoff-independent.</description>

      <title>A novel microfluidic method to produce monodisperse micrometer bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel microfluidic method to produce quasi-monodisperse bubbles with diameters from tens to very few microns. A gaseous rivulet flows over the shallow groove printed on a T-junction exit channel. The triple contact line delimiting the rivulet is pinned to the groove edges. The rivulet breaks up into bubbles much smaller than the exit channel. When operating under adequate conditions, the flow transitions toward a singular mode where the rivulet remains quasi-static and emits bubbles smaller than the groove width. This allows the production of bubbles with diameters in the 3-5 $\mu$m range, which is preferable for relevant therapeutical applications.</description>

      <title>3D Simulations of Semiconvection in Spheres: Turbulent Mixing and Layer Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconvection occurs in regions of stars and planets that are unstable to overturning convection according to the Schwarzschild criterion, yet stable according to the Ledoux criterion. Previous simulations in Cartesian boxes have advanced our understanding of the semiconvective instability, layer formation, and transport properties. However, much less is known about semiconvection in spherical geometry and under the influence of rotation or magnetic fields. We present 3D simulations of semiconvection in the full sphere (including $r=0$), and accounting for rotation. We find that the formation and evolution of semiconvective layers in nonrotating spheres occurs in a similar way to nonrotating Cartesian boxes, in the sense that the critical density ratio at which layers are expected to form is approximately the same in both geometries. Layers rapidly merge once they form, ultimately leading to a fully mixed convective sphere. The transport properties measured through the Nusselt numbers and the buoyancy flux ratio are also similar to results from previous studies in boxes. When rotation is added to the system, layer formation and evolution proceeds in a similar fashion to the nonrotating runs. However, rotation hampers the radial transport of heat and composition, and, as a result, the time required for the sphere to become fully mixed gets longer as the flow becomes more rotationally constrained. We also find that semiconvective layers exhibit spherical mixing in nonrotating cases, whereas in rotating cases, the mixing becomes more cylindrical. We discuss what is needed for future work to build more realistic models.</description>

      <title>Turbulence-Induced Fluctuating Interfaces in Heterogeneously-Active Suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of heterogeneous (spatially varying) activity in a hydrodynamical model for dense bacterial suspensions, confining ourselves to experimentally realizable, simple, quenched, activity patterns. We show that the evolution of the bacterial velocity field under such activity patterning leads to the emergence of hydrodynamic interfaces separating spatially localized turbulence from jammed frictional surroundings. We characterise the intermittent and multiscale fluctuations of this interface and also investigate how heterogeneity influences mixing via the residence times of Lagrangian tracers. This work reveals how naturally occurring heterogeneities could decisively steer active flows into more complex configurations than those typically studied, opening up parallels to droplet dynamics, front propagation and turbulent mixing layers.</description>

      <title>Shock induced ignition and transition to detonation in the presence of mechanically induced non-linear acoustic forcing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of shock induced ignition and transition to detonation in a reactive medium in the presence of mechanically induced fluctuations by a moving oscillating piston. For the inert problem prior to ignition, we provide a novel closed form model in Lagrangian coordinates for the generation of the train of compression and expansions, their steepening into a train of N-shock waves and their reflection on the lead shock, as well as the distribution energy dissipation rate in the induction zone. The model is found in excellent agreement with numerics. Reactive calculations were performed for hydrogen and ethylene fuels using a novel high-fidelity scheme to solve the reactive Euler equations written in Lagrangian coordinates. Different regimes of ignition and transition to detonation, controlled by the time scale of the forcing and the two time scales of the chemistry: the induction and reaction times. Two novel hot spot cascade mechanisms were identified. The first relies on the coherence between the sequence of hot spot formation set by the piston forcing and forward wave interaction with the lead shock, generalizing the classic runaway in fast flames. The second hot spot cascade is triggered by the feedback between the pressure pulse generated by the first generation hot spot cascade and the shock. For slow forcing, the sensitization is through a modification to the classic run-away process, while the high frequency regime leads to very localized sub-critical hot-spot formation controlled by the cumulative energy dissipation of the first generation shocks at a distance comparable to the shock formation location.</description>

      <title>A molecular-kinetic hypothesis on pressure behavior in gas flows at low Mach numbers and its effect on turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18914v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent works, we proposed a theory of turbulence creation via the second coefficient of the virial expansion (i.e. the van der Waals effect), which in part relies on the empirically observed "equilibrated" behavior of pressure in a low Mach number flow. At the same time, conventional kinetic theory does not offer satisfactory explanation for such a behavior of the pressure variable, leading instead to an adiabatic flow in the form of the usual compressible Euler or Navier-Stokes equations. For this reason, gas flows at low Mach numbers are modeled via the incompressible Euler or Navier-Stokes equations, which are derived empirically, and fail to capture some features of observed behavior in real-world gas flows (e.g. convection).
  In the current work, we introduce a novel correction term into the pair correlation function in the closure of the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon hierarchy. This correction adjusts the joint density of pairs of particles based on the macroscopic compression or expansion rate of the gas. The novel correction has no effect on the equations of fluid mechanics for the stochastic, Boltzmann-type collision integral, yet affects the pressure transport equation for the deterministic, Vlasov-type collision integral. Remarkably, its effect on the pressure and turbulent dynamics matches the observed behavior -- that is, the novel correction equilibrates the pressure variable, and, at sufficiently low Mach numbers, shuts down the linear instability which creates turbulent dynamics. Even more remarkably, viscosity appears to have no relation to the mechanism of turbulence shutdown, and the perceived connection of the latter to the Reynolds number is due to the fact that the Reynolds number is the quotient of the Mach and Knudsen numbers. In particular, we estimate that the critical value of the Reynolds number corresponds to the reciprocal of the packing fraction.</description>

      <title>Deep flows transmitted by forced surface gravity waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine a two-dimensional deep-water surface gravity wave packet generated by a pressure disturbance in the Lagrangian reference frame. The pressure disturbance has the form of a narrow-banded weakly nonlinear deep-water wave packet. During forcing, the vorticity equation implies that the momentum resides entirely in the near-surface Lagrangian-mean flow, which in this context is often called the ``Stokes drift''. After the forcing turns off, the wave packet propagates away from the forcing region, carrying with it most of the energy imparted by the forcing. These waves together with their induced long wave response have no momentum in a depth integrated sense, in agreement with the classical results of Longuet-Higgins and Stewart (1962) and McIntyre (1981). The total flow associated with the propagating packet has no net momentum, in agreement with the classical results. In contrast with the finite-depth scenario discussed by McIntyre (1981), however, momentum imparted to the fluid during forcing resides in a dipolar structure that persists in the forcing region -- rather than being carried away by shallow water waves. We conclude by examining waves propagating from deep to shallow water and show that wave packets, which initially have no momentum, may have non-zero momentum in finite-depth water through reflected and trapped long waves. This explains how deep water waves acquire momentum as they approach shore. The artificial form of the parameterized forcing from the wind facilitates the thought experiments considered in this paper, as opposed to striving to model more realistic wind forcing scenarios.</description>

      <title>Quantification of Flagellar Gait Changes with Combined Shape Mode Analysis and Swimming Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many different microswimmers propel themselves using flagella that beat periodically. The shape of the flagellar beat and swimming speed have been observed to change with fluid rheology. We quantify changes in the flagellar waveforms of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in response to changes in fluid viscosity using (1) shape mode analysis and (2) a full swimmer simulation to analyze how shape changes affect the swimming speed and to explore the dimensionality of the shape space. By decomposing the gait into the time-independent mean shape and the time-varying stroke, we find that the flagellar mean shape substantially changes in response to viscosity, while the changes in the time-varying stroke are more subtle. Using the swimmer simulation, we quantify how the swimming speed is affected by the dimensionality of the flagellar shape reconstruction, and we show that the observed change in swimming speed with viscosity is explained by the variations in mean flagellar shape and beat frequency, while the changes in swimming speed from the different time-varying strokes are on the scale of variation between cells.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale physics of cryogenic liquid helium-4: Inverse coarse-graining properties of smoothed particle hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our recent numerical studies on cryogenic liquid helium-4 strongly indicate the features of multiscale physics that can be identified using the Landau's two-fluid model. This study presents the possibility that two-fluid models based on classical and quantum hydrodynamics have a relationship between the scale transformation using filtering in large eddy simulations (LES) and the inverse scale transformation using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We show that the spin angular momentum conservation term, which we previously introduced into the two-fluid model as a quantum mechanical correction, formally corresponds to the subgrid-scale (SGS) model, which can be derived from the scale transformation of the two-fluid model from quantum to classical hydrodynamics. Our theoretical analysis shows that solving the two-fluid model based on classical hydrodynamics using SPH can reproduce the microscopic fluctuations even at the macroscopic scale because the truncation errors owing to the smoothing kernel approximation can substitute the microscopic fluctuations. In particular, the fluctuations can be amplified according to the size of the kernel radius at the macroscopic scale. Our further theoretical analysis shows that the Condiff viscosity model can serve as an SGS model and incorporate the quantum vortex interactions into the two-fluid model. Our results and discussion provide new insights into the microscopic composition of the cryogenic liquid helium-4 within a multiscale framework. First, a normal fluid can be a mixture of inviscid and viscous fluid particles. Second, a flow identified as a normal fluid on the microscopic scale because of the presence of molecular viscosity is still classified as an inviscid fluid on the hydrodynamic scale because its viscosity is insufficient to produce eddy viscosity.</description>

      <title>An Insight into Parameter Identifiability Issues in the Carreau-Yasuda Model: a Novel Rheological Formulation for Shear-thinning non-Newtonian Inelastic Fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Carreau-Yasuda rheological model is widely employed in both research and industrial applications to describe the shear-thinning behaviour of non-Newtonian inelastic fluids. However, its calibration against experimental data is often affected by intrinsic identifiability issues, which can lead to misleading physical interpretations of model parameters and unreliable flow predictions. In this paper, starting from the analysis of the identifiability challenges associated with the Carreau-Yasuda model, a novel rheological formulation for shear-thinning non-Newtonian inelastic fluids is proposed. Analytical results and exemplary numerical case studies demonstrate that the proposed formulation is based on physically meaningful model parameters, whose identifiability is not compromised by the key limitations of the Carreau-Yasuda model. Moreover, the new approach allows for effective parameter estimation through a straightforward direct identification strategy, eliminating the need for inverse calibration procedures based on optimization techniques.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a quasi-analytical framework for "Carreau-Yasuda-like" fluids with a viscosity characterized by two constant plateau at low and high shear rates connected by a shear-thinning branch, and flowing in slightly tapered pipes. This setup is common in research and industrial applications since the last century, by assuming both a Newtonian or a non-Newtonian inelastic behaviour. Nevertheless, an analytical solution for "Carreau-Yasuda-like" fluids is still lacking. The expressions have been derived by using the order-of-magnitude analysis and neglecting the inertial terms in the momentum balance equations. The analytical solutions are employed to an extrusion bioprinting process as an application example, and verified through numerical procedures.</description>

      <title>Duality of Navier-Stokes to a one-dimensional system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01389v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Navier-Stokes (NS) equations describe fluid motion via a high-dimensional, nonlinear system of partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite their fundamental role, their behavior in turbulent regimes remains poorly understood, and their global regularity is an open Millennium Problem. Here, we show that \textbf{the NS system can be transformed to a nonlinear equation for the momentum loop \( \vec{P}(\theta, t)\), reducing the original problem in \( \mathbb{R}_3 \) to a one-dimensional problem}. A key consequence is the \textbf{No Explosion Theorem}, which rules out finite-time singularities for stochastic initial conditions, suggesting a pathway to proving NS regularity for deterministic data. Additionally, we derive an exact solution of the momentum loop equation, the \textbf{Euler ensemble}, which describes the \textbf{asymptotic state of decaying turbulence}. This solution, validated by numerical and experimental data, replaces heuristic turbulence models with an analytically derived structure. While the Euler ensemble solves a specific boundary problem, its universality as an attractor remains an open question. By reducing NS to a \textbf{nonlinear equation} on \( S_1 \), this work opens new pathways toward resolving turbulence and fluid mechanics' fundamental challenges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning based surrogate models offer researchers powerful tools for accelerating simulation-based workflows. However, as standard datasets in this space often cover small classes of physical behavior, it can be difficult to evaluate the efficacy of new approaches. To address this gap, we introduce the Well: a large-scale collection of datasets containing numerical simulations of a wide variety of spatiotemporal physical systems. The Well draws from domain experts and numerical software developers to provide 15TB of data across 16 datasets covering diverse domains such as biological systems, fluid dynamics, acoustic scattering, as well as magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of extra-galactic fluids or supernova explosions. These datasets can be used individually or as part of a broader benchmark suite. To facilitate usage of the Well, we provide a unified PyTorch interface for training and evaluating models. We demonstrate the function of this library by introducing example baselines that highlight the new challenges posed by the complex dynamics of the Well. The code and data is available at https://github.com/PolymathicAI/the_well.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the dynamic transition of quantum turbulence (QT) in a confined potential field as the system evolves from purely two-dimensional (2D) to quasi-two-dimensional, and ultimately to three-dimensional (3D), by fixing the lateral dimensions of the trapping box while varying its height. In the 2DQT, distinct Onsager vortex cluster formation and inverse energy cascade are observed, while 3DQT exhibits a direct energy cascade consistent with the Vinen turbulence decay rate, which display striking differences. By systematically altering the system height, we explore how dimensionality drives the differentiation of turbulence types and find that this transition is closely related to the excitation of Kelvin waves. Kelvin waves not only introduce additional dissipation mechanisms but also serve as mediators for direct energy transfer across scales. When the wavelength of the permitted Kelvin waves exceeds the critical size of vortex clusters, turbulence begins transitioning to 3D type, culminating in fully developed 3DQT at the characteristic scale. In the transitional region, we observe continuous variations in the decay rate and vortex cluster correlation functions.</description>
