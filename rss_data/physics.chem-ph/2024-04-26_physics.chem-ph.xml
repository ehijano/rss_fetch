      <title>$\Delta$ADAPT-VQE: Toward Accurate Calculation of Excitation Energies on Quantum Computers for BODIPY Molecules With Application in Photodynamic Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum chemistry simulations offer a cost-effective way for computational design of BODIPY photosensitizers with potential use in photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, accurate predictions of photophysical properties, such as excitation energies, pose a challenge for the popular time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and equation-of-motion coupled cluster with singles and doubles (EOM-CCSD) methods. By contrast, reliable descriptions can be achieved by multi-reference quantum chemistry methods, though unfortunately, their computational cost grows exponentially with the number of correlated electrons. Alternatively, quantum computing holds a great potential for exact simulation of photophysical properties in a computationally more efficient way. To this end, we introduce the state-specific $\Delta$UCCSD-VQE (unitary coupled cluster with singles and doubles variational quantum eigensolver) and $\Delta$ADAPT-VQE methods in which the electronically excited state is calculated via a non-Aufbau electronic configuration. The accuracy and capability of the developed methods are assessed against experimentally determined excitation energies for six BODIPY-derivatives. We show that the proposed methods predict accurate vertical excitation energies that are not only in good agreement with experimental reference data but also outperform popular quantum chemistry methods, such as TDDFT and EOM-CCSD. Spurred by its impressive performance and simplicity, we are confident that $\Delta$ADAPT will emerge as the method of choice for guiding the rational design of photosensitizers for PDT and photocatalysis in the era of near-term quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Simulating Ultrafast Transient Absorption Spectra from First Principles using a Time-Dependent Configuration Interaction Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) is among the most common ultrafast photochemical experiments, but its interpretation remains challenging. In this work, we present an efficient and robust method for simulating TAS signals from first principles. Excited-state absorption and stimulated emission (SE) signals are computed using time-dependent complete active space configuration interaction (TD-CASCI) simulations, leveraging the robustness of time-domain simulation to minimize electronic structure failure. We demonstrate our approach by simulating the TAS signal of 1$^\prime$-hydroxy-2$^\prime$-acetonapthone (HAN) from ab initio multiple spawning nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations. Our results are compared to gas-phase TAS data recorded from both jet-cooled ($T\sim 40$ K) and hot ($\sim 403$ K) molecules via cavity-enhanced transient absorption spectroscopy (CE-TAS). Decomposition of the computed spectrum allows us to assign a rise in the SE signal to excited-state proton transfer and the ultimate decay of the signal to relaxation through a twisted conical intersection. The total cost of computing the observable signal ($\sim$1700 graphics processing unit hours for $\sim$4 ns of electron dynamics) was markedly less than that of the {\em ab initio} multiple spawning calculations used to compute the underlying nonadiabatic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Reduced density matrix formulation of quantum linear response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prediction of spectral properties via linear response (LR) theory is an important tool in quantum chemistry for understanding photo-induced processes in molecular systems. With the advances of quantum computing, we recently adapted this method for near-term quantum hardware using a truncated active space approximation with orbital rotation, named quantum linear response (qLR). In an effort to reduce the classic cost of this hybrid approach, we here derive and implement a reduced density matrix (RDM) driven approach of qLR. This allows for the calculation of spectral properties of moderately sized molecules with much larger basis sets than so far possible. We report qLR results for benzene and $R$-methyloxirane with a cc-pVTZ basis set and study the effect of shot noise on the valence and oxygen K-edge absorption spectra of H$_2$O in the cc-pVTZ basis.</description>

      <title>Rational Designing of Anthocyanidins-Directed Near-Infrared Two-Photon Fluorescence Probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, two-photon fluorescent probes based on anthocyanidins molecules have attracted extensive attention due to their outstanding photophysical properties. However, there are only a few two-photon excited fluorescent probes that really meet the requirements of relatively long emission wavelengths (&gt;600 nm), large two-photon absorption (TPA) cross sections (300 GM), significant Stokes shift (&gt;80 nm), and high fluorescence intensity. Herein, the photophysical properties of a series of anthocyanidins with the same substituents but different fluorophore skeletons were investigated in detail. Compared with b-series molecules, a-series molecules with a six-membered ring in the backbone have a slightly higher reorganization energy. This results in more energy loss upon light excitation, enabling the reaction products to detect NTR through a larger Stokes shift. More importantly, there is very little decrease in fluorescence intensity as the Stokes shift increases. These features are extremely valuable for high-resolution NTR detection. In light of this, novel 2a-n (n=1-5) compounds are designed, which are accomplished by inhibiting the twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) effect through alkyl cyclization, azetidine ring and extending {\pi} conjugation. Among them, 2a-3 gains long emission spectrum ({\lambda}em=691.42 nm), noticeable TPA cross section (957.36 GM), and large Stokes shift (110.88 nm), indicating that it serves as a promising candidate for two-photon fluorescent dyes. It is hoped that this work will offer some insightful theoretical direction for the development of novel high performance anthocyanin fluorescent materials.</description>

      <title>Revealing the regularities of electron correlation energies associated with valence electrons in atoms in the first three rows of the periodic table</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic correlation is a complex many-body effect and the correlation energy depends on the specific electronic structure and spatial distribution of electrons in each atom and molecule. Although the total correlation energy in an atom can be decomposed into different components such as inter-orbital and intra-orbital pair-correlation energies (PCE), it is generally believed that the PCEs in different atoms cannot be the same. In this work, we investigate the correlation energies of the atoms in the first three rows of the periodic table (He to Ar). It is found that when the correlation energy is defined as the difference between the exact ground-state energy and the unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) energy, the inter- and intra-orbital PECs associated with the valence electrons of the atoms in the same row of the periodic table have the same values. These PCEs are not entangled and their values depend only on the electron orbitals. For two specific orbitals, the inter-orbital correlation energy is the same between two electrons of parallel spins or anti-parallel spins. We also show that the effects of orbital relaxation on the correlation energy are surprisingly small.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Ethanol Blending Effects on Auto-Ignition and Heat Release in n-Heptane/Ethanol Non-Premixed Flames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves into the auto-ignition temperature of n-heptane and ethanol mixtures within a counterflow flame configuration under low strain rate, with a particular focus on the impact of ethanol blending on heat release rates. Employing the sensitivity analysis method inspired by Zurada's sensitivity approach for neural network, this study identifies the group of critical species influencing the heat release rate. Further analysis concentration change reveals the intricate interactions among these various radicals across different temperature zones. It is found that, in n-heptane dominant mixtures, inhibition of low-temperature chemistry (LTC) caused by additional ethanol, impacts heat release rate at high temperature zone through diffusion effect of specific radicals such as CH2O, C2H4, C3H6 and H2O2. For ethanol-dominant mixtures, an increase in heat release rate was observed with higher ethanol fraction. Further concentration change analysis elucidated it is primarily attributed to the decomposition of ethanol and its subsequent reactions. This research underscores the significance of incorporating both chemical kinetics and species diffusion effects when analyzing the counterflow configuration of complex fuel mixtures.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient Molecular Integrals of Solid Harmonic Gaussian Orbitals Using Quantum Entanglement of Angular Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vector-coupling and vector-uncoupling schemes in the quantum theory of angular momentum correspond to unitary Clebsch-Gordan transformations that operate on quantum angular momentum states and thereby control their degree of entanglement. The addition of quantum angular momentum from this transformation is suitable for reducing the degree of entanglement of quantum angular momentum, leading to simple and effective calculations of the molecular integrals of solid harmonic Gaussian orbitals (SHGO). Even with classical computers, the speed-up ratio in the evaluation of molecular nuclear Coulomb integrals with SHGOs can be up to four orders of magnitude for atomic orbitals with high angular momentum quantum number. Thus, the less entanglement there is for a quantum system the easier it is to simulate, and molecular integrals with SHGOs are shown to be particularly well-suited for quantum computing. High-efficiency quantum circuits previously developed for unitary and cascading Clebsch-Gordan transformations of angular momentum states can be applied to the differential and product rules of solid harmonics to efficiently compute two-electron Coulomb integrals ubiquitous in quantum chemistry. Combined with such quantum circuits and variational quantum eigensolver algorithms, the high computational efficiency of molecular integrals in solid harmonic bases unveiled in this paper may open an avenue for accelerating full quantum computing chemistry.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of hyperbolic reaction-diffusion systems on directed networks through the generalized Routh-Hurwitz criterion for complex polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of dynamical systems on complex networks is of paramount importance in engineering, given that many natural and artificial systems find a natural embedding on discrete topologies. For instance, power grids, chemical reactors and the brain, to name a few, can be modeled through the network formalism by considering elementary units coupled via the links. In recent years, scholars have developed numerical and theoretical tools to study the stability of those coupled systems when subjected to perturbations. In such framework, it was found that asymmetric couplings enhance the possibilities for such systems to become unstable. Moreover, in this scenario the polynomials whose stability needs to be studied bear complex coefficients, which makes the analysis more difficult. In this work, we put to use a recent extension of the well-known Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion, allowing to treat the complex coefficient case. Then, using the Brusselator model as a case study, we discuss the stability conditions and the regions of parameters when the networked system remains stable.</description>

      <title>In Situ Characterisation of Graphene Growth on Liquid Copper-Gallium Alloys: Paving the Path for Cost-Effective Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid metal catalysts (LMCats), primarily molten copper, have demonstrated their efficiency in the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) approach for synthesising high-quality, large-area graphene. However, their high melting temperatures limit broader applications. Reducing the temperature of graphene production on LMCats would lead to a more efficient and cost-effective process. Here, we investigated the effects of alloying copper with a low-melting temperature metal on graphene growth in real-time. We examined a set of liquid copper-gallium alloy systems using two complementary in situ techniques: radiation-mode optical microscopy and synchrotron X-ray reflectivity (XRR). Microscopy observations revealed reduced catalytic activity and graphene quality degradation in compositions with gallium domination. The XRR confirmed the formation of single-layer graphene on alloys with up to 60 wt% of gallium. Additionally, we detected a systematic increase in adsorption height on the alloys' surface, suggesting a weaker graphene adhesion on gallium. These findings propose a trade-off between layer quality and production cost reduction is feasible. Our results offer insights into the CVD synthesis of graphene on bimetallic liquid surfaces and underscore the potential of gallium-copper alloys for enabling the direct transfer of graphene from a liquid substrate, thereby addressing the limitations imposed by high melting temperatures of conventional LMCats.</description>

      <title>Freezing density scaling of transport coefficients in the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the transport coefficients (self-diffusion, shear viscosity, and thermal conductivity) of the Weeks-Chandler-Anderson (WCA) fluid along isotherms exhibit a freezing density scaling (FDS). The functional form of this FDS is essentially the same or closely related to those in the Lennard-Jones fluid, hard-sphere fluid, and some liquefied noble gases. This proves that this FDS represents a quasi-universal corresponding state principle for simple classical fluids with steep interactions. Some related aspects such as Stokes-Einstein relation without a hydrodynamic diameter and gas-to-liquid dynamical crossover are briefly discussed. Simple fitting formula for the transport coefficients of the dense WCA fluid are suggested.</description>

      <title>Model-free inference of memory in conformational dynamics of a multi-domain protein</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-molecule experiments provide insight into the motion (conformational dynamics) of individual protein molecules. Usually, a well-defined but coarse-grained intramolecular coordinate is measured and subsequently analysed with the help of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to deduce the kinetics of protein conformational changes. Such approaches rely on the assumption that the microscopic dynamics of the protein evolve according to a Markov-jump process on some network. However, the manifestation and extent of memory in the dynamics of the observable strongly depends on the chosen underlying Markov model, which is generally not known and therefore can lead to misinterpretations. Here, we combine extensive single-molecule plasmon ruler experiments on the heat shock protein Hsp90, computer simulations, and theory to infer and quantify memory in a model-free fashion. Our analysis is based on the bare definition of non-Markovian behaviour and does not require any underlying model. In the case of Hsp90 probed by a plasmon ruler, the Markov assumption is found to be clearly and conclusively violated on timescales up to roughly 50 s, which corresponds roughly to $\sim$50% of the inferred correlation time of the signal. The extent of memory is striking and reaches biologically relevant timescales. This implies that memory effects penetrate even the slowest observed motions. We provide clear and reproducible guidelines on how to test for the presence and duration of memory in experimental single-molecule data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09761v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability of quantum computers to overcome the exponential memory scaling of many-body problems is expected to transform quantum chemistry. Quantum algorithms require accurate representations of electronic states on a quantum device, but current approximations struggle to combine chemical accuracy and gate-efficiency while preserving physical symmetries, and rely on measurement-intensive adaptive methods that tailor the wave function ansatz to each molecule. In this contribution, we present a symmetry-preserving and gate-efficient ansatz that provides chemically accurate molecular energies with a well-defined circuit structure. Our approach exploits local qubit connectivity, orbital optimisation, and connections with generalised valence bond theory to maximise the accuracy that is obtained with shallow quantum circuits. Numerical simulations for molecules with weak and strong electron correlation, including benzene, water, and the singlet-triplet gap in tetramethyleneethane, demonstrate that chemically accurate energies are achieved with as much as 84% fewer two-qubit gates compared to state-of-the-art adaptive ansatz techniques.</description>

      <title>Photofragmentation of cyclobutanone at 200 nm: TD-DFT vs CASSCF electron diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To simulate a 200 nm photoexcitation in cyclobutanone to the n-3s Rydberg state, classical trajectories were excited from a Wigner distribution to the singlet state manifold based on excitation energies and oscillator strenghts. Twelve singlet and twelve triplet states are treated using TD-B3LYP-D3/6-31+G$^{**}$ for the electronic structure and the nuclei are propagated with the Tully Surface Hopping method. Using TD-DFT, we are able to predict the bond cleavage that takes place on the S$_1$ surface as well as the ultrafast deactivation from the Rydberg n-3s state to the n$\pi^*$. After showing that triplet states and higher-lying singlet states do not play any crucial role during the early dynamics (i.e., the first 300 fs), the SA(6)-CASSCF(8,11)/aug-cc-pvDZ method is used as an electronic structure and the outcome of the non-adiabatic dynamic simulations is recomputed. Gas-phase ultrafast electron diffraction (GUED) spectra are computed for both electronic structure methods, showing significantly different results.</description>

      <title>TorchMD-Net 2.0: Fast Neural Network Potentials for Molecular Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving a balance between computational speed, prediction accuracy, and universal applicability in molecular simulations has been a persistent challenge. This paper presents substantial advancements in the TorchMD-Net software, a pivotal step forward in the shift from conventional force fields to neural network-based potentials. The evolution of TorchMD-Net into a more comprehensive and versatile framework is highlighted, incorporating cutting-edge architectures such as TensorNet. This transformation is achieved through a modular design approach, encouraging customized applications within the scientific community. The most notable enhancement is a significant improvement in computational efficiency, achieving a very remarkable acceleration in the computation of energy and forces for TensorNet models, with performance gains ranging from 2-fold to 10-fold over previous iterations. Other enhancements include highly optimized neighbor search algorithms that support periodic boundary conditions and the smooth integration with existing molecular dynamics frameworks. Additionally, the updated version introduces the capability to integrate physical priors, further enriching its application spectrum and utility in research. The software is available at https://github.com/torchmd/torchmd-net.</description>

Abstract: The basal plane of graphene can function as a selective barrier that is permeable to protons but impermeable to all ions and gases, stimulating its use in applications such as membranes, catalysis and isotope separation. Protons can chemically adsorb on graphene and hydrogenate it, inducing a conductor-insulator transition that has been explored intensively in graphene electronic devices. However, both processes face energy barriers and various strategies have been proposed to accelerate proton transport, for example by introducing vacancies, incorporating catalytic metals or chemically functionalizing the lattice. However, these techniques can compromise other properties, such as ion selectivity or mechanical stability. Here we show that independent control of the electric field, E, at around 1 V nm-1, and charge-carrier density, n, at around 1 x 10^14 cm-2, in double-gated graphene allows the decoupling of proton transport from lattice hydrogenation and can thereby accelerate proton transport such that it approaches the limiting electrolyte current for our devices. Proton transport and hydrogenation can be driven selectively with precision and robustness, enabling proton-based logic and memory graphene devices that have on-off ratios spanning orders of magnitude. Our results show that field effects can accelerate and decouple electrochemical processes in double-gated 2D crystals and demonstrate the possibility of mapping such processes as a function of E and n, which is a new technique for the study of 2D electrode-electrolyte interfaces.</description>
