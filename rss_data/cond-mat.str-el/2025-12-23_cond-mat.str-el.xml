      <title>Non-Abelian topological superconductivity from melting Abelian fractional Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators (FCI) are exotic phases of matter realized at partial filling of a Chern band that host fractionally charged anyon excitations. Recent numerical studies in several microscopic models reveal that increasing the bandwidth in an FCI can drive a direct transition into a charge-2e superconductor rather than a conventional Fermi liquid. Motivated by this surprising observation, we propose a theoretical framework that captures the intertwinement between superconductivity and fractionalization in a lattice setting. Leveraging the duality between three field-theoretic descriptions of the Jain topological order, we find that bandwidth tuning can drive a single parent FCI at $\nu = 2/3$ into five different superconductors, some of which are intrinsically non-Abelian and support Majorana zero modes. Our results reveal a rich landscape of exotic superconductors with no normal state Fermi surface and predict novel higher-charge superconductors coexisting with neutral non-Abelian topological order at more general filling fractions $\nu = p/(2p+1)$.</description>

      <title>Electronic Phonons in a Moir\'e Electron Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective quantum phenomena, such as the excitation of composite fermions1, spin waves2, and exciton condensation3,4, can emerge in strongly correlated systems like the fractional quantum Hall states5, spin liquids6, or excitonic insulators7. Two-dimensional (2D) moir\'e superlattices have emerged as a powerful platform for exploring such correlated phases and their associated collective excitations8,9. Specifically, electron crystals stabilized by longrange Coulomb interactions may host collective vibrational excitations emerging from electron correlations10, termed electronic phonons, which are fundamentally distinct from atomic lattice phonons. Despite theoretical prediction of their existence in moir\'e electron crystals11, direct experimental evidence has remained elusive. Here we report the observation of electronic phonons in the Mott insulating and stripe phases of a WS2/WSe2 moir\'e superlattice, achieved through light scattering measurements. The phonon energies, temperature and filling factor dependencies, along with theoretical modeling, corroborate their origin as collective vibrations of a correlated electron crystal. Polarization-resolved measurements further indicate rotational symmetry breaking in the Mott state. Notably, these electronic phonons exhibit strong tunability in energy, intensity, and polarization under external electric or magnetic fields, highlighting rich and controllable lattice dynamics of the electron crystal. These findings provide direct spectroscopic evidence for the electronic crystalline nature of correlated phases, opening avenues for probing and manipulating collective excitations in correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>Momentum-resolved spectral functions of super-moir\'e systems using tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18397v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing spectral functions in large, non-periodic super-moir\'e systems remains an open problem due to the exceptionally large system size that must be considered. Here, we establish a tensor network methodology that allows computing momentum-resolved spectral functions of non-interacting and interacting super-moir\'e systems at an atomistic level. Our methodology relies on encoding an exponentially large tight-binding problem as an auxiliary quantum many-body problem, solved with a many-body kernel polynomial tensor network algorithm combined with a quantum Fourier transform tensor network. We demonstrate the method for one and two-dimensional super-moir\'e systems, including super-moir\'e with non-uniform strain, interactions treated at the mean-field level, and quasicrystalline super-moir\'e patterns. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our methodology allows us to compute momentum-resolved spectral functions restricted to selected regions of a super-moir\'e, enabling direct imaging of position-dependent electronic structure and minigaps in super-moir\'e systems with non-uniform strain. Our results establish a powerful methodology to compute momentum-resolved spectral functions in exceptionally large super-moir\'e systems, providing a tool to directly model scanning twisting microscope tunneling experiments in twisted van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Topological edge states in two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_4$ Potts paramagnet protected by the $\mathbb{Z}_4^{\times 3}$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a two-dimensional bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) paramagnet protected by an on-site $G=\mathbb{Z}_4^{\times 3}$ symmetry, starting from a three-component $\mathbb{Z}_4$ Potts paramagnet on a triangular lattice. Within the group-cohomology framework, $H^{3}(G,U(1))\cong \mathbb{Z}_4^{\times 7}$, we focus on a "colorless" cocycle representative obtained by antisymmetrizing the basic $\mathbb{Z}_4$ three-cocycle, and generate the corresponding SPT Hamiltonian via a cocycle-induced nonlocal unitary transformation followed by symmetry averaging. For open geometry, we derive the boundary theory explicitly: one color sector decouples, while the nontrivial edge reduces to an interacting $\mathbb{Z}_4$ chain with next-to-nearest-neighbor constraints that admits a compact dressed-Potts form. Using DMRG we show that the boundary model is gapless, with the lowest gap scaling as $1/L$ and an entanglement-entropy scaling consistent with a conformal field theory of central charge $c=2.191(4)\simeq 11/5$. The rational value $c=11/5$ matches the coset $SU(3)_3/SU(2)_3$, making it a candidate for the continuum description of the $\mathbb{Z}_4^{\times 3}$ edge; we outline spectral and symmetry-resolved diagnostics needed to test this identification at the level of conformal towers beyond the central charge.</description>

      <title>Evolution of charge-density-wave soft phonon modes in $\mathrm{Pd}_x\mathrm{ErTe}_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the lattice dynamics of quasi-two-dimensional Pd-intercalated $\mathrm{ErTe}_3$ in relation to its charge-density-wave (CDW) transitions by means of x-ray diffuse and meV-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering. In pristine $\mathrm{ErTe}_3$, CDW order develops at orthogonal in-plane wave vectors $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{q}}_{1}^{c} = (0, 0, 0.29)$ (the $c\text{-}\mathrm{CDW}$) and $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{q}}_{2}^{a} = (0.31, 0, 0)$ (the $a\text{-}\mathrm{CDW}$), with transition temperatures $T_{1}^{c} = 270$~K and $T_{2}^{a} = 160$~K, respectively. Remarkably, we observe diffuse x-ray scattering already near the higher transition temperature $T_{1}^{c}$ along $a\text{-}\mathrm{CDW}$ but at a slightly different wave vector $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{q}}_{1}^{a} = (0.29, 0, 0)$. Inelastic x-ray scattering for $\mathrm{Pd}_{0.01}\mathrm{ErTe}_3$ shows that a partial phonon softening at $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{q}}_{1}^{a}$, underscoring the strong competition between ordering tendencies along the nearly equivalent in-plane axes of the orthorhombic lattice. For intercalation levels $x \geq 0.02$, the $a\text{-}\mathrm{CDW}$ state is suppressed. Nevertheless, a similar correlation between phonon softening and diffuse scattering persists along the $[100]$ direction, again observed at $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{q}}_{1}^{a} = (0.29, 0, 0)$ and $T_{1}^{c}$. These findings confirm that the $a\text{-}\mathrm{CDW}$ is fully suppressed for $x \geq 0.02$, and that the residual diffuse scattering at $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{q}}_{1}^{a}$ originates from the partial phonon softening associated with the $c\text{-}\mathrm{CDW}$, reflected by the near equality of the absolute size of $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{q}}_{1}^{c}$ and $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{q}}_{1}^{a}$. In highly intercalated $\mathrm{Pd}_{0.023}\mathrm{ErTe}_3$, the phonon softening remains incomplete, possibly linked to the recently reported CDW Bragg glass state.</description>

Abstract: In our comment we show that some of the very difficult problems have been successfully solved. We have to focus on the resolved problems, since the authors claims: Our hope, however, is that the topics we have presented will provide inspiration for others working in this field and motivation for the idea that significant progress can be made on very hard problems if we focus our collective energies. Thus, there is no need to mislead potential researchers.</description>

      <title>Global approximations to correlation functions of strongly interacting quantum field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a method for constructing global approximations to correlation functions of strongly interacting quantum field theories, starting from perturbative results. The key idea is to employ interpolation method, such as the two-point Pad\'e expansion, to interpolate the weak and strong coupling expansions of correlation function. We benchmark this many-body interpolation approach on two prototypical models: the lattice $\phi^4$ field theory and the 2D Hubbard model. For the $\phi^4$ theory, the resulting two point Pad\'e approximants exhibit uniform and global convergence to the exact correlation function. For the Hubbard model, we show that even at second order, the Pad\'e appproximant already provides reasonable characterization of the Matsubara Green's function for a wide range of parameters. Finally, we offer a heuristic explanation for these convergence properties based on analytic function theory.</description>

      <title>Spiral states, first-order transitions and specific heat multipeak phenomenon in $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ model: A Wang-Landau algorithm study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Ising model on the honeycomb lattice is important for understanding frustrated magnetic phenomena in materials such as $FePS_3$ and $Ba_2CoTeO_6$, where diverse phases (e.g., striped, zigzag, armchair) and magnetization plateaus have been experimentally observed. To explain the experimental results, previous mean-field studies have explored its thermal phase transitions, identifying armchair phases and striped phases, but their limitations call for more reliable numerical investigations. In this work, we systematically revisit the classical $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Ising model using the Wang-Landau algorithm. We find that the armchair (AC) phase, previously reported in mean-field and experimental studies, actually coexists with the spiral (SP) phase, with their combined degeneracy reaching 20-fold (4-fold for the AC states and 16-fold for the spiral states). The phase transitions and critical exponents are studied at different interaction values. We observe first-order phase transitions, continuous phase transitions, and even the multipeak phenomenon, i.e., Schottky-like specific-heat anomalies in frustrated systems. These results clarify the nature of phases and phase transitions in frustrated Ising systems and their exponents, and additionally provide inspiration for experimental efforts to search for the spiral state and Schottky-like anomalies.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Convergent Sequence of Approximations (of Integral Equation Form) to the Solutions of the Hedin Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many ways the solution to the Hedin equations represents an exact solution to the many body problem. However, for most systems of practical interest, the solution to the Hedin equations is rendered nearly numerically intractable because the Hedin equations are of functional derivative form. Integral equations are much more numerically tractable, than functional derivative equations, as they can often be solved iteratively. In this work we present a systematic set of integral equations (with no functional derivatives) - Hedin approximations I, II, III, IV etc. - whose solutions converge to the solutions of the exact Hedin equations. The Hedin approximations are well suited to iterative numerical solutions (which we also describe). Furthermore Hedin approximation I is just the GW approximation (as such this work may be viewed as a systematic improvement of the GW approximation). We present a systematic study of the Hedin equations for zero dimensional field theory (which, in particular, is a method to enumerate Feynman diagrams for field theories in arbitrary dimensions) and show better and better convergence to the solutions of the Hedin equations for higher and higher Hedin approximations, with Hedin approximations I, II and III being explicitly studied. We, in particular, show that the higher Hedin approximations capture more and and more Feynman diagrams for the self energy. We also show that already Hedin approximation II captures more diagrams than the state of the art diagrammatic vertex corrections approach. Furthermore Hedin approximation III is a near perfect match to the exact solutions of the Hedin equations, at least in the zero dimensional case, and enumerates a large number of Feynman diagrams.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Spectral Function of the Kagome Quantum Spin Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) host exotic fractionalized magnetic and gauge-field excitations whose microscopic origins and experimental verification remain frustratingly elusive. In the absence of static magnetic order, the spin excitation spectrum constitutes the crucial probe of QSL behavior, but its theoretical computation remains a serious challenge. Here we employ state-of-the-art tensor-network methods to obtain the full dynamical spectral function of the $J_1$-$J_2$ kagome Heisenberg model and benchmark our results by tracking their evolution across the magnetically ordered and QSL phases. Reducing $|J_2|/J_1$ causes increasingly strong spin-wave renormalization, flattening these modes then merging them into a continuum characteristic of deconfined spinons at all finite energies in the QSL. The low-energy continuum and the occurrence of gap closure at multiple high-symmetry points identify this gapless QSL as the U(1) Dirac spin liquid. These results establish a unified understanding of spin excitations in highly frustrated quantum magnets and provide clear spectral fingerprints for experimental detection in candidate kagome QSL materials.</description>

      <title>Field-induced anomaly in the anisotropic non-Fermi-liquid normal state of UBe$_{13}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the results of high-resolution dc magnetization and specific-heat measurements at very low temperatures for
  a single crystal \color{black} of UBe$_{13}$ in magnetic fields applied along the [001] and [111] directions, in both the normal and superconducting states. In the normal state, magnetic susceptibility $\chi(T) = M/H$ exhibits a logarithmic temperature dependence over a wide temperature range (1-20 K). However, with increasing field, this non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) behavior of $\chi(T) $ at low temperatures is suppressed. Moreover, a susceptibility maximum occurs below 4 T, whereas Fermi-liquid coherence is recovered above 8 T. In addition, thermodynamic anomalies ($T_{\rm A}$ and $H_{\rm A}$) occur in both magnetic susceptibility and specific heat at intermediate fields (6--10 T) along the [111] direction. Furthermore, a nontrivial fifth-order nonlinear susceptibility is observed in the normal-state magnetization of UBe$_{13}$. These results suggest a close relationship between the field-induced multipolar correlations of $5f$-electron degrees of freedom and the Fermi-surface reconstruction accompanying the crossover from the NFL state to the Fermi-liquid state in UBe$_{13}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum decay of magnons in the unfrustrated honeycomb Heisenberg model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the physical properties of elementary magnon excitations of the ordered antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice using quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, series expansions (SE), and continuous similarity transformations (CST). The stochastic analytic continuation method is used to determine the dynamic structure factor from correlation functions in imaginary time obtained by QMC. In contrast to the "roton minimum" of the square lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, we find that magnons on the honeycomb lattice completely decay in the corner of the Brillouin zone ($K$-point); the entire weight is shifted into the continuum. These findings are fully supported by SE and CST in momentum space. The extrapolated one-magnon dispersion obtained from SE about the Ising limit quantitatively agrees with the extracted QMC excitation energies except around the $K$-point, where large uncertainties in the extrapolation indicate the magnon decay. This quantum decay is further confirmed and understood by the CST, which yields a divergent flow when enforcing a magnon quasi-particle picture. The divergence originates from strong attractive magnon-magnon interactions leading to a bound state and thereby to a three-magnon continuum overlapping with the one-magnon state. This has the magnon quasi-particle picture break down at high energies on the honeycomb lattice.</description>

      <title>Quantum Altermagnetic Instability in Disordered Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility of a zero temperature, altermagnetic instability in anisotropic two dimensional electron systems in the diffusive regime is analyzed, in the presence and absence of spin-orbit coupling. Allowing for ferromagnetism, a phase diagram is built as a function of the parameter that controls anisotropy and the strength of the interactions. It is found that, at zero spin orbit coupling, ferromagnetism only dominates at small values of anisotropy and coupling constant. Larger values of these parameters favour the formation of altermagnetism. At finite spin-orbit coupling, a paramagnetic phase competes with the other two, and a quantum critical point appears. The phase transition from the paramagnetic to the magnetically ordered phases is of second order, while the phase transition between ferromagnet and altermagnet states is first order. The altermagnetic phase is robust under small magnetic fields, displaying a coexistence with a field-induced magnetization.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Hall effect in hysteretic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement of the Hall effect is a ubiquitous probe for materials discovery, characterization, and metrology. Inherent to the Hall measurement geometry, the measured signal is often contaminated by unwanted contributions, so the data must be processed to isolate the Hall response. The standard approach invokes Onsager-Casimir reciprocity and antisymmetrizes the raw signal about zero applied magnetic field. In hysteretic materials this becomes nontrivial, since Onsager-Casimir relations apply only to microscopically reversible states. Incorrect antisymmetrization can lead to artifacts that mimic anomalous or topological Hall signatures. The situation is especially subtle when hysteresis loops are not centered at zero applied field, as in exchange-biased systems. A practical reference for generically extracting the Hall response in hysteretic materials is lacking. Here, using Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ as a bulk single-crystal model that can be prepared with or without exchange-biased hysteresis, we demonstrate two procedures that can be used to extract the Hall effect: (1) reverse-magnetic-field reciprocity and (2) antisymmetrization with respect to applied field. We then measure the Hall effect on CeCoGe$_3$, a noncentrosymmetric antiferromagnet which can be prepared to have asymmetric magnetization and magnetoresistance, and demonstrate how improper processing can generate artificial anomalous Hall signals. These methods are generic and can be applied to any conductor.</description>

      <title>Towards a universal phase diagram of planar chiral magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In planar chiral magnets, the competition of the positive definite Heisenberg exchange and Zeeman energies with the indefinite Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) energy allows for the possibility of negative energy ground states, and leads to an intricate dependence of the ground states on the parameters of the theory. In this paper, we consider arbitrary spiralization tensors for the DMI interaction and arbitrary directions for the external magnetic field, and study the nature of the ground states in this parameter space, using a combination of analytical and numerical methods. Classifying ground states by their symmetry into ferromagnetic (invariant under under arbitrary translations in the plane), spiral (invariant under arbitrary translations in one direction) and skyrmion lattice ground states (invariant under a two dimensional lattice group), we give a complete description of the phase diagram of this class of theories.</description>

      <title>Kitaev interactions of the spin-orbit coupled magnet UO2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uranium dioxide, UO$_2$, is a canonical example of a magnetic material with strong spin-orbit coupling. Here, we present a study of the magnetic diffuse scattering measured on a polycrystalline sample of UO$_2$, which we interpret in terms of its magnetic interactions between U$^{4+}$ magnetic moments. By refining values of the magnetic interaction parameters to magnetic diffuse-scattering data measured above the magnetic ordering transition temperature, we show that the dominant magnetic coupling in UO$_2$ is a bond-dependent interaction analogous to the Kitaev model of honeycomb magnets. We compare our experimental results with published theoretical predictions and experimental measurements of the magnetic excitation spectrum. Our results suggest that magnetic materials with $f$-electron magnetic ions, particularly actinides, may be promising candidates for realising Kitaev magnetism, and highlight the role that magnetic diffuse-scattering data can play in identifying such materials.</description>

      <title>2D coherent spectroscopy signatures of exciton condensation in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the nonlinear optical response probed by two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) can discriminate between excitonic and lattice driven order. In the excitonic regime of a realistic model of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$, the third order 2DCS signals are strongly enhanced by the condensate's amplitude and phase modes, with negligible contributions from single-particle excitations. In the linear optical response, in contrast, single-particle and collective-mode contributions overlap. With increasing electron-phonon coupling, the amplitude mode contribution to 2DCS initially remains robust, but then drops rapidly and remains small in the phonon-dominated regime -- even in systems with large order parameter. 2DCS also aids the detection of the massive relative phase mode, which is analogous to the Leggett mode in superconductors. Our analysis, based on the time-dependent Hartree-Fock approach, demonstrates that 2DCS can track the emergence of the symmetry-broken state and the crossover from Coulomb-driven to phonon-driven order.</description>

      <title>Net Magnetization and Inhomogeneous Magnetic Order in a High-Tc Nickelate Superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-temperature and high-magnetic-field-induced re-entrant superconductivity has been discovered in the infinite-layer nickelate $\mathrm{Sm_{1-x-y} Eu_x Ca_y Ni O_2}$ (SECNO). Infinite-layer nickelates are the closest known analogues of high-$\mathrm{T}_c$ cuprate superconductors, yet they host distinct magnetic ground states. Using low-energy muon spin relaxation and polarized neutron reflectometry, we reveal the magnetic order in SECNO. We find that magnetic freezing occurs at a higher-temperature than in other nickelate compounds, and that a substantial net magnetization of 55 $\,\mathrm{kA}\,\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ $\pm10 \,\mathrm{kA}\,\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ emerges and remains largely unchanged across the superconducting transition. The magnetism in SECNO is disordered and nonuniform.</description>

      <title>Observation of square-like moire lattice and quasicrystalline order in twisted rock-salt nitrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twistronics, which exploits moire modulation of lattice and electronic structures in twisted bilayers, has emerged as a powerful approach to engineer novel quantum states. Recent efforts have expanded beyond two dimensional van der Waals (vdWs) crystals to more complex, strongly correlated materials, where interfacial moire effects can dominate physical properties. Here we demonstrate a generalizable route to fabricate twisted bilayers of transition metal nitrides with vdWs like interfaces, using freestanding CrN membranes as a model system. Twisted bilayer CrN (tCrN) is realized by employing cubic alkaline earth metal monoxides as sacrificial layers, enabling the assembly of clean, controllable interfaces. Electron ptychography reveals well defined, periodic square moire superlattices in tCrN. For a twist angle of 16.3 degree, we identify a nearly commensurate moire lattice with coincident Cr columns, whereas at 45 degree we uncover localized octagonal quasicrystalline order with clear self-similarity. These results establish a practical platform for twisted TMNs and open avenues to explore moire-induced atomic configurations and emergent correlated phenomena in nitride based heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Unusual strain relaxation and Dirac semimetallic behavior in epitaxial antiperovskite nitrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiperovskite nitrides (X3AN) are the structural analogues to perovskite oxides, while their epitaxial growth and electronic properties remain largely unexplored. We report the successful synthesis of Ni3InN thin films on substrates with different lattice constants. First-principles phonon calculations confirm the dynamical stability of cubic phase Ni3InN, providing the basis for epitaxial synthesis. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals coherent (001)-oriented interfaces when Ni3InN is grown on LaAlO3 and SrTiO3, while an unexpected (011)-orientation forms on DyScO3, aligning with surface-energy predictions. Transport measurements highlight a strain-controlled Fermi-liquid behavior, correlated with variations in the Ni-3d bandwidth and hybridization. Band structure calculations reveal a dual character near the Fermi level: a high-mobility Dirac-like band and a Ni-3d manifold that drives strange-metal transport with a reduced slope compared to oxide perovskites. The formal Ni valence (+2/3) places Ni3InN in an overdoped correlated-metal regime, distinguishing from most perovskite oxides. This positions antiperovskite nitrides as a promising platform for investigating overdoped Fermi liquids and strange-metal behavior.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking transforms strong to normal correlation and false metals to true insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Material scientists and condensed matter physicists have long been divided on the issue of choosing the conceptual framework for explaining why open-shell transition-metal oxides tend to be insulators, whereas otherwise successful theories such as DFT often predict them to be (false) metals. Strong correlation becomes the recommended medicine. We point out that strong correlation can be mitigated by allowing DFT to lower the energy by breaking structural, magnetic or dipolar symmetries. Such local motifs are observed experimentally by local probes beyond the 'average structure' determined by X-Ray diffraction. Observed broken symmetries can arise from slow fluctuations that persist over the observation time or longer. The surprising fact is that when symmetry breaking motifs are used as input to electronic structure calculations, false metals are converted into real insulators without the recommended medicine of strong correlation. Consistently, DFT calculations that show energy lowering symmetry breaking correct most cases where DFT, even with advanced exchange-correlation functionals, previously missed the correct metal vs insulator designation. Total energy calculations distinguish systems that support energy-lowering symmetry breaking from those that do not. This approach distinguishes between paramagnetic insulating and metallic phases and shows mass enhancement in Mott metals. The reason is that symmetry breaking removes many of the degeneracies that exist in a symmetry-unbroken system, reducing significantly the need for strong correlation. If one chooses to ignore symmetry breaking, the persistent degeneracies often call for strong correlation treatment. Thus, symmetry breaking transforms strong to normal correlation and false metals to true insulators. This view sheds light on the historic controversy between Mott and Slater that still reverberates today.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonequilibrium thermodynamics of interacting quantum many-body systems is investigated within the framework of thermal time-dependent density functional theory using a generalized linear-response formulation for the full quantum work statistics. A first-principles route is established to reconstruct the relaxation function that underlies linear-response theory, thereby moving beyond phenomenological descriptions and enabling a consistent evaluation of all moments of the dissipated-work distribution in interacting systems. The predictive power of the approach is demonstrated for the Hubbard model subject to a staggered external potential, where the evolution of the relaxation dynamics across the Mott-to-band-insulator crossover reveals how distinct many-body phases shape the out-of-equilibrium thermodynamic response. These results provide a microscopic and transferable framework for quantum thermodynamics in correlated systems, bridging thermal density functional theory and nonequilibrium work statistics.</description>

      <title>Lattice-decoupled rotatable stripe-like charge order within the strange metal phase of 2M-WS2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum materials, charge orders typically stabilize in specific crystallographic orientations, though their formation mechanisms may vary. Here, using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we discover a lattice-decoupled rotatable stripe-like charge order coexisting with superconductivity in 2M-WS2. The charge order manifests five distinct orientations across different sample regions, yet maintains an identical wavelength. This directional decoupling from host lattice challenges existing paradigms. First-principles calculations of phonon spectra and nesting function fail to explain the ordering mechanism. Intriguingly, the transition temperature of the charge orders exhibits spatial variations (21-46 K), coinciding with the temperature range of the recently reported strange metal phase in this material. This correlation suggests that the interplay between strong electronic correlations and electron-phonon coupling must be critically evaluated to elucidate the emergence of this unconventional charge order.</description>

      <title>Beyond spin-1/2: Multipolar spin-orbit coupling in noncentrosymmetric crystals with time-reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general multipolar theory of strong spin-orbit coupling for large total angular momentum $j$ in time-reversal-symmetric, noncentrosymmetric crystals. Using a $j\in\{1/2,3/2,5/2\}$ multiplet basis appropriate for heavy-element \textit{p}- and \textit{d}-bands, we systematically construct all symmetry-allowed spin-orbit coupling terms up to fifth order in momentum and generalize the usual spin texture to a total-angular-momentum texture. For $j&gt;1/2$, multipolar spin-orbit coupling qualitatively reshapes Fermi surfaces and makes the topology of Bloch states band dependent. This leads to anisotropic high-$j$ textures that go beyond a single Rashba helix. We classify these textures by their total-angular-momentum vorticity $W_{n}$ for every energy band and identify distinct $|W_{n}|=1,2,5$ phases. We show that their crossovers generate enhanced and nonmonotonic current-induced spin-polarization responses, namely the Edelstein effect, upon tuning the chemical potential. Our results provide a symmetry-based framework for analyzing and predicting multipolar spin-orbit coupling, total-angular-momentum textures, and spintronic responses in heavy-element materials without an inversion center.</description>

      <title>Topological Nodal Line and Weyl Magnons in the Non-Coplanar Antiferromagnet MnTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a combination of band representation analysis, inelastic neutron scattering (INS), magneto-Raman spectroscopy measurements, and linear spin wave theory, we establish that the non-coplanar antiferromagnet MnTe$_2$ hosts symmetry-protected topological nodal lines, Weyl points, and a three-fold degeneracy in its magnon band structure. The non-coplanar nature of the antiferromagnetic ordering protects the topological magnon nodal lines that transition into Weyl magnons upon the application of specific symmetry-breaking perturbations using an external magnetic field. Zero-field INS measurements confirm the existence of the topological magnon nodal lines through the pseudo-spin winding of the scattering intensity in angular scans near the nodal lines, indicating the non-trivial topology of the magnon wavefunctions. This work establishes a clear magnonic analog to Weyl electrons, allowing further exploration of topological behavior in bosonic systems, and highlighting the rich interplay between magnetic order and band topology in non-coplanar antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Spin Reorientation Driven Renormalization of Spin-Phonon Coupling in Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-2D van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$, featuring the simultaneous presence of high Curie temperature ($T_\mathrm{C}$ $\sim 270$ K) and a spin-reorientation transition at $T_\mathrm{SR}$ $\sim 110$ K, is a rare system where strong interplay of spin dynamics, lattice vibrations, and electronic structure leads to a wide range of interesting phenomena. Here, we investigate the lattice response of exfoliated Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ nanoflakes using temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy. Polarization-resolved measurements reveal that, while one Raman mode exhibits a purely out-of-plane character, the rest display mixed symmetry, reflecting interlayer vibrational nonuniformity and symmetry-driven mode degeneracies. Below $T_\mathrm{C}$, phonons harden, and the linewidth narrows, consistent with reduced anharmonicity, while across the spin reorientation transition at $T_\mathrm{SR}$ they display anomalous softening, linewidth broadening, and a peak in lifetime, which are signatures of strengthened spin-phonon coupling. Complementary DFT+DMFT calculations and atomistic spin dynamical simulations reveal temperature-dependent spin excitations whose energies overlap with the Raman-active phonons, providing a natural route for the observed magnon-phonon interaction. Together, these insights establish Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ as a versatile platform for exploring intertwined spin, lattice, and electronic degrees of freedom, with relevance for dynamic spintronic and magneto-optic functionalities near technologically meaningful temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-shell nanographenes offer a controlled setting to study correlated magnetism emerging from $\pi$-electron systems. We analyze oligo(indenoindene) molecules, non-bipartite carbon ladders whose tight-binding spectra feature a gapped, weakly dispersing manifold of quasi-zero modes, and show that their low-energy properties can be effectively mapped onto an interacting set of spin-1/2 degrees of freedom. Using Density Matrix Renormalization Group simulations of the full Fermi-Hubbard model, we obtain their excitation spectra, entanglement profiles, and spin-spin correlations. We then construct optimized delocalized fermionic modes that act as emergent spins and show that their interactions are well described by a frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg chain. This effective description clarifies how spin degrees of freedom arise and interact in non-bipartite nanographene ladders, providing a compact and accurate representation of their correlated behavior.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Dynamics by (Non-)Unitary Local Operator Quenches in a 2D Holographic CFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the time evolution of entanglement entropy and mutual information for the spatially-infinite systems where we act with a primary operator on the vacuum state and then time-evolve it with the sequence of the Euclidean and Lorentzian time evolutions. Two-dimensional holographic conformal field theories describe the systems under consideration in this paper. The Euclidean time evolution is induced by the Rindler Hamiltonian and behaves as the regulator that tames the divergence induced by the local operator, while the Lorentzian one is induced by the uniform Hamiltonian. Under these time evolutions, we investigate the time ordering effect of the Rindler Euclidean and uniform Lorentzian time evolution operators. Consequently, we find the remarkable differences between those time evolutions are induced by whether those are unitary or non-unitary. Especially, we find that the unitary time evolution induces the late-time logarithmic growth of the entanglement entropy, while the non-unitary time evolution induces the late-time constant behavior. Furthermore, we investigate the dual gravity of the systems under consideration. Especially, we investigate the gravity duals of the systems with the insertion of the heavy primary operator and show that it is a black brane with a spacetime-dependent horizon.</description>

      <title>Near-extremal hydrodynamics and the holographic product formula</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The holographic product formula is used to determine the general form taken by holographic spectral functions in the near-extremal hydrodynamic regime, with energy $\omega$, momentum $k$ and temperature $T$ much smaller than a hard scale $\mu$. The resulting expressions simplify in the extremal limit $T \ll \omega,k\ll \mu$, for which the low-temperature gapless modes and the IR conformal behavior factorize. In some cases, this factorization extends to the general near-extremal regime $\omega,k,T\ll\mu$ at leading order in $T/\mu$. Several examples are discussed with different types of gapless modes and IR CFTs, including new numerical results for low temperature quasi-normal modes. We end with a concrete application that shows how the inclusion of the IR conformal behavior improves the description of the spectral function at low energies.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in Electron Liquids: Precision Many-Body Treatment of Coulomb Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: More than a century after discovery, the theory of conventional superconductivity remains incomplete. While the importance of electron-phonon coupling is understood, a controlled first-principles treatment of Coulomb interaction is lacking. Current ab initio calculations of superconductivity rely on a phenomenological downfolding approximation, replacing Coulomb interaction with a repulsive pseudopotential \mu*, and leaving ambiguities in electron-phonon coupling with dynamical Coulomb interactions unresolved. We address this via an effective field theory approach, integrating out high-energy electronic degrees of freedom using variational Diagrammatic Monte Carlo. Applied to the uniform electron gas, this establishes a microscopic procedure to implement downfolding, define the pseudopotential, and express dynamical Coulomb effects on electron-phonon coupling via the electron vertex function. We find the bare pseudopotential significantly larger than conventional values. This yields improved pseudopotential estimates in simple metals and tests density functional perturbation theory accuracy for effective electron-phonon coupling. We present an ab initio workflow computing superconducting Tc from the anomalous vertex's precursory Cooper flow. This infers Tc from normal state calculations, enabling reliable estimates of very low Tc (including near quantum phase transitions) beyond conventional reach. Validating our approach on simple metals without empirical tuning, we resolve long-standing discrepancies and predict a pressure-induced transition in Al from superconducting to non-superconducting above ~60GPa. We propose ambient-pressure Mg and Na are proximal to a similar critical point. Our work establishes a controlled ab initio framework for electron-phonon superconductivity beyond the weak-correlation limit, paving the way for reliable Tc calculations and novel material design.</description>

      <title>Anomalous lattice specific heat and rattling phonon modes in quadruple perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental data on the specific heat $C_p$ of quadruple perovskites ACu$_3$Fe$_2$Re$_2$O$_{12}$ (A = Mn, Cu, La, Ce, Dy) are presented, demonstrating an anomalous concave-down $C_p/T$ vs. $T^2$ curve and a bell-shaped feature in $\beta(T) = (C_p - \gamma T)/T^3$ plotted against $T$ on a logarithmic scale. This feature is most pronounced for A = Cu and Mn. These findings can be explained by the rattling phenomenon, previously identified in other systems such as filled skutterudites and $\beta$-pyrochlores. Using first-principles DFT+U calculations, the presence of a rattling mode in A = Mn system is directly confirmed. A qualitative interpretation of the rattling mechanism in terms of a pseudo-Jahn-Teller effect is proposed.</description>

      <title>Quantum critical theories in a periodic potential: strange metallic thermoelectric and magneto-transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study DC and AC thermoelectric and magneto-transport in 2D quantum critical theories with strong translational symmetry breaking due to a % varying chemical potential lattice with zero average $\bar{\mu}=0$. The combination of quantum criticality and the absence of the average natural scale implies that such systems have idiosyncratic signatures that may apply more generally when the variance in the lattice potential far exceeds the average or for strong translational symmetry breaking in general. We model such theories holographically through near-extremal AdS black holes. We find that these systems (a) become \emph{better} conductors. In a 2D lattice, this can be explained by currents flowing around obstacles; (b) exhibit bad-metal electrical transport with Drude-like thermal transport, though it is not Drude, and, notably, (c) display an approximately $B$-linear longitudinal magnetoresistance at large fields, similar to Effective Medium Theory. We comment on how these results may apply when $\bar{\mu}\neq 0$.</description>

      <title>Harnessing non-Hermiticity for efficient quantum state transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian Hamiltonian describes the effective dynamics of a system coupled to a continuously measured bath, and can exhibit anti-unitary symmetries that give rise to exceptional points and broken phases with complex eigenvalues, features unique to non-Hermitian systems. Going beyond conventional Hermitian physics, we analyze the impact of non-Hermiticity in the quantum state transmission by employing a non-Hermitian spin chain that functions as a quantum data bus. By deriving a general expression for the fidelity of quantum state transfer for a U(1)-symmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we analyze PT-symmetric XX and SSH models, complemented by a numerical study of the RT-symmetric iXY model. We demonstrate that, in several parameter regimes, the transfer fidelity in the non-Hermitian setting exceeds the classical threshold and can even exceed the performance of the corresponding Hermitian models. In particular, for the SSH model with dominant inter-cell coupling, the broken phase supports near-unit-fidelity quantum state transfer, a level of performance that the corresponding Hermitian model fails to attain. Moreover, we establish a correspondence between the non-Hermitian and Hermitian descriptions by identifying related parameter regions in which the fidelity fails to surpass the classical bound.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced splitting of the CCDW-NCCDW phase transition in 1T-TaS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effects of uniaxial and biaxial tensile strain on the $\rho_{xx}$ and $\rho_{yy}$ components of the resistivity tensor, and the commensurable-nearly commensurate CDW (CCDW-NCCDW) transition temperature in 1T-TaS$_2$ are studied. At room temperature, uniaxial tensile strain increases the resistivity tensor components by a comparable magnitude both parallel and perpendicular to the strain axis. In the case of biaxial strain, up to 20~K decrease in the CCDW-NCCDW phase transition temperature is observed. In the case of uniaxial strain, a new phase with two different CCDW-NCCDW phase transition temperatures is observed, the splitting exceeds 10 K. The occurrence of such a phase is associated with the transition of the CDW into the commensurate state along the tensile strain direction while maintaining nearly commensurability along the perpendicular one. The results allow to justify various models widely used in analysis of transport properties of 1T-TaS$_2$ in commensurate and nearly commensurate states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we elaborate on and develop the geometrical approach introduced in K. Le Hur, Physics Reports 1104 1-42 (2025) between the magnetic monopole created from a radial field, quantum physics and topological lattice models through quantum phase transitions. We introduce an effective magnetic moment for a monopole when applying an additional source field along z-direction which also mediates the quantum phase transition. We present its relation with the transverse pumped quantum Hall current. The magnetic susceptibility can be introduced as a measure of the topological invariant i.e. remains quantized within the topological phase until the transition. We show the relation with two-dimensional topological lattice models such as a honeycomb Haldane model in real space. We develop the theory and present a numerical analysis between local invariants in momentum space introduced from Dirac points, correlation functions and the responses to circularly polarized light. We develop the formalism for coupled-planes materials including the possibility of quantum spin Hall effect and address a relation between the Ramanujan infinite alternating series and an interface in real space with a topological number one-half.</description>

      <title>Compressive Strain Turns $s^{\pm}$ into $d$-Wave Pairing in One-unit-cell La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ Thin Film Via Substrate-Induced Hole Doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent reports of ambient-pressure superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films grown on LaSrAlO$_4$, we investigate the superconducting instability in a one-unit cell thin film using {\it ab initio} and random-phase approximation techniques. Compared to the high-pressure bulk system, the ratio of inter-layer $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ hopping to intra-layer $d_{x^2-y^2}$ hopping is suppressed in the 1UC thin film, and the crystal-field splitting of the $e_g$ orbitals is increased. Our calculation indicates that spin-fluctuation-driven pairing correlations are weak for the stoichiometric case at ambient pressure, but increase significantly under hole doping. The leading pairing symmetry is also found to change by hole doping. Specifically, we obtain a leading $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing state at moderate hole doping, followed by a $d_{xy}$ state at higher doping. These states are driven by intra-band spin-fluctuation scattering {\it within} the $\gamma$ hole pocket centered around the M point, and arise primarily from states in the Ni layer {\it farther} from the substrate. These results strongly suggest that the thin-film superconducting samples are hole-doped and that pairing in this system predominantly arises in the layer, as opposed to the inter-layer pairing in the pressurized bulk system.</description>

Abstract: We study boundary critical behavior at the Nishimori multicritical point of the two-dimensional (2D) random-bond Ising model. Using tensor-network methods, we realize a one-parameter family of microscopic boundary conditions by continuously rotating the boundary-spin orientation and find two conformal boundary fixed points that correspond to the free and fixed boundaries. We extract conformal data, including the boundary entropies and the scaling dimensions of boundary primary operators, which characterize the boundary universality class. We further demonstrate that the free boundary fixed point exhibits multifractal scaling of boundary spin fields. Finally, we complement our numerical results with a renormalization group analysis and discuss a systematic bridge between the controlled $6-\epsilon$ expansion and the 2D tensor network numerics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological quantum matter represents a flexible playground to engineer unconventional excitations. While non-interacting topological single-particle systems have been studied in detail, topology in quantum many-body systems remains an open problem. Specifically, in the quantum many-body limit, one of the challenges lies in the computational complexity of obtaining the many-body ground state and its many-body topological invariant. While algorithms to compute ground states with quantum computers have been heavily investigated, algorithms to compute topological invariants in a quantum computer are still under active development. Here we demonstrate a quantum circuit to compute the many-body topological invariant of a second-order topological quantum magnet encoded in qubits. Our algorithm relies on a quantum circuit adiabatic evolution in transverse paths in parameter space, and we uncover hidden topological invariants depending on the traversed path. Our work puts forward an algorithm to leverage quantum computers to characterize many-body topological quantum matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the semiclassical limit of thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz equations naturally reconstructs the algebro-geometric spectra of finite-gap periodic potentials. This correspondence is illustrated using the traveling-wave (snoidal) solution of the defocusing modified Korteweg--de Vries equation. In this framework, the Bethe-root distribution of the associated quantum field theory yields an Abelian differential of the second kind on the elliptic Riemann surface specified by the spectral endpoints, a structure central to the algebro-geometric theory of solitons. The semiclassical parameter is identified with the large-rank limit of the internal symmetry group ($O(2N)$) of the underlying quantum field theory (the Gross-Neveu model with a chemical potential). Our analysis indicates that the analytic structure of the spectrum is dictated solely by the Dynkin diagram ($D_N$) and its large-rank limit ($D_\infty$), independently of the particular integrable model used to realize it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a Euclidean quantum field theory of two interacting real scalar fields in $D=4-\epsilon$ dimensions with the most general two--derivative but Lorentz--violating quadratic structure, allowing anisotropic spatial gradients and field--mixing time and cross--gradient terms, together with general cubic and quartic interactions. Although Lorentz violation is introduced only through the kinetic sector, the renormalization structure is nontrivial: interactions generate additional couplings, including masses and linear terms, so a consistent renormalization--group analysis cannot be formulated in terms of modified kinetic terms alone and requires an RG--complete operator basis compatible with the reduced symmetry.
  We perform a systematic one--loop renormalization and derive the complete set of beta functions for cubic and quartic couplings, masses, and linear terms. We identify and analyze the resulting fixed points and fixed manifolds, showing in particular how anisotropy restricts their existence and stability. In particular we obtain how anisotropy restricts existence of canonical Wilson-Fisher fixed point. Also we provide a transparent physical interpretation of the anisotropy--dependent coefficients appearing in the beta functions and clarify how kinetic mixing reshapes the interaction flow through the available ultraviolet phase space.</description>

Abstract: The weak Mott insulating regime of the triangular lattice Hubbard model exhibits a rich magnetic phase diagram as a result of the ring exchange interaction in the spin Hamiltonian. These phases include the Kalmeyer-Laughlin type chiral spin liquid (CSL) and a valence bond solid (VBS). A natural question arises regarding the robustness of these phases in the presence of a weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC). In this study, we derive the effective spin model for the spin-orbit coupled triangular lattice Hubbard model in the weak Mott insulting regime, including all SOC-mediated spin-bilinears and ring-exchange interactions. We then construct a simplified spin model keeping only the most relevant SOC-mediated spin interactions. Using infinite density matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) we show that the CSL and VBS phases of the triangular lattice Hubbard model can be stabilized in the presence of a weak SOC. The stabilization results from a compensation between the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and a SOC-mediated ring exchange interaction. We also provide additional qualitative arguments to intuitively understand the compensation mechanism in the iDMRG quantum phase diagrams. This mechanism for stabilization can potentially be useful for the experimental realization of quantum spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Loop Algorithm for Quantum Transverse Ising Model in a Longitudinal Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum transverse Ising model and its extensions play a critical role in various fields, such as statistical physics, quantum magnetism, quantum simulations, and mathematical physics. Although it does not suffer from the sign problem in most cases, the corresponding quantum Monte Carlo algorithm performs inefficiently, especially at a large longitudinal field. The main hindrance is the lack of loop update method which can strongly decrease the auto-correlation between Monte Carlo steps. Here, we successfully develop a loop algorithm with a novel merge-unmerge process. It demonstrates a great advantage over the state-of-the-art algorithm when implementing it to simulate the Rydberg atom chain and Kagome qubit ice. This advanced algorithm suits various systems such as Rydberg atom arrays, trapped ions, quantum materials, and quantum annealers.</description>

      <title>First-principles study of KCoF$_3$: Jahn-Teller effect, dynamical magnetic charges, magnetoelectric multipoles and antimagnetoelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study from \textit{ab~initio} density functional theory calculations the structural and magnetic properties of the crystal KCoF$_3$. We found that the experimentally reported cubic to tetragonal phase transition is due to an electronic first-order Jahn-Teller effect from the R zone boundary point. We also obtain that the magnetic ground state is the G-type antiferromagnetic order, in agreement with the R-point Jahn-Teller distortion and that the magnetic moment of the Co atoms contains a strong orbital contribution ($m_L=0.95$ $\mu_B$ in the cubic phase and 0.55 $\mu_B$ in the tetragonal phase). Furthermore, we compute the dynamical magnetic effective charges and show that it is zero by symmetry for the Co and they can reach a value as large as 200 $10^{-2}\mu_{\text{B}}/\text{\r{A}}$ for the apical F anion. This large magnetic effective charge comes from the spin-orbit coupling (50\% of the response is from the orbital moment) contrary to the rare-earth manganites and ferrites with similar order of magnitude but originating from the exchange striction mechanism. The fact that the dynamical magnetic effective charges are non-zero also proves that the tetragonal phase of KCoF$_3$ is antimagnetoelectric with a large magnetic sublattice magnetoelectric response of 210 ps/m per spin-channel. We also discuss the generality of these magnetic effective charges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a dynamical mean-field study of the nonperturbative electronic mechanisms, which may lead to significant enhancements of the electron-phonon coupling in correlated electron systems. Analyzing the effects of electronic correlations on the lowest-order electron-phonon processes, we show that in the proximity of the Mott metal-to-insulator transition of the doped square lattice Hubbard model, where the isothermal charge response becomes particularly large at small momenta, the coupling of electrons to the lattice is strongly increased. This, in turn, induces significant corrections to both the electronic self-energy and phonon-mediated pairing interaction, indicating the possible onset of a strong interplay between lattice and electronic degrees of freedom even for small values of the bare electron-phonon coupling.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory for triple-Q magnetic orders on a hexagonal lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18649v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive Ginzburg-Landau theory describing triple-Q magnetic orders on hexagonal lattices, focusing on $O(N)$ models with $N=2$ and $N=3$. Through systematic analysis of symmetry-allowed terms in the free energy, we establish complete phase diagrams governed by competing interaction parameters. Our theory reveals distinct magnetic configurations including single-Q, double-Q, and triple-Q states, each characterized by unique symmetry breaking patterns and collective excitations. The framework provides fundamental insights into complex magnetic orders recently observed in materials such as Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$, where the interplay between geometric frustration and multiple ordering vectors leads to exotic magnetic states. Our results establish clear connections between microscopic interactions, broken symmetries, and experimentally observable properties, offering a powerful tool for understanding and predicting novel magnetic phases in frustrated magnets.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Insulator and the Extended Falicov--Kimball Model Away from Half-Filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an extended spinless Falicov--Kimball model at an arbitrary doping level, focusing on the range of parameter values where a uniform excitonic insulator is stabilised at half-filling. We compare the properties of possible uniform phases and construct the Hartree--Fock phase diagrams, which include sizeable phase separation regions. It is seen that the excitonic insulator can appear as a component phase in a mixed-phase state in a broad interval of doping levels. In addition, in a certain range of parameter values the excitonic metal (doped excitonic insulator) is identified as the lowest-energy uniform phase. We suggest that this phase, which is unstable with respect to phase separation, may be stabilised when the phase separation is suppressed by the long-range Coulomb interaction. Overall, we find that excitonic correlations can affect the behaviour of the system relatively far away from half-filling.</description>

      <title>Deep Variational Free Energy Calculation of Hydrogen Hugoniot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a deep variational free energy framework to compute the equation of state of hydrogen in the warm dense matter region. This method parameterizes the variational density matrix of hydrogen nuclei and electrons at finite temperature using three deep generative models: a normalizing flow model for the Boltzmann distribution of the classical nuclei, an autoregressive transformer for the distribution of electrons in excited states, and a permutational equivariant flow model for the unitary backflow transformation of electron coordinates in Hartree-Fock states. By jointly optimizing the three neural networks to minimize the variational free energy, we obtain the equation of state and related thermodynamic properties of dense hydrogen for the temperature range where electrons occupy excited states. We compare our results with other theoretical and experimental results on the deuterium Hugoniot curve, aiming to resolve existing discrepancies. Our results bridge the gap between the results obtained by path-integral Monte Carlo calculations at high temperature and ground-state electronic methods at low temperature, thus providing a valuable benchmark for hydrogen in the warm dense matter region.</description>

      <title>Fermi-liquid-like phase driven by next-nearest-neighbor couplings in a lightly doped kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the interplay between charge fluctuation and geometry frustration, the doped kagome-lattice Mott insulator is a fascinating platform to realize exotic quantum states. Through the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculation, we explore the quantum phases of the lightly doped kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model in the presence of the next-nearest-neighbor electron hopping $t_2$ and spin interaction $J_2$. On the $L_y = 3$ cylinder ($L_y$ is the number of unit cells along the circumference direction), we establish a quantum phase diagram with tuning $t_2 &gt; 0$ and $J_2 &gt; 0$, showing an emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase driven by increased $t_2$ and $J_2$, which sits at the neighbor of the previously identified charge density wave (CDW) phase. Compared with the CDW phase, the charge order is significantly suppressed in the Fermi-liquid-like phase, and most correlation functions are greatly enhanced with power-law decay. In particular, we find the absence of hole pairing and a strong three-sublattice magnetic correlation. On the wider $L_y = 4$ cylinder, this Fermi-liquid-like phase persists at low doping levels, strongly suggesting that this state might be stable in the two-dimensional kagome system.</description>

      <title>Fractionalized Fermi liquids and cuprate phase diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20164v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review a theoretical framework for the cuprate superconductors, rooted in a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) description of the intermediate-temperature pseudogap phase at low doping. The FL* theory predicted hole pockets each of fractional area $p/8$ at hole doping $p$, in contrast to the area $p/4$ in spin density wave theory. Magnetotransport measurements, including observation of the Yamaji angle, show clear evidence of hole pocket quasiparticles which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers, and are consistent with the FL* description.
  The FL* phase of a single-band model is described using a layer construction with a pair of ancilla qubits on each site: the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM). Fluctuations are described by the SU(2) gauge theory of a background spin liquid with critical Dirac spinons. A Monte Carlo study of the thermal SU(2) gauge theory transforms the hole pockets into Fermi arcs in photoemission. One route to confinement of FL* upon lowering temperature yields a $d$-wave superconductor via a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of $h/(2e)$ vortices, with nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles featuring anisotropic velocities and vortices surrounded by charge order halos.
  Increasing doping from the FL* phase in the ALM drives a transition to a conventional Fermi liquid (FL) at large doping, passing through an intermediate strange metal regime. We formulate a theory of the FL*-FL metal-metal transition without a symmetry-breaking order parameter, using a critical quantum `charge' liquid of mobile electrons in the presence of disorder, developed via an extension of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model to two spatial dimensions.
  At low temperatures, and across optimal and over doping, we address the regimes of extended non-Fermi liquid behavior by Griffiths effects near quantum phase transitions in disordered metals.</description>

Abstract: We propose a causality-based divide-and-conquer algorithm for nonequilibrium Green's function calculations with quantics tensor trains. This algorithm enables stable and efficient extensions of the simulated time domain by exploiting the causality of Green's functions. We apply this approach within the framework of nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory to the simulation of quench dynamics in symmetry-broken phases, where long-time simulations are often required to capture slow relaxation dynamics. We demonstrate that our algorithm allows to extend the simulated time domain without a significant increase in the cost of storing the Green's function.</description>

Abstract: We performed field-angle-resolved magnetostriction and thermal-expansion measurements on PrIr$_2$Zn$_{20}$, a cubic non-Kramers compound exhibiting antiferroquadrupolar order below $T_{\rm Q}=0.125$ K. Thermal expansion exhibits two qualitatively different anomalies under magnetic fields applied along the $[001]$ direction, providing experimental support for the existence of an intermediate A phase previously reported. Furthermore, comparison between the experimental results and theoretical modeling indicates a strong anisotropic coupling of the $O_{20}$ quadrupolar moment, which plays a key role in stabilizing the A phase. These findings demonstrate that multipolar states in non-Kramers systems can be effectively tuned by magnetic-field orientation, providing insights into the anisotropic nature of quadrupolar interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent experimental observations of high temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate have attracted lots of attentions. Previous studies have assumed a mirror symmetry $\mathcal M$ between the two layers and focused on uniform and clean superconducting states. Here, we show that breaking this mirror symmetry via an applied displacement field can stabilize a pair-density-wave (PDW) superconductor, which is similar to the Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, but at zero magnetic field. Based on a mean-field analysis of a model of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital with an effective inter-layer attraction, we demonstrate that the PDW phase is robust over a wide range of displacement field, interlayer hopping strengths, and electron fillings. Finally, we analyze disorder effects on interlayer superconductivity within the first Born approximation. Based on symmetry considerations, we show that pairing is weaken by disorders which break the mirror symmetry, even with unbroken time reversal symmetry. Our results establish bilayer nickelate as a tunable platform for realizing finite-momentum pairing and for exploring generalized disorder effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02387v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigating the interplay of dualities, generalized symmetries, and topological defects beyond theoretical models is an important challenge in condensed matter physics and quantum materials. A simple model exhibiting this physics is the transverse-field Ising model, which can host a topological defect that performs the Kramers-Wannier duality transformation. When acting on one point in space, this duality defect imposes the duality twisted boundary condition and binds a single zero mode. This zero mode is unusual as it lacks a localized partner in the same $\mathbb{Z}_2$ sector and has an infinite lifetime, even in finite systems. Using Floquet driving of a closed Ising chain with a duality defect, we generate this zero mode in a digital quantum computer. We detect the mode by measuring its associated persistent autocorrelation function using an efficient sampling protocol and a compound strategy for error mitigation. We also show that the zero mode resides at the domain wall between two regions related by a Kramers-Wannier duality transformation. Finally, we highlight the robustness of the isolated zero mode to integrability- and symmetry-breaking perturbations. Our findings provide a method for exploring exotic topological defects, associated with noninvertible generalized symmetries, in digitized quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Anomaly inflow for CSS and fractonic lattice models and dualities via cluster state measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes are a class of quantum error correction codes that contains the toric code and fracton models. A procedure called foliation defines a cluster state for a given CSS code. We use the CSS chain complex and its tensor product with other chain complexes to describe the topological structure in the foliated cluster state, and argue that it has a symmetry-protected topological order protected by generalized global symmetries supported on cycles in the foliated CSS chain complex. We demonstrate the so-called anomaly inflow between CSS codes and corresponding foliated cluster states by explicitly showing the equality of the gauge transformations of the bulk and boundary partition functions defined as functionals of defect world-volumes. We show that the bulk and boundary defects are related via measurement of the bulk system. Further, we provide a procedure to obtain statistical models associated with general CSS codes via the foliated cluster state, and derive a generalization of the Kramers-Wannier-Wegner duality for such statistical models with insertion of twist defects. We also study the measurement-assisted gauging method with cluster-state entanglers for CSS/fracton models based on recent proposals in the literature, and demonstrate a non-invertible fusion of duality operators. Using the cluster-state entanglers, we construct the so-called strange correlator for general CSS/fracton models. Finally, we introduce a new family of subsystem-symmetric quantum models each of which is self-dual under the generalized Kramers-Wannier-Wegner duality transformation, which becomes a non-invertible symmetry.</description>

Abstract: The algebraic approach to quantum field theory focuses on the properties of local algebras, whereas the study of (possibly non-invertible) global symmetries emphasizes global aspects of the theory and spacetime. We study connections between these two perspectives by examining how either of two core algebraic properties -- "additivity" or "Haag duality" -- is violated in a 1+1D CFT or lattice model restricted to the symmetric sector of a general global symmetry. For the Verlinde symmetry of a bosonic diagonal RCFT, we find that additivity is violated whenever the symmetry algebra contains an invertible element, while Haag duality is violated whenever it contains a non-invertible element. We find similar phenomena for the Kramers-Wannier and Rep(D$_8$) non-invertible symmetries on spin chains.</description>

      <title>Inter-species topological phases via a dynamical gauge field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We uncover a class of inter-species topological phases in a one-dimensional lattice, loaded with two species of non-identical particles interacting via a dynamical gauge field (DGF). Two types of topological states are found to emerge from different inter-species topology activated by the DGF. Specifically, edge confined states with co-localization of both species arise from an extrinsic inter-species topology, which can be decomposed into the single-particle topology for each species. On the other hand, bulk bound states with extended distribution emerge from an intrinsic inter-species topology that cannot be understood from single-particle ones. The two classes of inter-species topology are found to be independent of each other, characterized by different sets of inter-species topological invariants. Thus, their topological states can coexist in certain parameter regimes and compete with each other, leading to distinguished dynamical signatures. We further propose a feasible cold-atom realization of our model to demonstrate experimental accessibility of inter-species topological phases. Our work establishes inter-species topology as a new organizing principle of topological matter, revealing how correlations between distinct particle species can generate topological phenomena beyond single-particle paradigms.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Density Matrix Renormalization Group with Matchgates and Clifford circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matchgates and Clifford circuits are two types of quantum circuits which can be efficiently simulated classically, though the underlying reasons are quite different. Matchgates are essentially the single particle basis transformations in the Majorana fermion representation which can be easily handled classically, while the Clifford circuits can be efficiently simulated using the tableau method according to the Gottesman-Knill theorem. In this work, we propose a new wave-function ansatz in which matrix product states are augmented with the combination of Matchgates and Clifford circuits (dubbed MCA-MPS) to take advantage of the representing power of all of them. Moreover, the optimization of MCA-MPS can be efficiently implemented within the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method. Our benchmark results on one-dimensional hydrogen chain show that MCA-MPS can improve the accuracy of the ground-state calculation by several orders of magnitude over MPS with the same bond dimension. This new method provides us a useful approach to study quantum many-body systems. The MCA-MPS ansatz also expands our understanding of classically simulatable quantum many-body states.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Theories, Wigner's Function, Compactification, and Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The global symmetry data of a $D$-dimensional absolute quantum field theory can sometimes be packaged in terms of a $(D+1)$-dimensional bulk system obtained by extending along an interval, with a relative QFT$_D$ at one end and suitable gapped / free boundary conditions at the other end. The partition function of the QFT$_D$ can then be interpreted as a wavefunction depending on background fields. However, in some cases, it is not possible or simply cumbersome to fix an absolute form of the symmetry data. Additionally, it is also of interest to consider entangled and mixed states of relative QFTs as well as entangled and mixed states of gapped / free boundary conditions. We argue that Wigner's quasi-probabilistic function on phase space provides a physical interpretation of the symmetry data in all such situations. We illustrate these considerations in the case of string compactifications and holographic systems.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Superfluid Density in Pair-Density-Wave Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13631v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pair-density-wave (PDW) states are a long-sought-after phase of quantum materials, with the potential to unravel the mysteries of high-$T_c$ cuprates and other strongly correlated superconductors. Yet, surprisingly, a key signature of stable superconductivity, namely the positivity of the superfluid density, $n_s(T)$, has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we address this central issue by calculating $n_s(T)$ for a generic model two-dimensional PDW superconductor. We uncover a surprisingly large region of intrinsic instability, associated with negative $n_s(T)$, revealing that a significant portion of the parameter space thought to be physical cannot support a pure PDW order. In the remaining stable regime, we predict two striking and observable fingerprints: a small longitudinal superfluid response and an unusual temperature dependence for $n_s(T)$. These generally model-independent, as well as experimentally relevant findings suggest that the fragility of the superfluid density poses a significant problem for the formation of stable, finite temperature PDW superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Orbital mixing as key ingredient for magnetic order in a van der Waals ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a vast increase in research into van der Waals magnetic materials. In many of these systems, magnetism is introduced via light 3\textit{d}-transition metal elements, combined with chalcogenides or halogens. Despite the high technological promise in the field of spintronics, the connection between the \textit{d}-orbital configuration and the occurrence of low-dimensional magnetic order is currently unclear. Here we address the prototypical two-dimensional ferromagnet CrI\textsubscript{3}, via complementary spectroscopies and density functional theory calculations. We reveal the electronic structure and orbital character of bulk CrI\textsubscript{3} in the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases, describing the couplings underpinning its energy diagram, and providing a robust experimental demonstration that the mechanism of stabilization of ferromagnetism is attributable to orbital mixing between I \textit{p} and Cr \textit{e\textsubscript{g}} states. These findings reveal the microscopic connection between orbital and spin degrees of freedom, providing fundamental insights into the behavior of low-dimensional magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Strong electron-electron interactions in a dilute weakly-localized metal near a metal-to-insulator transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Because it is easily switched from insulator to metal either via chemical doping or electrical gating, silicon is at the core of modern information technology and remains a candidate platform for quantum computing. The metal-to-insulator transition in this material has therefore been one of the most studied phenomena in condensed matter physics, and has been revisited with considerable profit each time a new fabrication technology has been introduced. Here we take advantage of recent advances in creating ultra-thin layers of Bohr-atom-like dopants to realize the two-dimensional disordered Hubbard model at half-filling and its metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) as a function of mean distance between atoms. We use gas-phase dosing of dopant precursor molecules on silicon to create arsenic and phosphorus $\delta$-layers as thin as 0.4~nm and as dilute as 10$^{13}$~cm$^{-2}$. On approaching the insulating state, the conventional weak localization effects, prevalent at high dopant densities and due to orbital motion of the electrons in the plane, become dominated by electron-electron interaction contributions which obey a paramagnetic Zeeman scaling law. The latter make a negative contribution to the conductance, and thus cannot be interpreted in terms of an emergent Kondo regime near the MIT.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetries and Deformations of Symmetric Product Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12180v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct generalized symmetries in two-dimensional symmetric product orbifold CFTs $\text{Sym}^N(\mathcal{T}),$ for a generic seed CFT $\mathcal{T}$. These symmetries are more general than the universal and maximally symmetric ones previously constructed. We show that, up to one fine-tuned example when the number of copies $N$ equals four, the only symmetries that can be preserved under twisted sector marginal deformations are invertible and maximally symmetric. The results are obtained in two ways. First, using the mathematical machinery of $G$-equivariantization of fusion categories, and second, via the projector construction of topological defect lines. As an application, we classify all preserved symmetries in symmetric product orbifold CFTs with the seed CFT given by any $A$-series $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ minimal model. We comment on the implications of our results for holography.</description>

      <title>Generalizing fusion rules by shuffle: Symmetry-based classifications of nonlocal systems constructed from similarity transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study fusion rings, or symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs), which lie outside the non-negative integer matrix representation (NIM-rep), by combining knowledge from generalized symmetry and that from pseudo-Hermitian systems. By applying the Galois shuffle operation to the SymTFTs, we reconstruct fusion rings that correspond to nonlocal CFTs constructed from the corresponding local nonunitary CFTs by applying the similarity transformations. The resultant SymTFTs are outside of NIM-rep, whereas they are ring isomorphic to the NIM-rep of the corresponding local nonunitary CFTs. We study the consequences of this correspondence between the nonlocal unitary model and local nonunitary models. We demonstrate the correspondence between their classifications of massive or massless renormalization group flows and the discrepancies between their boundary or domain wall phenomena. Our work reveals a new connection between ring isomorphism and similarity transformations, providing the fundamental implications of ring-theoretic ideas in the context of symmetry in physics.</description>

      <title>Trion ordering in the attractive three-color Hubbard model on a $\pi$-flux square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultracold multicomponent fermions (atoms/molecules) loaded in optical lattices provide an ideal platform for simulating SU($N$) Hubbard models that host unconventional many-body quantum states beyond SU(2). A prime example is the attractive three-color Hubbard model, in which trion states emerge at strong coupling. Nevertheless, much of its trion ordering on two-dimensional lattices remains uncertain. Here, we employ the determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method to simulate the attractive three-color Hubbard model on a $\pi$-flux square lattice at half filling. We show that color-dependent attractive interaction can induce coexisting charge density wave (CDW) and N\'eel ordered states in the three-color $\pi$-flux Hubbard model. In particular, enhanced charge fluctuations (cf. honeycomb lattice) cause much stronger N\'eel ordering on the $\pi$-flux square lattice. The coexisting charge and N\'eel orders survive up to a melting temperature, at which they vanish simultaneously. The Ginzburg-Landau (GL) analysis on the coexistence of CDW and N\'eel orders demonstrates how color-dependent Hubbard interactions stabilize coexisting orders from the perspective of GL free energy principle.</description>

      <title>Orbital-related gyrotropic responses in Cu$_2$WSe$_4$ and chirality indicator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, counterparts of phenomena studied in spintronics have been actively explored in the orbital sector. The relationship between orbital degrees of freedom and crystal chirality has also been intensively investigated, although the distinction from gyrotropic properties has not been fully clarified. In this work, we investigate spin and orbital Edelstein effects as well as the nonlinear responses in the ternary transition-metal chalcogenide Cu$_2$WSe$_4$, which has a gyrotropic but achiral crystal structure. We find that in the Edelstein effect, magnetization is dominated by the orbital contribution rather than the spin contribution. On the other hand, both the nonlinear chiral thermoelectric (NCTE) Hall effect--a response to the cross product of the electric field and the temperature gradient--and the nonlinear Hall effect--conventional second-order response to the electric field--are found to be dominated by the Berry curvature dipole. We further find that spin-orbit coupling plays only a minor role in these effects, whereas the orbital degrees of freedom are essential. Finally, we demonstrate that the orbital magnetic-moment contributions to both the Edelstein effect and the NCTE Hall effect are closely linked to chirality, and we discuss the possibility of using them as a chirality indicator.</description>
