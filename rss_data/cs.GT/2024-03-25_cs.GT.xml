      <title>Single-token vs Two-token Blockchain Tokenomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider long-term equilibria that arise in the tokenomics design of proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain systems that comprise of users and validators, both striving to maximize their own utilities. Validators are system maintainers who get rewarded with tokens for performing the work necessary for the system to function properly, while users compete and pay with such tokens for getting a desired system service level.
  We study how the system service provision and suitable rewards schemes together can lead to equilibria with desirable characteristics (1) viability: the system keeps parties engaged, (2) decentralization: multiple validators are participating, (3) stability: the price path of the underlying token used to transact with the system does not change widely over time, and (4) feasibility: the mechanism is easy to implement as a smart contract, i.e., it does not require fiat reserves on-chain for buy back of tokens or to perform bookkeeping of exponentially growing token holdings. Furthermore, we consider both the common single-token PoS model and a less widely used two-token approach (that roughly, utilizes one token for the users to pay the transaction fees and a different token for the validators to participate in the PoS protocol and get rewarded). Our approach demonstrates, for the first time to our knowledge, concrete advantages of the two-token approach in terms of the ability of the mechanism to reach equilibrium.</description>

      <title>PPA-Game: Characterizing and Learning Competitive Dynamics Among Online Content Creators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Proportional Payoff Allocation Game (PPA-Game) to model how agents, akin to content creators on platforms like YouTube and TikTok, compete for divisible resources and consumers' attention. Payoffs are allocated to agents based on heterogeneous weights, reflecting the diversity in content quality among creators. Our analysis reveals that although a pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) is not guaranteed in every scenario, it is commonly observed, with its absence being rare in our simulations. Beyond analyzing static payoffs, we further discuss the agents' online learning about resource payoffs by integrating a multi-player multi-armed bandit framework. We propose an online algorithm facilitating each agent's maximization of cumulative payoffs over $T$ rounds. Theoretically, we establish that the regret of any agent is bounded by $O(\log^{1 + \eta} T)$ for any $\eta &gt; 0$. Empirical results further validate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Balancing Fairness and Efficiency in Energy Resource Allocations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bringing fairness to energy resource allocation remains a challenge, due to the complexity of system structures and economic interdependencies among users and system operators' decision-making. The rise of distributed energy resources has introduced more diverse heterogeneous user groups, surpassing the capabilities of traditional efficiency-oriented allocation schemes. Without explicitly bringing fairness to user-system interaction, this disparity often leads to disproportionate payments for certain user groups due to their utility formats or group sizes.
  Our paper addresses this challenge by formalizing the problem of fair energy resource allocation and introducing the framework for aggregators. This framework enables optimal fairness-efficiency trade-offs by selecting appropriate objectives in a principled way. By jointly optimizing over the total resources to allocate and individual allocations, our approach reveals optimized allocation schemes that lie on the Pareto front, balancing fairness and efficiency in resource allocation strategies.</description>

      <title>On the Variational Interpretation of Mirror Play in Monotone Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mirror play (MP) is a well-accepted primal-dual multi-agent learning algorithm where all agents simultaneously implement mirror descent in a distributed fashion. The advantage of MP over vanilla gradient play lies in its usage of mirror maps that better exploit the geometry of decision domains. Despite extensive literature dedicated to the asymptotic convergence of MP to equilibrium, the understanding of the finite-time behavior of MP before reaching equilibrium is still rudimentary. To facilitate the study of MP's non-equilibrium performance, this work establishes an equivalence between MP's finite-time primal-dual path (mirror path) in monotone games and the closed-loop Nash equilibrium path of a finite-horizon differential game, referred to as mirror differential game (MDG). Our construction of MDG rests on the Brezis-Ekeland variational principle, and the stage cost functional for MDG is Fenchel coupling between MP's iterates and associated gradient updates. The variational interpretation of mirror path in static games as the equilibrium path in MDG holds in deterministic and stochastic cases. Such a variational interpretation translates the non-equilibrium studies of learning dynamics into a more tractable equilibrium analysis of dynamic games, as demonstrated in a case study on the Cournot game, where MP dynamics corresponds to a linear quadratic game.</description>

      <title>On the Stability of Learning in Network Games with Many Players</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent learning algorithms have been shown to display complex, unstable behaviours in a wide array of games. In fact, previous works indicate that convergent behaviours are less likely to occur as the total number of agents increases. This seemingly prohibits convergence to stable strategies, such as Nash Equilibria, in games with many players.
  To make progress towards addressing this challenge we study the Q-Learning Dynamics, a classical model for exploration and exploitation in multi-agent learning. In particular, we study the behaviour of Q-Learning on games where interactions between agents are constrained by a network. We determine a number of sufficient conditions, depending on the game and network structure, which guarantee that agent strategies converge to a unique stable strategy, called the Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE). Crucially, these sufficient conditions are independent of the total number of agents, allowing for provable convergence in arbitrarily large games.
  Next, we compare the learned QRE to the underlying NE of the game, by showing that any QRE is an $\epsilon$-approximate Nash Equilibrium. We first provide tight bounds on $\epsilon$ and show how these bounds lead naturally to a centralised scheme for choosing exploration rates, which enables independent learners to learn stable approximate Nash Equilibrium strategies. We validate the method through experiments and demonstrate its effectiveness even in the presence of numerous agents and actions. Through these results, we show that independent learning dynamics may converge to approximate Nash Equilibria, even in the presence of many agents.</description>

      <title>A Coupled Optimization Framework for Correlated Equilibria in Normal-Form Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In competitive multi-player interactions, simultaneous optimality is a key requirement for establishing strategic equilibria. This property is explicit when the game-theoretic equilibrium is the simultaneously optimal solution of coupled optimization problems. However, no such optimization problems exist for the correlated equilibrium, a strategic equilibrium where the players can correlate their actions. We address the lack of a coupled optimization framework for the correlated equilibrium by introducing an {unnormalized game} -- an extension of normal-form games in which the player strategies are lifted to unnormalized measures over the joint actions. We show that the set of fully mixed generalized Nash equilibria of this unnormalized game is a subset of the correlated equilibrium of the normal-form game. Furthermore, we introduce an entropy regularization to the unnormalized game and prove that the entropy-regularized generalized Nash equilibrium is a sub-optimal correlated equilibrium of the normal form game where the degree of sub-optimality depends on the magnitude of regularization. We prove that the entropy-regularized unnormalized game has a closed-form solution, and empirically verify its computational efficacy at approximating the correlated equilibrium of normal-form games.</description>

      <title>Efficient Method for Finding Optimal Strategies in Chopstick Auctions with Uniform Objects Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm for computing Nash equilibria (NE) in a class of conflicts with multiple battlefields with uniform battlefield values and a non-linear aggregation function. By expanding the symmetrization idea of Hart [9], proposed for the Colonel Blotto game, to the wider class of symmetric conflicts with multiple battlefields, we reduce the number of strategies of the players by an exponential factor. We propose a clash matrix algorithm which allows for computing the payoffs in the symmetrized model in polynomial time. Combining symmetrization and clash matrix algorithm with the double oracle algorithm we obtain an algorithm for computing NE in the models in question that achieves a significant speed-up as compared to the standard, LP-based, approach. We also introduce a heuristic to further speed up the process. Overall, our approach offers an efficient and novel method for computing NE in a specific class of conflicts, with potential practical applications in various fields.</description>

      <title>Economic DAO Governance: A Contestable Control Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a new form of DAO governance that uses a sequential auction mechanism to overcome entrenched control issues that have emerged for DAOs by creating a regime of temporary contestable control. The mechanism avoids potential public choice problems inherent in voting approaches but at the same time provides a vehicle that can enhance and secure value than inheres to DAO voting and other DAO non-market governance procedures. It is robust to empty voting and is code feasible. It facilitates the ability of DAOs to meet their normative and operational goals in the face of diverse regulatory approaches. Designed to shift control to the party with the most promising business plan, at the same time it distributes surplus in a way that tends to promote investment by other parties.</description>

      <title>Efficient Weighting Schemes for Auditing Instant-Runoff Voting Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various risk-limiting audit (RLA) methods have been developed for instant-runoff voting (IRV) elections. A recent method, AWAIRE, is the first efficient approach that does not require cast vote records (CVRs). AWAIRE involves adaptively weighted averages of test statistics, essentially "learning" an effective set of hypotheses to test. However, the initial paper on AWAIRE only examined a few weighting schemes and parameter settings.
  We provide an extensive exploration of schemes and settings, to identify and recommend efficient choices for practical use. We focus only on the (hardest) case where CVRs are not available, using simulations based on real election data to assess performance.
  Across our comparisons, the most effective schemes are often those that place most or all of the weight on the apparent "best" hypotheses based on already seen data. Conversely, the optimal tuning parameters tended to vary based on the election margin. Nonetheless, we quantify the performance trade-offs for different choices across varying election margins, aiding in selecting the most desirable trade-off if a default option is needed.
  A limitation of the current AWAIRE implementation is its restriction to handling a small number of candidates (previously demonstrated up to six candidates). One path to a more computationally efficient implementation would be to use lazy evaluation and avoid considering all possible hypotheses. Our findings suggest that such an approach could be done without substantially comprising statistical performance.</description>

      <title>A new social welfare function with a number of desirable properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By relaxing the dominating set in three ways (e.g., from "each member beats every non-member" to "each member beats or ties every non-member, with an additional requirement that at least one member beat every non-member"), we propose a new social welfare function, which satisfies a number of desirable properties including Condorcet winner principle, Condorcet loser principle, strong Gehrlein-stability (hence Smith set principle), anonymity, neutrality, weak Pareto, strong Pareto, non-dictatorship, and [independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) when the pairwise majority relation is an ordering on the alternative set]. If the pairwise majority relation is complete and transitive, the proposed method yields a collective preference relation that coincides with the input majority relation. It thus shares the same collective preference function on the dichotomous domain with the approval voting and the majority voting. It runs in polynomial time and thus possesses a competitive advantage over a number of computationally intractable voting rules such as the Dodgson's rule, the Kemeny's rule, the Slater's rule, the Banks rule, and the Schwartz's tournament equilibrium set (TEQ) rule. When it is used in tournaments, its winner belongs to the uncovered set, the top cycle set, the Smith set, and the Schwartz set. In addition, in a tournament where the number of alternatives is not more than 4, its winner set is a subset, sometimes proper, of the Copeland winner set. Whether this attractive argument is still valid in four-more-alternative tournaments remains an open question.</description>

      <title>Do LLM Agents Have Regret? A Case Study in Online Learning and Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for (interactive) decision-making, via the development of LLM-based autonomous agents. Despite their emerging successes, the performance of LLM agents in decision-making has not been fully investigated through quantitative metrics, especially in the multi-agent setting when they interact with each other, a typical scenario in real-world LLM-agent applications. To better understand the limits of LLM agents in these interactive environments, we propose to study their interactions in benchmark decision-making settings in online learning and game theory, through the performance metric of \emph{regret}. We first empirically study the {no-regret} behaviors of LLMs in canonical (non-stationary) online learning problems, as well as the emergence of equilibria when LLM agents interact through playing repeated games. We then provide some theoretical insights into the no-regret behaviors of LLM agents, under certain assumptions on the supervised pre-training and the rationality model of human decision-makers who generate the data. Notably, we also identify (simple) cases where advanced LLMs such as GPT-4 fail to be no-regret. To promote the no-regret behaviors, we propose a novel \emph{unsupervised} training loss of \emph{regret-loss}, which, in contrast to the supervised pre-training loss, does not require the labels of (optimal) actions. We then establish the statistical guarantee of generalization bound for regret-loss minimization, followed by the optimization guarantee that minimizing such a loss may automatically lead to known no-regret learning algorithms. Our further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our regret-loss, especially in addressing the above ``regrettable'' cases.</description>

      <title>Project-Fair and Truthful Mechanisms for Budget Aggregation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the budget aggregation problem in which a set of strategic voters must split a finite divisible resource (such as money or time) among a set of competing projects. Our goal is twofold: We seek truthful mechanisms that provide fairness guarantees to the projects. For the first objective, we focus on the class of moving phantom mechanisms [Freeman et al., 2021], which are -- to this day -- essentially the only known truthful mechanisms in this setting. For project fairness, we consider the mean division as a fair baseline, and bound the maximum difference between the funding received by any project and this baseline. We propose a novel and simple moving phantom mechanism that provides optimal project fairness guarantees. As a corollary of our results, we show that our new mechanism minimizes the $\ell_1$ distance to the mean (a measure suggested by Caragiannis et al. [2022]) for three projects and gives the first non-trivial bounds on this quantity for more than three projects.</description>

      <title>Non-convex potential games for finding global solutions to sensor network localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sensor network localization (SNL) problems require determining the physical coordinates of all sensors in a network. This process relies on the global coordinates of anchors and the available measurements between non-anchor and anchor nodes. Attributed to the intrinsic non-convexity, obtaining a globally optimal solution to SNL is challenging, as well as implementing corresponding algorithms. In this paper, we formulate a non-convex multi-player potential game for a generic SNL problem to investigate the identification condition of the global Nash equilibrium (NE) therein, where the global NE represents the global solution of SNL. We employ canonical duality theory to transform the non-convex game into a complementary dual problem. Then we develop a conjugation-based algorithm to compute the stationary points of the complementary dual problem. On this basis, we show an identification condition of the global NE: the stationary point of the proposed algorithm satisfies a duality relation. Finally, simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.</description>
