      <title>Genetic Algorithm-Based Inverse Design of Guided Wave Planar Terahertz Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a genetic algorithm (GA)-based inverse design framework for synthesizing high-performance planar terahertz (THz) filters integrated with coplanar striplines (CPSs). The method efficiently explores high-dimensional design spaces to generate filter geometries matching user-defined S-parameter magnitude and phase responses, while enforcing structural connectivity for compatibility with terahertz system-on-chip (TSoC) platforms. To accelerate optimization, filter performance is evaluated using the ABCD matrix method, providing a significant computational advantage over full-wave simulations. Final validation is performed through finite element method (FEM) simulations. As a proof of concept, we design band-stop filters with center frequencies of 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 THz, each with a 150 GHz target bandwidth, and demonstrate tunable rejection depths within a constant physical footprint. Optimization is guided by minimizing the root-mean-square error (RMSE) between simulated and target S-parameters.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Novel Passive Double-Sensitivity Optical Gyroscope Based on Non-Reciprocal Polarization Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel interferometric fiber optic gyroscope (IFOG) architecture, the Double-Sensitive Non-Reciprocal Polarization Phase Shifter IFOG (DS-NRPPS-IFOG), which introduces for the first time a fully passive phase biasing scheme capable of simultaneous operation at two quadrature points $\pi/2$ and $3\pi/2$. Building upon prior passive biasing techniques, this design uses a Non-Reciprocal Polarization-Dependent Phase Shifter (NRPPS) combined with a double-pass sensing coil arrangement to achieve both passive $\pi/2$ phase modulation and enhanced measurement sensitivity. The system utilizes polarization manipulation and a quarter-wave retarder to create a double-sensitive response while eliminating the need for active modulators. Simulation results demonstrate significant performance improvements, with Angular Random Walk (ARW) values up to 50x lower than those of conventional DS-IFOG systems, depending on fiber length. Moreover, the architecture enables continuous rotation measurements and offers spontaneous noise suppression by leveraging dual quadrature detection. These findings mark a major advancement toward low-power, highly stable, and compact passive optical gyroscopes for precision navigation applications.</description>

      <title>Direct laser ablation of 2D material films for fabricating multi-functional flexible and transparent devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a scalable method for direct patterning of graphite and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) films on polycarbonate (PC) and other transparent substrates using fiber laser ablation. This process facilitates the fabrication of various functional devices, including strain gauges, supercapacitors, and photodetector arrays, without the need for photolithography or solvents, thereby simplifying device production and enhancing environmental sustainability. Utilizing roll-to-roll mechanical exfoliation, homogeneous nanosheet films are created and then patterned with a laser engraving system. Electrical and optical characterization confirms that the laser-processed films maintain their crystallinity, with no observable damage to the underlying substrate. We demonstrate the scalability of this approach by constructing a WSe2/graphite photodetector array on PC, which exhibits high sensitivity, low noise, and uniform photocurrent response across its active channels. As a proof-of-concept, this array is used as an image sensor to capture light patterns, showcasing its potential for flexible and semi-transparent imaging applications. These findings open up new avenues for incorporating all-van der Waals devices into wearable electronics, optoelectronics, and imaging technologies.</description>

      <title>Levitated macroscopic rotors with 10 hours of free spin at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-dissipation rotors with large angular momentum are essential for precision sensing and probing macroscopic quantum phenomena. To date, low dissipation can only be achieved for micro-scale rotors. Here, we report a diamagnetically levitated millimeter-scale rotor exhibiting a measured dissipation rate as low as $3.85\,\mu\mathrm{Hz}$ at room temperature, corresponding to a free spinning duration exceeding 10 hours. The rotor is levitated stably over an axisymmetric permanent magnet trap, and can be driven up to 930 RPM using contactless electrostatic actuation in high vacuum. Leveraging its low damping rate and large angular momentum, we realize a precision gyroscope with a measured sensitivity of $6.5 \times 10^{-3}\ \mathrm{^\circ/s}$ and an estimated thermal-limited stability of $5.7 \times 10^{-7}\ \mathrm{^\circ/\sqrt{h}}$. These results establish diamagnetic levitation as a promising room-temperature platform for high-performance gyroscopes.</description>

      <title>Single-Shot, Single-Mask X-ray Dark-field and Phase Contrast Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray imaging, traditionally relying on attenuation contrast, struggles to differentiate materials with similar attenuation coefficients like soft tissues. X-ray phase contrast imaging (XPCI) and dark-field (DF) imaging provide enhanced contrast by detecting phase shifts and ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering (USAXS). However, they typically require complex and costly setups, along with multiple exposures to retrieve various contrast features. In this study, we introduce a novel single-mask X-ray imaging system design that simultaneously captures attenuation, differential phase contrast (DPC), and dark-field images in a single exposure. Most importantly, our proposed system design requires just a single mask alignment with relatively low-resolution detectors. Using our novel light transport models derived for these specific system designs, we show intuitive understanding of contrast formation and retrieval method of different contrast features. Our approach eliminates the need for highly coherent X-ray sources, ultra-high-resolution detectors, spectral detectors or intricate gratings. We propose three variations of the single-mask setup, each optimized for different contrast types, offering flexibility and efficiency in a variety of applications. The versatility of this single-mask approach along with the use of befitting light transport models holds promise for broader use in clinical diagnostics and industrial inspection, making advanced X-ray imaging more accessible and cost-effective.</description>

      <title>Selective Addressing of Coupled Qubits via Complex Frequency Zero Targeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving precise, individual control over qubits within scalable quantum processors is critically hampered by parasitic couplings and spectral crowding, leading to detrimental crosstalk. While optimal absorption strategies based on time-reversal symmetry have shown promise for single emitters, their applicability is limited in realistic multi-qubit systems where realistic losses break time-reversal symmetry. This work introduces a robust approach using complex frequency (CF) pulses specifically tailored to the complex reflection zeros of the complete, coupled, and explicitly lossy qubit-waveguide system. This method circumvents the limitations of idealized time-reversal arguments by directly engaging with the dissipative system's true response characteristics. We first develop a theoretical framework for a system of three coupled two-level emitters, employing Heisenberg equations to derive the system's response and design appropriate CF pulses that inherently account for the system's dissipative nature. The efficacy and practicality of this approach are then validated through comprehensive transient simulations for a realistic model of three Josephson junction-based transmon qubits, explicitly including intrinsic qubit losses. Our results demonstrate that CF pulses can selectively excite a target qubit with significantly suppressed crosstalk to neighboring qubits, markedly outperforming conventional Gaussian pulses of comparable energy.</description>

      <title>Structural Vibration Monitoring with Diffractive Optical Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is vital for maintaining the safety and longevity of civil infrastructure, yet current solutions remain constrained by cost, power consumption, scalability, and the complexity of data processing. Here, we present a diffractive vibration monitoring system, integrating a jointly optimized diffractive layer with a shallow neural network-based backend to remotely extract 3D structural vibration spectra, offering a low-power, cost-effective and scalable solution. This architecture eliminates the need for dense sensor arrays or extensive data acquisition; instead, it uses a spatially-optimized passive diffractive layer that encodes 3D structural displacements into modulated light, captured by a minimal number of detectors and decoded in real-time by shallow and low-power neural networks to reconstruct the 3D displacement spectra of structures. The diffractive system's efficacy was demonstrated both numerically and experimentally using millimeter-wave illumination on a laboratory-scale building model with a programmable shake table. Our system achieves more than an order-of-magnitude improvement in accuracy over conventional optics or separately trained modules, establishing a foundation for high-throughput 3D monitoring of structures. Beyond SHM, the 3D vibration monitoring capabilities of this cost-effective and data-efficient framework establish a new computational sensing modality with potential applications in disaster resilience, aerospace diagnostics, and autonomous navigation, where energy efficiency, low latency, and high-throughput are critical.</description>

      <title>High-pressure Induced Phase Transition and Laser Characterization Response of MAPbBr$_3$ Thin Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high-pressure behavior of 3D metal halide chalcogenides (MHPs) has been widely studied. In the field of high-pressure technology, the studies on 3D MHPs have focused on the structural and optical properties, where the optical properties are mainly investigated on the photoluminescence behavior, while the laser properties of the materials have not been studied yet. In this paper, MAPbBr$_3$-MAAc films with ionic liquid methylammonium acetate (MAAc) as solvent and conventional MAPbBr$_3$-DMF:DMSO films with N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as solvents were prepared using solvent engineering method. In-situ pressurization testing of both materials using a small-cavity hydrostatic high-pressure device (DAC) was used to investigate the high-pressure optical behavior of the MAPbBr$_3$ films, especially the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) properties, which, combined with high-pressure in-situ Raman, revealed that the changes in the optical properties of the films under pressure are due to the changes in the crystal structure of the materials. This paper also emphasizes that the optical properties and phase structure stability of MAPbBr$_3$-MAAc films are superior to those of MAPbBr$_3$-DMF:DMSO films under high pressure.</description>

      <title>Gefitinib-Induced Interface Engineering Enhances the Defect Formation Energy for Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) has been widely used as a hole transport layer in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the high interface defect density and energy level mismatch between PEDOT:PSS and perovskite can lead to significant open-circuit voltage loss. Additionally, the free PSS chains on the surface of PEDOT:PSS can absorb water molecules, promoting the degradation of perovskite at the PEDOT:PSS/perovskite interface. Here, gefitinib is used to modify the surface of PEDOT:PSS, removing a portion of the free PSS chains from the surface, reducing the PSS/PEDOT ratio, and enhancing the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS. Gefitinib has altered the energy level structure of PEDOT:PSS, facilitating hole transport at the interface. The Cl, F, and NH groups in gefitinib also passivated defects in the perovskite, reducing the defect density at the interface and significantly enhancing the stability of PSCs. This modification increased the open-circuit voltage from 1.077 to 1.110 V and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 17.01% to 19.63%. When gefitinib was used to modify the interface between SnO2 and perovskite, the PCE of PSCs (ITO/SnO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMETAD/Au) increased from 22.46% to 23.89%. This approach provides new perspectives and strategies for improving the efficiency and stability of PSCs.</description>

      <title>Efficient and standardized interface energy calculations in hybrid heterostructures using fictitious atoms surface passivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterostructures combining diverse physico-chemical properties are increasingly in demand for a wide range of applications in modern science and technology. However, despite their importance in materials science, accurately determining absolute interface energies remains a major challenge. This difficulty arises from periodic boundary conditions, high computational costs of plane-wave methods, multipolar interactions in heterostructures, the need for thick slabs for interface convergence, and reconstructed surfaces on both slab faces. Here, we introduce a standardized and computationally efficient fictitious H* charge passivation method for the surface termination, designed to accurately determine absolute interface energies in heterogeneous materials associations. This approach effectively addresses issues associated with surface reconstructions while significantly reducing computational costs within the framework of density functional theory. To demonstrate its reliability, we calculate the absolute interface energies for various quasi-lattice-matched and lattice-mismatched abrupt III-V/Si interfaces using the H* passivation technique and benchmark the results against those obtained using conventional reconstructed surface methods. We further explore the early stages of strained epitaxial GaAs on Si(001). Finally, we assess the fictitious H* passivation method, showing its effectiveness in minimizing electric dipole errors, reducing computational costs, and thus decreasing greenhouse gas emissions from high-performance computing. Finally, the potential of the approach to compute interface energies across a broad spectrum of materials is emphasized.</description>

      <title>Non-invasive measurement of local stress inside soft materials with programmed shear waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical stresses in soft materials across different length scales play a fundamental role in understanding the function of biological systems and in the use of artificial materials for engineering soft machines and biomedical devices. Yet it remains a great challenge to probe local mechanical stresses in situ in a non-invasive, non-destructive manner, in particular when the mechanical properties are unknown. To address this challenge, we propose an acoustoelastic imaging-based method to infer the local mechanical stresses in soft materials by measuring the speed of shear waves induced by custom-programmed acoustic radiation force. Using a medical ultrasound transducer to excite and track the shear waves remotely, we demonstrate the application of the method by imaging uniaxial stress and bending stress in an isotropic hydrogel, and the passive uniaxial stress in a skeletal muscle. These measurements were all done without the knowledge of the constitutive parameters of the materials. These examples indicate that our method will find broad applications, ranging from health monitoring of soft structures and machines, to the diagnosis of diseases that alter stresses in soft tissues.</description>

      <title>Rapid Muon Tomography for Border Security</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray muon tomography is a promising technique for border security applications, leveraging highly penetrating cosmic-ray muons and their interactions with various materials to generate 3D images of large and dense objects, such as shipping containers. Using scattering and absorption of muons as they pass through dense cargo materials, muon tomography provides a viable solution for customs and border security by enabling the verification of shipping container declarations and preventing illegal trafficking. In this study, we utilized Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of muon tomography for cargo characterization and contraband detection in various smuggling scenarios. Our results demonstrate that muon tomography can offers a novel approach to cargo inspection, moving beyond traditional 3D image reconstruction. Instead, it analyzes muon scattering and absorption rates in real time during scanning, enabling the prompt detection of discrepancies between actual cargo contents and declared goods within just 10 to 20 seconds. This method is particularly effective for cargo consisting of uniform loads composed of a single material or product, a common practice in shipping. Unlike traditional X-ray radiography, which analyzes detailed 2D images, muon tomography begins evaluating scatter-absorption rates within the first few seconds of scanning. This early assessment enables cargo evaluation long before a statistically reliable 3D image is formed, significantly improving scanning throughput without disrupting trade flow.</description>

      <title>Electric Field Sensing via Rydberg Electromagnetically Induced Transparency Using Zeeman and Stark Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rydberg-assisted atomic electrometry with thermal vapors offers a promising approach for detecting external electric fields. However, this technique presents significant challenges for measuring low frequencies due to the effects of metal-alkali atoms adsorbed on the interior surface of the vacuum chamber. In this work, we apply high-contrast Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) spectroscopy to systematically investigate these effects, including the influence of laser power and electric field strength. We demonstrate the ability to measure electric field frequencies ranging from 10 Hz to 1 MHz. Additionally, this study identifies a fundamental limit for data capacity in such measurements. Furthermore, we propose a method for precise Stark shift measurements by locking the coupling laser to Zeeman-split Rydberg EIT peaks. Using the Zeeman shift in a reference cell as a stable frequency reference, we track Stark-induced shifts in a science cell and confirm excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. These results provide valuable insights for future precision measurement techniques and field sensing applications based on Rydberg atom systems.</description>

Abstract: The total ionizing dose (TID) effect of semiconductor devices stems from radiation-induced $E'_\gamma$ defects in the $a$-SiO$_2$ dielectrics, but the conventional ``hole transport-trapping'' model of defect generation fails to explain recent basic experiments. Here, we propose an essentially new ``nonradiative carrier capture-structural relaxation'' (NCCSR) mechanism that can consistently explain the puzzling temperature/electric-field dependence, based on spin-polarized HSE06 hybrid functional calculations and existing experimental alignment of defect formation energies and charge capture cross-sections of large-sample oxygen vacancies in $a$-SiO$_2$. It is revealed that, the long-assumed $V_{O\gamma}$ precursors with high formation energy cannot survive in high temperature-grown $a$-SiO$_2$; whereas the stable $V_{O\delta}$ can capture irradiation-induced holes via strong electron-phonon coupling, generating metastable $E'_\delta$ that most relax into stable $E'_\gamma$. A fractional power-law (FPL) dynamic model is derived based on the mechanism and the Kohlrausch-Williams Watts (KWW) decay function. It can uniformly describe nonlinear data over a wide dose and temperature range. This work not only provides a solid cornerstone for prediction and hardening of TID effects of SiO$_2$-based semiconductor devices, but also offers a general approach for studying ionizing radiation physics in alternative dielectrics with intrinsic electronic metastability and dispersion.</description>

      <title>Electrical switching of altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Switching magnetism using only electricity is of great significance for industrial applications but remains challenging. We find that, altermagnetism, as a newly discovered unconventional magnetism, may open an avenue along this effort. Specifically, to have deterministic switching, i.e., reversing current direction must reverse magnetic structure, parity symmetry has to be broken. We discover that, due to their symmetry which depends on chemical environments, altermagnet devices may naturally carry the parity symmetry breaking required for deterministic electrical switching of magnetism. More importantly, we identify MnTe bilayers (Te-Mn-Te-Mn-Te) as candidate devices, with the help of symmetry analysis, first-principles calculations, and magnetic dynamics simulations. This scheme will inspire further explorations on unconventional magnetism.</description>
