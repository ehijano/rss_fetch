      <title>Not all cores are equal: Phase-space origins of dynamical friction, stalling and buoyancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical friction governs the orbital decay of massive perturbers within galaxies and dark matter halos, yet its standard Chandrasekhar formulation fails in systems with cores of (roughly) constant density, where inspiral can halt or even reverse, phenomena known respectively as core stalling and dynamical buoyancy. Although these effects have been observed in simulations, the conditions under which they arise remain unclear. Using high-resolution N-body simulations and analytic insights from kinetic theory, we systematically explore the physical origin of these effects. We demonstrate that the overall distribution function (DF) of the host, not just its central density gradient, determines the efficiency and direction of dynamical friction. Core stalling arises when the perturber encounters a plateau in the DF, either pre-existing or dynamically created through its own inspiral, while buoyancy emerges in systems whose DFs possess an inflection that drives an unstable dipole mode. We show that double power-law density profiles with rapid outer-to-inner slope transitions naturally produce such DF features, which is why structurally similar cores can yield radically different dynamical outcomes. Our results provide a unified framework linking the phase-space structure of galaxies to the fate of embedded massive objects, with direct implications for off-center AGN, the dynamics of nuclear star clusters, and the stalled coalescence of black holes in dwarf galaxies and massive ellipticals.</description>

      <title>LEGA-C stellar populations scaling relations. II: Dissecting mass-complete archaeological trends and their evolution since z~0.7 with LEGA-C and SDSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a sample of 552 galaxies at z~0.7 from the LEGA-C survey, we investigate how current star formation influences light-weighted mean stellar ages and metallicities, and their median trends with stellar mass or velocity dispersion. The bimodality in the global age-mass relation stems from the different age distributions in the quiescent (Q) and star-forming (SF) populations. A bimodality is not observed in the stellar metallicity-mass relation, although Q and SF galaxies have different distributions in this parameter space. We identify a high-metallicity sequence populated by both Q and weakly SF galaxies. At masses below logM/Msun=10.8 the median stellar metallicity-mass relation of SF galaxies steepens, as a consequence of increasing scatter toward lower stellar metallicities for galaxies with increasing specific star formation rate at fixed mass. With a consistent analysis of SDSS DR7 spectra, accounting for aperture corrections, we quantify the evolution of the stellar age and stellar metallicity scaling relations between z=0.7 and the present. We find negligible evolution in the stellar metallicity-mass relation of Q galaxies and for logM/Msun&gt;11 galaxies in general. Lower mass SF galaxies, instead, have typically lower metallicities than their local counterparts, indicating significant enrichment since z~0.7 in the low-mass regime. The median of the stellar ages of both the general population and Q galaxies has changed by only 2 Gyr between z=0.7 and z=0.1, less than expected from cosmic aging. Some Q galaxies must evolve passively to reach the old boundary of the local population. However, in order to explain the evolution of the median trends, both individual evolution, through rejuvenation and/or minor merging impacting the outer galaxy regions, and population evolution, through quenching of massive, metal-rich star-forming galaxies, are required.

      <title>ODIN: Characterizing the Three-dimensional Structure of Two Protocluster Complexes at $z = 3.1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the 3D morphology of two extended associations of multiple protoclusters at $z=3.1$. These protocluster `complexes', designated COSMOS-z3.1-A and COSMOS-z3.1-C, are the most prominent overdensities of $z=3.1$ Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) identified in the COSMOS field by the One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey. These protocluster complexes have been followed up with extensive spectroscopy from Keck, Gemini, and DESI. Using a probabilistic method that combines photometrically selected and spectroscopically confirmed LAEs, we reconstruct the 3D structure of these complexes on scales of $\approx$50 cMpc. We validate our reconstruction method using the IllustrisTNG300-1 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation and show that it consistently outperforms approaches relying solely on spectroscopic data. The resulting 3D maps reveal that both complexes are irregular and elongated along a single axis, emphasizing the impact of sightline on our perception of structure morphology. The complexes consist of multiple density peaks, ten in COSMOS-z3.1-A and four in COSMOS-z3.1-C. The former is confirmed to be a proto-supercluster, similar to {\it Hyperion} at $z=2.4$ but observed at an even earlier epoch. Multiple `tails' connected to the cores of the density peaks are seen, likely representing cosmic filaments feeding into these extremely overdense regions. The 3D reconstructions further provide strong evidence that Ly$\alpha$ blobs preferentially reside in the outskirts of the highest density regions. Descendant mass estimates of the density peaks suggest that COSMOS-z3.1-A and COSMOS-z3.1-C will evolve to become ultra-massive structures by $z=0$, with total masses $\log(M/M_\odot) \gtrsim 15.3$, exceeding that of Coma.</description>

      <title>Infrared Signatures of Dusty Tori Formed by MHD-Driven Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to probe the physical structure and conditions of the central regions of active galactic nuclei (AGN) by interpreting their mid-infrared observational spectra. We constructed a sophisticated three-dimensional radiative transfer model of the AGN source and dusty torus, built upon a physically motivated framework that includes a comprehensive dust grain model. To investigate the properties of the circumnuclear medium, we performed model fitting to a sample of 20 observational spectra from Spitzer Space Telescope's IRS Enhanced Data Products, testing two distinct dust density laws: a steep $r^{-2}$ profile, characteristic of a radiation pressure-driven wind, and a shallower $r^{-1}$ profile, which is a key prediction of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models. Our model successfully reproduces fundamental observational phenomena, such as the transition from 9.7\,$\mu$m silicate emission at low inclinations to deep absorption at high inclinations, with absorption features becoming more pronounced for higher accretion rates, dust-to-gas ratios, and black hole masses. Most importantly, a direct comparison of the fitting results revealed that the $r^{-1}$ density law provided a significantly better fit ($\chi^2$) than the $r^{-2}$ density law for 18 of the 20 observational spectra. These results confirm the physical consistency of our advanced radiative model and provide compelling evidence that an $r^{-1}$ density law is a more accurate representation of the AGN dusty torus.</description>

      <title>PAH Marks the Spot: Digging for Buried Clusters in Nearby Star-forming Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The joint capabilities of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and JWST allow for an unparalleled look at the early lives of star clusters at near- and mid-infrared wavelengths. We present here a multiband analysis of embedded young stellar clusters in 11 nearby, star-forming galaxies, using the PHANGS-JWST and PHANGS-HST datasets. We use the Zooniverse citizen science platform to conduct an initial by-eye search for embedded clusters in near-UV/optical/near-infrared images that trace stellar continuum emission, the Paschen$\alpha$ and H$\alpha$ recombination lines, and the 3.3 $\mu$m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon feature and its underlying continuum. With this approach, we identify 292 embedded cluster candidates for which we characterize their ages, masses, and levels of line-of-sight extinction by comparing the photometric data to predictions from stellar population models. The embedded cluster candidates have a median age of 4.5 Myr and an average line-of-sight extinction $\left&lt; A_V \right&gt; = 6.0$ mag. We determine lower limits on source stellar masses, resulting in a median stellar mass of $10^3$ $M_{\odot}$. We use this sample of embedded cluster candidates to train multiple convolutional neural network models to carry out deep transfer learning-based searches for embedded clusters. With the aim of optimizing models for future catalog production, we compare results for four variations of training data using two neural networks. Confusion matrices for all eight model configurations, as well as inter-model identification trends, are presented. With refinement of the training sample, we determine that optimized models could serve as a pathway for future embedded cluster identification beyond our 11 galaxy sample.</description>

      <title>Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1): Identification of massive galaxy candidates at the end of the Epoch of Reionisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probing the presence and properties of massive galaxies at high redshift is one of the most critical tests for galaxy formation models. In this work, we search for galaxies with stellar masses M* &gt; 10^10.25 Msun at z in [5,7], i.e., towards the end of the Epoch of Reionisation, over a total of ~23 deg^2 in two of the Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1) fields: the Euclid Deep Field North and Fornax (EDF-N and EDF-F). In addition to the Euclid photometry, we incorporate Spitzer Infrared Camera (IRAC) and ground-based optical data to perform spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, obtaining photometric redshifts and derived physical parameters. After applying rigorous selection criteria, we identify a conservative sample of 145 candidate massive galaxies with M* &gt; 10^10.25 Msun at z in [5,7], including 5 objects with M* &gt; 10^11 Msun. This makes for a surface density of about 6.3 deg^-2 at z in [5,7], which should be considered a lower limit because of the current depth of the Euclid data (H_E &lt; 24, 5 sigma in Q1). We find that the inferred stellar masses are consistent with galaxy formation models with standard star-formation efficiencies. These massive galaxies have colour excess E(B-V) values up to 0.75, indicating significant dust attenuation in some of them. In addition, half of the massive galaxies have best-fit ages comparable to the age of the Universe at those redshifts, which suggests that their progenitors were formed very early in cosmic time. About 78% of the massive galaxies lie on the star-forming main sequence (MS) in the SFR-M* plane, ~12% are found in the starburst region, and 10% in the transition zone between the MS and starbursts. We find no significant evidence for outshining or AGN contamination that could account for the elevated specific star-formation rates (sSFR) observed in the ~12% of galaxies classified as starbursts.</description>

      <title>Formation of Close Binaries through Massive Black Hole Perturbations and Chaotic Tides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hills breakup of binary systems allows massive black holes (MBH) to produce hyper-velocity stars (HVSs) and tightly bound stars. The long timescale of orbital relaxation means that binaries must spend numerous orbits around the MBH before they are tidally broken apart. Repeated MBH tidal perturbations over multiple pericenter passages can perturb the binary inner orbit to high eccentricities, leading to strong tidal interactions between the stars. In this work, we develop a physical model of the MBH-binary system, taking into account outer orbital relaxation, MBH tidal perturbations, and tidal interactions between the binaries in the form of dynamical tides. We show that when the inner orbit reaches high eccentricities such that the pericenter radius is only a few times stellar radii ($R_*$), the stellar oscillation modes can grow chaotically and rapidly harden the binaries to semi-major axes $a_b\lesssim 10\,R_*$. We find that a significant fraction (up to 50\%) of initially wide binaries that are in the empty loss-cone regime ($a_b\sim 1.0\,{\rm AU}$) do not undergo Hills breakup as wide binaries, but instead experience chaotic growth of tides and become close binaries. These tidally hardened binaries provide a new channel for the production of the fastest HVSs, and are connected to other nuclear transients such as repeating partial tidal disruption events and quasi-periodic eruptions.</description>

      <title>First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES) XX: Comparing semi-analytic models at high-redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore how the choice of galaxy formation model affects the predicted properties of high-redshift galaxies. Using the FLARES zoom resimulation strategy, we compare the EAGLE hydrodynamics model and the GALFORM, L-Galaxies, SC-SAM and SHARK semi-analytic models (SAMs) at $5\leq z \leq 12$. The first part of our analysis examines the stellar mass functions, stellar-to-halo mass relations, star formation rates, and supermassive black hole (SMBH) properties predicted by the different models. Comparisons are made with observations, where relevant. We find general agreement between the range of predicted and observed stellar mass functions. The model predictions differ considerably when it comes to SMBH properties, with GALFORM and SHARK predicting between 1.5-3 dex more massive SMBHs ($M_{\rm BH}&gt;10^6\ {\rm M_\odot}$) than L-Galaxies and SC-SAM, depending on redshift. The second half of our analysis focuses on passive galaxies. We show that in L-Galaxies and SC-SAM, environmental quenching of satellites is the prevalent quenching mechanism, with active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback having little effect at the redshifts probed. On the other hand, $\sim40\%$ of passive galaxies predicted by GALFORM and SHARK are quenched by AGN feedback at $z=5$. The SAMs are an interesting contrast to the EAGLE model, in which AGN feedback is essential for the formation of passive galaxies, in both satellites and centrals, even at high redshift.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Orbital Anisotropy Assumptions in Lensing-Dynamics Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate potential systematic biases introduced by assumptions regarding stellar orbital anisotropy in joint lensing-dynamics modeling. Our study employs the massive early-type galaxies from the TNG100 simulation at redshifts z = 0.2, 0.5, and 0.7. Based on the simulated galaxies, we generate a self-consistent mock dataset containing both lensing and stellar kinematic observables. This is achieved through taking the potential composed of both dark matter and baryons of the simulated galaxies, plus the radial variation of the stellar orbit anisotropy depicted by a logistic function. By integrating constraints from both lensing and stellar kinematics, we separate the contributions of stars and dark matter inside the galaxies. Under three commonly adopted stellar anisotropy assumptions (isotropic orbits, constant anisotropy, and the Osipkov-Merritt profile), the model inferences suggest that the systematic biases in the total stellar mass and central dark matter fraction are not significant. Specifically, the total stellar mass on average is underestimated by less than $0.03\pm0.10$ $\rm dex$ while the dark matter fraction experiences only a statistically insignificant increase of less than $2\%\pm10\%$ at the population level. The dark matter inner density slope in our tests is over-predicted by $0.15\pm0.2$. Additionally, these lacks of significant biases are insensitive to the discrepancies between the assumed anisotropy in modeling and the ground truth orbital anisotropy of mock sample. Our results suggest that conventional assumptions regarding orbital anisotropy, such as an isotropic profile or the Osipkov-Merritt model, would not introduce a significant systematic bias when inferring galaxy mass density distribution at the population level.</description>

      <title>Dual core system candidates: a sample of objects with large velocity offset between absorption and narrow emission lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a sample of 28 objects at z&lt;0.3 from Data Release 16 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS DR16) with large velocity offset (&gt; 200 km/s) of narrow H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$ emission lines relative to absorption lines. Diagnostic classification via the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich diagram indicates that the sample comprises 12 AGNs, 12 composite galaxies, 3 H{\sc ii} galaxies, and 1 object of uncertain classification. A strong correlation is found between stellar mass and velocity dispersion. We examine the asymmetries of the narrow H$\beta$ and find that the correlation between velocity offset and narrow H$\beta$ skewness is negligible in both blue-shifted and red-shifted systems, suggesting that the rotating disk model may not fully explain the observed kinematics. The sample exhibits an asymmetric velocity offset distribution, with more red-shifted (17) than blue-shifted (11) objects. No significant correlation is observed between velocity offset and line width in blue-shifted systems, while red-shifted systems show a weak anti-correlation for narrow H$\alpha$, which is inconsistent with the outflow model. The similarity in velocity offset between narrow emission lines supports the dual core system. Furthermore, the SDSS photometric images reveal eight objects with two cores and two with merger features. Based on the narrow emission line properties, the objects in our sample represent strong candidates for dual core systems exhibiting velocity offset. Extending this property to higher-redshift populations in the near future may facilitate the identification of merging supermassive black hole pairs at earlier cosmic epochs, providing critical constraints on their formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>3D extinction maps of the Milky Way disc from Gaia GSP-Spec parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D maps of interstellar dust are crucial for understanding the structure of the Milky Way interstellar medium to apply correction to astrophysical observations affected by dust. We aim at providing new extinction estimates in the Gaia BP/RP bands to study the dust distribution in the disc, to provide new views of the spatial distribution of extinction and to compare it with tracers of the Galactic spiral arms. We use a highly homogeneous method based on the spectral chemo-physical parametrisation of stars from Gaia General Stellar Parametriser-Spectroscopy (GSP-Spec). This catalogue of 5.6 million stars in DR3, presents the advantage of estimating the stellar atmospheric parameters independently of extinction. The extinction is calculated by comparing the observed stellar (BP-RP) colours in the Gaia bands with the theoretical ones assuming a theoretical Teff-log(g)-[M/H] relation, from the GSP-Spec parameters. Publicly available, 3D high-resolution maps around the Sun are produced through the computation of differential extinction by discretising the dataset into spherical coordinates. Our large scale map covers a region of 4x4x0.8 kpc centred on the Sun with a discretisation of (dr,d{\theta},d{\phi})=(40pc,1{\deg},1{\deg}). To exploit the higher number of stars in the Sun proximity, we created a smaller scale map focused on the Local Bubble area, with a volume of 1x1x0.8 kpc and a finer discretisation of (dr,d{\theta},d{\phi})=(30pc,1{\deg},1{\deg}). The produced extinction maps exhibit a strong spatial correlation with molecular clouds and the spiral arms. Interestingly, several regions of the map are consistently present in different tracers as density of gas, of young stars and the chemical pattern of the spiral arms. Our study unveils the link between the distribution of dust, gas, and stars governing the chemical and dynamical evolution of the spiral arms in the Galactic framework.</description>

      <title>Chemically primitive dwarf accretion reignites the inner disk assembly of Malin 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed kinematic and stellar population analysis of the inner disk of Malin 1, a giant low surface brightness (GLSB) galaxy with a prominent SB0-type central morphology. AstroSat far-UV imaging reveals clumpy emission features indicating recent star formation. Using MUSE integral field spectroscopy, we identify four star-forming complexes (SFCs) within the inner 10 kpc, each associated with localized ionized gas emission in distinct H$\alpha$ velocity channels. Two of the SFCs, including a far-UV clump, appear on the blue-shifted side ($V_{H\alpha}=-230~\mathrm{kms^{-1}}$), while the other two are redshifted. The far-UV clump shows a strong velocity offset ($\sim150~\mathrm{kms^{-1}}$) and high gas dispersion ($\sim250~\mathrm{kms^{-1}}$), indicating that it is kinematically decoupled from the rotating disk. The spatial and velocity isolation of these features in the channel map confirms they do not follow regular disk rotation.
  The far-UV clump hosts young (250-500 Myr), extremely metal-poor ([M/H]$\simeq$ -1.69) and $\alpha$-enriched ($[\alpha/Fe] \sim 0.5$) stellar populations, sharply contrasting with the surrounding super-solar gas-phase metallicity. The young stellar populations in each SFC are chemically distinct (similar to the far-UV clump) from the enriched central ISM, indicating rapid, local star formation from primitive gas before efficient mixing with the enriched ISM. Their spatial and velocity segregation, age synchronicity, and chemical homogeneity suggest an origin of gas delivered by a disrupted, gas-rich dwarf on a high-inclination (off-plane) orbit. These results suggest that the central HSB within $\rm \sim 9^{\prime\prime} (14\ kpc)$ radius component of Malin 1 has grown through discrete, externally driven accretion, contributing to its complex, hybrid disk morphology.</description>

      <title>Metallicity Effects on Machine Learning Classification of Dusty Stellar Sources in the Magellanic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differences in metallicity between the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) offer an opportunity to examine whether environmental metallicity affects the performance of machine learning models in classifying dusty stellar sources. The five stellar classes studied include young stellar objects (YSOs), red supergiants (RSGs), post-asymptotic giant branch stars (PAGBs), and oxygen- and carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars (OAGBs and CAGBs), which are key phases of stellar evolution involved in dust production. Using spectroscopically labeled data from the Surveying the Agents of Galaxy Evolution (SAGE) project, we trained and evaluated a probabilistic random forest (PRF) classifier with four approaches: (1) separate training on LMC and SMC, including all five classes, (2) excluding the underpopulated PAGB class, (3) combined LMC and SMC datasets, and (4) cross-galaxy training and testing. The model achieved 93\% accuracy on the SMC and 88\% on the LMC across all five classes. In the SMC, PAGB sources were misclassified as YSOs, mainly because of their small sample size (4 objects). When PAGB was excluded, both the LMC and the SMC reached 92\% accuracy. A combined dataset produced the same accuracy, and cross-galaxy training yielded similar results, indicating that metallicity does not significantly impact model performance. A comparison of absolute CMDs for the LMC and SMC confirms their similarity in stellar populations. These findings suggest that environmental metallicity has little effect on ML-based classification of dusty stellar sources, supporting the use of combined datasets and cross-galaxy models in low-metallicity environments.</description>

      <title>Examining Turbulence in Galactic Molecular Clouds - II: Continuity of Turbulence Cascading in a Portion of the Local Arm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use $^{12}$CO (J=1-0) MWISP data to study turbulence in a segment of the Local Arm. Velocity slices at different kinematic distances show similar spatial power spectra (SPSs) and structure functions (SFs), demonstrating that the entire region forms a single turbulent field with a cascade extending from $\sim 400$ pc to sub-parsec scales. The SPS slopes of both the intensity and velocity fields exhibit a systematic scale dependence that approaches the values expected from turbulence models. Cloud-to-cloud VSFs follow similar trends to the pixel-by-pixel VSFs in the extended self-similarity (ESS) scaling, indicating that velocity differences among clouds arise from large-scale turbulent motions. Velocity- and intensity-increment maps reveal filamentary, intermittent structures. The PDFs of the velocity increments display strong non-Gaussianity and are well fitted by the normal inverse gaussian (NIG) distribution, whereas the intensity increments show much weaker tails. A simple energetic estimate suggests that Galactic differential rotation is able to supply the large-scale shear required to maintain the observed turbulence.</description>

      <title>Made-to-Measure Outperforms Schwarzschild's Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Syer and Tremaine's made-to-measure method and Schwarzschild's orbit superposition method are well-known within the field of stellar dynamical modeling. This research is concerned with assessing and comparing the operational capabilities of the two methods and, in particular, the impact on observable reproduction, orbit classifications and computer elapsed times when using low orbit numbers (8000 orbits) with different observational data sets and initial conditions. Both methods are able to reproduce observed data with mean $\chi^2 \approx 1$ or less. However, the made-to-measure process does so three to five times faster than the orbit superposition method, and this starts to make the made-to-measure process attractive for analyzing galaxy surveys. For a given set of initial conditions, both methods produce similar orbit classifications but the orbits behind the classifications are not the same. Orbits which are common do not have the same weights. Different initial conditions result in different classifications.</description>

      <title>The influence of AGN feedback on star formation in red spiral galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the influence of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback on star formation in red spiral galaxies by analyzing a sample of 324 red and 273 blue face-on spirals selected from 115 low-redshift galaxy clusters. This multi-wavelength dataset combines optical emission line data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with X-ray fluxes from Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray space telescopes. Using diagnostic emission line ratios, we constructed Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagrams, introduced in 1981 to classify galaxies based on nuclear activity. Our analysis reveals that most red spirals exhibit AGN or low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) signatures, based on optical data, as determined by their location in the BPT, Cid Fernandes, and Mazzolari diagrams. These results are consistent with the presence of negative feedback from AGNs quenching star formation. Conversely, X-ray analysis reveals that many blue spirals exhibit high X-ray luminosities and are situated in the AGN region of emission line ratio diagrams, suggesting that AGN-driven positive feedback may be enhancing star formation. Our findings support the hypothesis that AGN feedback plays a key role in the evolution of spiral galaxies, particularly in quenching star formation and driving the transition from blue to red spiral systems.</description>

      <title>Sub-millimeter galaxies in hierarchical models: revisiting the need for a top-heavy stellar initial mass function with Bayesian optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of high-redshift sub-millimetre galaxies (SMGs) remain controversial within hierarchical structure formation models. We revisit whether a top-heavy stellar initial mass function (IMF) in starbursts is required to reproduce both SMG observations and local galaxy properties. Using Bayesian optimisation, we perform an extensive search of the 15-dimensional parameter space of the GALFORM semi-analytical model. This efficient approach converges to optimal parameter values in fewer than 200 model evaluations, representing orders of magnitude fewer runs than traditional methods. We test whether GALFORM can simultaneously match three key observational constraints: the $z=0$ $K$-band luminosity function, the SMG number counts at 850~$\mu$m, and the SMG redshift distribution. We consider two model variants: one with a universal solar neighbourhood IMF for all star formation, and another allowing the IMF slope in starbursts to vary as a free parameter. When assuming a universal Chabrier IMF, we find no parameter combination that simultaneously reproduces all three datasets. The model either matches the SMG constraints while grossly overpredicting the local $K$-band luminosity function, or matches the local luminosity function while severely underpredicting SMG counts by factors of 3--100. In contrast, allowing a top-heavy IMF in starbursts enables excellent simultaneous fits to all constraints. The best-fitting model prefers an IMF slope parameter $x \approx 0.7$ (where d$n$/dlog$m \propto m^{-x}$), somewhat more top-heavy than recent models but less extreme than early proposals. Our comprehensive parameter space exploration definitively confirms that, within the GALFORM framework, a top-heavy IMF in starbursts is necessary to reconcile high-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies with local galaxy populations.</description>

      <title>From Images to Physics: Probabilistic Inference of Galaxy Parameters and Emission Lines via VAE &amp; Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a Variational Autoencoder (VAE)--Normalizing Flow (NF) framework for rapid probabilistic inference of galaxy properties and emission line fluxes at $z \leq 0.3$ from SDSS \textit{gri} imaging and photometry. Our model probabilistically infers stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), redshift, gas-phase metallicity, and central black hole mass for a given galaxy. The model accruacy matches current non-spectroscopic methods for stellar mass and redshift, surpasses them for SFR and metallicity, and introduces the first probabilistic central black hole mass estimates from imaging + photometry. It also delivers probabilistic estimates of H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, [N~\textsc{ii}], and [O~\textsc{iii}] emission line fluxes directly from imaging, enabling SFR, metallicity, dust, and AGN/shock diagnostics without spectroscopy. This approach opens new pathways for scalable, physics-informed inference in upcoming surveys such as Roman and Rubin LSST.</description>

      <title>Near-infrared [P II] and [Fe II] line mapping of Galactic supernova remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phosphorus (P) is one of the key ingredients for life, yet its origins in galaxies remain poorly understood. In order to investigate the production of P by supernovae, we performed near-infrared (IR) [P II] and [Fe II] line mapping of 26 Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) with the Infrared Survey Facility and Kanata telescopes, using the narrow-band filters tuned to these lines. By combining our data with archival [Fe II] maps from UKIRT, we detected both the [P II] and [Fe II] emissions in five SNRs, only the [Fe II] emission in 15 SNRs, and no line emissions in the remaining six. Using the observed [P II]/[Fe II] ratios and upper limits for non-detections, we derived the P/Fe abundance ratios, which vary by up to two orders of magnitude among our sample SNRs. This suggests that the production rate of P and/or the degree of dust destruction may differ from remnant to remnant, the latter being due to the fact that P is volatile while Fe is mostly locked in dust grains. We used the mid- and far-IR maps to examine the dust content for the five SNRs where both the line emissions are detected. As a result, we find that high P/Fe abundance ratios in the northern and southeastern regions of Cassiopeia A and the Crab Nebula, respectively, are not likely due to dust destruction but may reflect an asymmetric ejection of P during supernova explosions. In the Crab Nebula, it is also possible that near-IR [Ni II] emission contaminates the observed flux in the southeastern region, suggesting that the Ni/Fe abundance ratio, rather than the P/Fe abundance ratio, is relatively high in this part of the remnant.</description>

      <title>AGN feedback in merging galaxies with a SMUGGLE multiphase ISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fast nuclear winds driven by Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) feedback in merging galaxies using high-resolution hydrodynamics simulations. We use Stars and MUltiphase Gas in GaLaxiEs (SMUGGLE) to explicitly model the multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) and employ sub-grid dynamical friction for massive black holes (BHs). Furthermore, we use a super-Lagrangian refinement scheme to resolve AGN feedback coupling to the ISM at $\sim10-100\,$pc scales. By comparison between merging and isolated galaxies, with and without AGN feedback, we identify trends in the complex interplay between dynamics, BH fueling and feedback, and star formation and feedback. We consider three galaxy types: Milky Way analogs, Sbc-type galaxies, and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) analogs. The synergy between AGN feedback and merger dynamics is strongest in the Milky Way-like mergers, where the AGN winds are energetically dominant and entrain more gas when the initially thin disks become thick and amorphous during the merger. In contrast, the merger of thicker, vigorously star-forming Sbc galaxies is not strongly impacted by AGN feedback until star formation declines in the post-merger phase. Finally, while the sub-grid dynamical friction prescription effectively retains BHs in galactic nuclei during more massive mergers, the clumpy multiphase ISM induces significant wandering of low-mass BHs $\mathrm{(&lt;10^5M_\odot)}$ in the shallow potentials of the SMC-like galaxies. These low-mass BHs wander at distances $\gtrsim 2$ kpc from the galactic center, yielding negligible BH accretion and feedback. This has implications for LISA event rates and present a further challenge to understanding the rapid growth of $z\sim7-10$ quasars discovered by JWST.</description>

      <title>Infrared photometry and CaT spectroscopy of the most metal-poor in-situ globular cluster VVV-CL001</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Globular clusters in the Galactic bulge are difficult to study due to high extinction and severe crowding. VVV-CL001 is an old, metal-poor, and fast cluster in the inner bulge, whose extreme properties make it a key probe of the early chemical and dynamical evolution of the Milky Way. We derive its fundamental parameters by combining spectroscopy, astrometry, and near-infrared photometry. Metallicity and radial velocity were measured from medium-resolution FORS2/VLT spectra; proper motions from Gaia DR3; and FourStar/Magellan photometry was used to refine the cluster centre, derive its structure, and estimate age, distance, and reddening. VVV-CL001 is confirmed to be an old ($12.1^{+1.0}_{-1.2}$ Gyr), metal-poor ($[\text{Fe}/\text{H}] = -2.25 \pm 0.05$) cluster at a heliocentric distance of $7.1^{+1.3}_{-1.1}$ kpc, with reddening $E(J-K_s) = 1.40^{+0.01}_{-0.02}$. Its mean proper motions are $\mu_\alpha^* = -3.68 \pm 0.09$ and $\mu_\delta = -1.76 \pm 0.10$ mas yr$^{-1}$, and its radial velocity is $-334 \pm 4$ km s$^{-1}$. The orbit is eccentric ($e = 0.76^{+0.10}_{-0.14}$), confined to the inner Galaxy ($|Z|_{\max} \approx 1$ kpc) and within the bar's influence ($R &lt; 5$ kpc), with pericentre $0.6^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ kpc and apocentre $4.5^{+2.5}_{-1.2}$ kpc. Its old age, low metallicity, and orbital properties support an in-situ origin, identifying VVV-CL001 as one of the most metal-poor inner-Galaxy clusters formed in the early Milky Way. It likely belongs to the primordial disk cluster population later trapped by the bar, making it a fossil remnant of the earliest phases of Galactic assembly.</description>

      <title>Constraining r-process nucleosynthesis with multi-objective Galactic chemical evolution models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The astrophysical site(s) of the r-process are uncertain, with candidates such as neutron star mergers and magneto-rotational supernovae predicting different event rates, delay times, and heavy-element yields. Galactic chemical evolution models constrain these properties by comparing model predictions with observed abundances. We explore, in a systematic and data-driven way, the astrophysical conditions under which r-process enrichment can reproduce the observed trends of multiple neutron-capture elements in the Milky Way. Rather than assuming a fixed site, we adopt a flexible, parametric approach to test whether a common set of r-process parameters can explain the chemical evolution of several heavy elements. We compute a grid of one-infall, homogeneous models varying: Eu yield per event, r-process event rate, enrichment delay time, and progenitor mass range. For each of the $\sim 1.5 \times 10^5$ models, we predict [X/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] trends by scaling Eu yields with the solar r-process pattern. A multi-objective optimisation based on Pareto fronts identifies models that best reproduce the abundance trends. Best-fitting models favour short delay times ($\leq 30\ \rm Myr$), low-mass progenitors ($\sim 20-25\ \rm M_\odot$), and an effective Eu injection of $\sim 2 \times 10^{-7}\ \rm M_\odot$ per event. Stars more massive than $\sim 80\ \rm M_\odot$ are too rare to dominate the enrichment. While heavy elements can be reproduced, lighter ones show stronger conflicts with Eu, reflecting that the solar r-process scaling relation becomes less valid toward lighter elements. No single class of r-process events, under solar-scaled yields, can explain light and heavy neutron-capture elements; at least two components are required: a main r-process consistent with solar and r-rich stars, and a weaker component producing enhanced light r-process elements, similar to that observed in r-poor stars.</description>

      <title>The PAH 3.4 micron feature as a tracer of shielding in the Orion Bar and NGC 6240</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have carried out a detailed analysis of the 3.4 micron spectral feature arising from Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH), using JWST archival data. For the first time in an external galaxy (NGC 6240), we have identified two distinct spectral components of the PAH 3.4 micron feature: a shorter wavelength component at 3.395 micron, which we attribute to short aliphatic chains tightly attached to the aromatic rings of the PAH molecules; and a longer wavelength feature at 3.405 microns that arises from longer, more fragile, aliphatic chains that are weakly attached to the parent PAH molecule. These longer chains are more easily destroyed by far-ultraviolet photons (&gt;5eV) and PAH thermal emission only occurs where PAH molecules are shielded from more energetic photons by dense molecular gas. We see a very strong correlation in the morphology of the PAH 3.395 micron feature with the PAH 3.3 micron emission, the latter arising from robust aromatic PAH molecules. We also see an equally strong correlation between the PAH 3.405 micron morphology and the warm molecular gas, as traced by H2 vibrational lines. We show that the flux ratio PAH_3.395/PAH_3.405 &lt; 0.3 corresponds strongly to regions where the PAH molecules are shielded by dense molecular gas, so that only modestly energetic UV photons penetrate to excite the PAHs. Our work shows that PAH 3.405 micron and PAH 3.395 micron emission features can provide robust diagnostics of the physical conditions of the interstellar medium in external galaxies, and can be used to quantify the energies of the photon field penetrating molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>High Resolution Observations of CO(3-2) in Haro 2: Cool Molecular Outflows of a Ly$\alpha$ Emitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Haro 2 is a blue compact dwarf galaxy and the closest (at 21Mpc) known $Ly\alpha$ emitter. UV and optical observations have found Haro 2 to be immersed in shells of partly ionized gas expanding at $\sim200$km/s. Observations of CO(2-1) (Becket et al 2020; Paper 1) with moderate ($2^{\prime\prime}$) resolution discovered a large-scale one-sided outflow associated with a soft X-ray bubble and apparently driven by the young star clusters created in the recent starburst. We present here SMA observations of CO(3-2) with $1.1^{\prime\prime}$ resolution in Haro 2. The opposite-side component of the large molecular outflow is detected lying in the direction of the fast ionized outflow; it is very confined in area. An additional outflow is apparent in the CO(3-2); it is south-east of the galaxy in a region holding weak star formation and a moderate-luminosity hard X-ray source. All the molecular outflow and filament velocities are within $\lesssim\pm50$km/s of the systemic velocity of the galaxy.</description>

      <title>A Fleeting GLIMPSE of N/O Enrichment at Cosmic Dawn: Evidence for Wolf Rayet N Stars in a z = 6.1 Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of extreme nitrogen enrichment by Wolf Rayet nitrogen stars (WN) in the metal-poor ($\sim10\%Z_\odot$), lensed, compact ($R_{\rm eff}\sim20$ pc) galaxy RXCJ2248 at $z=6.1$, revealed by unprecedentedly deep JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution spectroscopy from the GLIMPSE-D Survey. The exquisite S/N reveals multiple high-ionization nebular lines and broad Balmer and [OIII] components (FWHM$\sim700-3000$ km s$^{-1}$). We detect broadened HeII $\lambda$1640 and $\lambda$4687 (FWHM$\sim530$ km s$^{-1}$) and strong NIII] $\lambda$4642 emission consistent with a population of WN stars, making RXCJ2248 the most distant galaxy with confirmed WR features to date. We measure the multi-phase nebular density across five ions, the direct-method metallicity ($12+\log(\rm O/H)= 7.749\pm0.023$), and a non-uniform elemental enrichment pattern of extreme N/O enhancement ($\log(\rm N/O)=-0.390\pm0.035$ from N$^+$, N$^{+2}$, and N$^{+3}$) and suppressed C/O relative to empirical C/N trends. We show that this abundance pattern can be explained by enrichment from a dual-burst with a low WC/WN ratio, as expected at low metallicities. Crucially, these signatures can only arise during a brief, rare evolutionary window shortly after a burst ($\sim3-6$ Myr), when WN stars dominate chemical feedback but before dilution by later yields (e.g., supernovae). The observed frequency of strong N emitters at high$-z$ implies a $\sim50$ Myr burst duty cycle, suggesting that N/O outliers may represent a brief but ubiquitous phase in the evolution of highly star-forming early galaxies. The detection in RXCJ2248, therefore, provides the first direct evidence of WN-driven chemical enrichment in the early Universe and a novel timing argument for the bursty star formation cycles that shaped galaxies at cosmic dawn.</description>

      <title>Sense and Sensitivity - I. Uncertainty analysis of the gas-phase chemistry in AGB outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical reaction networks are central to all chemical models. Each rate coefficient has an associated uncertainty, which is generally not taken into account when calculating the chemistry. We performed the first uncertainty analysis of a chemical model of C-rich and O-rich AGB outflows using the Rate22 reaction network. Quantifying the error on the model predictions enables us to determine the need for adding complexity to the model. Using a Monte Carlo sampling method, we quantified the impact of the uncertainties on the chemical kinetic data on the predicted fractional abundances and column densities. The errors are caused by a complex interplay of reactions forming and destroying each species. Parent species show an error on their envelope sizes, which is not caused by the uncertainty on their photodissociation rate, but rather the chemistry reforming the parent after its photodissociation. Using photodissociation models to estimate the envelope size might be an oversimplification. The error on the CO envelope impacts retrieved mass-loss rates by up to a factor of two. For daughter species, the error on the peak fractional abundance ranges from a factor of a few to three orders of magnitude, and is on average about 10\% of its value. This error is positively correlated with the error on the column density. The standard model suffices for many species, e.g., the radial distribution of cyanopolyynes and hydrocarbon radicals around IRC +10216. However, including spherical asymmetries, dust-gas chemistry, and photochemistry induced by a close-by stellar companion are still necessary to explain certain observations.</description>

      <title>JWST observes the assembly of a massive galaxy at z~4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST observations of the radio galaxy TGSSJ1530+1049, spectroscopically confirmed at $z=4.0$. NIRCam images and NIRSpec/IFU spectroscopy ($R=2700$) show that TGSSJ1530+1049 is part of one of the densest-known structures of continuum and line-emitting objects found at these redshifts. NIRCam images show a number of distinct continuum objects and evidence of interactions traced by diffuse emission, and the NIRSpec IFU cube reveals further strong line emitting regions. We identify six continuum and four additional strong Halpha emitting sources with weaker or no underlying continuum within the 3''x3'' IFU field. From spatial alignment with high-resolution radio data and emission line profiles, the radio AGN host galaxy is clearly identified. The bright Halpha emission (but not the optical components) is distributed remarkably linearly along the radio axis, suggestive of a biconical illumination zone by a central obscured AGN. The emission line kinematics indicate jet-gas interactions on scales of a few kpc. However, due to large relative velocities and presence of underlying continuum, the alignment with the radio structure appears to be, at least partly, caused by a particular configuration of interacting galaxies. At least four objects within a 10x10 (projected) kpc^2 area which includes the radio source have high stellar masses (log($M_\star/M_\odot)&gt;10.3$) and star formation rates in the range 70-163 $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Using a stellar mass-based analysis, we predict a total dark matter halo mass of $\approx10^{13} M_\odot$. Based on the physical separations and velocity differences between the galaxies, it is expected that these galaxies will merge to form a massive galaxy within a few Gyr. The system qualitatively resembles the forming brightest cluster galaxies in cosmological simulations that form early through a rapid succession of mergers.</description>

      <title>High-resolution radio imaging of TGSSJ1530+1049, a radio galaxy in a dense environment at z=4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-redshift radio galaxies can provide insights into the structure formation and galaxy evolution at earlier cosmological epochs. TGSSJ1530+1049 was selected as a candidate high-redshift radio galaxy. Subsequent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) presented in a companion paper (Saxena et al., submitted) have shown that it is located at a redshift z=4.0. The JWST data furthermore showed that the radio source is part of one of the densest structures of galaxies and ionized gas known at these redshifts. The complex system qualitatively resembles a massive (cluster) galaxy forming early through a rapid succession of mergers. TGSSJ1530+1049 is an unresolved source down to ~0.6" scale in multiple radio surveys. To reveal its high-resolution radio structure and allow for a detailed comparison with JWST observations, we studied its morphology at various angular scales with different radio interferometric instruments. We observed TGSSJ1530+1049 at milliarcsecond (mas) scale angular resolution with the European VLBI Network (EVN), and at ~100-mas scale resolution with the enhanced Multi-Element Remotely Linked Interferometer Network (e-MERLIN). We recovered a complex north--south oriented structure with steep-spectrum radio-emitting features, which are associated with lobes and hot spots of a jetted active galactic nucleus. The centre of the radio galaxy proved to be too faint at cm wavelengths to be unambiguously detected in our observations. Nevertheless, the linear size (~5.5 kpc) and the radio power place it among the so-called medium-sized symmetric objects, a smaller and/or confined version of larger radio galaxies. Comparison between the radio morphology and that of the ionized gas observed by JWST shows that the two are closely aligned. However, the optical emission line gas extends out to ~25 kpc, which is well beyond the detected radio structures. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>The Scatter of the Many Outweighs the Scatter of the Few: Systematic Error Asymmetry in Steeply-Falling Mass Functions for High-Redshift JWST Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of massive, high redshift galaxies with JWST has been argued to challenge $\Lambda$CDM: such systems would require extremely rare halos and baryon-to-stellar-mass conversion efficiencies unphysically approaching--or exceeding--100%. If confirmed at galaxy formation forbidden efficiencies, these galaxies could signal new physics beyond standard cosmological structure formation. We develop a galaxy model framework that ties the linear power spectrum to the inferred efficiencies of galaxy growth in order to test the structure formation models. In addition, we incorporate multiple sources of error, including (i) observational sample variance, (ii) asymmetric scatter induced by the steepness of the high-mass halo tail, and (iii) systematic uncertainties in stellar mass estimates. We find that the inferred efficiency of star formation is dominated by systematic uncertainties on the spectral energy distribution inferred stellar mass of the JWST detected galaxies. The systematic uncertainty augments the asymmetry in scatter that largely brings the inferred efficiencies to be in line with that expected from early galaxy formation models. Our framework can be used to test $\Lambda$CDM as errors are reduced and further detections are made.</description>

      <title>A new estimate of the zero-point shift of the Gaia DR3 parallaxes obtained from a comparison with VLBI measurements of masers and radio stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most complete sample of radio stars and masers with trigonometric parallaxes measured by the VLBI method, common with the Gaia EDR3 and Gaia DR3 catalogs, has been compiled using literature data. The sample contains 151 stars. An analysis of the differences in parallaxes and proper motions of Gaia-VLBI stars has been performed. A new estimate of the systematic shift of the Gaia parallax zero point relative to the inertial coordinate system has been obtained: $\Delta\pi=-0.038\pm0.011$ mas. The obtained estimates of the relative rotation rates confirm the absence of a significant rotation of the Gaia\,DR3 system relative to the extragalactic coordinate system, which in this case is represented by VLBI measurements.</description>

      <title>Clustering effects on the Dark Siren determination of $H_0$: A simulation study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) offer an alternative way to measure the Hubble parameter. The optimal technique, the ``bright siren'' approach, requires the identification of an electromagnetic counterpart. However, a significant fraction of gravitational waves signals will not have counterparts. Such events can still constrain the Hubble parameter $H_0$ via statistical methods, exploiting galaxy information from the GWs sky localisation volume. In this work, we investigate the power of this method using high-resolution, cosmological simulations that include realistic clustering. We find that clustering leads to increased convergence of the $H_0$ posteriors, with clear recovery of the input value as early as $N_{\rm gw}=40$ events, compared to uniform catalogues, where the posterior remains largely unconstrained, even with $N_{\rm gw}=100$ events. In addition, we quantify the role of catalogue incompleteness. We show that catalogues with completeness levels as low as $f=25\%$ can be competitive with fully complete catalogues, confirming the impact of clustering. Completeness levels of $f=50\%$ perform statistically similar to complete catalogues with as few as $N_{\rm gw}=40$ events. This indicates the need to focus on improving gravitational waves detection capabilities, rather than obtaining more complete galaxy catalogues. Finally, we investigate additional properties of the method by taking into consideration physical weights, different observational errors, potential biases from the $H_0$ priors, a variety of detectors' horizon distances, and different methods of catalogue completion and statistical analysis.</description>

      <title>Mock Observations for the CSST Mission: Multi-Channel Imager--Instrument Simulation</title>

Abstract: The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST), a two-meter aperture astronomical space telescope under China's manned space program, is equipped with multiple back-end scientific instruments. As an astronomical precision measurement module of the CSST, the Multi-Channel Imager (MCI) can cover a wide wavelength range from ultraviolet to near-infrared with three-color simultaneous high-precision photometry and imaging, which meets the scientific requirements for various fields. The diverse scientific objectives of MCI require not only a robust airborne platform, advanced optical systems, and observing facilities but also comprehensive software support for scientific operations and research. To this end, it is essential to develop realistic observational simulation software to thoroughly evaluate the MCI data stream and provide calibration tools for future scientific investigations. The MCI instrument simulation software will serve as a foundation for the development of the MCI data processing pipeline and will facilitate improvements in both hardware and software, as well as in the observational operation strategy, in alignment with the mission's scientific goals. In conclusion, we present a comprehensive overview of the MCI instrument simulation and some corresponding performances of the MCI data processing pipeline.</description>

      <title>Mock Observations for the CSST Mission: Integral Field Spectrograph--Instrument Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) is a next-generation Stage-IV facility renowned for its wide field of view, high image quality, and multi-band observational capabilities. Among the five instruments onboard the CSST, the Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) offers the unique ability to simultaneously capture spatial and spectral information across a field of view of no less than $6^{''}\times6^{''}$. Key advantages of the IFS include a high spatial resolution of $0.2^{''}$ and a broad spectral coverage from 350 to 1000 nm, making it an ideal instrument for studying physical processes in the vicinity of supermassive black holes within galaxies. To more accurately assess the technical and scientific performance of the CSST-IFS, it is essential to develop a simulation tool that incorporates realistic effects from all optical components. Such a simulation will form an integral part of the CSST-IFS data and pipeline system, enabling the development of the data reduction pipeline well ahead of actual observations. This paper presents an end-to-end simulation workflow for the CSST-IFS, incorporating a wide range of instrumental effects that may influence its spectral and imaging performance. The simulation accounts for optical diffraction effects introduced by all components, such as image slicers and slit array, as well as sub-pixel effects from gratings. It also includes various detector noises, frame-shifting effects, and charge-transfer inefficiency. Real observational conditions--such as target Doppler shift, cosmic rays, and other in-orbit operational effects--are also considered. We describe the technical implementation of the simulation and present results that quantitatively characterize key instrument parameters.</description>

      <title>Unraveling eMSTO in NGC 2355: Stellar Rotation and Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extended Main Sequence Turn-off (eMSTO) in the open cluster NGC 2355 is investigated using precise astrometry and photometry from Gaia DR3 and spectroscopic data from the Gaia-ESO Survey. We find a clear positive correlation between the rotational velocity (v sin i) and color of eMSTO stars, supporting the role of stellar rotation and gravity darkening in causing the observed color spread. Contrary to predictions from binary tidal-locking scenarios, spatial distribution analysis reveals that fast-rotating stars are preferentially concentrated in the cluster's central regions. This finding provides the observational evidence favoring star-disk interactions during the pre-main-sequence phase, rather than tidal locking in binaries, as the primary mechanism responsible for the origin of rotational spread in eMSTO stars.</description>

      <title>IdentYS: A Python-Based Tool for Identifying Young Stars in Star-Forming Regions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on young stellar populations is essential to understand the properties of embedded clusters and advance theories of their formation. This has driven advancements in methodologies for star detection, leading to the development of valuable databases and software. We present the scientific justification and operating principles of the IdentYS tool, which is designed to identify young stellar objects (YSOs) in star-forming regions. The tool facilitates the identification of young stars with infrared (IR) excess in remote and embedded star-forming regions, focusing primarily on Class I and II YSOs. For this purpose, near- and mid-IR photometric data and five colour-colour diagrams (J - H) vs. (H - K), K - [3.6] vs. [3.6] - [4.5], [3.6] - [4.5] vs. [5.8] - [8.0], [3.6] - [4.5] vs. [8.0] - [24], and [3.4] - [4.6] vs. [4.6] - [12] are used. The purity of the YSOs sample is enhanced by excluding field contamination from stellar and extragalactic objects. As a result, we compile a list of YSO candidates displaying the source designation, astrometric, and photometric parameters, as well as information on the evolutionary stage determined by the presence of IR excess, as indicated by certain diagrams. The application of this program can greatly streamline the statistical analysis of young stellar populations across diverse star-forming regions, including distant and deeply embedded ones, which typically require processing large volumes of initial data.</description>

Abstract: We present optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the rapidly declining Type IIL supernova (SN) 2016iog. SN 2016iog reached its peak $\sim$ 14 days after explosion, with an absolute magnitude in the $V$ band of $-18.64 \pm 0.15$ mag, followed by a steep decline of $8.85 \pm 0.15$~mag~(100\,d)$^{-1}$ post-peak. Such a high decline rate makes SN~2016iog one of the fastest declining Type~IIL SNe observed to date. The rapid rise in the light curve, combined with the nearly featureless continuum observed in the spectrum at +9.3 days, suggests the presence of interaction. In the recombination phase, we observed broad H$\alpha$ lines that persist at all epochs. In addition, the prominent double-peaked H$\alpha$ feature observed in the late-time spectrum (+190.8 days) is likely attributable either to significant dust formation within a cool dense shell or to asymmetric circumstellar material. These features suggest the presence of sustained interaction around SN~2016iog. We propose that the observed characteristics of SN~2016iog can be qualitatively explained by assuming a low-mass H-rich envelope surrounding a red supergiant progenitor star with low-density circumstellar material.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the accretion process and observational signatures of thin accretion disks around a Schwarzschild black hole (BH) embedded in a Dehnen-type dark matter (DM) halo. We examine the influence of the density {\rho}_{s} and radius r_{s} of the DM halo on key disk properties, including the energy flux, temperature distribution, and emission spectrum. Our results show that all three of these quantities decrease with increasing {\rho}_{s} or r_{s}. Furthermore, by generating and analyzing both direct and secondary images of the accretion disk, we explore how the observational inclination angle and the DM halo parameters {\rho}_{s} and rs affect image profiles. Finally, the observed flux distributions are presented for different inclination angles. Our findings indicate that the accretion disk becomes colder and dimmer as the DM halo parameters increase, highlighting the significant role of DM in shaping BH observables.</description>

      <title>Probing the Nature of Dark Matter Self-Interactions Through Observations of Massive Black Hole Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Though the nature of dark matter remains elusive, two models have come to prominence with testable predictions: cold dark matter (CDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). While CDM remains the widely accepted model, SIDM was introduced to potentially help resolve the discrepancies between the predictions of the CDM model and observational data, in particular the predicted central density profiles. Previous work involving simulations of small numbers of Milky Way-mass galaxies shows that SIDM delays massive black hole mergers as compared to CDM when the host halo has a flattened central density profile. It is, however, unclear how well massive black hole observations are able to differentiate between CDM and SIDM. In this work, we use mock gravitational wave observations of massive black hole mergers from LISA, a space-based gravitational wave observatory set to launch in the 2030s, to test LISA's capability to indirectly probe dark matter physics. As a proof of concept, we show that LISA may be able to distinguish between CDM and SIDM with a short-range interaction and a constant cross section of 1 $\rm{cm^2~ g^{-1}}$ at the $\sim2\sigma$ level or greater, provided at least $\sim80$ massive black hole mergers are observed with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 10. Our exploratory work shows that LISA may provide a pathway to probe dark matter self-interactions, motivating future work with more realistic, currently-favored models and larger simulation suites.</description>

      <title>Multiple Components and Spectral Evolution of BL Lacertae as Revealed by Multiwavelength Variability and SED Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: BL Lac has entered an active state since 2020, with multiwavelength observations revealing intense flares. In this study, we conducted 12-night multicolor optical monitoring using an 85 cm telescope from 2020 September to 2024 June and collected long-term broad-band archived data from radio to $\gamma$-rays. Intraday variabilities were detected on four nights, and most of them exhibited a bluer-when-brighter behavior. Both clockwise and counterclockwise spectral hysteresis loops were found within a single night. However, no reliable intraband time lag was detected for the intranight variabilities. On long timescales, the cross-correlation analysis shows that the variations of the optical, X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray bands do not reveal an obvious time delay, while the variations in the radio bands lagged them by about 370 days. The measured time lags suggest two distinct emission regions respectively responsible for the optical to $\gamma$-ray radiation and for the radio radiation, with a spatial separation of approximately $4.50\times10^{19}\ \rm cm$. We modeled the broad-band spectral energy distributions during four flaring epochs and one quiescent epoch, and found evidence for the possible persistent existence of a very high energy emission region. We also confirmed a spectral evolution of the source from an intermediate synchrotron peaked BL Lac object to a low synchrotron peaked BL Lac object.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the $z\sim6-13$ intergalactic medium from JWST spectroscopy of Lyman-alpha damping wings in galaxies</title>

Abstract: JWST provides a unique dataset to study reionization's earliest stages, promising insights into the first galaxies. Many JWST/NIRSpec prism spectra reveal smooth Lyman-alpha breaks in z&gt;5 galaxies, implying damping wing scattering by neutral hydrogen. We investigate what current prism spectra imply about the intergalactic medium (IGM), and how best to use NIRSpec spectra to recover IGM properties. We use a sample of 99 z~5.5-13 galaxies with high S/N prism spectra in the public archive, including 12 at z&gt;10. We analyse these spectra using damping wing sightlines from inhomogeneous reionizing IGM simulations, mapping between the distance of a source from neutral IGM and the mean IGM neutral fraction. We marginalise over absorption by local HI around galaxies, and Lyman-alpha emission. We observe a decline in the median and variance of flux around the Lyman-alpha break with increasing redshift, consistent with an increasingly neutral IGM, as ionized regions become smaller and rarer. At $z\gtrsim9$ the spectra become consistent with an almost fully neutral IGM. We find S/N&gt;15 per pixel is required to robustly estimate IGM properties from prism spectra. We fit a sub-sample of high S/N spectra and infer mean neutral fractions $\overline{x}_\mathrm{HI}=0.33^{+0.18}_{-0.27}, 0.64^{+0.17}_{-0.23}$ ($&gt;0.70$ excluding GNz11) at $z \approx 6.5, 9.3$. We also investigate local HI absorption, finding median column density $\log_{10}N_\mathrm{HI}\approx10^{20.8}$ cm$^{-2}$, comparable to $z\sim3$ Lyman-break galaxies, with no significant redshift evolution. We find galaxies showing the strongest absorption are more likely to be in close associations (&lt;500 pkpc), implying enhanced absorption in massive dark matter halos. Future deep prism and grating spectroscopy of z&gt;9 sources will provide tighter constraints on the earliest stages of reionization, key for understanding the onset of star formation.</description>

      <title>The role of turbulence in setting the phase of the ISM and implications for the star formation rate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03305v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the link between star formation, turbulence and the thermal state of the multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM). We analyse a suite of stratified box simulations modelling a realistic ISM that aims to probe environments similar to those found in the Milky Way. Turbulence is injected through stellar feedback and an external large-scale driving force. We find that star formation can be either boosted or reduced when increasing the external driving strength, depending on the environment. When the density is sufficiently high, warm neutral gas naturally transitions to the cold phase, leading to high cold neutral medium (CNM) fractions of around 40\%. Under these conditions, excessive large-scale driving leads to a slight reduction of the CNM fraction and an increase in the amount of gas that is thermally unstable. What limits the star formation in this regime is a reduced fraction of dense gas due to additional turbulent support against collapse. For low density regions, overdensities in which cooling is efficient are much rarer and we find that star formation is regulated by the formation of cold gas. In such cases, turbulence can significantly boost star formation by compressing gas in shocks and increasing the CNM fraction dramatically. In our simulations we see an increase from almost no CNM to up to a fraction of 15 \% when including external turbulence driving; leading to an associated increase in the star formation rate. We provide a model to quantify this behaviour and predict the CNM fraction by combining the standard ISM cooling/heating model with the density PDF generated by turbulence. The change in the dominant limiting process for star formation between low- and intermediate-density environments provides a natural explanation for the observed break in the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation around column densities of 9\,\Msun\, pc$^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>A weak Ly$\alpha$ halo for an extremely bright Little Red Dot: Indications of enshrouded SMBH growth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09542v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The abundant population of "Little Red Dots" (LRDs)-compact objects with red UV to optical colors and broad Balmer lines at high redshift-is unveiling new insights into the properties of early active galactic nuclei (AGN). Perhaps the most surprising features of this population are the presence of Balmer absorption and ubiquitous strong Balmer breaks. Recent models link these features to an active supermassive black hole (SMBH) cocooned in very dense gas ($N_{\rm H}\sim10^{24}\,\rm cm^{-2}$). We present a stringent test of such models using VLT/MUSE observations of A2744-45924, the most luminous LRD known to date ($L_{\rm H\alpha}\approx10^{44}~\rm erg\,s^{-1}$), located behind the Abell-2744 lensing cluster at $z=4.464$ ($\mu=1.8$). We detect a moderately extended Ly$\alpha$ nebula ($h\approx5.7$ pkpc), spatially offset from the point-like H$\alpha$ seen by JWST. The Ly$\alpha$ emission is narrow ($\rm FWHM=270\pm 15~km\,s^{-1}$), spatially offset to H$\alpha$, and faint ($\rm Ly\alpha=0.07H\alpha$) compared to Ly$\alpha$ nebulae typically observed around quasars of similar luminosity. We detect compact N$\,$IV]$\lambda$1486 emission, spatially aligned with H$\alpha$, and a spatial shift in the far-UV continuum matching the Ly$\alpha$ offset. We discuss that H$\alpha$ and Ly$\alpha$ have distinct physical origins: H$\alpha$ originates from the AGN, while Ly$\alpha$ is powered by star formation. In the environment of A2744-45924, we identify four extended Ly$\alpha$ halos ($\Delta z&lt;0.02$, $\Delta r&lt;100$ pkpc). Their Ly$\alpha$ luminosities match expectations based on H$\alpha$ emission, indicating no evidence for radiation from A2744-45924 affecting its surroundings. The lack of strong, compact, and broad Ly$\alpha$ and the absence of a luminous extended halo, suggest that the UV AGN light is obscured by dense gas cloaking the SMBH with covering factor close to unity.</description>

      <title>The Distribution of Atomic Hydrogen in the Host Galaxies of FRBs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06594v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We probe the atomic hydrogen (HI) emission from the host galaxies of fast radio bursts (FRBs) to investigate the emerging trend of disturbance and asymmetry in the population. Quadrupling the sample size, we detect 16 out of 17 new hosts in HI, with the single non-detection arising in a galaxy known to be transitioning towards quiescence. With respect to typical local Universe galaxies, FRB hosts are generally massive in HI ($M_{HI}&gt;10^9 M_\odot$), which aligns with previous studies reporting that FRB hosts also tend to have high stellar masses and are star-forming. However, they span a broad range of other HI derived properties. Using visual inspection alongside various asymmetry metrics, we identify six unambiguously settled host galaxies, demonstrating for the first time that a disturbed HI morphology is not a universal feature of FRB host galaxies. However, we find another six that show clear signs of disturbance, one borderline case, and three which require deeper or more targeted observations to reach a conclusion; this brings the confirmed ratio of disturbed-to-settled FRB hosts to 11:6. Given that roughly a 1:1 ratio is expected for random background galaxies of similar type, our observed ratio yields a p-value of 0.222. Therefore, we conclude that contrary to earlier indications, there is no statistically significant excess of HI disturbance in this sample of FRB host galaxies with respect to the general galaxy population, and hence we find no evidence for a fundamental connection between FRB progenitor formation and merger-induced star formation activity.</description>

      <title>A Turbulent Framework for Star Formation in High-Redshift Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of distant galaxies suggest that the physics of galaxy formation at high redshifts differs significantly from later times. In contrast to large, steady disk galaxies like the Milky Way, high-redshift galaxies are often characterized by clumpy, disturbed morphologies and bursty star formation histories. These differences between low-mass, bursty galaxies and higher-mass, steady star-forming galaxies have recently been studied in galaxy formation simulations with resolved multiphase ISM. These simulation studies indicate that while steady disk galaxies can be well-modeled as "equilibrium disks" embedded in a distinct, hot CGM, bursty galaxies are much more dynamic and their star formation occurs in a dispersion-dominated medium that extends to halo scales, with no clear boundary between the ISM and the CGM. We develop an analytic framework to model star formation in bursty galaxies that are not adequately modeled as equilibrium disks. The framework approximates the gas in low-mass halos as a continuous, supersonically turbulent medium with large density fluctuations. Star formation occurs locally in the high-density tail of a roughly lognormal density distribution. This is analogous to turbulent models of star formation in molecular clouds, but here applied on inner CGM scales. By comparing with galaxy formation simulations from the FIRE project, we show that this framework can be used to understand star formation efficiencies and radial profiles in halos. The turbulent framework shows explicitly how the instantaneous galaxy-averaged star formation efficiency can be relatively low even if the local efficiency in dense gas approaches unity.</description>

      <title>Universal Structure of Turbulent Radiative Mixing Layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulent radiative mixing layers (TRMLs), where shear-driven turbulence between dense and diffuse gas produces rapidly cooling intermediate-temperature gas, are ubiquitous in the interstellar and circumgalactic media. Using a quasi-steady Reynolds decomposition, we separate mean and turbulent components. In quasi-isobaric TRMLs, upstream gas cools and compresses before streamwise momentum is fully mixed, yielding a negative shear stress (R_{xz}) and a positive compressive stress (R_{zz}) that together sustain a steady radiative conversion of hot to cold gas. A pronounced thermal-pressure dip develops within the TRML, while radiative losses are offset by the divergences of enthalpy flux and (subdominant) turbulent heat flux (Q_t). The volume-averaged temperature follows a tanh profile, resulting in universal emissivity distributions that are consistent with simulations. Contrary to previous claims, the cooling-rate surface density saturates and becomes independent of box size in the strong-cooling limit, establishing the universal structure of TRMLs.</description>

      <title>MARTA: The connection between chemical enrichment, feedback, and dust in a Wolf-Rayet galaxy at z${\sim}$2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the analysis of the stellar and interstellar medium (ISM) properties of MARTA-4327, a star-forming galaxy at z=2.224 observed by means of deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy in both medium- and high-resolution gratings as part of the "Measuring Abundances at high Redshift with the Te Approach" (MARTA) programme. We report one of the highest-redshift detections of the Wolf-Rayet (WR) blue and red bumps in a non-lensed system. The broad He ii${\lambda}$4686 feature is consistent with a young (${\sim 5-6}$ Myr) burst dominated by WN stars, although both SSP models and empirical templates struggle to reproduce the nitrogen stellar features at ${\approx}$ 4640 A. Based on the relative strength of the available optical stellar features, we disfavor the presence of very massive stars (VMS) in this system. Elemental abundance ratios such as Ne/O, N/O, and Ar/O align with observations of local star-forming galaxies (including WR galaxies), suggesting that any impact of the WR population on the chemical enrichment of the ISM is strongly localized. However, the gas-phase Fe/O ratio appears enhanced compared to local galaxies of similar metallicity, which we interpret as evidence for reduced Fe depletion onto dust grains, possibly linked to localized destruction in WR-driven wind environments. In addition, we detect a broad and blueshifted (~70 km/s) H${\alpha}$ component, revealing the presence of an ionized outflow with a mass loading factor ${\eta \sim 0.2}$. Finally, we report the robust detection of O I${\lambda}$8446 emission (among the firsts at high redshift), which we interpret as originating from Ly${\beta}$ fluorescence and/or collisional excitation in dense clumps. Overall, MARTA-4327 represents a unique system for studying the role of massive stars in shaping the ISM in galaxies at Cosmic Noon.</description>

      <title>The Deepest GLIMPSE of a Dense Gas Cocoon Enshrouding a Little Red Dot</title>

Abstract: The detection of strong Balmer breaks and absorption features in Little Red Dots (LRDs) suggests they host AGN embedded within dense gas envelopes, potentially powered by super-Eddington accretion. We present GLIMPSE-17775, a luminous ($L_{\rm bol}\sim10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$) LRD at $z=3.501$ behind Abell S1063 ($\mu\sim2$), observed with deep JWST/NIRCam and a $\sim$20 hr (80 hr de-lensed) NIRSpec/G395M spectrum. The data reveal 40+ emission and absorption features, including a rich forest of low-ionization FeII lines and numerous broad hydrogen recombination transitions. We use this depth to test the dense-gas interpretation through five independent diagnostics. Nearly all permitted lines show exponential wings with consistent FWHM, the signature of Thomson scattering requiring $n_e\gtrsim10^8$ cm$^{-3}$. Adopting this width yields $M_{\rm BH}\sim10^{6.7}M_\odot$, a factor of ten lower than Gaussian fits, and $\lambda_{\rm Edd}\sim1.8$. Additional diagnostics support the same picture: a pronounced Balmer break ($f_{\nu,4050}/f_{\nu,3670}=2.0\pm0.1$), enhanced HeI $\lambda7065$ and $\lambda10830$ with P-Cygni absorption, Bowen-fluorescent OI $\lambda8446$-$\lambda11290$ emission requiring Ly$\beta$ pumping, and 16 FeII lines matching fluorescence models. These features indicate a dense ($n\sim10^8$ cm$^{-3}$), partially ionized cocoon where scattering and fluorescence dominate line formation, providing strong evidence that at least some LRDs are powered by super-Eddington black-hole growth in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Effect of molecular hydrogen self-shielding modeling on early Reionization Era galaxies in radiative hydrodynamic cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately modeling molecular hydrogen ($\text{H}_{2}$) is an important task in cosmological simulations because it regulates star formation. One fundamental property of $\text{H}_{2}$ is the ability to self-shield, a phenomenon in which the $\text{H}_{2}$ in the outer layer of a molecular cloud absorbs the photodissociating Lyman-Werner UV radiation and shields the inner $\text{H}_{2}$. Historically, numerical approximations have been utilized to avoid intensive ray-tracing calculations. This paper evaluates the use of the Sobolev-like density-gradient approximation in $\text{H}_{2}$ self-shielding modeling and tests its agreement with a more rigorous adaptive ray-tracing method in cosmological simulations. We ran four high-resolution zoom-in cosmological simulations to investigate the models' effects in the early Reionization Era ($z \geq 12$). We find that the approximation model returns a higher $\text{H}_{2}$ photodissociation rate in low gas density environments but a lower rate when gas density is high, resulting in low-mass halos having less $\text{H}_{2}$ while high-mass halos having more $\text{H}_{2}$. The approximation also hinders star formation in small halos, but it less affects the stellar mass of larger halos. Inside a halo, the discrepancies between the two models regarding $\text{H}_{2}$ fraction, temperature, and stellar mass are radially dependent. On a large scale, the simulations using the approximation have less $\text{H}_{2}$ in the intergalactic medium and may experience a slower reionization process. These results show that the Sobolev-like approximation alters properties of galaxies and the large-scale universe when compared to the ray-tracing treatment, emphasizing a need for caution when interpreting results from these two techniques in cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>Stellar Populations with MaNGA: Iron Kink and Nitrogen Fuzz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent analysis of 2968 MaNGA early type galaxies has yielded two notable trends with velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) not previously discussed in the literature. First, Fe abundance rises with $\sigma$, but only until $\sigma\approx100$ km s$^{-1}$, after which it falls. This kink is reproduced by TNG100 simulations, implying that hierarchical merger processes might explain it. Second, astrophysical scatter in N is high for galaxies with $\sigma &lt; 100$ km s$^{-1}$. Due to the restricted list of nucleosynthetic sources for N, it is likely that asymptotic giant branch stars provide most of this N. A varied star formation history (compared to that of massive galaxies) along with variable retention and recycling of N-enriched gas might explain the fuzz of N abundance in low-$\sigma$ galaxies. Because a timescale argument seems necessary to explain the nitrogen fuzz, and an initial mass function argument is ruled out, similar timescale arguments for the [Mg/Fe] trend as a function of velocity dispersion are supported.</description>

      <title>JWST View of the Supernebula in NGC 5253. II. Nebular Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nearby dwarf starburst NGC 5253 is dominated by a compact radio-infrared supernebula powered by a very young and bright embedded Super Star Cluster (SSC) of $\sim 10^9 L_\odot$. We observed this source and its surroundings over the 5-25$\mu$m range with MIRI/MRS on JWST and in Paper I presented the JWST view of the region and its continuum features. We now present the more than 70 emission lines of HI, $H_2$ and metal ions detected by MIRI/MRS. We derive the extinction by comparing HI recombination to the free-free radio continuum and find that it is very flat, i.e., almost independent of wavelength, over this spectral range. Nebular conditions are consistent with young ($\lesssim5\times10^6$ years) and very massive stars. All regions show high excitation, but the spatial distribution of the high excitation lines suggests that photons with energies close to 50eV are escaping the supernebula core in spite of 35 magnitudes of visual extinction.</description>

      <title>The need for a nonlocal expansion in general relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11990v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by known facts about effective field theory and non-Abelian gauge theory, we argue that the post-Newtonian approximation might fail even in the limit of weak fields and small velocities for wide-extended rotating bodies, where angular momentum spans significant spacetime curvature. We construct a novel dimensionless quantity that samples this breakdown, and we evaluate it by means of existing analytical solutions of rotating extended bodies and observational data. We give estimates for galaxies and binary systems, as well as our home in the Cosmos, Laniakea. We thus propose that a novel effective field theory of general relativity might be needed to account for the onset of nonlocal angular momentum effects.</description>

      <title>The role of triple evolution in the formation of LISA double white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galactic double white dwarfs will be prominent gravitational-wave sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). While previous studies have primarily focused on formation scenarios in which binaries form and evolve in isolation, we present the first detailed study of the role of triple stellar evolution in forming the population of LISA double white dwarfs. In this work, we present the first detailed study of the role of triple stellar evolution in forming the population of LISA double white dwarfs. We use the multiple stellar evolution code (MSE) to model the stellar evolution, binary interactions, and the dynamics of triple star systems then use a Milky Way-like galaxy from the TNG50 simulations to construct a representative sample of LISA double white dwarfs. In our simulations about $7\times10^6$ Galactic double white dwarfs in the LISA frequency bandwidth originate from triple systems, whereas $\sim4\times10^6$ form from isolated binary stars. The properties of double white dwarfs formed in triples closely resemble those formed from isolated binaries, but we also find a small number of systems $\sim\mathcal{O}(10)$ that reach extreme eccentricities $(&gt;0.9)$, a feature unique to the dynamical formation channels. Our population produces $\approx 10^{4} $ individually resolved double white dwarfs (from triple and binary channels) and an unresolved stochastic foreground below the level of the LISA instrumental noise. About $57\,\%$ of double white dwarfs from triple systems retain a bound third star when entering the LISA frequency bandwidth. However, we expect the tertiary stars to be too distant to have a detectable imprint in the gravitational-wave signal of the inner binary.</description>

      <title>Estimating cluster masses: a comparative study between machine learning and maximum likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare an autoencoder convolutional neural network (AE-CNN) with a conventional maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) for inferring cluster virial masses, $M_v$, directly from the galaxy distribution around clusters, without identifying members or interlopers. The AE-CNN is trained on mock galaxy catalogues, whereas the MLE assumes that clusters of similar mass share the same phase-space galaxy profile. Conceptually, the MLE returns an unbiased estimate of $\log M_v$ at fixed true mass, whereas the AE-CNN approximates the posterior mean, so the true $\log M_v$ is unbiased at fixed estimate. Using MDPL2 mock clusters with redshift space number density as input, the AE-CNN attains an rms scatter of $0.10\,\textrm{dex}$ between predicted and true $\log M_v$, compared with $0.16\,\textrm{dex}$ for the MLE. With inputs based on mean peculiar velocities, binned in redshift space or observed distance, the AE-CNN achieves scatters of $0.12\,\textrm{dex}$ and $0.16\,\textrm{dex}$, respectively, despite strong inhomogeneous Malmquist bias.</description>

      <title>The Dark Energy Camera All Data Everywhere cosmic shear project V: Constraints on cosmology and astrophysics from 270 million galaxies across 13,000 deg$^2$ of the sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present constraints on models of cosmology and astrophysics using cosmic shear data vectors from three datasets: the northern and southern Galactic cap of the Dark Energy Camera All Data Everywhere (DECADE) project, and the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3. These data vectors combined consist of 270 million galaxies spread across 13,000 ${\rm deg}^2$ of the sky. We first extract constraints for $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and find $S_8= 0.805^{+0.019}_{-0.019}$ and $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.262^{+0.023}_{-0.036}$, which is consistent within $1.9 \sigma$ of constraints from the Planck satellite. Extending our analysis to dynamical dark energy models shows that lensing provides some (but still minor) improvements to existing constraints from supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations. Finally, we study six different models for the impact of baryons on the matter power spectrum. We show the different models provide consistent constraints on baryon suppression, and associated cosmology, once the astrophysical priors are sufficiently wide. Current scale-cut approaches for mitigating baryon contamination result in a residual bias of $\approx 0.3\sigma$ in the $S_8, \Omega_{\rm m}$ posterior. Using all scales with dedicated baryon modeling leads to negligible improvement as the new information is used solely to self-calibrate the baryon model on small scales. Additional non-lensing datasets, and/or calibrations of the baryon model, will be required to access the full statistical power of the lensing measurements. The combined dataset in this work represents the largest lensing dataset to date (most galaxies, largest area) and provides an apt testing ground for analyses of upcoming datasets from Stage IV surveys. The DECADE shear catalogs, data vectors, and likelihoods are made publicly available.</description>

      <title>JWST lensed quasar dark matter survey IV: Stringent warm dark matter constraints from the joint reconstruction of extended lensed arcs and quasar flux ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a measurement of the free-streaming length of dark matter (DM) and subhalo abundance around 28 quadruple image strong lenses using observations from JWST MIRI presented in Paper III of this series. We improve on previous inferences on DM properties from lensed quasars by simultaneously reconstructing extended lensed arcs with image positions and relative magnifications (flux ratios). Our forward modeling framework generates full populations of subhalos, line-of-sight halos, and globular clusters, uses an accurate model for subhalo tidal evolution, and accounts for free-streaming effects on halo abundance and concentration. Modeling lensed arcs leads to more-precise model-predicted flux ratios, breaking covariance between subhalo abundance and the free-streaming scale parameterized by the half-mode mass $m_{\rm{hm}}$. Assuming subhalo abundance predicted by the semi-analytic model {\tt{galacticus}} ($N$-body simulations), we infer (Bayes factor of 10:1) $m_{\rm{hm}} &lt; 10^{7.4} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ ($m_{\rm{hm}} &lt; 10^{7.2} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), a 0.4 dex (0.3 dex) improvement relative to omitting lensed arcs. These bounds correspond to lower limits on thermal relic DM particle masses of $7.4$ and $8.4$ keV, respectively. Conversely, assuming DM is cold, we infer a projected mass in subhalos ($10^6 &lt; m/M_{\odot}&lt;10^{10.7}$) of $1.6_{-1.1}^{+2.4} \times 10^7 \ \mathrm{M}_{\odot} \ \rm{kpc^{-2}}$ at $95 \%$ confidence. This is consistent with {\tt{galacticus}} predictions ($0.6 \times 10^7 \mathrm{M}_{\odot} \ \rm{kpc^{-2}}$), but in mild tension with recent $N$-body simulations ($0.3 \times 10^7 \mathrm{M}_{\odot} \ \rm{kpc^{-2}}$). Our results are among the strongest bounds on WDM, and the most precise measurement of subhalo abundance around strong lenses. Further improvements will follow from the large sample of lenses to be discovered by Euclid, Rubin, and Roman.</description>
