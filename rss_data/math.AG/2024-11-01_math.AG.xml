      <title>Exceptional Collections for Toric Fano Fourfolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beilinson first gave a resolution of the diagonal for $\mathbb{P}^n$. Generalizing this, a modification of the cellular resolution of the diagonal given by Bayer-Popescu- Sturmfels gives a (non-minimal, in general) virtual resolution of the diagonal for smooth projective toric varieties and toric Deligne-Mumford stacks which are a global quotient of a smooth projective variety by a finite abelian group. In the past year, Hanlon-Hicks-Lazarev gave in particular a symmetric, minimal resolution of the diagonal for smooth projective toric varieties. We give implications for exceptional collections on smooth projective toric Fano varieties in dimension 4. We find that for 73 out of 124 smooth projective toric Fano 4-folds, the Hanlon-Hicks-Lazarev resolution of the diagonal yields a full strong exceptional collection of line bundles.</description>

      <title>Counting the fission trees and nonabelian Hodge graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any algebraic connection on a vector bundle on a smooth complex algebraic curve determines an irregular class and in turn a fission tree at each puncture. The fission trees are the discrete data classifying the admissible deformation classes. Here we explain how to count the fission trees with given slope and number of leaves, in the untwisted case. This also leads to a clearer picture of the ``periodic table'' of the atoms that play the role of building blocks in 2d gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Approximation of maps from algebraic polyhedra to real algebraic varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite simplicial complex $\mathcal{K}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and a real algebraic variety $Y,$ by a $\mathcal{K}$-regular map $|\mathcal{K}|\rightarrow Y$ we mean a continuous map whose restriction to every simplex in $\mathcal{K}$ is a regular map. A simplified version of our main result says that if $Y$ is a uniformly retract rational variety and if $k, l$ are integers satisfying $0\leq l\leq k,$ then every $\mathcal{C}^l$ map $|\mathcal{K}|\rightarrow Y$ can be approximated in the $\mathcal{C}^l$ topology by $\mathcal{K}$-regular maps of class $\mathcal{C}^k.$ By definition, $Y$ is uniformly retract rational if for every point $y\in Y$ there is a Zariski open neighborhood $V\subset Y$ of $y$ such that the identity map of $V$ is the composite of regular maps $V\rightarrow W\rightarrow V,$ where $W\subset\mathbb{R}^p$ is a Zariski open set for some $p$ depending on $y.$</description>

      <title>Quantum $K$-invariants via Quot scheme II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a $K$-theoretic analogue of the Vafa--Intriligator formula, computing the (virtual) Euler characteristics of vector bundles over the Quot scheme that compactifies the space of degree $d$ morphisms from a fixed projective curve to the Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}(r,N)$. As an application, we deduce interesting vanishing results, used in Part I (arXiv:2406.12191) to study the quantum $K$-ring of $\mathrm{Gr}(r,N)$. In the genus-zero case, we prove a simplified formula involving Schur functions, consistent with the Borel-Weil-Bott theorem in the degree-zero setting. These new formulas offer a novel approach for computing the structure constants of quantum $K$-products.</description>

      <title>Stringy Hodge numbers via crepant resolutions by Artin stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous paper we showed that any variety with log-terminal singularities admits a crepant resolution by a smooth Artin stack. In this paper we prove the converse, thereby proving that a variety admits a crepant resolution by a smooth Artin stack if and only if it has log-terminal singularities. Furthermore if $\mathcal{X} \to Y$ is such a resolution, we obtain a formula for the stringy Hodge numbers of $Y$ in terms of (motivically) integrating an explicit weight function over twisted arcs of $\mathcal{X}$. That weight function takes only finitely many values, so we believe this result provides a plausible avenue for finding a long-sought cohomological interpretation for stringy Hodge numbers. Using that the resulting integral is defined intrinsically in terms of $\mathcal{X}$, we also obtain a notion of stringy Hodge numbers for smooth Artin stacks, that in particular, recovers Chen and Ruan's notion of orbifold Hodge numbers.</description>

      <title>On the Chern filtration for the moduli of bundles on curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study the Chern filtration on the cohomology of the moduli of bundles on curves. This can be viewed as a natural cohomological invariant defined via tautological classes that interpolates between additive Betti numbers and the multiplicative ring structure. In the rank two case, we fully compute the Chern filtration for moduli of stable bundles and all intermediate stacks in the Harder--Narasimhan stratification. We observe a curious symmetry of the Chern filtration on the moduli of rank two stable bundles, and construct $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-actions that categorify this symmetry. Our study of the Chern filtration is motivated by the $P=C$ phenomena in several related geometries.</description>

      <title>A twist on ring morphisms and crepant contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a surjective ring morphism, this paper constructs the twist functor around the induced derived restriction of scalars functor. We prove that the twist around ring morphisms is a derived autoequivalence in two settings: (1) Twists for Gorenstein orders, (2) twists induced by Frobenius exact categories. As a corollary, it is shown that the noncommutative twist introduced by Donovan and Wemyss is in fact a spherical twist. We then use the technology developed in (1) and (2) to obtain new spherical twists for very singular schemes, and discuss how our result extends previous works on spherical twists induced by crepant contractions.</description>

      <title>The twistor space of a compact hypercomplex manifold is never Moishezon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let (X,I,J,K) be a compact hypercomplex manifold, i.e. a smooth manifold X with an action of the quaternion algebra (Id,I,J,K) on the tangent bundle TX, inducing integrable almost complex structures. For any $(a, b, c) \in S^2$, the linear combination $L := aI + bJ + cK$ defines another complex structure on X. This results in a $C P^1$-family of complex structures called the twistor family. Its total space is called the twistor space. We show that the twistor space of a compact hypercomplex manifold is never Moishezon and, moreover, it is never Fujiki class C (in particular, never Kahler and never projective).</description>

Abstract: This is an English translation of Ludwig Bieberbach's paper ``Remarks on Hilbert's Thirteenth Problem" originally written in German and originally published in Journal f\"ur die Reine und Angewandte Mathematik - 165 (89-92) 1931, along with an addendum to the paper published in 1933. Beiberbach studies under what conditions are there functions of three variables which can or cannot be obtained by combining or nesting functions of two variables. In the addendum, Bieberbach acknowledges a fatal error in a proof in the original article and connects Hilbert's thirteenth problem to a related problem in the theory of differential equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be an absolutely unramified $p$-adic field. We establish a ramification bound, depending only on the given prime $p$ and an integer $i$, for mod $p$ Galois representations associated with Wach modules of height at most $i$. Using an instance of $q$-crystalline cohomology (in its prismatic form), we thus obtain improved bounds on the ramification of $\mathrm{H}^{i}_{et}(X_{\mathbb{C}_K}, \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})$ for a smooth proper $p$-adic formal scheme $X$ over $\mathcal{O}_K$, for arbitrarily large degree $i$.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial extension of tropical cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article discusses a combinatorial extension of tropical intersection theory to spaces given by glueing quotients of partially open convex polyhedral cones by finitely many automorphisms. This extension is done in terms of linear poic-complexes and poic-fibrations, mainly motivated by the case of the moduli spaces of tropical curves of arbitrary genus and marking. We define tropical cycles of a linear poic-complex and of a poic-fibration, and discuss the pushforward maps in these situations. In the context of moduli spaces of tropical curves, we also discuss "clutching morphisms" and "forgetting the marking" morphisms. In a subsequent article we apply this framework to moduli spaces of discrete admissible covers and study the loci of tropical curves that appear as the source of a degree-$d$ discrete admissible cover of a genus-$h$ $m$-marked tropical curve, for fixed $d$, $h$ and $m$.</description>

      <title>The mod p cohomology of the Morava stabilizer group at large primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the cohomology of the extended Morava stabilizer group of height $n$, with trivial mod $p$ coefficients, for all heights $n$ and all primes $p&gt;&gt;n$. The result is an exterior algebra on $n$ generators. A brief sketch of the method: we introduce a family of deformations of Ravenel's Lie algebra model $L(n,n)$ for the Morava stabilizer group scheme. This yields a family of DGAs, parameterized over an affine line and smooth except at a single point. The singular fiber is the Chevalley-Eilenberg DGA of Ravenel's Lie algebra. Consequently the cohomology of the singular fiber is the cohomology of the Morava stabilizer group, at large primes. We prove a derived version of the invariant cycles theorem from Hodge theory, which allows us to compare the cohomology of the singular fiber to the fixed-points of the Picard-Lefschetz (monodromy) operator on the cohomology of a smooth fiber. Finally, we use some new methods for constructing small models for cohomology of reductive Lie algebras to show that the cohomology of the Picard-Lefschetz fixed-points on a smooth fiber agrees with the singular cohomology $H^*(U(n);\mathbb{F}_p)$ of the unitary group, which is the desired exterior algebra.</description>

      <title>Stringy K\"ahler moduli, mutation and monodromy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10891</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.10891v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper gives the first description of derived monodromy on the stringy K\"ahler moduli space (SKMS) for a general irreducible flopping curve C in a 3-fold X with mild singularities. We do this by constructing two new infinite helices: the first consists of sheaves supported on C, and the second comprises vector bundles in a tubular neighbourhood. We prove that these helices determine the simples and projectives in iterated tilts of the category of perverse sheaves, and that all objects in the first helix induce a twist autoequivalence for X. We show that these new derived symmetries, along with established ones, induce the full monodromy on the SKMS.
  The helices have many further applications. We (1) prove representability of noncommutative deformations of all successive thickenings of a length l flopping curve, via tilting theory, (2) control the representing objects, characterise when they are not commutative, and their central quotients, and (3) give new and sharp theoretical lower bounds on Gopakumar-Vafa invariants for a curve of length l. When X is smooth and resolves an affine base, we furthermore (4) prove that the second helix classifies all tilting reflexive sheaves on X, and thus that (5) all noncommutative crepant resolutions arise from tilting bundles on X.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.12490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of topological hyperbolicity to characterize the largeness of the topological fundamental group of a complex variety. Inspired by the Shafarevich conjecture, we propose to study the topological hyperbolicity of moduli spaces of polarized manifolds. We provide two pieces of supporting evidence: first, we show that moduli spaces where the infinitesimal Torelli theorem holds are very close to being topologically hyperbolic. Second, we establish a weak form of topological hyperbolicity for moduli spaces of elliptic surfaces of Kodaira dimension one without multiple fibers, where the infinitesimal Torelli theorem generally does not hold.</description>

      <title>$p$-group Galois covers of curves in characteristic $p$ II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p &gt; 0$ and let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. The results of Harbater, Katz and Gabber associate a $G$-cover of the projective line ramified only over $\infty$ to every $k$-linear action of $G$ on $k[[t]]$. In this paper we relate the HKG-covers to the classical problem of determining the equivariant structure of cohomologies of a curve with an action of a $p$-group. To this end, we present a new way of computing cohomologies of HKG-covers. As an application of our results, we compute the equivariant structure of the de Rham cohomology of Klein four covers in characteristic $2$.</description>

      <title>The "exponential" torsion of superelliptic Jacobians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02377v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $J$ be the Jacobian of a superelliptic curve defined by the equation $y^{\ell} = f(x)$, where $f$ is a separable polynomial of degree non-divisible by $\ell$. In this article we study the "exponential" (i.e. $\ell$-power) torsion of $J$. In particular, under some mild conditions on the polynomial $f$, we determine the image of the associated $\ell$-adic representation up to the determinant. We show also that the image of the determinant is contained in an explicit $\mathbb Z_{\ell}$-lattice with a finite index. As an application, we prove the Hodge, Tate and Mumford-Tate conjectures for a generic superelliptic Jacobian of the above type.</description>

      <title>An elementary description of nef cone for irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe MBM classes for irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifolds of K3 and Kummer types. These classes are the monodromy images of extremal rational curves which give the faces of the nef cone of some birational model. We study the connection between our results and A. Bayer and E. Macr\`{\i}'s theory. We apply the numerical method of description due to E. Amerik and M. Verbitsky in low dimensions to the K3 type and Kummer type cases.</description>

Abstract: We prove the finite generation conjecture of arXiv:hep-th/0406078 for the Gromov-Witten potentials of the Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces $Z_6 \subset \mathbb{P}(1,1,1,1,2)$, $Z_8 \subset \mathbb{P}(1,1,1,1,4)$, and $Z_{10} \subset \mathbb{P}(1,1,1,2,5)$ using the theory of MSP fields. In addition, a formula is given for the genus one Gromov-Witten potentials of these targets.</description>

      <title>Limits of saturated ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the question whether a given homogeneous ideal is a limit of saturated ones. We provide cohomological necessary criteria for this to hold and apply them to a range of examples. Our motivation comes from the theory of border apolarity and varieties of sums of powers, where the question above is tightly connected to proving new lower bounds for border ranks of tensors.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Stable Envelopes for Certain Non-Symplectic Varieties and Dynamical $R$-Matrices for Superspin Chains from the Bethe/Gauge Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize Aganagic-Okounkov's theory of elliptic stable envelopes, and its physical realization in Dedushenko-Nekrasov's and Bullimore-Zhang's works, to certain varieties without holomorphic symplectic structure or polarization. These classes of varieties include, in particular, classical Higgs branches of 3d $\mathcal N=2$ quiver gauge theories. The Bethe/gauge correspondence relates such a gauge theory to an anisotropic/elliptic superspin chain, and the stable envelopes compute the $R$-matrix that solves the dynamical Yang-Baxter equation (dYBE) for this spin chain. As an illustrative example, we solve the dYBE for the elliptic $\mathfrak{sl}(1|1)$ spin chain with fundamental representations using the corresponding 3d $\mathcal N=2$ SQCD whose classical Higgs branch is the Lascoux resolution of a determinantal variety. Certain Janus partition functions of this theory on $I \times \mathbb E$ for an interval $I$ and an elliptic curve $\mathbb E$ compute the elliptic stable envelopes, and in turn the geometric elliptic $R$-matrix, of the anisotropic $\mathfrak{sl}(1|1)$ spin chain. Furthermore, we consider the 2d and 1d reductions of elliptic stable envelopes and the $R$-matrix. The reduction to 2d gives the K-theoretic stable envelopes and the trigonometric $R$-matrix, and a further reduction to 1d produces the cohomological stable envelopes and the rational $R$-matrix. The latter recovers Rim\'anyi-Rozansky's results that appeared recently in the mathematical literature.</description>

      <title>Oka-1 manifolds: New examples and properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09798v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate Oka-1 manifolds and Oka-1 maps, a class of complex manifolds and holomorphic maps recently introduced by Alarc\'on and Forstneri\v{c}. Oka-1 manifolds are characterised by the property that holomorphic maps from any open Riemann surface to the manifold satisfy the Runge approximation and Weierstrass interpolation conditions, while Oka-1 maps enjoy similar properties for liftings of maps from open Riemann surfaces in the absence of topological obstructions. We also formulate and study the algebraic version of the Oka-1 condition, called aOka-1. We show that it is a birational invariant for compact algebraic manifolds and holds for all uniformly rational projective manifolds. This gives a Runge approximation theorem for maps from compact Riemann surfaces to uniformly rational projective manifolds. Finally, we study a class of complex manifolds with an approximation property for holomorphic sprays of discs. This class lies between the smaller class of Oka manifolds and the bigger class of Oka-1 manifolds and has interesting functorial properties.</description>

      <title>Solvable and Nilpotent Matroids: Realizability and Irreducible Decomposition of Their Associated Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the families of solvable and nilpotent matroids, examining their realization spaces, closures, and associated matroid and circuit varieties. We establish sufficient conditions for both the realizability of these matroids and the irreducibility of their associated varieties. Additionally, we analyze the defining polynomial equations of these varieties using Grassmann-Cayley algebra and geometric liftability techniques. For several families within these matroid types, we provide a complete set of defining equations for matroid varieties, or equivalently, a finite generating set for their associated matroid ideals. This includes forest configurations, and a subfamily of nilpotent matroids, called weak nilpotent matroids, which may have arbitrary rank.</description>

      <title>Modular anomaly of BPS black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating functions of BPS indices, counting states of D4-D2-D0 black holes in Calabi-Yau compactifications of type IIA string theory and identified with rank 0 Donaldson- Thomas invariants, are examples of mock modular forms. They have a quite complicated modular anomaly expressed as a sum over three different types of trees weighted by generalized error functions and their derivatives. We show that this anomaly can be significantly simplified, which in turn simplfies finding the corresponding mock modular generating functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we'll introduce a $q$-variant of Witt vectors and de Rham-Witt complexes. This variant is closely related to the Habiro ring of a number field constructed by Garoufalidis, Scholze, Wheeler, and Zagier, to $q$-Hodge cohomology, and to $\operatorname{THH}(-/\mathrm{ku})$. While most of these connections will only be explored in forthcoming work, the goal of this article is to provide the necessary technical foundation.</description>

      <title>Derived $q$-Hodge complexes and refined $\operatorname{TC}^-$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a consequence of Efimov's proof of rigidity of the $\infty$-category of localising motives, Scholze and Efimov have constructed refinements of localising invariants such as $\operatorname{TC}^-$. In this article we compute the homotopy groups of the refined invariants $\operatorname{TC}^{-,\mathrm{ref}}(\mathrm{ku}\otimes\mathbb Q/\mathrm{ku})$ and $\operatorname{TC}^{-,\mathrm{ref}}(\mathrm{KU}\otimes\mathbb Q/\mathrm{KU})$. The computation involves a surprising connection to $q$-de Rham cohomology. In particular, it suggests a construction of a $q$-Hodge filtration on $q$-de Rham complexes in certain situations, which can be used to construct a functorial derived $q$-Hodge complex for many rings. This is in contrast to a no-go result by the second author, who showed that such a $q$-Hodge complex (and thus also a $q$-Hodge filtration) cannot exist in full generality.</description>
