      <title>Linearization method and sharp thresholds for spherically symmetric multidimensional pressureless Euler-Poisson equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the question about the criterion of a singularity formation for radially symmetric solutions to the Cauchy problem for a fairly wide class of equations related to the pressureless Euler-Poisson equations can be reduced to the study of solutions to a linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation. In some cases, such a criterion can be obtained in terms of the initial data. In the remaining cases, it is possible to construct a simple numerical procedure, on the basis of which the question about preserving smoothness for any set of initial data can be solved.</description>

      <title>Statistical solutions to the Schr\"odinger map equation in 1D, via the randomly forced Landau-Lifschitz-Gilbert equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of statistically stationary solutions to the Schr\"odinger map equation on a one-dimensional domain, with null Neumann boundary conditions. We deal directly with the equation in its real-valued formulation, without using any transform. To approximate the Schr\"odinger map equation, we employ the stochastic Landau-Lifschitz-Gilbert equation. By a limiting procedure \`a la Kuksin, we establish existence of a random initial datum, whose distribution is preserved under the dynamics of the deterministic equation. Among other properties, the corresponding statistically stationary solution is proved to exhibit non-trivial dynamics in space and time and to be genuinely random. With an analogous argument, we prove the existence of stationary solutions to a stochastic Schr\"odinger map equation. We discuss the relationship between the statistically stationary solutions to the Schr\"odinger map equation, the binormal curvature flow and the cubic non-linear Schr\"odinger equation. Additionally, we prove the existence of statistically stationary solutions to the binormal curvature flow.</description>

      <title>Anomaly of the fractional heat propagator in abstract settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the following time-fractional heat equation: \begin{equation*} ^{C}\partial_{t}^{\alpha}u(t)+\mathscr{L}u(t)=0,\quad u(0)=u_0\in X, \quad t\in[0,T],\quad T&gt;0,\quad 0&lt;\alpha&lt;1, \end{equation*} where $^{C}\partial_{t}^{\alpha}$ is the Djrbashian-Caputo fractional derivative, $X$ is a complex Banach space and $\mathscr{L}:\mathcal{D}(\mathscr{L})\subset X\to X$ is a closed linear operator. The solution operator of the equation above is given by the strongly continuous operator $E_\alpha(-t^{\alpha}\mathscr{L})$ for any $t\geqslant0$, closely related with the Mittag-Leffler function $E_\alpha(-x)$ for $x\geqslant0.$ There are different ways to present explicitly this operator and one of the most popular is given in terms of the $C_0$-semigroup generated by $-\mathscr{L}$ $\big(\{e^{-t\mathscr{L}}\}_{t\geqslant0}\big)$ as follows: \[ E_\alpha(-t^{\alpha}\mathscr{L})=\int_0^{+\infty}M_{\alpha}(s)e^{-st^{\alpha}\mathscr{L}}{\rm d}s,\quad t\geqslant0, \] where $M_{\alpha}(s)$ is a Wright-type function. We will see that the latter expression is not always optimal (regarding restrictions: endpoint lost) to estimate different norms. An additional restriction appears while bounding the above integral, which can be avoided by using directly the function itself and its well-known uniform bound $|E_{\alpha}(-x)|\leqslant \frac{C}{1+x},$ $x\geqslant0.$</description>

      <title>Slow Manifolds for PDE with Fast Reactions and Small Cross Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple time scales problems are investigated by combining geometrical and analytical approaches. More precisely, for fast-slow reaction-diffusion systems, we first prove the existence of slow manifolds for the abstract problem under the assumption that cross diffusion is small. This is done by extending the Fenichel theory to an infinite dimensional setting, where a main idea is to introduce a suitable space splitting corresponding to a small parameter, which controls additional fast contributions of the slow variable. These results require a strong convergence in $L^\infty(0,T;H^2(\Omega))$, which is the subtle analytical issue in fast reaction problems in comparison to previous works. By considering a nonlinear fast reversible reaction in one dimension, we successfully prove this convergence and therefore obtain the slow manifold for a PDE with fast reactions. Moreover, the obtained convergence also shows the influence of the cross diffusion term and illuminates the role of the initial layer. Explicit approximations of the slow manifold are also carried out in the case of linear systems.</description>

      <title>General Stability Estimates in NonLocal Traffic Models for Several Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove global existence, uniqueness and $\L1$ stability of solutions to general systems of nonlocal conservation laws modeling multiclass vehicular traffic. Each class follows its own speed law and has specific effects on the other classes' speeds. Moreover, general explicit dependencies of the speed laws on space and time are allowed. Solutions are proved to depend continuously -- in suitable norms -- on all terms appearing in the equations, as well as on the initial data. Numerical simulations show the relevance and the effects of the nonlocal terms.</description>

      <title>Propagation of coherent states in the logarithmic Schrodinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the logarithmic Schr{\"o}dinger equation in a semiclassical scaling, in the presence of a smooth, at most quadratic, external potential. For initial data under the form of a single coherent state, we identify the notion of criticality as far as the nonlinear coupling constant is concerned, in the semiclassical limit. In the critical case, we prove a general error estimate, and improve it in the case of initial Gaussian profiles. In this critical case, when the initial datum is the sum of two Gaussian coherent states with different centers in phase space, we prove a nonlinear superposition principle.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of a class of infinite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian systems with boundary control and observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the well-posedness of a class of infinite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian systems with boundary control and observation. This class includes in particular the Euler-Bernoulli beam equations and more generally 1D linear infinite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian systems with boundary control and observation as well as coupled systems. It is known, that for the Timoshenko beam models internal well-posedness implies well-posedness of the overall system. By means of an example we show that this is not true for the Euler-Bernoulli beam models. An easy verifiable equivalent condition for well-posedness of the overall system will be presented. We will conclude the paper by applying the obtained results to several Euler-Bernoulli beam models.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Dissipation via Time-Dependent Velocity Fields: Acceleration and Intermittency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by mixing processes in analytical laboratories, this work investigates enhanced dissipation in non-autonomous flows. Specifically, we study the evolution of concentrations governed by the advection-diffusion equation, where the velocity field is modelled as the product of a shear flow (with simple critical points) and a time-dependent function $\xi(t)$. The main objective of this paper is to derive explicit, quantitative estimates for the energy decay rates, which are shown to depend sensitively on the properties of $\xi$. We identify a class of time-dependent functions $\xi$ that are bounded above and below by increasing functions of time. For this class, we demonstrate super-enhanced dissipation, characterized by energy decay rates faster than those observed in autonomous cases (e.g., when $\xi \equiv 1$, as in Coti Zelati and Gallay (2023)). Additionally, we explore enhanced dissipation in the context of intermittent flows, where the velocity fields may be switched on and off over time. In these cases, the dissipation rates are comparable to those of autonomous flows but with modified constants. To illustrate our results, we analyse two prototypical intermittent flows: one that exhibits a gradual turn-on and turn-off phase, and another that undergoes a significant acceleration following a slow initial activation phase. For the second, we derive the corresponding dissipation rate using a gluing argument. Both results are achieved through the application of the hypocoercivity framework (\`a la Bedrossian and Coti Zelati (2017)), adapted to an augmented functional with time-dependent weights. These weights are designed to dynamically counteract the potential growth of $\xi$, ensuring robust estimates for the energy decay.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove the existence of viscosity solutions to complex Hessian equations on compact Hermitian manifolds, assuming the existence of a strict subsolution in the viscosity sense. The results cover the complex Hessian quotient equations. This generalized our previous results where the equation needs to satisfy a determinant domination condition.</description>

Abstract: The p-Laplace operator in the entire N-dimensional Euclidean space, subject to external electromagnetic potentials, is investigated. In the general case 1&lt;p&lt;N, the existence of at least one solution of mountain pass type to a weighted critical equation is proved. Our technique relies on variational methods and faces a twofold difficulty: double lack of compactness, which requires concentration compactness arguments; and a complex quasilinear framework, which entails appropriate inequalities.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the focusing power nonlinearity heat equation
  \begin{equation}\label{Eq:Heat_abstract}\tag{NLH}
  \partial_t u -\Delta u = |u|^{p-1}u, \quad p&gt;1,
  \end{equation} in dimensions $d \geq 3$. It is well-known that if $p$ is large enough then \eqref{Eq:Heat_abstract} is unconditionally locally well-posed in $L^q(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for $q \geq d(p-1)/2$. We prove that this result is optimal in the sense that uniqueness of local solutions fails when $q &lt; d(p-1)/2$ as long as $p &lt; p_{JL}$, where $p_{JL}$ stands for the Joseph-Lundgren exponent. Our proof is based on the method that Jia-\v{S}ver\'ak proposed in \cite{JiaSve15} to show non-uniqueness of Leray solutions to incompressible 3d Navier-Stokes equations. In particular, we rigorously verify for \eqref{Eq:Heat_abstract} the (analogue of the) spectral assumption made in \cite{JiaSve15}. To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous implementation of the Jia-\v{S}ver\'ak method to a nonlinear parabolic equation without forcing.</description>

      <title>Hellinger-Kantorovich Gradient Flows: Global Exponential Decay of Entropy Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a family of gradient flows of positive and probability measures, focusing on the Hellinger-Kantorovich (HK) geometry, which unifies transport mechanism of Otto-Wasserstein, and the birth-death mechanism of Hellinger (or Fisher-Rao). A central contribution is a complete characterization of global exponential decay behaviors of entropy functionals (e.g. KL, $\chi^2$) under Otto-Wasserstein and Hellinger-type gradient flows. In particular, for the more challenging analysis of HK gradient flows on positive measures -- where the typical log-Sobolev arguments fail -- we develop a specialized shape-mass decomposition that enables new analysis results. Our approach also leverages the (Polyak-)\L{}ojasiewicz-type functional inequalities and a careful extension of classical dissipation estimates. These findings provide a unified and complete theoretical framework for gradient flows and underpin applications in computational algorithms for statistical inference, optimization, and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Local decay and asymptotic profile for the damped wave equation in the asymptotically Euclidean setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove local decay estimates for the wave equation in the asymptotically Euclidean setting. In even dimensions we go beyond the optimal decay by providing the large time asymptotic profile, given by a solution of the free wave equation. In odd dimensions, we improve the best known estimates. In particular, we get a decay rate that is better than what would be the optimal decay in even dimensions. The analysis mainly relies on a comparison of the corresponding resolvent with the resolvent of the free problem for low frequencies. Moreover, all the results hold for the damped wave equation with short range absorption index.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Ordered Mean Curvature with Integrable Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study the concept of nonlocal ordered curvature. In the classical (differential) setting, the problem was introduced by Nirenberg and Li, where they conjectured that if a bounded, smooth surface has its mean curvature ordered in a particular direction, then the surface must be symmetric with respect to some hyperplane orthogonal to that direction. The conjecture was proved by Li et al in 2022. Here we study the counterpart problem in the nonlocal setting, where the nonlocal mean curvature of a set $\Omega$, at any point $x$ on its boundary, is defined as $H_\Omega^J(x) = \int_{\Omega^c} J(x-y) dy - \int_\Omega J(x-y) dy$ and the kernel function $J$ is radially symmetric, non-increasing, integrable and compactly supported. Using a generalization of Alexandrov's moving plane method, we prove a similar result in the nonlocal setting.</description>

      <title>Passing through nondegenerate singularities in mean curvature flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the properties of nondegenerate cylindrical singularities of mean curvature flow. We prove they are isolated in spacetime and provide a complete description of the geometry and topology change of the flow passing through the singularities. Particularly, the topology change agrees with the level sets change near a critical point of a Morse function, which is the same as performing surgery. The proof is based on a new $L^2$-distance monotonicity formula, which allows us to derive a discrete almost monotonicity of the ``decay order", a discrete mean curvature flow analog to Almgren's frequency function.</description>

      <title>On the regularity of nondegenerate hypo-analytic structures of hypersurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a smooth, non-degenerate locally integrable structure of hypersurface type on a manifold $M$, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for it to be equivalent, near a point, to a real-analytic locally integrable structure (the analytic regularizability), generalizing a recent result of Zaitsev and the first author.
  First, we discover, in our setting, a (previously unknown) invariant CR submanifold $\Sigma$ in $M$ of hypersurface type, which we call the central submanifold. We prove that the analytic regularizability of $M$ is equivalent to that of the associated CR manifold $\Sigma$. Furthermore, as a byproduct of our construction, we show that the central manifold construction reduces the whole (smooth or analytic) equivalence problem for nondegenerate structures with the Levi positivity condition to that of the associated central manifolds, i.e. to CR geometry.
  Second, we make use of a classical construction due to Marson and show that sufficient for the analytic regularizability of $M$ is the analytic regularizability of the CR manifold $\tilde M$ associated with $M$ in the sense of Marson.
  We show applications of both regularizability conditions to classes of locally integrable structures.</description>

      <title>The Landau equation does not blow up</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider solutions to the space-homogeneous Landau equation with a general family of interaction potentials. We prove that their Fisher information is monotone decreasing in time. The class of interaction potentials covered by our result includes the case of the Landau equation with Coulomb interactions. As a consequence of the global boundedness of the Fisher information, we deduce that solutions to the space-homogeneous Landau equation never blow up.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical states for the curl-curl problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show the existence of the so-called semiclassical states $\mathbf{U}:\mathbb{R}^3\to\mathbb{R}^3$ to the following curl-curl problem $$ \varepsilon^2\; \nabla \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{U}) + V(x) \mathbf{U} = g(\mathbf{U}), $$ for sufficiently small $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. We study the asymptotic behaviour of solutions as $\varepsilon\to 0^+$ and we investigate also a related nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation involving a singular potential. The problem models large permeability nonlinear materials satisfying the system of Maxwell equations.</description>

      <title>The index of sub-laplacians: beyond contact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the following question: do sub-Laplacian type operators have non-trivial index theory on Carnot manifolds in higher degree of nilpotency? The problem relates to characterizing the structure of the space of hypoelliptic sub-Laplacian type operators, and results going back to Rothschild-Stein and Helffer-Nourrigat. In two degrees of nilpotency, there is a rich index theory by work of van Erp-Baum on contact manifolds, that was later extended to polycontact manifolds by Goffeng-Kuzmin. We provide a plethora of examples in higher degree of nilpotency where the index theory is trivial.</description>

      <title>Complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation for positive $(p,p)$ forms on compact K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation for differential $(p,p)$ forms is introduced on compact K\"ahler manifolds. For any $1 \leq p &lt; n$, we show the existence of smooth solutions unique up to adding constants. For $p=1$, this corresponds to the Calabi-Yau theorem proved by S. T. Yau, and for $p=n-1$, this gives the Monge-Amp\`ere equation for $(n-1)$ plurisubharmonic functions solved by Tosatti-Weinkove. For other $p$ values, this defines a non-linear PDE that falls outside of the general framework of Caffarelli-Nirenberg-Spruck. Further, we define a geometric flow for higher-order forms that preserves their cohomology classes, and extends the K\"ahler-Ricci flow naturally to $(p,p)$ forms. As a consequence of our main theorem, we show that this flow exists in a maximal time interval and can be shown to converge under some assumptions. A modified flow is introduced and the convergence of the associated normalized flow is shown. Some potential applications are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness for Dean-Kawasaki Models of Vlasov-Fokker-Planck Type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider systems of interacting particles which are described by a second order Langevin equation, i.e., particles experiencing inertia. We introduce an associated equation of fluctuating hydrodynamics, which can be interpreted as stochastic version of a Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation. We show a dichotomy previously known for purely diffusive systems carries over to the hypoelliptic setting considered here: Solutions exist only for suitable atomic initial data, but not for smooth initial data. The class of systems covered includes several models of active matter.</description>

      <title>Deformations of $\mathbb Z_2$-Harmonic Spinors on 3-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A $\mathbb Z_2$-harmonic spinor on a 3-manifold $Y$ is a solution of the Dirac equation on a bundle that is twisted around a submanifold $\mathcal Z$ of codimension 2 called the singular set. This article investigates the local structure of the universal moduli space of $\mathbb Z_2$-harmonic spinors over the space of parameters $(g,B)$ consisting of a metric and perturbation to the spin connection. The main result states that near a $\mathbb Z_2$-harmonic spinor with $\mathcal Z$ smooth, the universal moduli space projects to a codimension 1 submanifold in the space of parameters. The analysis is complicated by the presence of an infinite-dimensional obstruction bundle and a loss of regularity in the first variation of the Dirac operator with respect to deformations of the singular set $\mathcal Z$, necessitating the use of the Nash-Moser Implicit Function Theorem.</description>

Abstract: In the paper, we utilize the recent variational, abstract theorem to show the existence of homoclinic solutions to the Hamiltonian system $$ \dot{z} = J D_z H(z, t), \quad t \in \mathbb{R}, $$ where the Hamiltonian $H : \mathbb{R}^{2N} \times \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is of the form $$ H(z, t) = \frac12 Az \cdot z + \Gamma(t) \left( F(z) - \lambda G(z) \right) $$ for some symmetric matrix $A$.</description>

      <title>On Nonlinear Closures for Moment Equations Based on Orthogonal Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work, an approach to the moment closure problem on the basis of orthogonal polynomials derived from Gram matrices is proposed. Its properties are studied in the context of the moment closure problem arising in gas kinetic theory, for which the proposed approach is proven to have multiple attractive mathematical properties. Numerical studies are carried out for model gas particle distributions and the approach is compared to other moment closure methods, such as Grad's closure and the maximum-entropy method. The proposed ``Gramian'' closure is shown to provide very accurate results for a wide range of distribution functions.</description>

      <title>Jacobi convolution series for Petrov-Galerkin scheme and general fractional calculus of arbitrary order over finite interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, general fractional calculus was introduced by Kochubei (2011) and Luchko (2021) as a further generalisation of fractional calculus, where the derivative and integral operator admits arbitrary kernel. Such a formalism will have many applications in physics and engineering, since the kernel is no longer restricted. We first extend the work of Al-Refai and Luchko (2023) on finite interval to arbitrary orders. Followed by, developing an efficient Petrov-Galerkin scheme by introducing Jacobi convolution series as basis functions. A notable property of this basis function, the general fractional derivative of Jacobi convolution series is a shifted Jacobi polynomial. Thus, with a suitable test function it results in diagonal stiffness matrix, hence, the efficiency in implementation. Furthermore, our method is constructed for any arbitrary kernel including that of fractional operator, since, its a special case of general fractional operator.</description>

      <title>Equivariant constructions of spheres with Zoll families of minimal spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct one-parameter deformations of the Euclidean sphere $\mathbb{S}^n$ inside $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ that admit a Zoll family of codimension one embedded minimal spheres, in all dimensions $n\geq 3$. The method of construction is equivariant with respect to the natural actions of the orthogonal group. In particular, we show that the original Zoll spheres of revolution in $\mathbb{R}^3$ have counterparts in the context of minimal surface theory, in all dimensions.
  We also describe the first examples of metrics on the real projective spaces $\mathbb{RP}^n$, in all dimensions $n \geq 3$, that admit a Zoll family of embedded minimal projective hyperplanes, and which are not isometric to metrics with minimal linear projective hyperplanes.
  The new constructions are underpinned by equivariant versions of Nash-Moser-Hamilton implicit function theorem, and yield new information even in dimension $n=2$. As an application, we also show that every finite group of the orthogonal group $O(3)$ that does not contain $-Id$ is the isometry group of some (classical) Zoll metric on $\mathbb{S}^2$.</description>
