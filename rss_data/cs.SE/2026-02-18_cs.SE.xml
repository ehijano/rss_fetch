      <title>CircuChain: Disentangling Competence and Compliance in LLM Circuit Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance toward expert-level performance in engineering domains, reliable reasoning under user-specified constraints becomes critical. In circuit analysis, for example, a numerically correct solution is insufficient if it violates established methodological conventions such as mesh directionality or polarity assignments, errors that can propagate in safety-critical systems. Yet it remains unclear whether frontier models truly apply first-principles reasoning or rely on entrenched training priors that conflict with explicit instructions. We introduce CircuChain, a diagnostic benchmark designed to disentangle instruction compliance from physical reasoning competence in electrical circuit analysis. CircuChain consists of counterbalanced Control/Trap problem pairs across five canonical circuit topologies, augmented with systematic variations in sign conventions, current orientations, and polarity definitions. A multi-stage verification pipeline, combining symbolic solvers, SPICE simulation, and an LLM-based error taxonomy, enables fine-grained attribution of failures to convention errors, physics errors, arithmetic mistakes, or hallucinations. Across 100 tasks per model, we observe a consistent Compliance-Competence Divergence. The strongest model evaluated exhibits near-perfect physical reasoning but a high rate of convention violations when Trap conditions deliberately invert natural sign patterns. Conversely, weaker models display lower physical fidelity yet superior adherence to explicit instructions. These results suggest that increased model capability does not guarantee improved constraint alignment and highlight the need for new evaluation frameworks that stress instruction-following under mathematically rigid domains. CircuChain provides one such framework and offers actionable insights for both engineering education and AI alignment research.</description>

      <title>The Agentic Automation Canvas: a structured framework for agentic AI project design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic AI prototypes are being deployed across domains with increasing speed, yet no methodology for their structured design, governance, and prospective evaluation has been established. Existing AI documentation practices and guidelines - Model Cards, Datasheets, or NIST AI RMF - are either retrospective or lack machine-readability and interoperability. We present the Agentic Automation Canvas (AAC), a structured framework for the prospective design of agentic systems and a tool to facilitate communication between their users and developers. The AAC captures six dimensions of an automation project: definition and scope; user expectations with quantified benefit metrics; developer feasibility assessments; governance staging; data access and sensitivity; and outcomes. The framework is implemented as a semantic web-compatible metadata schema with controlled vocabulary and mappings to established ontologies such as Schema.org and W3C DCAT. It is made accessible through a privacy-preserving, fully client-side web application with real-time validation. Completed canvases export as FAIR-compliant RO-Crates, yielding versioned, shareable, and machine-interoperable project contracts between users and developers. We describe the schema design, benefit quantification model, and prospective application to diverse use cases from research, clinical, and institutional settings. The AAC and its web application are available as open-source code and interactive web form at https://aac.slolab.ai</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study on the Effects of System Prompts in Instruction-Tuned Models for Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instruction-tuned Language Models (ILMs) have become essential components of modern AI systems, demonstrating exceptional versatility across natural language and reasoning tasks. Among their most impactful applications is code generation, where ILMs -- commonly referred to as Code Language Models (CLMs) -- translate human intent into executable programs. While progress has been driven by advances in scaling and training methodologies, one critical aspect remains underexplored: the impact of system prompts on both general-purpose ILMs and specialized CLMs for code generation. We systematically evaluate how system prompts of varying instructional detail, along with model scale, prompting strategy, and programming language, affect code assistant. Our experimental setting spans 360 configurations across four models, five system prompts, three prompting strategies, two languages, and two temperature settings. We find that (1) increasing system-prompt constraint specificity does not monotonically improve correctness -- prompt effectiveness is configuration-dependent and can help or hinder based on alignment with task requirements and decoding context; (2) for larger code-specialized models, few-shot examples can degrade performance relative to zero-shot generation, contrary to conventional wisdom; and (3) programming language matters, with Java exhibiting significantly greater sensitivity to system prompt variations than Python, suggesting language-specific prompt engineering strategies may be necessary.</description>

      <title>GenAI for Systems: Recurring Challenges and Design Principles from Software to Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping how computing systems are designed, optimized, and built, yet research remains fragmented across software, architecture, and chip design communities. This paper takes a cross-stack perspective, examining how generative models are being applied from code generation and distributed runtimes through hardware design space exploration to RTL synthesis, physical layout, and verification. Rather than reviewing each layer in isolation, we analyze how the same structural difficulties and effective responses recur across the stack. Our central finding is one of convergence. Despite the diversity of domains and tools, the field keeps encountering five recurring challenges (the feedback loop crisis, the tacit knowledge problem, trust and validation, co-design across boundaries, and the shift from determinism to dynamism) and keeps arriving at five design principles that independently emerge as effective responses (embracing hybrid approaches, designing for continuous feedback, separating concerns by role, matching methods to problem structure, and building on decades of systems knowledge). We organize these into a challenge--principle map that serves as a diagnostic and design aid, showing which principles have proven effective for which challenges across layers. Through concrete cross-stack examples, we show how systems navigate this map as they mature, and argue that the field needs shared engineering methodology, including common vocabularies, cross-layer benchmarks, and systematic design practices, so that progress compounds across communities rather than being rediscovered in each one. Our analysis covers more than 275 papers spanning eleven application areas across three layers of the computing stack, and distills open research questions that become visible only from a cross-layer vantage point.</description>

      <title>SACS: A Code Smell Dataset using Semi-automatic Generation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code smell is a great challenge in software refactoring, which indicates latent design or implementation flaws that may degrade the software maintainability and evolution. Over the past of decades, the research on code smell has received extensive attention. Especially the researches applied machine learning-technique have become a popular topic in recent studies. However, one of the biggest challenges to apply machine learning-technique is the lack of high-quality code smell datasets. Manually constructing such datasets is extremely labor-intensive, as identifying code smells requires substantial development expertise and considerable time investment. In contrast, automatically generated datasets, while scalable, frequently exhibit reduced label reliability and compromised data quality. To overcome this challenge, in this study, we explore a semi-automatic approach to generate a code smell dataset with high quality data samples. Specifically, we first applied a set of automatic generation rules to produce candidate smelly samples. We then employed multiple metrics to group the data samples into an automatically accepted group and a manually reviewed group, enabling reviewers to concentrate their efforts on ambiguous samples. Furthermore, we established structured review guidelines and developed a annotation tool to support the manual validation process. Based on the proposed semi-automatic generation approach, we created an open-source code smell dataset, SACS, covering three widely studied code smells: Long Method, Large Class, and Feature Envy. Each code smell category includes over 10,000 labeled samples. This dataset could provide a large-scale and publicly available benchmark to facilitate future studies on code smell detection and automated refactoring.</description>

      <title>Automated Multi-Source Debugging and Natural Language Error Explanation for Dashboard Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern web dashboards and enterprise applications increasingly rely on complex, distributed microservices architectures. While these architectures offer scalability, they introduce significant challenges in debugging and observability. When failures occur, they often manifest as opaque error messages to the end-user such as Something went wrong. This masks the underlying root cause which may reside in browser side exceptions, API contract violations, or server side logic failures. Existing monitoring tools capture these events in isolation but fail to correlate them effectively or provide intelligible explanations to non technical users. This paper proposes a novel system for Automated Multi Source Debugging and Natural Language Error Explanation. The proposed framework automatically collects and correlates error data from disparate sources such as browser, API, server logs and validates API contracts in real time, and utilizes Large Language Models to generate natural language explanations. This approach significantly reduces Mean Time to Resolution for support engineers and improves the user experience by transforming cryptic error codes into actionable insights.</description>

      <title>Social Life of Code: Modeling Evolution through Code Embedding and Opinion Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software repositories provide a detailed record of software evolution by capturing developer interactions through code-related activities such as pull requests and modifications. To better understand the underlying dynamics of codebase evolution, we introduce a novel approach that integrates semantic code embeddings with opinion dynamics theory, offering a quantitative framework to analyze collaborative development processes. Our approach begins by encoding code snippets into high-dimensional vector representations using state-of-the-art code embedding models, preserving both syntactic and semantic features. These embeddings are then processed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, with data normalized to ensure comparability. We model temporal evolution using the Expressed-Private Opinion (EPO) model to derive trust matrices and track opinion trajectories across development cycles. These opinion trajectories reflect the underlying dynamics of consensus formation, influence propagation, and evolving alignment (or divergence) within developer communities -- revealing implicit collaboration patterns and knowledge-sharing mechanisms that are otherwise difficult to observe. By bridging software engineering and computational social science, our method provides a principled way to quantify software evolution, offering new insights into developer influence, consensus formation, and project sustainability. We evaluate our approach on data from three prominent open-source GitHub repositories, demonstrating its ability to reveal interpretable behavioral trends and variations in developer interactions. The results highlight the utility of our framework in improving open-source project maintenance through data-driven analysis of collaboration dynamics.</description>

      <title>MMPersistence: A mathematical morphology-oriented software library for computing persistent homology on cubical complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical morphology (MM) is a powerful and widely used framework in image processing. Through set-theoretic and discrete geometric principles, MM operations such as erosion, dilation, opening, and closing effectively manipulate digital images by modifying local structures via structuring elements (SEs), while cubical homology captures global topological features such as connected components and loop structures within images. Building on the GUDHI package for persistent homology (PH) computation on cubical complexes, we propose the MMPersistence library, which integrates MM operations with diverse SEs and PH computation to extract multiscale persistence information. By employing SEs of different shapes to construct topological filtrations, the proposed MM-based PH framework encodes both spatial and morphological characteristics of digital images, providing richer local geometric information than conventional cubical homology alone and establishing a unified foundation for analyzing digital images that integrates topological insight with morphological image processing techniques.</description>

      <title>Latent Regularization in Generative Test Input Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of regularization of latent spaces through truncation on the quality of generated test inputs for deep learning classifiers. We evaluate this effect using style-based GANs, a state-of-the-art generative approach, and assess quality along three dimensions: validity, diversity, and fault detection. We evaluate our approach on the boundary testing of deep learning image classifiers across three datasets, MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR-10. We compare two truncation strategies: latent code mixing with binary search optimization and random latent truncation for generative exploration. Our experiments show that the latent code-mixing approach yields a higher fault detection rate than random truncation, while also improving both diversity and validity.</description>

      <title>Req2Road: A GenAI Pipeline for SDV Test Artifact Generation and On-Vehicle Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Testing functionality in Software-Defined Vehicles is challenging because requirements are written in natural language, specifications combine text, tables, and diagrams, while test assets are scattered across heterogeneous toolchains. Large Language Models and Vision-Language Models are used to extract signals and behavioral logic to automatically generate Gherkin scenarios, which are then converted into runnable test scripts. The Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS) integration standardizes signal references, supporting portability across subsystems and test benches. The pipeline uses retrieval-augmented generation to preselect candidate VSS signals before mapping. We evaluate the approach on the safety-relevant Child Presence Detection System, executing the generated tests in a virtual environment and on an actual vehicle. Our evaluation covers Gherkin validity, VSS mapping quality, and end-to-end executability. Results show that 32 of 36 requirements (89\%) can be transformed into executable scenarios in our setting, while human review and targeted substitutions remain necessary. This paper is a feasibility and architectural demonstration of an end-to-end requirements-to-test pipeline for SDV subsystems, evaluated on a CPDS case in simulation and Vehicle-in-the-Loop settings.</description>

      <title>A Differential Fuzzing-Based Evaluation of Functional Equivalence in LLM-Generated Code Refactorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in automated code refactoring, assessing and ensuring functional equivalence between LLM-generated refactoring and the original implementation becomes critical. While prior work typically relies on predefined test cases to evaluate correctness, in this work, we leverage differential fuzzing to check functional equivalence in LLM-generated code refactorings. Unlike test-based evaluation, a differential fuzzing-based equivalence checker needs no predefined test cases and can explore a much larger input space by executing and comparing thousands of automatically generated test inputs. In a large-scale evaluation of six LLMs (CodeLlama, Codestral, StarChat2, Qwen-2.5, Olmo-3, and GPT-4o) across three datasets and two refactoring types, we find that LLMs show a non-trivial tendency to alter program semantics, producing 19-35% functionally non-equivalent refactorings. Our experiments further demonstrate that about 21% of these non-equivalent refactorings remain undetected by the existing test suites of the three evaluated datasets. Collectively, the findings of this study imply that reliance on existing tests might overestimate functional equivalence in LLM-generated code refactorings, which remain prone to semantic divergence.</description>

      <title>TAROT: Test-driven and Capability-adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Fine-tuning for Code Generation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are changing the coding paradigm, known as vibe coding, yet synthesizing algorithmically sophisticated and robust code still remains a critical challenge. Incentivizing the deep reasoning capabilities of LLMs is essential to overcoming this hurdle. Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) has emerged as a promising strategy to address this need. However, most existing approaches overlook the heterogeneous difficulty and granularity inherent in test cases, leading to an imbalanced distribution of reward signals and consequently biased gradient updates during training. To address this, we propose Test-driven and cApability-adaptive cuRriculum reinfOrcement fine-Tuning (TAROT). TAROT systematically constructs, for each problem, a four-tier test suite (basic, intermediate, complex, edge), providing a controlled difficulty landscape for curriculum design and evaluation. Crucially, TAROT decouples curriculum progression from raw reward scores, enabling capability-conditioned evaluation and principled selection from a portfolio of curriculum policies rather than incidental test-case difficulty composition. This design fosters stable optimization and more efficient competency acquisition. Extensive experimental results reveal that the optimal curriculum for RFT in code generation is closely tied to a model's inherent capability, with less capable models achieving greater gains with an easy-to-hard progression, whereas more competent models excel under a hard-first curriculum. TAROT provides a reproducible method that adaptively tailors curriculum design to a model's capability, thereby consistently improving the functional correctness and robustness of the generated code. All code and data are released to foster reproducibility and advance community research at https://github.com/deep-diver/TAROT.</description>

      <title>SecCodeBench-V2 Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15485v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce SecCodeBench-V2, a publicly released benchmark for evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) copilots' capabilities of generating secure code. SecCodeBench-V2 comprises 98 generation and fix scenarios derived from Alibaba Group's industrial productions, where the underlying security issues span 22 common CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) categories across five programming languages: Java, C, Python, Go, and JavaScript. SecCodeBench-V2 adopts a function-level task formulation: each scenario provides a complete project scaffold and requires the model to implement or patch a designated target function under fixed interfaces and dependencies. For each scenario, SecCodeBench-V2 provides executable proof-of-concept (PoC) test cases for both functional validation and security verification. All test cases are authored and double-reviewed by security experts, ensuring high fidelity, broad coverage, and reliable ground truth. Beyond the benchmark itself, we build a unified evaluation pipeline that assesses models primarily via dynamic execution. For most scenarios, we compile and run model-generated artifacts in isolated environments and execute PoC test cases to validate both functional correctness and security properties. For scenarios where security issues cannot be adjudicated with deterministic test cases, we additionally employ an LLM-as-a-judge oracle. To summarize performance across heterogeneous scenarios and difficulty levels, we design a Pass@K-based scoring protocol with principled aggregation over scenarios and severity, enabling holistic and comparable evaluation across models. Overall, SecCodeBench-V2 provides a rigorous and reproducible foundation for assessing the security posture of AI coding assistants, with results and artifacts released at https://alibaba.github.io/sec-code-bench. The benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/alibaba/sec-code-bench.</description>

Abstract: Business plan (BP) writing plays a key role in entrepreneurship education by helping learners construct, evaluate, and iteratively refine their ideas. However, conventional BP writing remains a rigid, linear process that often fails to reflect the dynamic and recursive nature of entrepreneurial ideation. This mismatch is particularly challenging for novice entrepreneurial students, who struggle with the substantial cognitive demands of developing and refining ideas. While reflection and meta-reflection are critical strategies for fostering divergent and convergent thinking, existing writing tools rarely scaffold these higher-order processes. To address this gap, we present the Meflex System, a large language model (LLM)-based writing tool that integrates BP writing scaffolding with a nonlinear idea canvas to support iterative ideation through reflection and meta-reflection. We report findings from an exploratory user study with 30 participants that examined the system's usability and cognitive impact. Results show that Meflex effectively scaffolds BP writing, promotes divergent thinking through LLM-supported reflection, and enhances meta-reflective awareness while reducing cognitive load during complex idea development. These findings highlight the potential of non-linear LLM-based writing tools to foster deeper and coherent entrepreneurial thinking.</description>

Abstract: Most vulnerability detection studies focus on datasets of vulnerabilities in C/C++ code, offering limited language diversity. Thus, the effectiveness of deep learning methods, including large language models (LLMs), in detecting software vulnerabilities beyond these languages is still largely unexplored. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting and classifying Common Weakness Enumerations (CWE) using different prompt and role strategies. Our experimental study targets six state-of-the-art pre-trained LLMs (GPT-3.5- Turbo, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o, CodeLLama-7B, CodeLLama- 13B, and Gemini 1.5 Pro) and five programming languages: Python, C, C++, Java, and JavaScript. We compiled a multi-language vulnerability dataset from different sources, to ensure representativeness. Our results showed that GPT-4o achieves the highest vulnerability detection and CWE classification scores using a few-shot setting. Aside from the quantitative results of our study, we developed a library called CODEGUARDIAN integrated with VSCode which enables developers to perform LLM-assisted real-time vulnerability analysis in real-world security scenarios. We have evaluated CODEGUARDIAN with a user study involving 22 developers from the industry. Our study showed that, by using CODEGUARDIAN, developers are more accurate and faster at detecting vulnerabilities.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09651v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bug reports provide critical insights into software quality, yet existing datasets often suffer from limited scope, outdated content, or insufficient metadata for machine learning. To address these limitations, we present GitBugs-a comprehensive and up-to-date dataset comprising over 150,000 bug reports from nine actively maintained open-source projects, including Firefox, Cassandra, and VS Code. GitBugs aggregates data from Github, Bugzilla and Jira issue trackers, offering standardized categorical fields for classification tasks and predefined train/test splits for duplicate bug detection. In addition, it includes exploratory analysis notebooks and detailed project-level statistics, such as duplicate rates and resolution times. GitBugs supports various software engineering research tasks, including duplicate detection, retrieval augmented generation, resolution prediction, automated triaging, and temporal analysis. The openly licensed dataset provides a valuable cross-project resource for benchmarking and advancing automated bug report analysis. Access the data and code at https://github.com/av9ash/gitbugs/.</description>

      <title>Byam: Fixing Breaking Dependency Updates with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07522v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) facilitate the integration of third-party dependencies within the code of client applications. However, changes to an API, such as deprecation, modification of parameter names or types, or complete replacement with a new API, can break existing client code. These changes are called breaking dependency updates; It is often tedious for API users to identify the cause of these breaks and update their code accordingly. In this paper, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate client code updates in response to breaking dependency updates. We evaluate our approach on the BUMP dataset, a benchmark for breaking dependency updates in Java projects. Our approach leverages LLMs with advanced prompts, including information from the build process and from the breaking dependency analysis. We assess effectiveness at three granularity levels: at the build level, the file level, and the individual compilation error level. We experiment with five LLMs: Google Gemini-2.0 Flash, OpenAI GPT4o-mini, OpenAI o3-mini, Alibaba Qwen2.5-32b-instruct, and DeepSeek V3. Our results show that LLMs can automatically repair breaking updates. Among the considered models, OpenAI's o3-mini is the best, able to completely fix 27% of the builds when using prompts that include contextual information such as the buggy line, API differences, error messages, and step-by-step reasoning instructions. Also, it fixes 78% of the individual compilation errors. Overall, our findings demonstrate the potential for LLMs to fix compilation errors due to breaking dependency updates, supporting developers in their efforts to stay up-to-date with changes in their dependencies.</description>

      <title>Toward Agentic Software Engineering Beyond Code: Framing Vision, Values, and Vocabulary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agentic AI is poised to usher in a seismic paradigm shift in Software Engineering (SE). As technologists rush head-along to make agentic AI a reality, SE researchers are driven to establish agentic SE as a research area. While early visions of agentic SE are primarily focused on code-related activities, early empirical evidence calls for a consideration of a wider range of socio-technical activities and concerns to make it work in practice. This paper contributes to the emerging visions by: (a) recommending an expansion of its scope beyond code, toward a 'whole of process' vision, grounding it in SE foundations and evolution and emerging agentic SE frameworks, (b) proposing a preliminary set of values and principles to guide community efforts, and (c) sharing guidance on designing and using well-defined vocabulary for agentic SE. It is hoped that these ideas will encourage collaborations and steer the SE community toward laying strong foundations of agentic SE so it is not limited to enabling coding acceleration but becomes the next process-level paradigm shift.</description>

      <title>A Code Smell Refactoring Approach using GNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Code smell is a great challenge in software refactoring, which indicates latent design or implementation flaws that may degrade the software maintainability and evolution. Over the past decades, a variety of refactoring approaches have been proposed, which can be broadly classified into metrics-based, rule-based, and machine learning-based approaches. Recent years, deep learning-based approaches have also attracted widespread attention. However, existing techniques exhibit various limitations. Metrics- and rule-based approaches rely heavily on manually defined heuristics and thresholds, whereas deep learning-based approaches are often constrained by dataset availability and model design. In this study, we proposed a graph-based deep learning approach for code smell refactoring. Specifically, we designed two types of input graphs (class-level and method-level) and employed both graph classification and node classification tasks to address the refactoring of three representative code smells: long method, large class, and feature envy. In our experiment, we propose a semi-automated dataset generation approach that could generate a large-scale dataset with minimal manual effort. We implemented the proposed approach with three classical GNN (graph neural network) architectures: GCN, GraphSAGE, and GAT, and evaluated its performance against both traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. The results demonstrate that proposed approach achieves superior refactoring performance.</description>

      <title>Is Vibe Coding Safe? Benchmarking Vulnerability of Agent-Generated Code in Real-World Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vibe coding is a new programming paradigm in which human engineers instruct large language model (LLM) agents to complete complex coding tasks with little supervision. Although vibe coding is increasingly adopted, are its outputs really safe to deploy in production? To answer this question, we propose SU S VI B E S, a benchmark consisting of 200 feature-request software engineering tasks from real-world open-source projects, which, when given to human programmers, led to vulnerable implementations. We evaluate multiple widely used coding agents with frontier models on this benchmark. Disturbingly, all agents perform poorly in terms of software security. Although 61% of the solutions from SWE-Agent with Claude 4 Sonnet are functionally correct, only 10.5% are secure. Further experiments demonstrate that preliminary security strategies, such as augmenting the feature request with vulnerability hints, cannot mitigate these security issues. Our findings raise serious concerns about the widespread adoption of vibe-coding, particularly in security-sensitive applications.</description>

      <title>Is Your Private Information Logged? An Empirical Study on Android App Logs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of mobile apps, users' concerns about their privacy have become increasingly prominent. Android app logs serve as crucial computer resources, aiding developers in debugging and monitoring the status of Android apps, while also containing a wealth of software system information. Previous studies have acknowledged privacy leaks in software logs and Android apps as significant issues without providing a comprehensive view of the privacy leaks in Android app logs. In this study, we build a comprehensive dataset of Android app logs and conduct an empirical study to analyze the status and severity of privacy leaks in Android app logs. Our study comprises three aspects: (1) Understanding real-world developers' concerns regarding privacy issues related to software logs; (2) Studying privacy leaks in the Android app logs; (3) Investigating the characteristics of privacy-leaking Android app logs and analyzing the reasons behind them. Our study reveals five different categories of concerns from real-world developers regarding privacy issues related to software logs and the prevalence of privacy leaks in Android app logs, with the majority stemming from developers' unawareness of such leaks. Additionally, our study provides developers with suggestions to safeguard their privacy from being logged.</description>

      <title>Software Testing at the Network Layer: Automated HTTP API Quality Assessment and Security Analysis of Production Web Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08242v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern web applications rely heavily on client-side API calls to fetch data, render content, and communicate with backend services. However, the quality of these network interactions (redundant requests, missing cache headers, oversized payloads, and excessive third-party dependencies) is rarely tested in a systematic way. Moreover, many of these quality deficiencies carry security implications: missing cache headers enable cache poisoning, excessive third-party dependencies expand the supply-chain attack surface, and error responses risk leaking server internals. In this study, we present an automated software testing framework that captures and analyzes the complete HTTP traffic of 18 production websites spanning 11 categories (e-commerce, news, government, developer tools, travel, and more). Using automated browser instrumentation via Playwright, we record 108 HAR (HTTP Archive) files across 3 independent runs per page, then apply 8 heuristic-based anti-pattern detectors to produce a composite quality score (0-100) for each site. Our results reveal a wide quality spectrum: minimalist server-rendered sites achieve perfect scores of 100, while content-heavy commercial sites score as low as 56.8. We identify redundant API calls and missing cache headers as the two most pervasive anti-patterns, each affecting 67% of sites, while third-party overhead exceeds 20% on 72% of sites. One utility site makes 2,684 requests per page load, which is 447x more than the most minimal site. To protect site reputations, all identities are anonymized using category-based pseudonyms. We provide all analysis scripts, anonymized results, and reproducibility instructions as an open artifact. This work establishes an empirical baseline for HTTP API call quality across the modern web and offers a reproducible testing framework that researchers and practitioners can apply to their own applications.</description>

      <title>Theory of Troubleshooting: The Developer's Cognitive Experience of Overcoming Confusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Theory of Troubleshooting that is rooted in cognitive science. This theory helps software developers explain the challenges they face and the project risks that emerge as troubleshooting becomes difficult. We define troubleshooting as the cognitive problem-solving process of identifying, understanding, and constructing a mental model of the cause of an unexpected system behavior, and consider the cognitive process of troubleshooting to be an integral part of the activity of debugging. Troubleshooting is a particularly intense and draining aspect of software work, placing sustained demands on attention, working memory, and mental modeling. By surfacing and naming the confusion experience inherent in troubleshooting in terms of neurological and attentional dynamics, our theory explains how prolonged troubleshooting can deplete cognitive resources and lead to cognitive fatigue. In the study presented in this paper, we interview 27 professional developers about their troubleshooting experiences, and follow a Constructivist Grounded Theory approach to construct a theory grounded in empirical data. Our theory contributes to research on Developer Experience by providing a cognitive foundation for understanding troubleshooting difficulty, fatigue, and sustainability risk--and offers practical implications for both research and industry.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study of the Evolution of GitHub Actions Workflows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CI/CD practices play a significant role during collaborative software development by automating time-consuming and repetitive tasks such as testing, building, quality checking, dependency and security management. GitHub Actions, the CI/CD tool integrated into GitHub, allows repository maintainers to automate development workflows. We conducted a mixed methods analysis of GitHub Actions workflow changes over time. Through a preliminary qualitative analysis of 439 modified workflow files we identified seven types of conceptual changes to workflows. Next, we performed a quantitative analysis over 49K+ GitHub repositories totaling 267K+ workflow change histories and 3.4M+ workflow file versions from November 2019 to August 2025. This analysis revealed that repositories contain a median of three workflow files, and 7.3% of all workflow files are being changed every week. The changes made to workflows tend to be small, with about three-quarters containing only a single change. The large majority of the observed changes have to do with task configuration and task specification in workflow jobs. We did not find any conclusive evidence of the effect of LLM coding tools or other major technological changes on workflow creation and workflow maintenance frequency. Our findings highlight the need for improved tooling to support fine-grained maintenance tasks, such as a broader adoption of dependency management and AI-based support for ensuring and sustaining workflow security and quality.</description>
