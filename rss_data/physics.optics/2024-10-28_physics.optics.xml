      <title>Piezoelectrically actuated high-speed spatial light modulator for visible to near-infrared wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in light modulator technology have been driving discoveries and progress across various fields. The problem of large-scale coherent optical control of atomic quantum systems-including cold atoms, ions, and solid-state color centers-presents among the most stringent requirements. This motivates a new generation of high-speed large-scale modulator technology with the following requirements: (R1) operation at a design wavelength of choice in the visible (VIS) to near-infrared (NIR) spectrum, (R2) a scalable technology with a high channel density (&gt; 100mm-2 ), (R3) a high modulation speed (&gt; 100MHz), and (R4) a high extinction ratio (&gt; 20 dB). To fulfill these requirements, we introduce a modulator technology based on piezoelectrically actuated silicon nitride resonant waveguide gratings fabricated on 200mm diameter silicon wafers with CMOS compatible processes. We present a proof-of-concept device with 4 x 4 individually addressable 50 {mu}m x 50 {mu}m pixels or channels, each containing a resonant waveguide grating with a ~ 780 nm design wavelength, supporting &gt; 100MHz modulation speeds, and a spectral response with &gt; 20 dB extinction.</description>

      <title>Stimulated Brillouin scattering in a non-suspended ultra-low-loss thick-SOI platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon photonics, with its CMOS compatibility and high integration density, has enabled a wide range of novel applications. Harnessing stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS), an optomechanic interaction between optical and GHz acoustic waves, in silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platforms attracts great interests for its potential in narrow-linewidth lasers and microwave photonics. However, the poor optoacoustic overlap in silicon nanowires on conventional SOI platforms has previously restricted the observation of SBS signals to suspended silicon waveguide structures. In this work, we report, for the first time, the SBS response in a non-suspended ultra-low-loss thick-SOI waveguide platform. The SBS process in this 3~$\mu$m thick SOI platform is enabled by a leaky acoustic mode that coexists with the optical mode in the waveguide core, resulting in enhanced optoacoustic overlap. We measured a Brillouin gain coefficient of 2.5 m$^{-1}$W$^{-1}$ and 1.9 m$^{-1}$W$^{-1}$ at 37.6 GHz for the rib and strip waveguide, respectively. This work paves the way for Brillouin-based applications in non-suspended ultra-low-loss silicon photonics systems.</description>

      <title>Mid-infrared Energy Deposition Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photothermal microscopy is an emerging tool for measuring light-matter interactions with single-molecule sensitivity. It is generally believed that the spectral acquisition speed in photothermal microscopy is limited by the slow thermal diffusion process. Here, we demonstrate mid-infrared energy deposition (MIRED) spectroscopy, which offers both microsecond-scale temporal resolution and sub-micron spatial resolution. In this approach, the photothermal process is optically probed while the infrared pulses from a quantum cascade laser array are rapidly tuned. Based on Newton's law, the energy deposition corresponds to the first derivative of local temperature rise over time and provides the instantaneous infrared absorption. By employing time-resolved measurement of transient energy deposition, the upper limit for spectrum encoding shifts to the vibrational relaxation level, which occurs on the picosecond scale. This method significantly increases the detection bandwidth while maintaining the sensitivity and resolution advantages of photothermal detection.</description>

      <title>Hyperspectral wavefront sensing with a multicore fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-shot hyperspectral wavefront sensing is essential for applications like spatio-spectral coupling metrology in high power laser or fast material dispersion imaging. Under broadband illumination, traditional wavefront sensors assume an achromatic wavefront, which makes them unsuitable. We introduce a hyperspectral wavefront sensing scheme based on the Hartmann wavefront sensing principles, employing a multicore fiber as a modified Hartmann mask to overcome these limitations. Our system leverages the angular memory effect and spectral decorrelation from the multicore fiber, encoding wavefront gradients into displacements and the spectral information into uncorrelated patterns. This method retains the simplicity, compactness, and single-shot capability of conventional wavefront sensors, with only a slight increase in computational complexity. It also allows a tunable trade-off between spatial and spectral resolution. We demonstrate its efficacy for recording the hyperspectral wavefront cube from single-pulse acquisitions at the Apollon multi-PW laser facility, and for performing multispectral microscopic imaging of dispersive phase objects.</description>

      <title>Towards multi-petahertz all-optical electric field sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an all-optical concept for measuring the electric field of light spanning from infrared to extreme ultraviolet with multi-petahertz detection bandwidth. Our approach employs a heterodyne detection of light produced by a highly nonlinear light-matter interaction gate. We establish a numerical model of a complex spectral response for unambiguous electric field extraction and benchmark it against the experiment. We show that the concept can be applied for measuring wavelengths down to about 60 nm with a high sensitivity and dynamic range of about 40 decibels. This opens up unprecedented perspectives for spatio-temporal electric field-resolved experiments and control of broadband dynamics of matter.</description>

      <title>Single-shot X-ray ptychography as a structured illumination method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-shot ptychography is a quantitative phase imaging method wherein overlapping beams of light arranged in a grid pattern simultaneously illuminate a sample, allowing a full ptychographic dataset to be collected in a single shot. It is primarily used at optical wavelengths, but there is interest in using it for X-ray imaging. However, the constraints imposed by X-ray optics have limited the resolution achievable to date. In this work, we reinterpret single-shot ptychography as a structured illumination method by viewing the grid of beams as a single, highly structured illumination function. Pre-calibrating this illumination and reconstructing single-shot data using the randomized probe imaging algorithm allows us to account for the overlap and coherent interference between the diffraction arising from each beam. We achieve a resolution 3.5 times finer than the numerical aperture-based limit imposed by traditional algorithms for single-shot ptychography. We argue that this reconstruction method will work better for most single-shot ptychography experiments and discuss the implications for the design of future single-shot X-ray microscopes.</description>

      <title>Practical High-Contrast Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic displays are a promising technology for immersive visual experiences, and their potential for compact form factor makes them a strong candidate for head-mounted displays. However, at the short propagation distances needed for a compact, head-mounted architecture, image contrast is low when using a traditional phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM). Although a complex SLM could restore contrast, these modulators require bulky lenses to optically co-locate the amplitude and phase components, making them poorly suited for a compact head-mounted design. In this work, we introduce a novel architecture to improve contrast: by adding a low resolution amplitude SLM a short distance away from the phase modulator, we demonstrate peak signal-to-noise ratio improvement up to 31 dB in simulation compared to phase-only, even when the amplitude modulator is 60$\times$ lower resolution than its phase counterpart. We analyze the relationship between diffraction angle and amplitude modulator pixel size, and validate the concept with a benchtop experimental prototype. By showing that low resolution modulation is sufficient to improve contrast, we pave the way towards practical high-contrast holography in a compact form factor.</description>

      <title>Dynamic strain sensing using Doppler-shift-immune phase-sensitive OFDR with ultra-weak reflection array and frequency-tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In distributed fiber-optic sensing based on optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR), Doppler frequency shifts due to the changes of disturbances during one sweep period introduce demodulation errors that accumulate along both the distance and time, impairing the sensing performance. Here, we report distributed dynamic strain sensing using Doppler-shift-immune phase-sensitive OFDR based on frequency-tracking and spectrum-zooming with ultra-weak reflection array. Theoretical study has been carried out with the introduction of mismatch coefficient, unveiling quantitatively the impact of Doppler shift. Following a numerical analysis of the proposed method, a retained precision has been experimentally verified regardless of the position mismatch due to the Doppler effect. Doppler-shift-immune sensing for dynamic strains covering continuous spatial resolution over a distance of 1000 m with a 2.5 cm sensing spatial resolution has been demonstrated, verifying the high fidelity promised by the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Microring quantum cascade surface emitting lasers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We miniaturize a vertically-coupled in-plane whispering gallery mode cavity incorporating a quantum cascade gain medium, aiming to realize the mid-infrared counterpart to the vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL). Building on previous work with linear microcavities, we introduce a new type of quantum cascade surface emitting laser (QCSEL) by miniaturizing a buried heterostructure ring cavity. At wavelengths of 4.5 ${\mu}$m and 8 ${\mu}$m, we investigate the optical losses for decreasing ring diameters while benchmarking the device performance against linear microcavities. We achieve an equivalent mirror reflectivity of 0.95 and demonstrate lasing with ring diameters as small as 50 ${\mu}$m. Finally, we report a continuous-wave threshold power dissipation of 274mW for a 100 ${\mu}$m diameter ring QCSEL, characterized on wafer level at 20 ${^\circ}$C.</description>

      <title>An Ultra-low-loss Compact Phase-Change Material-based Hybrid-mode Interferometer for Photonic Memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel hybrid mode interferometer (HMI) leveraging the interference of hybridized TE-TM modes in a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) waveguide integrated with a GeSe phase change material (PCM) layer. The SOI waveguide's dimensions are optimized to support the hybridization of the fundamental transverse magnetic ($TM_0$) and the first higher transverse electric ($TE_1$) mode. This design allows for efficient and nearly equal power coupling between these two modes, resulting in high-contrast interference when starting from the amorphous PCM state. The PCM's phase transition induces a differential change in the modal effective index, enabling high-contrast transmittance modulation. Our numerical simulations demonstrate a multilevel transmission with a high contrast of nearly 14 dB, when the amorphous region's length is varied incrementally, enabling multi-bit storage. The transmittance is maximized in the fully crystalline state with an insertion loss below 0.1 dB. The HMI can also operate as a quasi-pure phase shifter when partially amorphized, making it suitable for Mach-Zehnder interferometers. These characteristics make the proposed device a promising candidate for applications in photonic memories and neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is an essential technique for characterizing quantum states. However, practical implementations of QST are significantly challenged by factors such as shot noise, attenuation, and Raman scattering, especially when photonic qubits are transmitted through optical fibers alongside classical signals. In this paper, we present a numerical framework to simulate and evaluate the efficiency of QST under these realistic conditions. The results reveal how the efficiency of QST is influenced by the power of the classical signal. By analyzing the fidelity of reconstructed states, we provide insights into the limitations and potential improvements for QST in noisy environments.</description>

      <title>Generalized Wigner-Smith analysis of resonance perturbations in low $Q$ non-Hermitian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perturbing resonant systems causes shifts in their associated scattering poles in the complex plane. In a previous study [arXiv: 2408.11360], we demonstrated that these shifts can be calculated numerically by analyzing the residue of a generalized Wigner-Smith operator associated with the perturbation parameter. In this work, we extend this approach by connecting the Wigner-Smith formalism with results from standard electromagnetic perturbation theory applicable to open systems with resonances of arbitrary quality factors. We further demonstrate the utility of the method through several numerical examples, including the inverse design of a multi-layered nanoresonator sensor and an analysis of the enhanced sensitivity of scattering zeros to perturbations.</description>

      <title>Giant Rabi splitting and polariton photoluminescence in an all solution-deposited dielectric microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planar microcavity polaritons have recently emerged as a promising technology for improving several performance characteristics of organic light-emitting diodes, photodiodes and photovoltaics. To form polaritons and achieve enhanced performance, traditional microcavities with high reflectivity mirrors are fabricated by energy-intensive physical vapor deposition methods, which restrict their use in applications requiring flexibility and low cost. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate a dielectric all-solution-processed polariton microcavity consisting of Rhodamine 6G films in a poly(vinyl alcohol) matrix, exhibiting more than 400 meV Rabi-splitting and photoluminescence with uniform dispersion along the lower polariton mode. Our fully automated deposition and annealing fabrication protocol played a key role in preventing interlayer mixing and producing high optical-quality polariton microcavities, enabling us to observe enhanced scattering of reservoir excitons to the lower polariton and to explore the effects of strong coupling on bimolecular interactions. Notably, we found that polariton microcavities exhibit a more than 10-fold increase in the critical excitation density for bimolecular annihilation compared to bare Rhodamine 6G films. This enhancement can only be partially attributed to the sub-3-fold measured enhancement in radiative lifetime, highlighting the critical role of strong coupling in the influence of molecular dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an innovative optical imaging system for measuring parameters of a small particle such as a macromolecule or nanoparticle at the quantum limit of sensitivity. In comparison to the conventional confocal interferometric scattering (iSCAT) approach, our setup adds a second arm to form a Michelson interferometer that allows us to tune a relative phase. We evaluate the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound (QCRB) for different quantum states, including single-mode coherent states, multi-frequency coherent states, and phase-averaged coherent states. Our results show that the proposed setup can achieve the QCRB of sensitivity and outperform iSCAT for all considered quantum states for mass and phase estimation of a particle.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Electro-optic Resonant Phase Shifting for Multi-dimensional, Ultra-dynamic Photonic Switches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02866v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical circuit switching is connection-oriented, being deterministic through the reservation of a complete wavelength channel or spatial path for a certain period. However, this comes at a trade-off against link dynamics, and overall capacity can thus be constrained by the time slot reservations, especially for switches with microsecond- to millisecond-scale reconfiguration times. For data-intensive applications, the communication patterns associated with random data sets typically yield short-lived flows. This situation calls for a new multi-dimensional switching paradigm that fully exploits not only the space and wavelength domains but also with nanosecond-scale reconfigurable capability in the time domain to enable ultra-dynamic links. In this work, we focus on the exploitation of micro-ring resonant phase shifters (RPSs) that are wavelength selective for optical switching in a single plane. By proposing an innovative analytical method with transmission circle chart, we fully unlock the power of RPS with nanosecond-scale reconfigurability and the capability to arbitrarily manipulate its phase and amplitude. Such a compact model offers fresh insights into designs with under and critically coupled RPSs beyond the commonly explored over-coupling condition. This creates not only versatile switch elements but also perfect absorbers for robust multi-wavelength operations. The proposed device can bring about a breakthrough in the optical switching capacity that potentially addresses the challenges faced by modern data center networks, as well as other photonic circuits for high-throughput signal processing.</description>

      <title>Wafer-Scale Integration of Freestanding Photonic Devices with Color Centers in Silicon Carbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Color center platforms have been at the forefront of quantum nanophotonics for applications in quantum networking, computing, and sensing. However, large-scale deployment of this technology has been stifled by a lack of ability to integrate photonic devices at scale while maintaining the properties of quantum emitters. We address this challenge in silicon carbide which has both commercially available wafer-scale substrates and is a host to color centers with desirable optical and spin properties. Using ion beam etching at an angle, we develop a 5-inch wafer process for the fabrication of triangular cross-section photonic devices in bulk 4H-SiC. The developed process has a variability in etch rate and etch angle of 5.4% and 2.9%, respectively. Furthermore, the integrated color centers maintain their optical properties after the etch, thus achieving the nanofabrication goal of wafer-scale nanofabrication in quantum-grade silicon carbide.</description>

      <title>Perturbing scattering resonances in non-Hermitian systems: a generalized Wigner-Smith operator formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resonances of open non-Hermitian systems are associated with the poles of the system scattering matrix. Perturbations of the system cause these poles to shift in the complex frequency plane. In this work, we introduce a novel method for calculating shifts in scattering matrix poles using generalized Wigner-Smith operators. We link our method to traditional cavity perturbation theory and validate its effectiveness through application to complex photonic networks. Our findings underscore the versatility of generalized Wigner-Smith operators for analyzing a broad spectrum of resonant systems and provides new insight into resonant properties of non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>The Verifications of No Bright and Dark Fringes In a Standing-wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After Wiener's experiment, it had been widely accepted that only electric-field was the fundamental-factor for optical interference and believed that there were alternating bright and dark fringes in a light standing-wave field which was formed by a pair of parallel light-beams traveling in mutually opposite directions. While being supplied to the bright fringes, the light-energy from the beams must pass across the dark fringes or across the electric-field nodes, so that the electric-field would not keep zero at the nodes. However, it was inconsistent with the characteristic of electric-field nodes at which the electric-field was zero anytime. Therefore, this naturally led to a presumption that there were no bright and dark interference-fringes in a standing-wave field, which was consistent with zero of the electromagnetic energy-flux-density in a standing-wave field. In this paper, it was fully verified from several aspects, including an ideal experiment, comparing a standing-wave with an LC circuit, a group of experiments and theoretical deductions of formulas. An inclination factor was introduced into the previous common formula of two-beams-interference to rectify it back to the original meaning of its initial definition by energy-flux-density rather than electric-field energy-density. Given the angle between the two-beams to be 180 degrees as a validation, it was verified by the corrected formula that the light-intensities of the bright interference-fringes in a standing-wave were equal to zero. i.e., no interference-fringes existed in a standing-wave field.Thus, instead of electric-field energy-density alone from Wiener's conclusions, interference-energy-flux density was the fundamental-factor to form interference-fringes. The magnetic-field vector acts the same role as the electric-field vector on light interacting with substance.</description>

      <title>Non-volatile Tuning of Cryogenic Optical Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing, ultra-low-noise sensing, and high-energy physics experiments often rely on superconducting circuits or semiconductor qubits and devices operating at deep cryogenic temperatures (4K and below). Photonic integrated circuits and interconnects have been demonstrated for scalable communications and optical domain transduction in these systems. Due to energy and area constraints, many of these devices need enhanced light-matter interaction, provided by photonic resonators. A key challenge, however, for using these resonators is the sensitivity of resonance wavelength to process variations and thermal fluctuations. While thermo-optical tuning methods are typically employed at room temperature to mitigate this problem, the thermo-optic effect is ineffective at 4K. To address this issue, we demonstrate a non-volatile approach to tune the resonance of photonic resonators using integrated phase-change materials (PCMs) at cryogenic temperatures. In this work, we report a 10Gb/s free-carrier dispersion based resonant photonic modulator that can be tuned in a non-volatile fashion at sub-4K temperatures using a commercial silicon photonics process. This method paves the way for realizing scalable cryogenic integrated photonics with thousands of resonant devices for quantum and high-energy physics applications.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the image projection of spatially incoherent light from a multimode fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spatially incoherent light generated by a multimode fiber(MMF) in the application of image projection designed for the ultracold-atom experiments. Inspired by previous half-analytic methods concerning the incoherent light, here a full-numerical model is established to provide more quantitative descriptions, and part of results is compared with experiments. Particularly, our model about the MMF is also compatible with light propagation in free space. Based on this, we study both the intrinsic speckle and the perturbation robustness of a MMF light field, under the influence of light propagation and fiber parameters. We point out several guidelines about choosing the suitable MMF in creating a spatially incoherent light source, which is useful in the context of the ultracold-atom experiments associating with the optical potential projection.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast single-photon detection using nanophotonic parametric amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated photonic quantum information processing (QIP) has advanced rapidly due to progress in various nanophotonic platforms. Single photon detectors have been the subject of intense study due to their ubiquity in QIP systems, yet many state-of-the art detectors operate at cryogenic temperatures under vacuum and suffer from long dead times. We propose and demonstrate a single photon detection scheme based on optical parametric amplification in nanophotonic lithium niobate (LN) combined with a classical photodetector. We use quantum detector tomography and experimentally demonstrate an efficiency of 26.5% with a 2.2% dark count rate. We show that by improving the nonlinearity-to-loss ratio in nanophotonics and using homodyne detection on a squeezed pump, the detector can achieve 69% efficiency with 0.9% dark count rate. The detector operates at room temperature, has no intrinsic dead time, and is readily integrated in LN nanophotonics, in which many other components of photonic QIP are available. Our results represent a step towards all-optical ultrafast photon detection for scalable nanophotonic QIP.</description>

      <title>Fermion and Boson Pairs in Beamsplitters and MZIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this short Topical Review, we look at something typically considered trivial, but not given formally elsewhere -- the behaviour of first multiple fermions, then multiple bosons, at a beamsplitter. Extending from this, we then describe the behaviour of multiple fermions and multiple bosons in Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs). We hope that by showing how to go from mathematically-simple but unintuitive quantum field theory to a phenomenological description, this Review will help both researchers and students build a stronger intuition for the behaviour of quantum particles.</description>
