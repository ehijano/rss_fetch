      <title>Experimental Investigation of Variations in Polycrystalline Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO)-based MFIM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Device-to-device variations in ferroelectric (FE) hafnium oxide-based devices pose a crucial challenge that limits the otherwise promising capabilities of this technology. Earlier simulation-based studies have identified polarization (P) domain nucleation and polycrystallinity as key contributors to these variations. In this work, we experimentally investigate the effect of these two factors on remanent polarization (PR) variation in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) based metal-ferroelectric-insulator-metal (MFIM) capacitors for different set voltages (VSET) and FE thicknesses (TFE). Our measurements reveal a non-monotonic behavior of PR variations with VSET, which is consistent with previous simulation-based predictions. For low and high-VSET regions, we find that PR variations are dictated primarily by saturation polarization (PS) variations and are associated with the polycrystallinity in HZO. Our measurements also reveal that PR variations peak near the coercive voltage (VC), defined as the mid-VSET region. We attribute the increase of PR variation around VC to the random nature and sharp P switching associated with domain nucleation, which is dominant near VC. Further, we observe a reduction in the peak PR variation as HZO thickness (TFE) is scaled. We validate our arguments by establishing the correlation between the measured values of PR with VC and PS. Our results display that a strong correlation exists between PR and VC in the mid-VSET region and between PR and PS in the low and high-VSET regions across various TFE.</description>

      <title>Antenne metasurface {\`a} polarisation circulaire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new approach using scalar metasurfaces for the design of linearly polarized antennas is presented. The proposed method is based on the construction of the surface impedance Zs using a technique called "phase-matching," which employs the sum of two circular polarizations in phase opposition. This process allows for the achievement of good performance of the synthesized antenna, such as the reduction of side lobe levels and the attainment of an almost symmetric main lobe regardless of the pointing direction. Numerical and measurement results are also presented.</description>

      <title>3D-Printed Dual-Polarized Magneto-Electric Dipole Antenna with Wideband High Isolation for Full-Duplex Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper introduces a novel dual-port dual-polarized magneto-electric dipole (MED) antenna with orthogonal Gamma and inverted-Gamma shape probes, which was fabricated by means of an additive 3D metal printing process. Electromagnetic wave simulation and RF measurement report a resonance bandwidth from 3 GHz to 4 GHz at both MED's ports with respect to a standing wave ratio of less than 2. The cross-polarization isolation (XPI) between the MED's ports was also measured to be greater than 50 dB across its entire resonance bandwidth. The paper also thoroughly examines the impact of misalignments in the polarization of the MED probes on the XPI level. The broadband resonance and excellent isolation between the MED ports make it a strong candidate for a full-duplex wireless transceiver in network infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Predicting Resistive Pulse Signatures in Nanopores by Accurately Modeling Access Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resistive pulse sensing has been widely used to characterize and count single particles in solution moving through channels under an electric bias, with nanoscale pores more recently providing enough spatial resolution for nucleic acid sequencing at the single-molecule level. At its core, this technique relies on measuring the drop in ionic current through the pore induced by the passage of a molecule and, through conductance models, translating the blockage signal to molecular dimensions. However, there exists no model considering the resistive contributions of the pore exterior, i.e. the access regions, when obstructed by a molecule. This is becoming increasingly important for low aspect ratio pores, with the advent of 2D materials and ultrathin membranes. In this work, a general method by which to model the resistance of the access regions of a pore in the presence of an insulating obstruction is presented. Thin oblate spheroidal slices are used to partition access regions and infer their conductance when blocked by differently shaped objects. We show that our model accurately estimates the blocked-state conductance of 2D and finite-length pores as a function of the distance from the pore in the presence of simple obstructions geometries (e.g. cylindrical and spherical objects) or complex structures (i.e. sequence of simple obstruction sub-units). The model is further shown to capture off-axis effects by predicting deeper blockages for obstructions offset from the pore's central axis. A web-based tool is created to predict the electrical signatures of a wide range of molecule geometries translocating through differently shaped pores. The introduced model will help guide experimental designs and thus presents a straightforward way to extend the quantification of the resistive pulse technique at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Creating compact localized modes for robust sound transport via singular flat band engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate the emergence of flat-band-induced compact-localized modes in acoustic Kagome lattices. Compact localized states populate singular dispersion bands characterized by band crossing, where a quadratic and a flat-band dispersion coalesce into a singularity. These conditions enable intriguing wave phenomena when the Hilbert Schmidt quantum distance, measuring the strength of the singularity, is nonzero. We report numerically and experimentally the formation of compact localized states (CLS), extremely localized in space and protected by dispersion flatness. In our system of coupled acoustic waveguides, sound waves are confined to propagate within tightly localized sites positioned both at the boundaries and within the interior of the lattice, achieving broadband and sustained confinement over time. This framework opens new avenues for the manipulation and transport of information through sound waves, with potential application in mechanics and acoustics, including communication, signal processing, and sound isolation. This work also expands the exploration of flat-band lattice physics within the realm of acoustics.</description>

      <title>Multiple-partition cross-modulation programmable metasurface empowering wireless communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the versatile manipulation capability, programmable metasurfaces are rapidly advancing in their intelligence, integration, and commercialization levels. However, as the programmable metasurfaces scale up, their control configuration becomes increasingly complicated, posing significant challenges and limitations. Here, we propose a multiple-partition cross-modulation (MPCM) programmable metasurface to enhance the wireless communication coverage with low hardware complexity. We firstly propose an innovative encoding scheme to multiply the control voltage vectors of row-column crossing, achieving high beamforming precision in free space while maintaining low control hardware complexity and reducing memory requirements for coding sequences. We then design and fabricate an MPCM programmable metasurface to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed encoding scheme. The simulated and experimental results show good agreements with the theoretically calculated outcomes in beam scanning across the E and H planes and in free-space beam pointing. The MPCM programmable metasurface offers strong flexibility and low complexity by allowing various numbers and combinations of partition items in modulation methods, catering to diverse precision demands in various scenarios. We demonstrate the performance of MPCM programmable metasurface in a realistic indoor setting, where the transmissions of videos to specific receiver positions are successfully achieved, surpassing the capabilities of traditional programmable metasurfaces. We believe that the proposed programmable metasurface has great potentials in significantly empowering the wireless communications while addressing the challenges associated with the programmable metasurface's design and implementation.</description>

      <title>Cascade hot carriers via broad-band resonant tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extraction of hot carriers (HCs) over the band-edge is a key to harvest solar energy beyond Shockley-Queisser limit1. Graphene is known as a HC-layered material due to phonon bottleneck effect near Dirac point, but limited by low photocarrier density2. Graphene/transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructures circumvent this issue by ultrafast carrier transfer from TMD to graphene2,3. Nevertheless, efficient extraction of photocurrent by means of HCs together with carrier multiplication (CM) is still missing. Here, we introduce an ultrathin broadband resonant tunneling (BRT) barrier, TiOX to efficiently extract photocurrent with simultaneous CM and HC measurements in MoS2/graphene/TiOX heterostructure. The BRT layer gives rise to boosting open circuit voltage which is linearly proportional to incident photon energy. Meanwhile, short circuit current rises rapidly over 2Eg with obvious CM feature. This was explained by defining the joint density of states between graphene and TiOX layer over positive and negative voltage. The broadband resonant tunneling states inherently constructed from oxidation states varying from Ti3+ to Ti4+ allow the ultrafast HCs to efficiently transfer from graphene to TiOX layer. We find that the number of available tunneling states is directly proportional to short circuit current, which is well corroborated with TiOX and MoS2 thickness variance. We obtained an optimum thickness of BRT layer of ~2.8 nm, yielding cascade open circuit voltage as high as ~0.7 V, two orders of magnitude higher than that without BRT layer to reach a record efficiency of 5.3% with improved fill factor owing to synergistic HC and CM conversion under 1-SUN with long-term stability.</description>

      <title>Dual axis atomic magnetometer and gyroscope enabled by nuclear spin perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alkali-noble-gas comagnetometers have become an essential tool for tests of fundamental physics and offer a compact platform for precision gyroscopy. They are, however, limited by technical noise at low frequencies, commonly due to their limited suppression of magnetic noise. Here we investigate a new method for co-magnetometry between a single noble gas and alkali species. While similar to well-known devices using self-compensation, our scheme introduces magnetic pulses that controllably perturb the noble gas and pulsed optical pumping to polarise the alkali atoms. These applied pulses allow our scheme to measure, rather than just suppress, the effect of magnetic noise thereby offering reduced cross-talk. We show numerically that our scheme retrieves four signals (rotations and magnetic fields on two transverse axes) with similar sensitivity to a single axis device. We also present a proof-of-principle experiment based on a 87Rb-129Xe cell. Our data shows a low magnetic-rotation cross-talk of $0.2 \pm 0.1\mu$Hz$/$pT, which is already on par with the most sensitive devices relying on self-compensation.</description>

      <title>Trapping of Single Atoms in Metasurface Optical Tweezer Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezer arrays have emerged as a key experimental platform for quantum computation, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology, enabling unprecedented levels of control over single atoms and molecules. Existing methods to generate tweezer arrays mostly rely on active beam-shaping devices, such as acousto-optic deflectors or liquid-crystal spatial light modulators. However, these approaches have fundamental limitations in array geometry, size, and scalability. Here we demonstrate the trapping of single atoms in optical tweezer arrays generated via holographic metasurfaces. We realize two-dimensional arrays with more than 250 tweezer traps, arranged in arbitrary geometries with trap spacings as small as 1.5 um. The arrays have a high uniformity in terms of trap depth, trap frequency, and positional accuracy, rivaling or exceeding existing approaches. Owing to sub-micrometer pixel sizes and high pixel densities, holographic metasurfaces open a path towards optical tweezer arrays with &gt;100,000 traps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear inverse source problem of detecting, localizing and identifying unknown accidental disturbances on forced and damped transmission networks. A first result is that strategic observation sets are enough to guarantee detection of disturbances. To localize and identify them, we additionally need the observation set to be absorbent. If this set is dominantly absorbent, then detection, localization and identification can be done in "quasi real-time". We illustrate these results with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Combining Bayesian Optimization, SVD and Machine Learning for Advanced Optical Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design and optimization of optical components, such as Bragg gratings, are critical for applications in telecommunications, sensing, and photonic circuits. To overcome the limitations of traditional design methods that rely heavily on computationally intensive simulations and large datasets, we propose an integrated methodology that significantly reduces these burdens while maintaining high accuracy in predicting optical response. First, we employ a Bayesian optimization technique to strategically select a limited yet informative number of simulation points from the design space, ensuring that each contributes maximally to the model's performance. Second, we utilize singular value decomposition to effectively parametrize the entire reflectance spectra into a reduced set of coefficients, allowing us to capture all significant spectral features without losing crucial information. Finally, we apply XGBoost, a robust machine learning algorithm, to predict the entire reflectance spectra from the reduced dataset. The combination of Bayesian optimization for data selection, SVD for full-spectrum fitting, and XGBoost for predictive modeling provides a powerful, generalizable framework for the design of optical components.</description>

      <title>The influence of geometry and specific electronic and nuclear energy deposition on ion-stimulated desorption from thin self-supporting membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dependence of the yield of positive secondary ions created upon impact of primary He, B and Ne ions on geometry and electronic and nuclear energy deposition by the projectiles. We employ pulsed beams in the medium energy regime and a large position-sensitive, time-of-flight detection system to ensure accurate quantification. As a target, we employ a single crystalline Si(100) self-supporting 50 nm thick membrane thus featuring two identical surfaces enabling simultaneous measurements in backscattering and transmission geometry. Electronic sputtering is identified as the governing mechanism for the desorption of hydrogen and molecular species found on the surfaces. Nevertheless, larger energy deposition to the nuclear subsystem by heavier projectiles as well as due to the directionality of the collision cascade appears to act in synergy with the electronic energy deposition leading to an overall increase in secondary ion yields. A higher yield of ions sputtered from the matrix is observed in transmission geometry only for B and Ne ions, consistent with the observed role of nuclear stopping.</description>

      <title>On-chip Moir\'e Optical Skyrmion Clusters with Nanoscale Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Skyrmions are topological defects belonging to nontrivial homotopy classes in particle theory, and are recognized as a suitable unit in the high-density, low-dissipation microelectronic devices in condensed matter physics. Their remarkably stable topology has been observed in electromagnetic waves recently. For the evanescent fields near a surface, this has been realized so far only for elementary optical skyrmions, with a fixed skyrmion number. Here we introduce the concept of moir\'e optical skyrmion clusters-multiskyrmions are nested to form a large optical skyrmion cluster-crystallized or quasi-crystallized as a consequence of the twisted nanostructures. The rapid inverting of optical skyrmion number is achieved in the imperfectly aligned composite nanostructures. This moir\'e optical skyrmion interaction mechanism is described by a lattice model. Further, the nucleation and collapse of optical skyrmion are studied, where their nanoscale dynamics are revealed with a tiny change of the twist angle. The sudden reversal of the on-chip skyrmion can serve as a precise beacon of the relative alignment deviation between twisted composite nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Polarization-independent metasurfaces based on bound states in the continuum with high Q-factor and resonance modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metasurfaces offer a powerful platform for effective light manipulation, which is crucial for advanced optical technologies. While designs of polarization-independent structures have reduced the need for polarized illumination, they are often limited by either low Q factors or low resonance modulation. Here, we design and experimentally demonstrate a metasurface with polarization-independent quasi-bound state in the continuum (quasi-BIC), where the unit cell consists of four silicon squares arranged in a two-dimensional array and the resonance properties can be controlled by adjusting the edge length difference between different squares. Our metasurface experimentally achieves a Q factor of approximately 100 and a resonance modulation of around 50%. This work addresses a common limitation in previous designs, which either achieved high Q factors exceeding 200 with a resonance modulation of less than 10%, leading to challenging signal-to-noise ratio requirements, or achieved strong resonance modulation with Q factors of only around 10, limiting light confinement and fine-tuning capabilities. In contrast, our metasurface ensures that the polarization-independent signal is sharp and distinct within the system, reducing the demands on signal-to-noise ratio and improving robustness. Experiments show the consistent performance across different polarization angles. This work contributes to the development of versatile optical devices, enhancing the potential for the practical application of BIC-based designs in areas such as optical filtering and sensing.</description>

      <title>Using optical tweezer electrophoresis to investigate clay nanoplatelet adsorption on Latex microspheres in aqueous media</title>

Abstract: The adsorption of charged clay nanoplatelets plays an important role in stabilizing emulsions by forming a barrier around the emulsion droplets and preventing coalescence. In this work, the adsorption of charged clay nanoplatelets on a preformed Latex microsphere in an aqueous medium is investigated at high temporal resolution using optical tweezer-based single-colloid electrophoresis. Above a critical clay concentration, charged clay nanoplatelets in an aqueous medium self-assemble gradually to form gel-like networks that become denser with increasing medium salinity. In a previous publication [R. Biswas et. al., Soft Matter, 2023, 19, 24007-2416], some of us had demonstrated that a Latex microsphere, optically trapped in a clay gel medium, is expected to attach to the network strands of the gel. In the present contribution, we show that for different ionic conditions of the suspending medium, the adsorption of clay nanoplatelets increases the effective surface charge on an optically trapped Latex microsphere while also enhancing the drag experienced by the latter. Besides the ubiquitous contribution of non-electrostatic dispersion forces in driving the adsorption process, we demonstrate the presence of an electrostatically-driven adsorption mechanism when the microsphere was trapped in a clay gel. These observations are qualitatively verified via cryogenic field emission scanning electron microscopy and are useful in achieving colloidal stabilisation, for example, during the preparation of clay-armoured Latex particles in Pickering emulsion polymerisation.</description>

      <title>Design rules for low-insertion-loss magnonic transducers</title>

Abstract: We present a computational framework for the design of magnonic transducers, where waveguide antennas generate and pick up spin-wave signals. Our method relies on the combination of circuit-level models with micromagnetic simulations and allows simulation of complex geometries in the magnonic domain. We validated our model with experimental measurements, which showed good agreement witch the predicted scattering parameters of the system. Using our model we identified scaling rules of the antenna radiation resistance and we show strategies to maximize transduction efficiency between the electric and magnetic domains. We designed a transducer pair on YIG with 5dB insertion loss in a 100 MHz band, an unusually low value for micron-scale spin-wave devices. This demonstrates that magnonic devices can be very efficient and competitive in RF applications.</description>

      <title>Self-Healing in Dielectric Capacitors: a Universal Method to Computationally Rate Newly Introduced Energy Storage Designs</title>

Abstract: Metal-film dielectric capacitors provide lump portions of energy on demand. While the capacities of various capacitor designs are comparable in magnitude, their stabilities make a difference. Dielectric breakdowns - micro-discharges - routinely occur in capacitors due to the inevitable presence of localized structure defects. The application of polymeric dielectric materials featuring flexible structures helps obtain more uniform insulating layers. At the modern technological level, it is impossible to completely avoid micro-discharges upon device exploitation. Every micro-discharge results in the formation of a soot channel, which is empirically known to exhibit semiconductor behavior. Because of its capability to conduct electricity, the emerged soot channels harm the subsequent capacitor performance and decrease the amount of stored energy. The accumulation of the soot throughout a dielectric capacitor ultimately results in irreversible overall failure. In the context of the dielectric breakdown, self-healing designates a range of chemical processes, which spontaneously rearrange the atoms in the soot channels to partially return their insulative function. We developed a universal method capable of rating new capacitor designs including electrode and polymer material and their proportions. We found the best-performing designs produce abundant volatile by-products after micro-discharge, whereas the soot samples exhibit lower electronic conductivities. We proved the capability of the theoretical method to rate the empirical performance of the known capacitors. The method relies on various electronic-structure simulations and potential landscape explorations. The reported advance opens an impressive avenue to computationally probe thousands of hypothetical capacitor designs.</description>

      <title>Lattice physics approaches for neural networks</title>

Abstract: Modern neuroscience has evolved into a frontier field that draws on numerous disciplines, resulting in the flourishing of novel conceptual frames primarily inspired by physics and complex systems science. Contributing in this direction, we recently introduced a mathematical framework to describe the spatiotemporal interactions of systems of neurons using lattice field theory, the reference paradigm for theoretical particle physics. In this note, we provide a concise summary of the basics of the theory, aiming to be intuitive to the interdisciplinary neuroscience community. We contextualize our methods, illustrating how to readily connect the parameters of our formulation to experimental variables using well-known renormalization procedures. This synopsis yields the key concepts needed to describe neural networks using lattice physics. Such classes of methods are attention-worthy in an era of blistering improvements in numerical computations, as they can facilitate relating the observation of neural activity to generative models underpinned by physical principles.</description>
