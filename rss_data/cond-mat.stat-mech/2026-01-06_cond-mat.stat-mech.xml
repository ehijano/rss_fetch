      <title>Stochastic Thermodynamics of Associative Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense Associative Memory networks (DenseAMs) unify several popular paradigms in Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as Hopfield Networks, transformers, and diffusion models - while casting their computational properties into the language of dynamical systems and energy landscapes. This formulation provides a natural setting for studying thermodynamics and computation in neural systems, because DenseAMs are simultaneously simple enough to admit analytic treatment and rich enough to implement nontrivial computational function. Aspects of these networks have been studied at equilibrium and at zero temperature, but the thermodynamic costs associated with their operation out of equilibrium are largely unexplored. Here, we define the thermodynamic entropy production associated with the operation of such networks, and study polynomial DenseAMs at intermediate memory load. At large system sizes, we use dynamical mean field theory to characterize work requirements and memory transition times when driving the system with corrupted memories. We find tradeoffs between entropy production, memory retrieval accuracy, and operation speed.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic geometry of friction on graphs: Resistance, commute times, and optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that for slowly driven reversible Markov chains, the thermodynamic friction metric governing dissipation is equivalent to two independently developed graph-theoretic geometries: commute-time geometry and resistance distance. This equivalence yields complementary physical insights: the commute-time metric provides the local Euclidean description of the thermodynamic manifold, while the resistance distance maps dissipation to power loss in an electrical network. We further show that this metric arises from a discrete $L^2$-Wasserstein transport cost evaluated along paths of equilibrium distributions, extending a correspondence previously shown for continuous-state processes. These results unify linear-response, electrical-resistance, random-walk, and optimal-transport frameworks, revealing linear-response dissipation as the energetic cost of transporting probability through the intrinsic geometry of the state-space network.</description>

      <title>Cellular Automata: From Structural Principles to Transport and Correlation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular automata (CA) are discrete-time dynamical systems with local update rules on a lattice. Despite their elementary definition, CA support a wide spectrum of macroscopic phenomena central to statistical physics: equilibrium and nonequilibrium phase transitions, transport and hydrodynamic limits, kinetic roughening, self-organized criticality, and complex spatiotemporal correlations. This survey focuses on three tightly connected themes. \emph{(i)} We present a structural view of CA as shift-commuting maps on configuration spaces, emphasizing rule complexity, reversibility, and conservation laws (including discrete continuity equations). \emph{(ii)} We organize transport in CA into ballistic, diffusive, and anomalous regimes, and connect microscopic currents to macroscopic laws through Green--Kubo formulas, scaling theory, and universality classes. \emph{(iii)} We develop correlation-based methods -- from structure factors and response formulas to computational mechanics and data-driven inference -- that diagnose regimes and enable coarse-graining.</description>

      <title>From Random Walks to Thermal Rides: Universal Anomalous Transport in Soaring Flights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-country soaring flights rely on intermittent atmospheric updrafts to cover long distances, producing trajectories that alternate between rapid relocation and local exploration. From a large dataset of paraglider, hang glider, and sailplane flights, we uncover a universal transport law: beyond short ballistic times, horizontal motion is persistently sub-ballistic, with a Hurst exponent $\approx 0.88$ largely independent of aircraft type. Phase-resolved analysis using a probabilistic segmentation method shows that this scaling arises from the fundamentally intermittent, two-dimensional, and directionally correlated nature of soaring transport, in which successive ballistic segments do not add coherently. We find that learning, in the sense of experience-driven improvements in exploration and decision-making, manifests primarily in the search phase, enhancing the ability to efficiently probe the air mass and locate the next thermal. Overall, our results suggest that atmospheric structure and the generic organization of the transition-search-climb cycle dominate transport properties, placing human soaring alongside biological and physical systems where anomalous transport emerges from intermittency and persistence.</description>

      <title>Renewal theory for Brownian motion with stochastically gated targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are a wide range of first passage time (FTP) problems in the physical and life sciences that can be modelled in terms of a Brownian particle binding to a reactive surface (absorption). However, prior to absorption, the particle may undergo several rounds of surface attachment (adsorption), detachment (desorption) and diffusion. Alternatively, the surface may be stochastically gated so that absorption can only occur when the gate is open. In both cases one can view each return to the surface as a renewal event. In this paper we develop a renewal theory for stochastically gated FTP problems along analogous lines to previous work on adsorption/desorption processes. We proceed by constructing a renewal equation that relates the joint probability density for particle position and the state of a gate (or multiple gates) to the probability density and FPT density for a totally absorbing (non-gated) boundary. This essentially decomposes sample paths into an alternating sequence of bulk diffusion and instantaneous adsorption/desorption events, which is terminated when adsorption coincides with an open gate. Through a variety of examples, we show how renewal theory provides a general mathematical framework for incorporating stochastic gating into FTP problems.</description>

      <title>Variation on the theme of Jarzynski's inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Jarzynski equality, which relates equilibrium free-energy difference to an average of non-equilibrium work, plays a central role in modern non-equilibrium statistical thermodynamics. In this paper, we study a weaker consequence of this relation, known as Jarzynski's inequality, which can be formally obtained from the Jarzynski equality via Jensen's inequality. We identify and analyze several extensions of Jarzynski's inequality that go beyond its direct derivation from the Jarzynski equality. In particular, we consider chemical systems both in the linear-response regime and away from linear thermodynamics. Furthermore, by employing functional-integral techniques, we extend Jarzynski's inequality to many-body statistical systems described by quantum field theory. Salient issues, such as connections of the Jarzynski inequality with the maximum work theorem and the Landau--Lifshitz theory of fluctuations, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Dislocations, vacancies and interstitials in the two-dimensional one-component plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energetics and stability of dislocations, vacancies and, interstitials in the one-component plasma (OCP), where the charges interact with a log potential and move on the curved surface of a cylinder have been investigated numerically. For vacancy-interstitial pairs, the log term of the direct Coulomb attraction and the elastic displacement energy cancel exactly at long distances, resulting in a defect energy of O(1). The numerical results confirm the predicted asymptotic behavior but also identify critical distances below which pairs evolve to different forms. We have found that bound pairs of dislocations - created by adding or removing 120 degree zig-zags of particles - have a dependence on their preparation history which is not accounted for in the usual starting point of the KTHNY theory. Furthermore, isolated dislocations, whose presence disrupts crystalline order, have energies of O(1) at some values of N, the number of particles in the system, and therefore will be thermally excited, raising questions about the applicability of standard KTHNY theory to the OCP, and supporting older suggestions that there are no phase transitions at all in the two-dimensional OCP.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal-field fidelity susceptibility analysis of the $J_1$-$J_2$ transverse-field Ising model around $J_2/J_1 \approx 0.5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The square-lattice $J_1$-$J_2$ transverse-field (TF) Ising model was investigated with the exact diagonalization (ED) method. In order to analyze the TF-driven phase transition, we applied the longitudinal-field fidelity susceptibility $\chi^{(h)}_F$, which is readily evaluated via the ED scheme. Here, the longitudinal field couples with the absolute value of the magnetic moment $|M|$ rather than the raw $M$ so that the remedied fidelity susceptibility exhibits a peak around the critical point; note that the spontaneous magnetization does not appear for the finite-size systems. As a preliminary survey, the modified fidelity susceptibility $\chi^{(h)}_F$ is applied to the analysis of criticality for $J_2=0$, where a number of preceding results are available. Thereby, properly scaling the distance from the multi-criticality, $\eta=0.5-J_2$, the $\chi^{(h)}_F$ data were cast into the crossover-scaling formula, and the multi-critical exponent for $\chi_F^{(h)}$ is estimated. The result is cross-checked by the numerically evaluated $\beta$-function behavior.</description>

      <title>Fitness Fluctuations and Correlation Time Scaling in the Barycentric Bak-Sneppen Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the barycentric version of the Bak-Sneppen model, a one-dimensional self-organized critical model that describes generalized Keynesian beauty contests with a local interaction rule. We numerically investigate the power spectral density of the fitness variable and correlation time. Through data collapse for both variables, we estimate the critical exponents. For global and local fitness variables, the power spectral density exhibits $1/f^{\alpha}$ with $0&lt; \alpha &lt; 2$, indicative of long-range correlations. We also investigate the cover time, defined as the duration required for the extinction or mutation of species across the entire system in the critical state of the barycentric BS model. Using finite-size scaling and extreme value theory, we analyze the statistical properties of the cover time. Our results show power-law scaling with system size for the mean, variance, mode, and peak probability. Furthermore, the cumulative probability distribution exhibits data collapse, and the associated scaling function is well described by the generalized extreme value density, closely approximating the Gumbel family.</description>

      <title>A bottom-up approach to fluctuating hydrodynamics: Coarse-graining of stochastic lattice gases and the Dean-Kawasaki equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluctuating hydrodynamics provides a quantitative, large-scale description of many-body systems in terms of smooth variables, with microscopic details entering only through a small set of transport coefficients. Although this framework has been highly successful in characterizing macroscopic fluctuations and correlations, a systematic derivation of fluctuating hydrodynamics from underlying stochastic microscopic dynamics remains obscure for broad classes of interacting systems. For stochastic lattice gas models with gradient dynamics and a single conserved density, we develop a path-integral based coarse-graining procedure that recovers fluctuating hydrodynamics in a controlled manner. Our analysis highlights the essential role of local-equilibrium averages, which go beyond na\"ive mean-field-type gradient expansions. We further extend this approach to interacting Brownian particles by coarse-graining the Dean-Kawasaki equation, revealing a mobility proportional to the density and a diffusivity determined by the thermodynamic pressure.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Kondo destruction and global phase diagram of heavy fermion metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strange metals represent a foundational problem in quantum condensed matter physics, and heavy fermion systems provide a canonical setting to advance a general understanding. The concept of a Kondo destruction quantum critical point is widely invoked to describe the competition of the Kondo effect and the local-moment magnetism. Here, we develop a unified field-theoretic approach, analyzing this competition from a rare approach that is anchored by the magnetically ordered side. Our analysis reveals, for the first time within a renormalization group framework, a quantum critical point across which the Kondo effect goes from being destroyed to dominating. Our findings elucidate not only the Kondo destruction quantum criticality but also an accompanying global phase diagram of heavy fermion metals.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and Topology in the Non-Hermitian Kitaev chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain with non-reciprocal hopping amplitudes and asymmetric superconducting pairing. We work out the symmetry structure of the model and show that particle-hole symmetry (PHS) is preserved throughout the entire parameter regime. As a consequence of PHS, the topological phase transition point of a finite open chain coincides with that of the periodic (infinite) system. By explicitly constructing the zero-energy wave functions (Majorana modes), we show that Majorana modes necessarily occur as reciprocal localization pairs accumulating on opposite boundaries, whose combined probability density exhibits an exact cancellation of the non-Hermitian skin effect for the zero energy modes. Excited states, by contrast, generically display skin-effect localization, with particle and hole components accumulating at opposite ends of the system. At the level of bulk topology, we further construct a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant in restricted parameter regimes that correctly distinguishes the topological and trivial phases. Finally, we present the topological phase diagram of the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain across a broad range of complex parameters and delineate the associated phase boundaries.</description>

      <title>Tuneable skyrmion and anti-skyrmion fluids via mechanical strain in chiral kagome lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are nanometric swirling spin textures that exhibit remarkable stability at finite temperatures, making them promising candidates for spintronic applications. Achieving controllable stability and transitions between distinct topological structures is crucial for practical implementations. In this work, we investigate the effect of uniaxial mechanical strain on a magnetic model on the kagome lattice, focusing on skyrmion stability and emergent topological phases. To this end, we consider a Heisenberg model that includes exchange interactions and both in-plane and out-of-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. Using a combination of Spin-Lattice Dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, we explore uniaxial strain variations in the range of $-10\%$ to $10\%$, showing important effects on the phase diagram. For compressive strain, we find that the density of skyrmions in the skyrmion gas (SkG) phase can be tuned and that the stability of this phase extends to higher temperatures. Tensile strain, in contrast, reduces the number of skyrmions and promotes transitions to other magnetic states. Within this regime, strain levels of about ($\sim4-6\%$) lead to a change in topological charge, turning skyrmions ($Q=-1$) into antiskyrmions ($Q=+1$). We also examine how strain affects other phases commonly appearing in skyrmion-hosting systems, such as the helical and fully polarized states, showing that mechanical deformation alters their stability and characteristic properties. Finally, we compare these results with the strain response of a more conventional skyrmion model, in order to clarify the role of the different interactions involved. Our results identify strain as an experimentally accessible route for engineering topological spin textures.</description>

      <title>Tunable chiral spiral phases in a non-Hermitian Ising-Gamma spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the influence of dissipation on the Ising-Gamma model. Through observables such as ground-state energy, order parameters, entanglement entropy, etc., we identify each phase region and provide the global phase diagram of the system. The results show that the region of the spiral phase will continuously expand with the increase of dissipation, gradually squeezing the original paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic phase regions. Remarkably, unlike the conservative system, the introduction of dissipation will cause two spiral phases with opposite chiralities to emerge simultaneously in the system, which provides a possibility for the manipulation of spiral chirality in cold atomic experiments. Moreover, we reveal the mechanism of the dependence of the transformation between these two spiral phases with distinct chirality on the strength of the relative coefficient of off-diagonal Gamma interactions in the Ising-Gamma model. Since both the relevant order parameters and dissipation can be well controlled within a detectable range, these phenomena can be observed in ultracold atomic experiments.</description>

      <title>Critical volatility threshold for log-normal to power-law transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random walk models with log-normal outcomes fit local market observations remarkably well. Yet interconnected or recursive structures - layered derivatives, leveraged positions, iterative funding rounds - periodically produce power-law distributed events. We show that the transition from log-normal to power-law dynamics requires only three conditions: randomness in the underlying process, rectification of payouts, and iterative feed-forward of expected values. Using an infinite option-on-option chain as an illustrative model, we derive a critical volatility threshold at $\sigma^* = \sqrt{2\pi} \approx 250.66\%$ for the unconditional case. With selective survival - where participants require minimum returns to continue - the critical threshold drops discontinuously to $\sigma_{\text{th}}^{*} = \sqrt{\pi/2} \approx 125.3\%$, and can decrease further with higher survival thresholds. The resulting outcomes follow what we term the Critical Volatility ($V^*$) Distribution - a power-law whose exponent admits closed-form expression in terms of survival pressure and conditional expected growth. The result suggests that fat tails may be an emergent property of iterative log-normal processes with selection rather than an exogenous feature.</description>

      <title>Utilizing intermediate states in quantum annealing for multi-objective optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate obtaining intermediate quantum states during the quantum annealing process to address the limitation of the linear weighted sum method in multi-objective optimization, which inherently fails to reach non-convex regions of the Pareto front. We validate this approach through physical experiments utilizing quench-based readout and numerical simulations assuming ideal mid-anneal measurements. Both methods consistently demonstrate a clear trade-off where earlier timing enhances diversity of the solutions, whereas later timing ensures convergence to non-dominated solutions. Notably, a practical compromise timing balances both metrics. The qualitative agreement between practical quench and ideal simulation indicates the potential of accessing the intermediate states for comprehensive Pareto front exploration.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal visual perception and polar alignment drive collective states in chiral active particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-propelled particles rarely move in straight lines; environmental interactions, shape asymmetry, and intrinsic torques generically induce curved or fluctuating trajectories. In biological and synthetic systems, this curvature often coexists with directional sensing and non-reciprocal interactions. Motivated by this, we explore the collective dynamics of chiral intelligent active Brownian particles (iABPs) that combine polar alignment with vision-based sensing. By varying the ratio of alignment to visual maneuverability, the vision angle, and the reduced chirality $(\omega/D_r)$, we construct a phase diagram exhibiting diverse collective states: spinners, vortices, ripples, worm-like swarms, rotary clusters, and irregular aggregates. Chirality critically governs their morphology: high chirality yields dilute phases, while moderate to low chirality produces cohesive yet dynamic patterns. Ripple loops emerge as a distinct state, characterized by expanding ring-like motion driven by outward torques and sustained only when both particle number and visual maneuverability are large. Structural and dynamical measures, including polarization, pair correlations, mean-square displacement, and orientation correlations, reveal clear signatures distinguishing these phases. Overall, our results show how chirality, non-reciprocal perception, and alignment together generate collective states inaccessible to non-chiral systems, with implications for chiral active matter in biological and synthetic contexts.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of Unfair Sampling in Quantum Annealing by Node Centrality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In applications where multiple optimal solutions are needed, transverse-field quantum annealing (QA) is known to sample degenerate ground states in a strongly biased manner. Despite extensive empirical observations, it remains unclear which features of degenerate ground states are preferentially sampled and why by QA. Here we analyze the final states using degenerate perturbation theory to characterize the preference among them. In this analysis, the adjacency matrix of the graph composed by the ground states naturally emerges, and we can predict the eigenvector centralities (one of the node centralities) are related to the probabilities of these states. We verify this prediction on toy models where degeneracy is lifted at first and second order, and we show that second-order weights encode local barrier information, relating sampling fairness to the flatness of the local energy landscape. Finally, this perspective suggests two practical routes toward fair sampling -- promoting connectivity of the graph and reducing heterogeneity of centralities -- and we illustrate consistency with higher-order drivers and minor-embedding transformations.</description>

      <title>Critical Phenomena on the Bethe Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the critical behavior of a family of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric scalar field theories on the Bethe lattice (the tree limit of regular hyperbolic tessellations) using both the non-perturbative Functional Renormalization Group and lattice perturbation theory. The family is indexed by the parameter $\zeta \in (0,1]$, which determines the range of the theory via the kinetic term constructed from the graph Laplacian raised to the power $\zeta$. Specifically, $\zeta=1$ is the short-range theory, while $0&lt;\zeta&lt;1$ defines the long-range model. Due to the hyperbolic nature of Bethe lattices, the Laplacian lacks a zero mode and exhibits a spectral gap. We find that upon closing this spectral gap by a modification of the Laplacian, the scalar field theories exhibit novel critical behavior in the form of non-trivial fixed points with critical exponents governed by $\zeta$ and the spectral dimension $d_s=3$. In particular, our analysis indicates the presence of a Wilson-Fisher fixed point for the short range $\zeta =1$ theory. In contrast, the nearest-neighbor Ising model on the Bethe lattice is known to exhibit mean-field critical exponents. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first evidence that a scalar $\phi^4$ theory and the discrete Ising model on the same underlying lattice may lie in distinct universality classes.</description>

      <title>Simulating Non-Markovian Dynamics in Open Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum technologies and related experiments have created a need for highly accurate, versatile, and computationally efficient simulation techniques for the dynamics of open quantum systems. Long-lived correlation effects (non-Markovianity), system-environment hybridization, and the necessity for accuracy beyond the Born-Markov approximation form particular challenges. Approaches to meet these challenges have been introduced, originating from different fields, such as hierarchical equations of motion, Lindblad-pseudomode formulas, chain-mapping approaches, quantum Brownian motion master equations, stochastic unravelings, and refined quantum master equations. This diversity, while indicative of the field's relevance, has inadvertently led to a fragmentation that hinders cohesive advances and their effective cross-community application to current problems for complex systems. How are different approaches related to each other? What are their strengths and limitations? Here we give a systematic overview and concise discussion addressing these questions. We make use of a unified framework which very conveniently allows to link different schemes and, this way, may also catalyze further progress. In line with the state of the art, this framework is formulated not in a fully reduced space of the system but in an extended state space which in a minimal fashion includes effective reservoir modes. This in turn offers a comprehensive understanding of existing methods, elucidating their physical interpretations, interconnections, and applicability.</description>

      <title>Colloidal Suspensions can have Non-Zero Angles of Repose below the Minimal Value for Athermal Frictionless Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the angle of repose ${\theta}_r$ of dense suspensions of colloidal silica particles ($d = 2$ $\mu m$ to $7$ $\mu m$) in water-filled microfluidic rotating drums experiments, to probe the crossover between the thermal (colloidal) and athermal (granular) regimes. For the smallest particles, thermal agitation promotes slow creep flows, and piles always flatten completely regardless of their initial inclination angle, resulting in ${\theta}_r = 0$. Above a critical particle size, piles of colloids stop flowing at a finite angle of repose, which increases with particle size but remains below the minimal value expected for athermal frictionless granular materials: $0 &lt; {\theta}_r &lt; {\theta}_{ath} \approx 5.8{\deg}$. We quantify the arrest dynamics as a function of the gravitational P\'eclet number $Pe_g$, which characterizes the competition between particle weight and thermal agitation. Our measurements are consistent with a recent rheological model [Billon et al., Phys. Rev. Fluids 8, 034302, 2023], in which the arrested state stems from a crossover between glass-like and jamming-dominated regimes as the granular pressure in the pile increases relative to the thermal pressure.</description>

      <title>Non-algebraic first return probability of a stretched random walk near a convex boundary and its effect on adsorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $N$-step random walk, elongated in the vicinity of a disc (in 2D) or a sphere (in 3D) of radius $R$, demonstrates a non-algebraic stretched exponential decay $P_N\sim \exp\left(-{\rm const}\, N^{1/3}\right)$ for the first return probability $P_N$ in the double-scaling limit $N=\frac{L}{a}\gg 1, \frac{R}{a}\gg 1$ conditioned that $\frac{L}{R}=c={\rm const}$. Stretching means that the length of the walk, $L=Na$ (where $a$ is the unit step length) satisfies the condition $L = cR$, where $c &gt; \pi$ and under "first return" we understand the radial first arrival to a boundary. Both analytic and numerical evidences of the non-algebraic behavior of $P_N$ are provided. Considering the model of a polymer loop stretched ("inflated") by external force, we show that non-algebraic behavior of $P_N$ affects the adsorption of a polymer at the boundary of a sticky disc in 2D, manifesting in a first order localization transition.</description>

      <title>Probing phase transitions of finite directed polymers near a corrugated wall via two-replica analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15332v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the pinning transition in a (1+1)-dimensional lattice model of a fluctuating interface interacting with a corrugated impenetrable wall. The interface is modeled as an $N$-step directed one-dimensional random walk on the half-line $x \ge 0$. Its interaction with the wall is described by a quenched, site-dependent, short-ranged random potential $u_j$ ($j = 1,\ldots,N$), distributed according to $Q(u_j)$ and localized at $x = 0$. By computing the first two disorder--averaged moments of the partition function, $\langle G_N \rangle$ and $\langle G_N^2 \rangle$, and by analyzing the analytic structure of the resulting expressions, we derive an explicit criterion for the coincidence or distinction of the pinning transitions in annealed and quenched systems. We show that, although the transition points of the annealed and quenched systems are always different in the thermodynamic limit, for finite systems there exists a "gray zone" in which this difference is hardly detectable. Our results may help reconcile conflicting views on whether quenched disorder is marginally relevant.</description>

      <title>Efficient Identification of Critical Transitions via Flow Matching: A Scalable Generative Approach for Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15318v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a machine learning framework based on Flow Matching (FM) to identify critical properties in many-body systems efficiently. Using the 2D XY model as a benchmark, we demonstrate that a single network, trained only on configurations from a small ($32\times 32$) lattice at sparse temperature points, effectively generalizes across both temperature and system size. This dual generalization enables two primary applications for large-scale computational physics: (i) a rapid "train-small, predict-large" strategy to locate phase transition points for significantly larger systems ($128\times 128$) without retraining, facilitating efficient finite-size scaling analysis; and (ii) the fast generation of high-fidelity, decorrelated initial spin configurations for large-scale Monte Carlo simulations, providing a robust starting point that bypasses the long thermalization times of traditional samplers. These capabilities arise from the combination of the Flow Matching framework, which learns stable probability-flow vector fields, and the inductive biases of the U-Net architecture that capture scale-invariant local correlations. Our approach offers a scalable and efficient tool for exploring the thermodynamic limit, serving as both a rapid explorer for phase boundaries and a high-performance initializer for high-precision studies.</description>

Abstract: Far-from-equilibrium thermodynamic systems dominated by strong nonlinearity are reformulated within a dynamical framework based on the Nambu bracket formalism. It is demonstrated that general complex nonlinear non-equilibrium systems can be locally reduced to a simple form of Nambu Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics (NNET). Furthermore, mathematical and dynamical obstacles encountered in extending this reduction globally are discussed, and a generalized formulation that incorporates nonlinear effects through mixed higher-order tensors is proposed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12641v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply Nambu non-equilibrium thermodynamics (NNET)-a dynamics with multiple Hamiltonians coupled to entropy-induced dissipation-to paradigmatic far-from-equilibrium systems. Concretely, we construct NNET realizations for the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction (oscillatory), the Hindmarsh-Rose neuron model (spiking), and the Lorenz and Chen systems (chaotic), and analyze their dynamical and thermodynamic signatures. Across all cases the velocity field cleanly decomposes into a reversible Nambu part and an irreversible entropygradient part, anchored by a model-independent quasi-conserved quantity. This construction reproduces cycles, spikes, and strange-attractor behavior and clarifies transitions among steady, periodic, and chaotic regimes via cross-model diagnostics. These results demonstrate that NNET provides a unified, quantitatively consistent framework for oscillatory, spiking, and chaotic non-equilibrium systems, offering a systematic description beyond the scope of linear-response theories such as Onsager's relations or GENERIC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11459v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past decade, a combinatorial framework for discrete, finite, and irreversibly aggregating systems has emerged. This work reviews its progress, practical applications, and limitations. We outline the approach's assumptions and foundations, based on direct enumeration of system states, contrasting with classical Smoluchowski and Marcus-Lushnikov methods. Using the constant kernel as an example, we derive combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and their standard deviation, and present the complete probability distribution for cluster counts. The method is then extended to several kernels (additive, product, linear-chain, condensation) by explicitly enumerating ways to form clusters of a given size. For general kernels, approximate solutions are obtained via recursive expressions, enabling predictions without explicit solutions. Applications to aerosol growth and planetesimal formation are demonstrated, with comparisons to numerical results. We summarize issues of validity and precision and propose open problems. The appendix includes partial Bell polynomials, generating functions, Lagrange inversion, potential applications, and links between combinatorial and scaling solutions of the Smoluchowski equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.13479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The complete, nonperturbative content of random matrix models is described by resurgent-transseries -- general solutions to their corresponding string-equations. These transseries include exponentially-suppressed multi-instanton amplitudes obtained by eigenvalue tunneling, but they also contain exponentially-enhanced and mixed instanton-like sectors with no known matrix model interpretation. This work shows how these sectors can be also described by eigenvalue tunneling in matrix models -- but on the non-physical sheet of the spectral curve describing their large-N limit. This picture further explains the full resurgence of random matrices via analysis of all possible eigenvalue integration-contours. How to calculate these "anti" eigenvalue-tunneling amplitudes is explained in detail and in various examples, such as the cubic and quartic matrix models, and their double-scaling limit to Painleve I. This further provides direct matrix-model derivations of their resurgent Stokes data, which were recently obtained by different techniques.</description>

      <title>Tunable quantum criticality and pseudocriticality across the fixed-point annihilation in the anisotropic spin-boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin-boson models are simple examples of quantum dissipative systems, but also serve as effective models in quantum magnetism and exhibit nontrivial criticality. Recently, they have been established as a platform to study the nontrivial renormalization-group (RG) scenario of fixed-point annihilation, in which two intermediate-coupling RG fixed points collide and generate an extremely slow RG flow near the collision. For the Bose Kondo model, a single $S=1/2$ spin where each spin component couples to an independent bosonic bath with power-law spectrum $\propto \omega^s$ via dissipation strengths $\alpha_i$, $i\in\{x,y,z\}$, such phenomena occur sequentially for the U(1)-symmetric model at $\alpha_z=0$ and the SU(2)-symmetric case at $\alpha_z = \alpha_{xy}$, as the bath exponent $s&lt;1$ is tuned. Here we use an exact wormhole quantum Monte Carlo method for retarded interactions to explore how this nontrivial fixed-point structure affects the phase diagram and phase transitions of the anisotropic model. In particular, we show how fixed-point annihilation within a symmetry-enhanced critical manifold leads to (i) a continuous order-to-order transition beyond the Landau paradigm, (ii) a symmetry-enhanced first-order transition, and (iii) pseudocriticality, which can be tuned into each other via the bath exponent $s$. We extract critical exponents at the continuous transition, but also find scaling behavior at the symmetry-enhanced first-order transition, for which the inverse correlation-length exponent is given by the bath exponent $s$. Moreover, we provide direct numerical evidence for pseudocritical scaling on both sides of the fixed-point collision, which manifests in an extremely slow drift of the correlation-length exponent. We also study the crossover away from the SU(2)-symmetric case and determine the phase boundary of an extended U(1)-symmetric critical phase.</description>

      <title>Onsager vortex clusters on a sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Onsager vortex clustered states in a shell-shaped superfluid containing a large number of quantum vortices. In the incompressible limit and at low temperatures, the relevant problem can be boiled down to the statistical mechanics of neutral point vortices confined on a sphere. We analyze rotation free vortex clustered states within the mean field theory in the microcanonical ensemble. We find that the sandwich state, which involves the separating of vortices with opposite circulation and the clustering of vortices with the same circulation around the poles and the equator, is the maximum entropy vortex distribution, subject to zero angular momentum constraint. The dipole momentum vanishes for the sandwich state and the quadrupole tensor serves as an order parameter to characterize the vortex cluster structure. For given finite angular momentum, the equilibrium vortex distribution forms a dipole structure, i.e., vortices with opposite sign are separated and are accumulated around the south and north pole, respectively. The conditions for the onset of clustering, and the exponents associated with the quadrupole moment and the dipole moment as functions of energy, are obtained within the mean field theory. At large energies,
  we obtain asymptotically exact vortex density distributions using the stereographic projection method, giving rise to the parameter bounds for the vortex clustered states. The analytical predictions are in excellent agreement with microcanonical Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present quantum heat machines using a diatomic molecule modelled by a $q$-deformed potential as a working medium. We analyze the effect of the deformation parameter and other potential parameters on the work output and efficiency of the quantum Otto and quantum Carnot heat cycles. Furthermore, we derive the analytical expressions of work and efficiency as a function of these parameters. Interestingly, our system operates as a quantum heat engine across the range of parameters considered. In addition, the efficiency of the quantum Otto heat engine is seen to be tunable by the deformation parameter. Our findings provide useful insight for understanding the impact of anharmonicity on the design of quantum thermal machines.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic expressions for steady-state distribution and static responses in population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11296v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the fundamental questions in population dynamics is how biological populations respond to environmental perturbations. In population dynamics, the mean fitness and the fraction of a trait in the steady state are important because they indicate how well the trait and the population adapt to the environment. In this study, we examine the parallel mutation-reproduction model, which is one of the simplest models of an evolvable population. As an extension of the Markov chain tree theorem, we derive diagrammatic expressions for the static responses of mean fitness and the steady-state distribution of the population. For the parallel mutation-reproduction model, we consider self-loops, which represent trait reproduction and are excluded from the Markov chain tree theorem for the linear master equation. To generalize the theorem, we introduce the concept of rooted $0$/$1$ loop forests, which generalize spanning trees with loops. We demonstrate that the weights of rooted $0$/$1$ loop forests yield the static responses of mean fitness and the steady-state distribution. Our results provide exact expressions for the static responses and the steady-state distribution. Additionally, we discuss approximations of these expressions in cases where reproduction or mutation is dominant. We provide numerical examples to illustrate these approximations and exact expressions.</description>

      <title>EFT meets CFT: Multiloop renormalization of higher-dimensional operators in general $\phi^4$ theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The renormalization of composite operators is a fundamental aspect of quantum field theory, relevant for the description of phase transitions and high energy phenomenology. We calculate the anomalous dimensions of a large set of operators in any scalar $\phi^4$ theory in $d=4-\varepsilon$ dimensions, up to five loops in most cases. The results have applications in both effective field theory (EFT) and conformal field theory (CFT). As an EFT application, we extract the five-loop renormalization group (RG) equations of the Higgs sector of the Standard Model EFT at dimension six, and up to two loops at dimension eight, aligning our operator basis with custodial symmetry violation. Additionally, for CFT, by resumming the $\varepsilon$-expanded results at the fixed-point, we determine the entire low-lying spectrum (i.e. up to dimension six and Lorentz rank two) of the Ising, $O(n)$ and hypercubic scalar CFTs. Our work enables future conformal bootstrap studies for numerous theories of interest. We include introductions to EFT and CFT, and we illustrate our method and the structure in RG mixing matrices in several illuminating examples, which may also be of general interest. All results in the general theory are publicly available and we describe a systematic path towards applying them to more complicated CFTs.</description>

      <title>Precise computation of universal corner entanglement entropy at 2+1 dimension: From Ising to Gaussian quantum critical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing the subleading logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy (EE) of (2+1)d quantum many-body systems remains a significant challenge, despite its central role in revealing universal information about quantum states and quantum critical points (QCPs). Building on recent algorithmic advances that enable the stable calculation of EE as an exponential observable~\cite{zhouIncremental2024,zhangIntegral2024,liaoExtracting2024}, we develop a {\it bubble basis} projector quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to precisely and efficiently compute the universal corner of EE at QCPs in a (2+1)d square-lattice transverse-field Ising model augmented with a four-body interaction. Turning on this interaction allows us to trace an Ising critical line, reaching the tricritical point, and then a line of first-order phase transition. In (2+1)d, the tricritical point is described by the Gaussian theory, where a theoretical calculation of the corner logarithmic term in the 2nd R\'enyi entropy term is available~\cite{UniversalCasini2007}. Our QMC results are in quantitative agreement with this theoretical value, providing a highly nontrivial benchmark of the algorithm. Furthermore, we also study the R\'enyi EE at the Ising critical line and on the first-order transition line, obtaining results consistent with theoretical expectations. These findings establish the long-sought connection between the universal values of an exactly solvable limit and those of a strongly correlated regime at (2+1)d.</description>

      <title>Understanding the temperature response of biological systems: Part I -- Phenomenological descriptions and microscopic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Virtually every biological rate depends on temperature, yet the resulting rate-temperature relationships often deviate strongly from simple Arrhenius behavior. In this first part of a two-part review, we survey empirical and phenomenological models used to describe biological temperature responses across scales, from enzymatic reactions to organismal performance. We discuss common functional forms, including symmetric and asymmetric thermal performance curves and extensions of the Arrhenius law, and we highlight how these models define operational quantities such as optimal temperatures, thermal breadths, and thermal limits. In Part II of this review, we will discuss how system-level temperature response curves emerge from the interaction of many underlying reactions.</description>

      <title>Information supercurrents and spin waves in chiral active matter: Universality of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16884v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent minimalist modeling indicates that overdamped polar chiral active matter can support inviscid Euler turbulence, despite the system's strictly dissipative microscopic nature. In this article, we establish the statistical mechanical foundation for this emergent inertial regime by deriving a formal isomorphism between the model's agent dynamics and the overdamped Langevin equation for disordered Josephson junctions. We identify the trapped agent state as carrying non-dissipative phase rigidity supercurrents, a mapping we confirm empirically by demonstrating a disorder-broadened Adler-Ohmic crossover in the system's slip velocity. Generalizing this framework to three dimensions ($S^1\to S^2$), we show that polar alignment on the unit sphere is geometrically equivalent to the Gilbert damping term in spintronics, and that the two-dimensional Kuramoto coupling term naturally appears in the tangent-plane projection of spin relaxation. This constraint generates inertial spin waves (ferromagnetic magnons) from the overdamped active bath, recovering the macroscopic transport predicted by Toner-Tu theory without invoking microscopic inertia. Our results show that all polar chiral agents who seek to align on the unit sphere strictly constitute a dissipative spintronic fluid, where phase gradient transport is ensured by the Goldstone modes of the underlying broken symmetry.</description>

      <title>Spin-operator form factors of the critical Ising chain and their finite volume scaling limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a self-contained derivation of the spin-operator matrix elements in the fermionic basis, for the critical Ising chain at a generic system length $N\in 2Z_{\ge 2}$. The approach relies on the near-Cauchy property of certain matrices formed by the Toeplitz symbol in the critical model, and leads to simpler product formulas for the dressing functions in terms of square root functions. These square root products allow fully dis-singularized integral representations. In the finite volume scaling limit, they further reduce to the Binet's second integral for the gamma function logarithm and its Hermite's generalization. As such, all the matrix elements in the scaling limit allow simple product formulas in terms of the gamma function at integer and half-integer arguments, and are rational numbers up to $\sqrt{2}$. They are exactly the spin-operator form factors of the Ising CFT in the fermionic basis, whose explicit forms are much less well known in comparison to the finite-volume form factors in the massive theory. We also fully determine the normalization factor of the spin-operator and show explicitly how the coefficient $G(\frac{1}{2})G(\frac{3}{2})$ appear through a ground state overlap.</description>
