      <title>Gauging modulated symmetries: Kramers-Wannier dualities and non-invertible reflections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modulated symmetries are internal symmetries that act in a non-uniform, spatially modulated way and are generalizations of, for example, dipole symmetries. In this paper, we systematically study the gauging of finite Abelian modulated symmetries in ${1+1}$ dimensions. Working with local Hamiltonians of spin chains, we explore the dual symmetries after gauging and their potential new spatial modulations. We establish sufficient conditions for the existence of an isomorphism between the modulated symmetries and their dual, naturally implemented by lattice reflections. For instance, in systems of prime qudits, translation invariance guarantees this isomorphism. For non-prime qudits, we show using techniques from ring theory that this isomorphism can also exist, although it is not guaranteed by lattice translation symmetry alone. From this isomorphism, we identify new Kramers-Wannier dualities and construct related non-invertible reflection symmetry operators using sequential quantum circuits. Notably, this non-invertible reflection symmetry exists even when the system lacks ordinary reflection symmetry. Throughout the paper, we illustrate these results using various simple toy models.</description>

      <title>Vortex structure in a $d$-wave superconductor obtained by a confinement transition from the pseudogap metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the structure of flux $h/(2e)$ vortices in a $d$-wave superconductor using a continuum SU(2) gauge theory of 2 flavors of charge $e$, SU(2)-fundamental Higgs bosons. Period-2 charge order is present near the vortex center. Upon coupling the electrons to the superconducting and charge order parameters, we find that the electronic local density of states does not have a zero-bias peak, in contrast to BCS theory. But there are sub-gap peaks at positive and negative bias, and these exhibit anti-phase periodic spatial modulations, as observed in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments in the underdoped cuprates (K. Matsuba et al., J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 76, 063704 (2007)).</description>

      <title>Spin mechanism of drag resistance in strongly-correlated electron liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of Coulomb drag resistance in a bilayer system of strongly-correlated electron liquids magnetized by an in-plane field employing the framework of hydrodynamic theory. We identify a mechanism for drag magnetoresistance, which physically arises from the spin diffusion driven by fluctuations of the spin currents within a partially spin-polarized fluid. This effect is further enhanced by acoustic and optic plasmon resonances within the bilayer, where hydrodynamic plasmons are driven by fluctuating viscous stresses. We express the drag magnetoresistivity in terms of the intrinsic dissipative coefficients and basic thermodynamic properties of the electron fluid. Our results are derived nonperturbatively in interaction strength and do not rely on assuming Fermi-liquid behavior of the electron liquid, and applicable also in the regimes of semiquantum and highly correlated classical fluids.</description>

      <title>Origin of the hidden energy scale and the $f$-ratio in geometrically frustrated magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sufficiently clean geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets are the largest class of candidate materials that may host quantum spin liquids (QSLs). Some of them have been shown to exhibit spin-glass freezing, potentially precluding QSLs, at the "hidden energy scale", which is significantly lower than the microscopic energy scale of spin interactions. Here, we investigate the origin of the hidden energy scale and its relationship to the $f$-ratio, the figure of merit for the degree of frustration in GF magnetic materials. The available experimental and numerical data provide evidence that GF magnets display, universally, two distinct temperature scales in the specific heat, the lowest of which is of the order of the hidden energy scale $T^*$. We argue that this scale is determined by non-magnetic excitations, similar to spin exchanges in chains of spins. The collective entropy of such excitations matches the entropy of the ground states of the Ising model on the same lattice, which provides a way to verify the proposed scenario in experiment. We further confirm this scenario of the hidden energy scale by numerical simulations of spins on the kagome lattice. As $T^*$ is a property of the clean GF medium, it leads to a constraint on the $f$-ratio.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation Spectrum of Critical Fermi Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Gaussian fluctuation spectrum of the large $N$ Yukawa-SYK model, which describes a Fermi surface coupled to an Ising-nematic quantum critical point in (2+1) spacetime dimensions with translation symmetry. The large $N$ saddle point is described by the Migdal-Eliashberg equations, and the Gaussian fluctuation around it is generated by the Bethe-Salpeter kernel $K_\text{BS}$. Based on the Ward identities, we propose an inner product on the space of two point functions, which reveals a large number of soft modes of $K_\text{BS}$. These soft modes parameterize deformation of the Fermi surface, and their fluctuation eigenvalues describe their decay rates. We analytically compute these eigenvalues for a circular Fermi surface, and we discover the odd-parity modes to be parametrically longer-lived than the even-parity modes, due to the kinematic constraint of fermions scattering on a convex FS. The sign of the eigenvalues signals an instability of the Ising-nematic quantum critical point at zero temperature for a convex Fermi surface. At finite temperature, the system can be stabilized by thermal fluctuations of the critical boson. We derive an effective action that describes the soft-mode dynamics, and it leads to a linearized Boltzmann equation, where the real part of the soft-mode eigenvalues can be interpreted as the collision rates. The structure of the effective action is similar to the theory of linear bosonization of a Fermi surface. Analyzing the Boltzmann equation, we obtain a conventional hydrodynamic transport regime and a tomographic transport regime. In both regimes, the conductance of the system in finite geometry can be a sharp indicator for the soft-mode dynamics and non-Fermi liquid physics.</description>

      <title>Superconductor-Insulator Transition in the TMD moir\'{e} systems and the Deconfined Quantum Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that the recently observed superconductor-insulator transition (SIT) in the twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides moir\'{e} system at hole filling $\nu = 1$ may be described by the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP), which was originally proposed for the transition between the N\'{e}el order and the valence bond solid (VBS) order on the square lattice. The key symmetries involved in the original DQCP include a $\mathrm{SO}(3)_s$ spin symmetry, as well as a $C_4$ lattice rotation symmetry for the VBS order that is enlarged into a $\mathrm{U}(1)_v$ symmetry near the DQCP. In the current SIT under consideration, the counterpart of the $\mathrm{SO}(3)_s$ spin symmetry is an approximate $\mathrm{SO}(3)_v$ symmetry that transforms between different crystalline orders on the triangular lattice; and the role of the $\mathrm{U}(1)_v$ symmetry is replaced by the ordinary charge-$\mathrm{U}(1)_e$ symmetry. And at the DQCP the $\mathrm{SO}(3)_v \times \mathrm{U}(1)_e$ may enlarge into an emergent $\mathrm{SO}(5)$ symmetry. Under strain, the SIT is driven into either a prominent first order transition, or an "easy-plane" DQCP, which is expected to have an emergent $\mathrm{O}(4)$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>The interplay between a pseudogap and superconductivity in a two-dimensional Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly correlated electrons systems may exhibit a variety of interesting phenomena, for instance, superconductivity and pseudogap, as is the case of cuprates and pnictides. In strongly correlated electron systems, it is considered essential to understand, not only the nature of the pseudogap, but also the relationship between superconductivity and the pseudogap. In order to address this question, in the present work, we investigated a one-band Hubbard model treated by the Green's function method within an n-pole approximation. In the strongly correlated regime, antiferromagnetic correlations give rise to nearly flat band regions in the nodal points of the quasiparticle bands. As a consequence, a pseudogap emerges at the antinodal points of the Fermi surface. The obtained results indicate that the same antiferromagnetic correlations responsible for a pseudogap, can also favor superconductivity, providing an increase in the superconducting critical temperature Tc.</description>

      <title>Hubbard model on a triangular lattice at finite temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the strong coupling diagram technique, we find three phases of the half-filled isotropic Hubbard model on a triangular lattice at finite temperatures. The weak-interaction ($U\lesssim5t$) and strong-interaction ($U\gtrsim9t$) phases are similar to those obtained by zero-temperature methods -- the former is a metal without perceptible spin excitations; the latter is a Mott insulator with the 120$^\circ$ short-range spin ordering. Zero-temperature approaches predict a nonmagnetic insulating spin-liquid phase sandwiched between these two regions. In our finite-temperature calculations, the Mott gap in the intermediate phase is filled by the Fermi-level peak, which is a manifestation of the bound states of electrons with pronounced spin excitations. We relate the appearance of these excitations at finite temperatures to the Pomeranchuk effect.</description>

      <title>Intertwined superconductivity and orbital selectivity in a three-orbital Hubbard model for the iron pnictides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a three-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori model relevant for iron-based superconductors using variational wave functions, which explicitly include spatial correlations and electron pairing. We span the nonmagnetic sector ranging from a filling $n=4$, which is representative of undoped iron-based superconductors, to $n=3$. In the latter case, a Mott insulating state is found, with each orbital at half filling. In the strong-coupling regime, when the electron density is increased, we find a spontaneous differentiation between the occupation of $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals, which leads to an orbital-selective state with a nematic character that becomes stronger at increasing density. One of these orbitals stays half filled for all densities while the other one hosts (together with the $d_{xy}$ orbital) the excess of electron density. Most importantly, in this regime, long-range pairing correlations appear in the orbital with the largest occupation. Our results highlight a strong link between orbital-selective correlations, nematicity, and superconductivity, which requires the presence of a significant Hund's coupling.</description>

      <title>Why Matthiessen's rule is violated in the high-$T_{c}$ cuprate superconductors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The perfect linear-in-$T$ dc resistivity in the strange metal phase of the high-$T_{c}$ cuprate superconductors is probably the most prominent manifestation of their non-Fermi liquid nature. A major puzzle about the strange metal behavior is that there is no discernible change in the trend of the dc resistivity at a temperature when we expect the electron-phonon coupling to play an essential role. The empirical Matthiessen's rule of summation of the resistivity from different scattering channels seems to be simply violated. On the other hand, the electron-phonon coupling has long been proposed to be responsible for the various spectral anomalies observed in the cuprate superconductors. In particular, the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode of the oxygen ion in the $CuO_{2}$ plane is proposed to be responsible for the peak-dip-hump spectral shape around the anti-nodal point. Here we show that the coupling to the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode is strongly suppressed by the vertex correction from the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation in the system as a result of the destructive interference between electron-phonon matrix element at momentum differ by the antiferromagnetic wave vector. In the real space scenario, such a destructive interference effect simply amounts to the fact that the electron hopping between nearest-neighboring sites is suppressed by the antiferromagnetic spin correlation between the electrons. More generally, we argue that the electron-phonon coupling strength in the cuprate superconductors should diminish with the proximity of the Mott insulating phase as a result of similar vertex correction from the electron correlation effect. We think that this offers an interpretation for the violation of the Matthiessen's rule in the dc resistivity of the strange metal phase of the cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Van-Hove annihilation and nematic instability on a Kagome lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novel states of matter arise in quantum materials due to strong interactions among electrons. A nematic phase breaks the point group symmetry of the crystal lattice and is known to emerge in correlated materials. Here we report the observation of an intra-unit-cell nematic order and signatures of Pomeranchuk instability in the Kagome metal ScV6Sn6. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we reveal a stripe-like nematic order breaking the crystal rotational symmetry within the Kagome lattice itself. Moreover, we identify a set of van Hove singularities adhering to the Kagome layer electrons, which appear along one direction of the Brillouin zone while being annihilated along other high-symmetry directions, revealing a rotational symmetry breaking. Via detailed spectroscopic maps, we further observe an elliptical deformation of Fermi surface, which provides direct evidence for an electronically mediated nematic order. Our work not only bridges the gap between electronic nematicity and Kagome physics, but also sheds light on the potential mechanism for realizing symmetry-broken phases in correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Fermi pockets on Hund's metal surface of Sr2RuO4 induced by the correlation-enhanced spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic structure of the topmost layer in Sr2RuO4 in the close vicinity of the Fermi level is investigated by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) with a 7-eV laser. We find that the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) predicted as 100 meV by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations is enormously enhanced in a real material up to 250 meV, even more than that of bulk state (200 meV), by the electron-correlation effect increased by the octahedral rotation in the crystal structure. This causes the formation of highly orbital-mixing small Fermi pockets and reasonably explains why the orbital-selective Mott transition (OSMT) is not realized in perovskite oxides with crystal distortion. Interestingly, Hund's metal feature allows the quasiparticle generation only near EF, restricting the spectral gap opening derived by band hybridization within an extremely small binding energy (&lt; 10 meV). Furthermore, it causes coherent-incoherent crossover, making the Fermi pockets disappear at elevated temperatures. The anomalous Fermi pockets are characterized by the dichotomy of the orbital-isolating Hund's coupling and the orbital-mixing SOC, which is key to understanding the nature of Sr2RuO4.</description>

      <title>Magnetotransport and thermoelectric studies of antiperovskite semimetal: Mn3SnC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the magnetotransport and thermoelectric (Seebeck and Nernst coefficients) properties of Mn3SnC an antiperovskite magnetic Nodal line semimetal. Mn3SnC shows paramagnetic (PM) to concurrent antiferromagnetic (AFM)/ferromagnetic (FM) transition at 286 K. The electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient indicate the importance of electron magnon scattering in the concurrent AFM/FM regime. We observed a large positive magnetoresistance (MR) of 8.2 at 8 T field near magnetic transition, in the otherwise negative MR behaviour for low temperatures. The electrical resistivity and MR show a weak thermal hysteresis around the boundary of transition temperature and the width of hysteresis decreases as magnetic field increases. Interestingly the Hall and Seebeck coefficients change sign from positive to negative below the transition temperature, highlighting the different scattering for holes and electrons in this multi-band system. The Seebeck and Nernst signal exhibit two sharp anomalies; one at the transition temperature and another at 50 K. The anomaly at magnetic transition in the Nernst signal disappear at 8 T magnetic field, owing to the reduction of magnetic fluctuation. A pseudo-gap near the Fermi level produces an upturn with a broad minimum in the Seebeck signal.</description>

      <title>Quantum anomalous, quantum spin, and quantum valley Hall effects in pentalayer rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments in pentalayer rhombohedral graphene moir\'e superlattice have observed the quantum anomalous Hall effect at the moir\'e filling factor $\nu=1$ and various fractions. These effects result from a flat Chern band induced by electron-electron interactions. In this Letter, we show that the many-body effects at $\nu=2$ give rise to the quantum spin Hall and quantum valley Hall states, even without spin-orbit couplings or valley-dependent potentials, in addition to the quantum anomalous Hall state. These three topological states can be selectively induced by applying and tilting a magnetic field. Furthermore, we demonstrate that at $\nu=3$ and $4$, a combination of the Wigner-like crystal state and topological states can be the ground state. Consequently, the relation between states at the filling factor $\nu$ and its particle-hole counterpart $4-\nu$ breaks down, which contrasts with the conventional quantum Hall effect in graphene.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive selection rules in optical absorption and Raman scattering spectra, that can determine the parity of pairing order parameters under inversion symmetry in two classes of \emph{clean} superconductors: (i) chiral superconductors with strong spin-orbit couplings, (ii) singlet superconductors with negligible spin-orbit couplings. Experimentally, the inversion parity of pair wave functions can be determined by comparing the "optical gap" $\Delta_\text{op}$ in Raman and optical spectroscopy and the "thermodynamic gap" $2\Delta$ in specific heat measurements, and the selection rules apply when $\Delta_\text{op}&gt;2\Delta$. We demonstrate the selection rules in superconductivity in models of (i) doped Weyl semimetals and (ii) doped graphene. Our derivation is based on the relation between pairing symmetry and fermion projective symmetry group of a superconductor. We further derive similar selection rules for two-dimensional superconductors with 2-fold rotational symmetry, and discuss how they apply to the superconducting state in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Weak Superfluidity in Twisted Optical Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A controlled twist between different underlying lattices allows one to interpolate, under a unified framework, across ordered and (quasi-)disordered matter while drastically changing quantum transport properties. Here, we use quantum Monte Carlo simulations to determine the unique phase diagrams of strongly-correlated ultracold bosons in twisted optical potentials. We show that at commensurate twisting angles, spectral gaps govern the formation of insulating patterns, separated by thin superfluid domains. The latter form weak superfluids, which are very sensitive to thermal fluctuations, but can be stabilized under appropriate parameter control. In contrast, slightly changing the twisting angle to a incommensurate value destroys most spectral gaps, leaving behind a prominent Bose glass phase. Our results are directly applicable to current generation experiments that quantum simulate moir\'e physics.</description>

      <title>Unconventional early-time relaxation in the Rydberg chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that unconventional relaxation dynamics of special initial states in one-dimensional arrays of Rydberg atoms produce non-generic decay of the initial-state survival probability at early times. Using the PXP hamiltonian as a minimal model of the Rydberg blockade, we prove that the early-time survival probability for states exhibiting quantum many-body scarring decays at a characteristic rate, whose finite-size scaling is determined solely by scars. We numerically investigate the effects of both revival-enhancing and ergodicity-restoring perturbations and find results consistent with the limiting cases of integrable and ergodic dynamics, respectively. Since the survival probability is easily accessible experimentally at early times, our findings enable us to probe the presence of scars at time scales much shorter than that of thermalization.</description>

Abstract: We perform a numerical bootstrap study of scalar operators in the critical 3d Gross-Neveu-Yukawa models, a family of conformal field theories containing N Majorana fermions in the fundamental representation of an O(N) global symmetry. We compute rigorous bounds on the scaling dimensions of the next-to-lowest parity-even and parity-odd singlet scalars at N = 2, 4, and 8. All of these dimensions have lower bounds greater than 3, implying that there are only two relevant singlet scalars and placing constraints on the RG flow structure of these theories.</description>

      <title>Tensor networks for non-invertible symmetries in 3+1d and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks provide a natural language for non-invertible symmetries in general Hamiltonian lattice models. We use ZX-diagrams, which are tensor network presentations of quantum circuits, to define a non-invertible operator implementing the Wegner duality in 3+1d lattice $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. The non-invertible algebra, which mixes with lattice translations, can be efficiently computed using ZX-calculus. We further deform the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory while preserving the duality and find a model with nine exactly degenerate ground states on a torus, consistent with the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-type constraint imposed by the symmetry. Finally, we provide a ZX-diagram presentation of the non-invertible duality operators (including non-invertible parity/reflection symmetries) of generalized Ising models based on graphs, encompassing the 1+1d Ising model, the three-spin Ising model, the Ashkin-Teller model, and the 2+1d plaquette Ising model. The mixing (or lack thereof) with spatial symmetries is understood from a unifying perspective based on graph theory.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and entanglement entropy of the non-Hermitian SSH model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological phase transitions are found in a variety of systems and were shown to be deeply related with a thermodynamic description through scaling relations. Here, we investigate the entanglement entropy, which is a quantity that captures the central charge of a critical model and the thermodynamics of the non-reciprocal Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Although this model has been widely studied, the thermodynamic properties reveal interesting physics not explored so far. In order to analyze the boundary effects of the model, we use Hill's thermodynamics to split the grand potential in two contributions: the extensive one, related to the bulk, and the subdivision one, related to the boundaries. Then, we derive the thermodynamic entropy for both, the edges and the bulk and the heat capacity for the bulk at the topological phase transitions. The latter is related to the central charge when the underlying theory is a conformal field theory, whereas the first reveals the resilience of the topological edge states to finite temperatures. The phase transition between phases that are adiabatically connected with the Hermitian SSH model display the well-known behaviour of systems within the Dirac universality class, but the transition between phases with complex energies shows an unexpected critical behavior, which signals the emergence of an imaginary time crystal.</description>

      <title>Two dimensional magnets: Forgotten history and recent progress towards spintronic applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of two-dimensional magnetic order in van-der Waals materials has stimulated a renaissance in the field of atomically-thin magnets. This has led to promising demonstrations of spintronic functionality such as tunneling magnetoresistance. The frantic pace of this emerging research, however, has also led to some confusion surrounding the underlying phenomena of phase transitions in two-dimensional (2D) magnets. In fact, there is a rich history of experimental precedents beginning in the 1960s with quasi-2D bulk magnets and progressing to the 1980s using atomically-thin sheets of elemental metals. This review provides a holistic discussion of the current state of knowledge on the three distinct families of low-dimensional magnets: quasi-2D, ultra-thin films and van-der Waals crystals. It highlights the unique opportunities presented by the latest implementation in van-der Waals materials. By revisiting the fundamental insights from the field of low-dimensional magnetism, this review will highlight factors that can be used to enhance material performance. For example, the limits imposed on the critical temperature by the Mermin-Wagner theorem can be escaped in three separate ways: magnetocrystalline anisotropy, long range interactions and shape anisotropy. Several recent experimental reports of atomically-thin magnets with Curie temperatures above room temperature are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Quantifying non-Hermiticity using single- and many-particle quantum properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian paradigm of quantum systems displays salient features drastically different from Hermitian counterparts. In this work, we focus on one such aspect, the difference of evolving quantum ensembles under $H_{\mathrm{nh}}$ (right ensemble) versus its Hermitian conjugate, $H_{\mathrm{nh}}^{\dagger}$ (left ensemble). We propose a formalism that quantifies the (dis-)similarity of these right and left ensembles, for single- as well as many-particle quantum properties. Such a comparison gives us a scope to measure the extent to which non-Hermiticity gets translated from the Hamiltonian into physically observable properties. We test the formalism in two cases: First, we construct a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian using a set of imperfect Bell states, showing that the non-Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian does not automatically comply with the non-Hermiticity at the level of observables. Second, we study the interacting Hatano--Nelson model with asymmetric hopping as a paradigmatic quantum many-body Hamiltonian. Interestingly, we identify situations where the measures of non-Hermiticity computed for the Hamiltonian, for single-, and for many-particle quantum properties behave distinctly from each other. Thus, different notions of non-Hermiticity can become useful in different physical scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the measures can mark the model's Parity--Time (PT) symmetry-breaking transition. Our findings can be instrumental in unveiling new exotic quantum phases of non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems as well as in preparing resourceful states for quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Universal Role of Combined Symmetry for the Protection of the Dirac Cone in Antiferromagnetic Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic topological insulators (AF TIs) are predicted to exhibit exotic physical properties such as gigantic optical and topological magnetoelectric responses. While a key to achieving such phenomena relies on how to break the symmetry protecting the Dirac-cone surface state (SS) and acquire the mass of Dirac fermions, the mechanism has yet to be clarified. To address this issue, we carried out micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy for GdBi hosting the type-II AF order, and uncovered the stripe-type 2$\times$1 reconstruction of the Fermi surface associated with the AF band folding. Intriguingly, in contrast to NdBi with the type-I AF order displaying the surface-selective Dirac-fermion mass, GdBi shows massless behavior irrespective of AF domains due to the robust topological protection. These results strongly suggest a crucial role of the ThetaTD (time-reversal and translational) symmetry to create the Dirac-fermion mass in AF TIs.</description>

Abstract: A coordinate-free formulation of first order effective field theory, in which Nambu-Goldstone fields are described as sections on associated bundle, is presented. This construction, which is based only on symmetry considerations, allows for a direct derivation of number and types of Nambu-Goldstone fields in a classical field theory without any reference to effective Lagrangian. A central role in classification is shown to be played by Lorentz-symmetry breaking order parameter which induces symplectic structure in the field space of the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the mechanism of topological mass-generation for 3d Chern-Simons gauge theories and propose a brand-new Topological Equivalence Theorem to connect scattering amplitudes of the physical gauge boson states to that of the transverse states under high energy expansion. We prove a general energy cancellation mechanism for $N$-point physical gauge boson amplitudes, which predicts large cancellations of $E^{4-L}\to E^{(4-L)- N}$ at any $L$-loop level ($L\geqslant 0$). We extend the double-copy approach to construct massive graviton amplitudes and study their structures. We newly uncover a series of strikingly large energy cancellations $E^{12}\to E^1$ of the tree-level four-graviton scattering amplitude under high energy expansion and establish a new correspondence between the two energy cancellations in the topologically massive Yang-Mills gauge theory and the topologically massive gravity theory. We further study the scattering amplitudes of Chern-Simons gauge bosons and gravitons in the nonrelativistic limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open quantum many-body systems are of both fundamental and applicational interest. However, it remains an open challenge to simulate and solve such systems, both with state-of-the-art classical methods and with quantum-simulation protocols. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a simulator for open quantum many-body systems based on giant atoms, i.e., atoms (possibly artificial), that couple to a waveguide at multiple points, which can be wavelengths apart. We first show that a simulator consisting of two giant atoms can simulate the dynamics of two coupled qubits, where one qubit is subject to different drive amplitudes and dissipation rates. This simulation enables characterizing the quantum Zeno crossover in this model. We further show that by equipping the simulator with post-selection, it becomes possible to simulate the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian dynamics of the system and thereby characterize the transition from oscillatory to non-oscillatory dynamics due to varying dissipation rates. We demonstrate and analyze the robustness of these simulation results against noise affecting the giant atoms. Finally, we discuss and show how giant-atom-based simulators can be scaled up for digital-analog simulation of large open quantum many-body systems, e.g., generic dissipative spin models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physics of superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) is a topic of keen interest in moir\'e systems research, and it may provide insight into the pairing mechanism of other strongly correlated materials such as high-$T_{\mathrm{c}}$ superconductors. Here, we use DC-transport and microwave circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) to measure directly the superfluid stiffness of superconducting MATBG via its kinetic inductance. We find the superfluid stiffness to be much larger than expected from conventional single-band Fermi liquid theory; rather, it aligns well with theory involving quantum geometric effects that are dominant at the magic angle. The temperature dependence of the superfluid stiffness exhibits a power-law behavior, which contraindicates an isotropic BCS model; instead, the extracted power-law exponents indicate an anisotropic superconducting gap, whether interpreted using the conventional anisotropic BCS model or a quantum geometric theory of flat-band superconductivity. Moreover, the quadratic dependence of the stiffness on both DC and microwave current is consistent with Ginzburg-Landau theory. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest a connection between quantum geometry, superfluid stiffness, and unconventional superconductivity in MATBG. Finally, the combined DC-microwave measurement platform used here is applicable to the investigation of other atomically thin superconductors.</description>

Abstract: The robustness of the macroscopic quantum nature of a superconductor can be characterized by the superfluid stiffness, $\rho_s$, a quantity that describes the energy required to vary the phase of the macroscopic quantum wave function. In unconventional superconductors, such as cuprates, the low-temperature behavior of $\rho_s$ drastically differs from that of conventional superconductors due to quasiparticle excitations from gapless points (nodes) in momentum space. Intensive research on the recently discovered magic-angle twisted graphene family has revealed, in addition to superconducting states, strongly correlated electronic states associated with spontaneously broken symmetries, inviting the study of $\rho_s$ to uncover the potentially unconventional nature of its superconductivity. Here we report the measurement of $\rho_s$ in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (TTG), revealing unconventional nodal-gap superconductivity. Utilizing radio-frequency reflectometry techniques to measure the kinetic inductive response of superconducting TTG coupled to a microwave resonator, we find a linear temperature dependence of $\rho_s$ at low temperatures and nonlinear Meissner effects in the current bias dependence, both indicating nodal structures in the superconducting order parameter. Furthermore, the doping dependence shows a linear correlation between the zero temperature $\rho_s$ and the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$, reminiscent of Uemura's relation in cuprates, suggesting phase-coherence-limited superconductivity. Our results provide strong evidence for nodal superconductivity in TTG and put strong constraints on the mechanisms of these graphene-based superconductors.</description>

Abstract: Hydrodynamic transport effectively describes the collective dynamics of fluids with well-defined thermodynamic quantities. With enhanced electron-electron interactions at elevated temperatures, the collective behavior of electrons in graphene with minimal impurities can be depicted as a hydrodynamic flow of charges. In this new regime, the well-known rules of Ohmic transport based on a single electron picture no longer apply, necessitating the consideration of collective electron dynamics. In particular, the hydrodynamic analogues of Joule heating and thermal transport require consideration of the viscous motion of the electron fluid, which has a direct impact on energy dissipation and heat generation by the fluidic motion of charge. In this work, we probe graphene hydrodynamics with thermal transport and find two distinct, qualitative signatures: thermal conductivity suppression below the Wiedemann-Franz value and viscous heating leading to magnetically-induced redistribution of temperature. We find these two effects are coincident in temperature and density, providing robust qualitative signatures of hydrodynamics, despite arising from two distinct aspects of this new regime: microscopic momentum conservation due to electron-electron scattering, and geometry-dependent viscous dissipation. Our results mark the first observation of viscous electronic heating in an electron fluid, providing insight for thermal management in electronic hydrodynamic devices and offering a new methodology for identifying hydrodynamic states in other systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Enhanced Sensitivity through Many-Body Bloch Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the sensing capacity of non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum systems exhibiting Bloch oscillations. By focusing on resource efficiency of the probe, quantified by quantum Fisher information, we find different scaling behaviors in two different phases, namely localized and extended. Our results provide a quantitative ansatz for quantum Fisher information in terms of time, probe size, and the number of excitations. In the long-time regime, the quantum Fisher information is a quadratic function of time, touching the Heisenberg limit. The system size scaling drastically depends on the phase changing from super-Heisenberg scaling in the extended phase to size-independent behavior in the localized phase. Furthermore, increasing the number of excitations always enhances the precision of the probe, although, in the interacting systems the enhancement becomes less eminent than the non-interacting probes, which is due to induced localization by interaction between excitations.</description>

      <title>Dirac-like fermions anomalous magneto-transport in a spin-polarized oxide two-dimensional electron system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In two-dimensional electron systems (2DES) the breaking of the inversion, time-reversal and bulk crystal-field symmetries is interlaced with the effects of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) triggering exotic quantum phenomena. Here, we used epitaxial engineering to design and realize a 2DES characterized simultaneously by ferromagnetic order, large Rashba SOC and hexagonal band warping at the (111) interfaces between LaAlO$_{3}$, EuTiO$_{3}$ and SrTiO$_{3}$ insulators. The 2DES displays anomalous quantum corrections to the magneto-conductance driven by the time-reversal-symmetry breaking occurring below the magnetic transition temperature. The results are explained by the emergence of a non-trivial Berry phase and competing weak anti-localization / weak localization back-scattering of Dirac-like fermions, mimicking the phenomenology of gapped topological insulators. These findings open perspectives for the engineering of novel spin-polarized functional 2DES holding promises in spin-orbitronics and topological electronics.</description>

      <title>Electrical switching of chirality in rhombohedral graphene Chern insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Chern insulator hosts topologically protected chiral edge currents with quantized conductance characterized by its Chern number. Switching the chirality of the Chern insulator, namely, the direction of the edge current, is highly challenging due to topologically forbidden backscattering but is of considerable importance for the design of topological devices. Nevertheless, this can be achieved by reversing the sign of the Chern number through a topological phase transition. Here, we report electrically switchable chirality in rhombohedral heptalayer graphene-based Chern insulators. The surface flat band and giant Berry curvature in rhombohedral multilayer graphene provide a highly tunable platform for engineering the topological states. By introducing moire superlattices in rhombohedral heptalayer graphene, we observed a cascade of topological phase transitions at quarter electron filling of a moire band. The Chern number can be continuously tuned from 0, -1, 1 to 2 by electric fields, manifesting as a large anomalous Hall effect and following Streda's formula. Sign reversal and the anomalous Hall effect also occurred at non-integer fillings, suggesting the possibility of electrically tunable topological phase transitions within the regime of fractional Chern insulators. Our work establishes rhombohedral heptalayer graphene moire superlattices as a versatile platform for topological engineering. The realization of switchable chirality enhances the potential application of chiral edge currents in topological circuit interconnects.</description>

Abstract: We discuss anyon condensation in mixed-state topological order. The phases were recently conjectured to be classified by pre-modular fusion categories. Just like anyon condensation in pure-state topological order, a bootstrap analysis shows condensable anyons are given by connected \'etale algebras. We explain how to perform generic anyon condensation including non-invertible anyons and successive condensations. Interestingly, some condensations lead to pure-state topological orders. We clarify when this happens. We also compute topological invariants of equivalence classes.</description>

      <title>Non-stabilizerness in kinetically-constrained Rydberg atom arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-stabilizer states are a fundamental resource for universal quantum computation. However,despite broad significance in quantum computing, the emergence of "many-body" non-stabilizerness in interacting quantum systems remains poorly understood due to its analytical intractability. Here we show that Rydberg atom arrays provide a natural reservoir of non-stabilizerness that extends beyond single qubits and arises from quantum correlations engendered by the Rydberg blockade. We demonstrate that this non-stabilizerness can be experimentally accessed in two complementary ways, either by performing quench dynamics or via adiabatic ground state preparation. Using the analytical framework based on matrix product states, we explain the origin of Rydberg nonstabilizerness via a quantum circuit decomposition of the wave function.</description>

      <title>One point functions in large $N$ vector models at finite chemical potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the thermal one point function of higher spin currents in the critical model of $U(N)$ complex scalars interacting with a quartic potential and the $U(N)$ Gross-Neveu model of Dirac fermions at large $N$ and strong coupling using the Euclidean inversion formula. These models are considered in odd space time dimensions $d$ and held at finite temperature and finite real chemical potential $\mu$ measured in units of the temperature. We show that these one point functions simplify both at large spin and large $d$. At large spin, the one point functions behave as though the theory is free, the chemical potential appears through a simple pre-factor which is either $\cosh\mu$ or $\sinh\mu$ depending on whether the spin is even or odd. At large $d$, but at finite spin and chemical potential, the 1-point functions are suppressed exponentially in $d$ compared to the free theory. We study a fixed point of the critical Gross-Neveu model in $d=3$ with 1-point functions exhibiting a branch cut in the chemical potential plane. The critical exponent for the free energy or the pressure at the branch point is $3/2$ which coincides with the mean field exponent of the Lee-Yang edge singularity for repulsive core interactions.</description>

      <title>Anomaly indicators for topological orders with $U(1)$ and time-reversal symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:1905.00435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study anomalies in time-reversal ($\mathbb{Z}_2^T$) and $U(1)$ symmetric topological orders. In this context, an anomalous topological order is one that cannot be realized in a strictly $(2+1)$-D system but can be realized on the surface of a $(3+1)$-D symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase. To detect these anomalies we propose several anomaly indicators -- functions that take as input the algebraic data of a symmetric topological order and that output a number indicating the presence or absence of an anomaly. We construct such indicators for both structures of the full symmetry group, i.e. $U(1)\rtimes\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ and $U(1)\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$, and for both bosonic and fermionic topological orders. In all cases we conjecture that our indicators are complete in the sense that the anomalies they detect are in one-to-one correspondence with the known classification of $(3+1)$-D SPT phases with the same symmetry. We also show that one of our indicators for bosonic topological orders has a mathematical interpretation as a partition function for the bulk $(3+1)$-D SPT phase on a particular manifold and in the presence of a particular background gauge field for the $U(1)$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Unconventional U(1) to $\mathbf{Z_q}$ cross-over in quantum and classical ${\bf q}$-state clock models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2009.03249v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional $q$-state quantum clock models with quantum fluctuations connecting states with clock transitions with different choices for matrix elements. We study the quantum phase transitions in these models using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, with the aim of characterizing the cross-over from emergent U(1) symmetry at the transition (for $q \ge 4$) to $Z_q$ symmetry of the ordered state. We also study classical three-dimensional clock models with spatial anisotropy corresponding to the space-time anisotropy of the quantum systems. The U(1) to ${Z_q}$ symmetry cross-over in all these systems is governed by a dangerously irrelevant operator. We specifically study $q=5$ and $q=6$ models with different forms of the quantum fluctuations and different anisotropies in the classical models. We find the expected classical XY critical exponents and scaling dimensions $y_q$ of the clock fields. However, the initial weak violation of the U(1) symmetry in the ordered phase, characterized by a $Z_q$ symmetric order parameter $\phi_q$, scales in an unexpected way. As a function of the system size $L$, close to the critical temperature $\phi_q \propto L^p$, where the known value of the exponent is $p=2$ in the classical isotropic clock model. In contrast, for strongly anisotropic classical models and the quantum models we find $p=3$. For weakly anisotropic classical models we observe a cross-over from $p=2$ to $p=3$ scaling. The exponent $p$ directly impacts the exponent $\nu'$ governing the divergence of the U(1) to $Z_q$ cross-over length scale $\xi'$ in the thermodynamic limit, according to the relationship $\nu'=\nu(1+|y_q|/p)$, where $\nu$ is the conventional correlation length exponent. We present a phenomenological argument based on an anomalous renormalization of the clock field in the presence of anisotropy, possibly as a consequence of topological (vortex) line defects.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spin Supersolid as a precursory Dirac Spin Liquid in a Triangular Lattice Antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the recent experiments on the triangular lattice antiferromagnet Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$, we propose the easy-axis XXZ spin-1/2 model on the triangular lattice, that exhibits a quantum spin supersolid, to be a precursory Dirac spin liquid. Despite the presence of a three-sublattice magnetic order as a spin supersolid, we suggest that this system is close to a Dirac spin liquid by exploring its spectroscopic response. The physical consequence is examined from the spectroscopic response, and we establish the continuous spectra near the M point in addition to the K point excitation from the spinon continuum on top of the three-sublattice order. Moreover, the satellite peaks were predicted at the mid-points connecting the $\Gamma$ and K points. This proposal offers a plausible understanding of the recent inelastic neutron scattering measurement in Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$ and could inspire further research in relevant models and materials, such as K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$ and Rb$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$, and even more anisotropic magnets like PrMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$.</description>

      <title>Magnetic plateaus and jumps in a spin-1/2 ladder with alternate Ising-Heisenberg rungs: a field dependent study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12266v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a frustrated two-leg spin-1/2 ladder with alternate Ising and isotropic Heisenberg rung exchange interactions, whereas, interactions along legs and diagonals are Ising type. The ground-state (GS) of this model has four exotic phases: (i) the stripe rung ferromagnet (SRFM), (ii) the anisotropic anti-ferromagnet (AAFM), (iii) the Dimer, and (iv) the stripe leg ferromagnet (SLFM) in absence of any external magnetic field. In this work, we study the effect of externally applied longitudinal and transverse fields on GS phases and note that there are two plateaus with per-site magnetization $1/4$ and $1/2$. There is another plateau at zero magnetization due to a finite spin gap in the presence of a longitudinal field. The exact diagonalization (ED) and the transfer matrix (TM) methods are used to solve the model Hamiltonian and the mechanism of plateau formation is analyzed using spin density, quantum fidelity, and quantum concurrence. In the (i) SRFM phase, Ising exchanges are dominant for all spins but the Heisenberg rungs are weak, and therefore, the magnetization shows a continuous transition as a function of the transverse field. In the other three phases [(ii)-(iv)], the Ising dimer rungs are weak and those are broken first to reach a plateau with per-site magnetization $1/4$, having a large gap which is closed by further application of the transverse field.</description>

Abstract: This paper focuses on the creation of a model with explicitly defined symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases on a triangular lattice as an extension of $Z_2$ Ising model's ferromagnetic phase. Unlike in previously known similar works, this model is based on an initially interacting system which is known to describe experimentally realizable physical systems. The Hamiltonian for these edge states contains four-point spin interactions between next-to-next nearest neighbors. As an initially interacting A generic technique for creating SPT models is developed, allowing for the construction of translation-invariant edge models.</description>

Abstract: We study electron states, bound to topological textures such as skyrmions and domain walls in a N\'eel antiferromagnet. In certain limits, we find the dependence of bound states on the geometry of the texture, and estimate the bound-state contribution to its energy. This contribution proves significant compared with the purely magnetic energy, and substantially affects the equilibrium geometry of the texture. The bound-state contribution also induces a large shift of the transition line between the modulated and the uniform phase, extending the latter.</description>

Abstract: We report the experimental discovery of orbital vortex lines in the three-dimensional (3D) band structure of a topological semimetal. Combining linear and circular dichroism in soft x-ray angle-resolved photoemission (SX-ARPES) with first-principles theory, we image the winding of atomic orbital angular momentum, thereby revealing - and determining the location of - lines of vorticity in full 3D momentum space. Our observation of momentum-space vortex lines with quantized winding number establishes an analogue to real-space quantum vortices, for instance, in type-II superconductors and certain non-collinear magnets. These results establish multimodal dichroism in SX-ARPES as an approach to trace 3D orbital textures. Our present findings particularly constitute the first imaging of non-trivial quantum-phase winding at line nodes and may pave the way to new orbitronic phenomena in quantum materials</description>

      <title>Spin and bond-charge excitation spectra in correlated electron systems near antiferromagnetic phase</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic and bond-charge interactions can arise from the same microscopic interaction. Motivated by this observation, we compute magnetic and bond-charge excitation spectra on an equal footing by introducing a simple effective model on a square lattice, which describes antiferromagnetic and d-wave superconducting phases around half-filling on the electron-doped side. The magnetic excitation spectrum Im chi(q, omega) has strong weight around q=(pi, pi) in low energy and its intensity map exhibits a pencil-tip-like shape in q-omega space. Around q=(0,0) magnetic excitations show a steep dispersion toward the (pi, pi) and (pi,0) directions, which is very similar to a spin-wave dispersion although the system is non-magnetic. Bond-charge excitations are characterized by four different symmetries and studied for all possible couplings. Bond-charge fluctuations with three different symmetries have large spectral weight around q=(pi, pi) in a relatively low-energy region and extend widely more than the magnetic excitation spectrum. The d-wave symmetry of bond-charge excitations also has sizable spectral weight along the direction (pi/2, pi/2)-(0, 0)-(pi/2, 0) in a low-energy region and exhibits softening around q approx (0.5 pi, 0), whereas no such softening is present in the other symmetries. These results capture the essential features observed in electron-doped cuprates and may motivate an experimental test of bond-charge excitations around q=(pi, pi) on top of the strong magnetic excitations there as well as additional softening in the d-wave channel in the (pi, pi)-(pi/2, pi/2) region at low temperatures near the magnetic phase. We extend the present analysis to the hole-doped side and highlight a contrast to the electron-doped side, which includes incommensurate correlations, electronic nematic correlations, and spin and bond-charge resonance modes in the superconducting state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of charge carriers in strange metals has become a topic of intense current investigation. Recent shot noise measurements in the quantum critical heavy fermion metal YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ revealed a suppression of the Fano factor that cannot be understood from electron-phonon scattering or strong electron correlations in a Fermi liquid, indicating loss of quasiparticles. The experiment motivates the consideration of shot noise in a variety of theoretical models in which quasiparticles may be lost. Here we study shot noise in systems with co-existing itinerant electrons and dispersive bosons, going beyond the regime where the bosons are on their own in thermal equilibrium. We construct the Boltzmann-Langevin equations for the coupled system, and show that adequate electron-boson couplings restore the Fano factor to its Fermi liquid value. Our findings point to the beyond-Landau form of quantum criticality as underlying the suppressed shot noise of strange metals in heavy fermion metals and beyond.</description>

Abstract: Fractonic matter can undergo unconventional phase transitions driven by the condensation of particles that move along subdimensional manifolds. We propose that this type of quantum critical point can be realized in a bilayer of crossed Rydberg chains. This system exhibits a transition between a disordered phase and a charge-density-wave phase with subextensive ground state degeneracy. We show that this transition is described by a stack of critical Ising conformal field theories that become decoupled in the low-energy limit due to emergent subsystem symmetries. We also analyze the transition using a Majorana mean-field approach for an effective lattice model, which confirms the picture of a fixed point of decoupled critical chains. We discuss the unusual scaling properties and derive anisotropic correlators that provide signatures of subdimensional criticality in this realistic setup.</description>

      <title>Space of non-Fermi liquids</title>

Abstract: In metals, low-energy effective theories are characterized by a set of coupling functions. Among them, the angle-dependent Fermi momentum specifies the size and shape of Fermi surface. Since the Fermi momentum grows incessantly under the renormalization group flow, a metallic fixed point is defined only modulo a rescaling of Fermi momentum. In this paper, we discuss the physical consequences of this projective nature of fixed points for non-Fermi liquids with hot Fermi surfaces. The first is the absence of a unique dynamical critical exponent that dictates the relative scaling between energy and momentum. The second is mismatches between the scaling dimensions of couplings and their relevancy. Nonetheless, each projective fixed point is characterized by a few marginal and relevant coupling functions, and the notion of universality survives. We illustrate our findings by charting the space of projective fixed points and extracting their universal properties for the Ising-nematic quantum critical metal beyond the patch theory. To control the theory, we use the dimensional regularization scheme that tunes the co-dimension of Fermi surface. Near the upper critical dimension, two exactly marginal coupling functions span the space of stable projective fixed points: functions that specify the shape of the Fermi surface and the angle-dependent Fermi velocity. All other coupling functions, including the Landau functions and the universal pairing interaction, are fixed by those two marginal functions. With decreasing dimensions, the forward scattering remains irrelevant while the pairing interaction becomes relevant near two dimensions. In two dimensions, it is expected that the universal superconducting fluctuations lower the symmetry of the non-Fermi liquid realized above the superconducting transition temperatures from the loop U(1) group to a proper subgroup.</description>

Abstract: Despite extensive studies on the one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard (SSHH) model, the variant incorporating next-nearest neighbour hopping remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the ground-state properties of this extended SSHH model using the constrained-path auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (CP-AFQMC) method. We show that this model exhibits rich topological phases, characterized by robust edge states against interaction. We quantify the properties of these edge states by analyzing spin correlation and second-order R\'enyi entanglement entropy. The system exhibits long-range spin correlation and near-zero R\'enyi entropy at half-filling. Besides, there is a long-range anti-ferromagnetic order at quarter-filling. Interestingly, an external magnetic field disrupts this long-range anti-ferromagnetic order, restoring long-range spin correlation and near-zero R\'enyi entropy. Furthermore, our work provides a paradigm studying topological properties in large interacting systems via the CP-AFQMC algorithm.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a simple lattice spin model that is written in terms of the well-known four-dimensional $\gamma$-matrix representation of the Clifford algebra. The local spins with a four-dimensional Hilbert space transform in a spinorial $(1/2,0) \oplus (0,1/2)$ representation of $SO(4)$, a symmetry of our model. When studied on a chain, and as a function of a transverse field tuning parameter, our model undergoes a quantum phase transition from a valence bond solid phase to a critical phase that is described by an $SU(2)_1$ WZW field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lattice non-invertible symmetries have rich fusion structures and play important roles in understanding various exotic topological phases. In this paper, we explore methods to generate new lattice non-invertible transformations/symmetries from a given non-invertible seed transformation/symmetry. The new lattice non-invertible symmetry is constructed by composing the seed transformations on different sites or sandwiching a unitary transformation between the transformations on the same sites. In addition to known non-invertible symmetries with fusion algebras of Tambara-Yamagami $\mathbb Z_N\times\mathbb Z_N$ type, we obtain a new non-invertible symmetry in models with $\mathbb Z_N$ dipole symmetries. We name the latter the dipole Kramers-Wannier symmetry because it arises from gauging the dipole symmetry. We further study the dipole Kramers-Wannier symmetry in depth, including its topological defect, its anomaly and its associated generalized Kennedy-Tasaki transformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (YSYK) model provides a universal theory of quantum phase transitions in metals in the presence of quenched random spatial fluctuations in the local position of the quantum critical point. It has a Fermi surface coupled to a scalar field by spatially random Yukawa interactions. We present full numerical solutions of a self-consistent disorder averaged analysis of the YSYK model in both the normal and superconducting states, obtaining electronic spectral functions, frequency-dependent conductivity, and superfluid stiffness. Our results reproduce key aspects of observations in the cuprates as analyzed by Michon $et$ $al$. (Nat. Comm. $\bf{14}$, 3033 (2023)). We also find a regime of increasing zero temperature superfluid stiffness with decreasing superconducting critical temperature, as is observed in bulk cuprates.</description>

      <title>Cluster-projected matrix product state: framework for engineering exact quantum many-body ground states in one and two dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a framework to design concurrently a frustration-free quantum many-body Hamiltonian and its exact ground states in one and two dimensions using an elementary matrix product state (MPS) representation. Our approach strategically chooses a local cluster Hamiltonian, which is arranged to overlap with neighboring clusters on a designed lattice. Ensuring that there exists a state spanned on the lattice that has its local submanifolds as the lowest-energy eigenstate of every cluster, we can construct the bulk Hamiltonian as the sum of the cluster Hamiltonians. The key to find such a solution is a systematic protocol, which projects out excited states on every cluster using MPS and effectively entangles the cluster states. The protocol offers several advantages, including the ability to achieve exact many-body ground-state solutions at nearly equal cost in one and two dimensions including those with gapless or long-range entangled ground states, flexibility in designing Hamiltonians unbiasedly across various forms of models, and numerically feasible validation through energy calculations. Our protocol offers exact ground state for any given-frustration free Hamiltonian, and enables the exploration of exact phase boundaries and the analysis of even a spatially nonuniform random system, providing platforms for quantum simulations and benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Preserving Quadratic Lindbladian and Dissipation Driven Topological Transitions in Gaussian States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamical evolution of an open quantum system can be governed by the Lindblad equation of the density matrix. In this paper, we propose to characterize the density matrix topology by the topological invariant of its modular Hamiltonian. Since the topological classification of such Hamiltonians depends on their symmetry classes, a primary issue we address is determining the requirement for the Lindbladian operators, under which the modular Hamiltonian can preserve its symmetry class during the dynamical evolution. We solve this problem for the fermionic Gaussian state and for the modular Hamiltonian being a quadratic operator of a set of fermionic operators. When these conditions are satisfied, along with a nontrivial topological classification of the symmetry class of the modular Hamiltonian, a topological transition can occur as time evolves. We present two examples of dissipation-driven topological transitions where the modular Hamiltonian lies in the AIII class with U(1) symmetry and the DIII class without U(1) symmetry. By a finite size scaling, we show that this density matrix topology transition occurs at a finite time. We also present the physical signature of this transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum magneto-oscillations have long been a vital subject in condensed matter physics, with ubiquitous quantum phenomena and diverse underlying physical mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate the intrinsic and reproducible DC-current-driven quantum electro-oscillations with a periodicity in the inverse of the current (1/I), in quasi-one-dimensional charge-density-wave (CDW) insulators (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I and TaS$_3$ nanowires. Such oscillations manifest in the nearly infinite Fr\"ohlich conductivity region where the undamped CDW flow forms in a finite electric current, and finally disappear after the oscillation index n reaches 1. A systematic investigation on the effect of temperature and magnetic field establishes that the observed electro-oscillations are a coherent quantum phenomenon. We discuss the possibilities of the physical mechanisms, including the formation of sliding-driven inherent Floquet sidebands. Our results introduce a new member in the family of quantum oscillations, and shed light on plausible avenues to explore novel physics and potential applications of coherent density-wave condensates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central requirement for the faithful implementation of large-scale lattice gauge theories (LGTs) on quantum simulators is the protection of the underlying gauge symmetry. Recent advancements in the experimental realizations of large-scale LGTs have been impressive, albeit mostly restricted to Abelian gauge groups. Guided by this requirement for gauge protection, we propose an experimentally feasible approach to implement large-scale non-Abelian $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ and $\mathrm{U}(N)$ LGTs with dynamical matter in $d+1$D, enabled by two-body spin-exchange interactions realizing local emergent gauge-symmetry stabilizer terms. We present two concrete proposals for $2+1$D $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{U}(2)$ LGTs, including dynamical bosonic matter and induced plaquette terms, that can be readily implemented in current ultracold-molecule and next-generation ultracold-atom platforms. We provide numerical benchmarks showcasing experimentally accessible dynamics, and demonstrate the stability of the underlying non-Abelian gauge invariance. We develop a method to obtain the effective gauge-invariant model featuring the relevant magnetic plaquette and minimal gauge-matter coupling terms. Our approach paves the way towards near-term realizations of large-scale non-Abelian quantum link models in analog quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Hubbard physics with Rydberg atoms: using a quantum spin simulator to simulate strong fermionic correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08065v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical method to investigate the equilibrium physics and the dynamics of strongly correlated fermionic models with spin-based quantum processors. Our proposal avoids the usual pitfalls of fermion-to-spin mappings thanks to a slave-spin method which allows to approximate the original Hamiltonian into a sum of self-correlated free-fermions and spin Hamiltonians. Taking as an example a Rydberg-based analog quantum processor to solve the interacting spin model, we avoid the challenges of variational algorithms or Trotterization methods. We explore the robustness of the method to experimental imperfections by applying it to the half-filled, single-orbital Hubbard model on the square lattice in and out of equilibrium. We show, through realistic numerical simulations of current Rydberg processors, that the method yields quantitatively viable results even in the presence of imperfections: it allows to gain insights into equilibrium Mott physics as well as the dynamics under interaction quenches. This method thus paves the way to the investigation of physical regimes -- whether out-of-equilibrium, doped, or multiorbital -- that are difficult to explore with classical processors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider universal aspects of two problems: (i) the slow purification of a large number of qubits by repeated quantum measurements, and (ii) the singular value structure of a product ${m_t m_{t-1}\ldots m_1}$ of many large random matrices. Each kind of process is associated with the decay of natural measures of entropy as a function of time or of the number of matrices in the product. We argue that, for a broad class of models, each process is described by universal scaling forms for purification, and that (i) and (ii) represent distinct ``universality classes'' with distinct scaling functions. Using the replica trick, these universality classes correspond to one-dimensional effective statistical mechanics models for a gas of ``kinks'', representing domain walls between elements of the permutation group. (This is an instructive low-dimensional limit of the effective statistical mechanics models for random circuits and tensor networks.) These results apply to long-time purification in spatially local monitored circuit models on the entangled side of the measurement phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Holographic tensor networks model AdS/CFT, but so far they have been limited by involving only systems that are very different from gravity. Unfortunately, we cannot straightforwardly discretize gravity to incorporate it, because that would break diffeomorphism invariance. In this note, we explore a resolution. In low dimensions gravity can be written as a topological gauge theory, which can be discretized without breaking gauge-invariance. However, new problems arise. Foremost, we now need a qualitatively new kind of "area operator," which has no relation to the number of links along the cut and is instead topological. Secondly, the inclusion of matter becomes trickier. We successfully construct a tensor network both including matter and with this new type of area. Notably, while this area is still related to the entanglement in "edge mode" degrees of freedom, the edge modes are no longer bipartite entangled pairs. Instead they are highly multipartite. Along the way, we calculate the entropy of novel subalgebras in a particular topological gauge theory. We also show that the multipartite nature of the edge modes gives rise to non-commuting area operators, a property that other tensor networks do not exhibit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At asymptotically late times ultrametricity can emerge from the persistent slow aging dynamics of the glass phase. We show that this suffices to recover the breaking of replica symmetry in mean-field spin glasses from the late time limit of the time evolution using the Keldysh path integral. This provides an alternative approach to replica symmetry breaking by connecting it rigorously to the dynamic formulation. Stationary spin glasses are thereby understood to spontaneously break thermal symmetry, or the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger relation of a state in global thermal equilibrium. We demonstrate our general statements for the spherical quantum $p$-spin model and the quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model in the presence of transverse and longitudinal fields. In doing so, we also derive their dynamical Ginzburg-Landau effective Keldysh actions starting from microscopic quantum models.</description>

Abstract: We present a rigorous framework for linear response theory in cavity QED materials. Our approach leverages the collective coupling between light and matter, drawing parallels with large-N theories in quantum field theory. We derive closed formulas for various responses of both the cavity and the matter. Our theory is validated by recovering established results for the Dicke model and the Quantum Hall Effect. Additionally, we discover novel excitations in quantum magnets, where the cavity binds magnon pairs into localized states.</description>

      <title>Cavity QED materials: Comparison and validation of two linear response theories at arbitrary light-matter coupling strengths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a linear response theory for materials collectively coupled to a cavity that is valid in all regimes of light-matter coupling, including symmetry-broken phases. We present and compare two different approaches. First, using a coherent path integral formulation for the partition function to obtain thermal Green functions. This approach relies on a saddle point expansion for the action, that can be truncated in the thermodynamic limit. Second, by formulating the equations of motion for the retarded Green functions and solving them. We use a mean-field decoupling of high-order Green functions in order to obtain a closed, solvable system of equations. Both approaches yield identical results in the calculation of response functions for the cavity and material. These are obtained in terms of the bare cavity and material responses. In combination, the two techniques clarify the validity of a mean-field decoupling in correlated light-matter systems and provide complementary means to compute finite-size corrections to the thermodynamic limit. The theory is formulated for a general model that encompasses most of the systems typically considered in the field of cavity QED materials, within a long-wavelength approximation. Finally, we provide a detailed application of the theory to the Quantum Hall effect and to a collection of magnetic models.
