      <title>Convolutional Neural Network Design and Evaluation for Real-Time Multivariate Time Series Fault Detection in Spacecraft Attitude Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional anomaly detection techniques onboard satellites are based on reliable, yet limited, thresholding mechanisms which are designed to monitor univariate signals and trigger recovery actions according to specific European Cooperation for Space Standardization (ECSS) standards. However, Artificial Intelligence-based Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) solutions have recently raised with the prospect to overcome the limitations of these standard methods, expanding the range of detectable failures and improving response times. This paper presents a novel approach to detecting stuck values within the Accelerometer and Inertial Measurement Unit of a drone-like spacecraft for the exploration of Small Solar System Bodies (SSSB), leveraging a multi-channel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to perform multi-target classification and independently detect faults in the sensors. Significant attention has been dedicated to ensuring the compatibility of the algorithm within the onboard FDIR system, representing a step forward to the in-orbit validation of a technology that remains experimental until its robustness is thoroughly proven. An integration methodology is proposed to enable the network to effectively detect anomalies and trigger recovery actions at the system level. The detection performances and the capability of the algorithm in reaction triggering are evaluated employing a set of custom-defined detection and system metrics, showing the outstanding performances of the algorithm in performing its FDIR task.</description>

      <title>Towards Input-Convex Neural Network Modeling for Battery Optimization in Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Battery energy storage systems (BESS) play an increasingly vital role in integrating renewable generation into power grids due to their ability to dynamically balance supply. Grid-tied batteries typically employ power converters, where part-load efficiencies vary non-linearly. While this non-linearity can be modeled with high accuracy, it poses challenges for optimization, particularly in ensuring computational tractability. In this paper, we consider a non-linear BESS formulation based on the Energy Reservoir Model (ERM). A data-driven approach is introduced with the input-convex neural network (ICNN) to approximate the nonlinear efficiency with a convex function. The epigraph of the convex function is used to engender a convex program for battery ERM optimization. This relaxed ICNN method is applied to two battery optimization use-cases: PV smoothing and revenue maximization, and it is compared with three other ERM formulations (nonlinear, linear, and mixed-integer). Specifically, ICNN-based methods appear to be promising for future battery optimization with desirable feasibility and optimality outcomes across both use-cases.</description>

      <title>Optimal Feedback Stabilizing Control of Bounded Jacobian Discrete-Time Systems via Interval Observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses optimal feedback stabilizing control for bounded Jacobian nonlinear discrete-time (DT) systems with nonlinear observations, affected by state and process noise. Instead of directly stabilizing the uncertain system, we propose stabilizing a higher-dimensional interval observer whose states enclose the true system states. Our nonlinear control approach introduces additional flexibility compared to linear methods, compensating for system nonlinearities and allowing potentially tighter closed-loop intervals. We also establish a separation principle, enabling independent design of observer and control gains, and derive tractable linear matrix inequalities, resulting in a stable closed-loop system.</description>

      <title>Optimal Interval Observers for Bounded Jacobian Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this chapter, we introduce two interval observer designs for discrete-time (DT) and continuous-time (CT) nonlinear systems with bounded Jacobians that are affected by bounded uncertainties. Our proposed methods utilize the concepts of mixed-monotone decomposition and embedding systems to design correct-by-construction interval framers, i.e., the interval framers inherently bound the true state of the system without needing any additional constraints. Further, our methods leverage techniques for positive/cooperative systems to guarantee global uniform ultimate boundedness of the framer error, i.e., the proposed interval observer is input-to-state stable. Specifically, our two interval observer designs minimize the $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ and $L_1$ gains, respectively, of the associated linear comparison system of the framer error dynamics. Moreover, our designs adopt a multiple-gain observer structure, which offers additional degrees of freedom, along with coordinate transformations that may improve the feasibility of the resulting optimization programs. We will also discuss and propose computationally tractable optimization formulations to compute the observer gains. Finally, we compare the efficacy of the proposed designs against existing DT and CT interval observers.</description>

      <title>A Framework to Estimate Life Cycle Emissions for Vehicle-Integrated Photovoltaic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a framework to estimate the environmental impact of solar electric vehicles, accounting for the emissions caused by photovoltaic system production as well as vehicle use. We leverage a cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment to estimate the greenhouse gas emissions of the vehicle-integrated photovoltaic system, from the raw material extraction to the final panel assembly, including the effect of the electricity mix both at the factory location and in the country of use. %the vehicle's life cycle, considering both Furthermore, we modify an existing optimization framework for battery electric vehicles to optimally design a solar electric vehicle and estimate its energy consumption. We showcase our framework by analyzing a case study where the mono-crystalline silicon extraction and refinement processes occur in China, while the final assembly of the panel is in The Netherlands, generating 118 kg of CO2 equivalents per square meter of solar panel. The results suggest that it is generally beneficial to operate solar electric vehicles in countries with a high irradiation index. However, when the local electricity mix already displays a low carbon intensity, the additional emissions introduced by the panel are unnecessary, requiring a longer vehicle lifetime to reach an advantageous emission balance.</description>

      <title>Procedural Generation of Communication Networks in Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power system communication networks enable operators to remotely monitor and control field equipment. The sophistication of these networks is also increasing as operators continue the trend towards digitization, which is beneficial in integrating distributed energy resources. However, as the attack surface increases in size so too does the risk of cyberattacks. The topology, configuration and composition of communication networks is therefore confidential since this can provide information to attackers. As a result, the number of benchmarks available for research purposes is limited.
  A tool for procedurally generating communication network topologies is therefore proposed. While primarily intended as an enabler for public research into communication networks, this tool also allows general insights to be gained into the effect of communication network design on the vulnerability of networks to cyberattacks. The tool includes the ability to encapsulate network characteristics in JSON specification files, which is demonstrated with example Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and Wide Area Monitoring (WAM) specification files. The SCADA network generation is then compared to a real-world case. Finally, the effect of network redundancy on the networks cyber resilience is investigated.</description>

      <title>Quantify Gas-to-Power Fault Propagation Speed:A Semi-Implicit Simulation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relying heavily on the secure supply of natural gas, the modern clean electric power systems are prone to the gas disturbances induced by the inherent rupture and leakage faults. For the first time, this paper studies the cross-system propagation speed of these faults using a simulation-based approach. Firstly, we establish the differential algebraic equation models of the rupture and leakage faults respectively. The boundary conditions at the fault locations are derived using the method of characteristics. Secondly, we propose utilizing a semi-implicit approach to perform post-fault simulations. The approach, based on the stiffly-accurate Rosenbrock scheme, possesses the implicit numerical stability and explicit computation burdens. Therefore, the high-dimensional and multi-time-scale stiff models can be solved in an efficient and robust way. Thirdly, to accurately locate the simulation events, which can not be predicted a priori, we propose a critical-time-location strategy based on the continuous Runge-Kutta approach. In case studies, we verified the accuracy and the efficiency superiority of the proposed simulation approach. The impacts of gas faults on gas and power dynamics were investigated by simulation, where the critical events were identified accurately. We found that the fault propagation speed mainly depends on the fault position and is influenced by the pipe frictions. The bi-directional coupling between gas and power may lead to cascading failures.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection and Inlet Pressure Prediction in Water Distribution Systems Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents two models to optimize pressure management in water distribution networks. The first model forecasts pressure at distribution points and compares predictions with actual data to detect anomalies such as leaks and blockages. Early detection allows for timely interventions, minimizing economic losses and ensuring system sustainability. The second model estimates the necessary inlet pressure based on the influence of various distribution points, ensuring consistent water supply while reducing waste and optimizing resource management. Both models utilize modern machine learning algorithms to enhance the prediction process. The methodology includes the CNN-EMD model, which analyzes historical data collected every 15 minutes over two months to predict future pressures. The Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method identifies fluctuations and anomalies, improving prediction accuracy. The second model combines CNN, EMD, and LSTM techniques to forecast required inlet pressure, emphasizing the impact of distribution points. Results show that the CNN-EMD and CNN-EMD-LSTM models enhance pressure management capabilities, with the first model achieving an anomaly detection accuracy of 85% to 95% and the second model predicting inlet pressure with an average accuracy of 93%. This enables flexible system adjustments and identifies critical factors affecting inlet pressure. In conclusion, advanced machine learning models like CNN-EMD and LSTM significantly improve pressure management in water distribution networks, facilitating early issue identification, ensuring efficient water supply, and optimizing resource management for future generations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article examines the problem of area coverage for a network of mobile robots with imprecise agent localization. Each robot has uniform radial sensing ability, governed by first order kinodynamics. The convex-space is partitioned based on the Guaranteed Voronoi (GV) principle and each robot's area of responsibility corresponds to its GV-cell, bounded by hyperbolic arcs. The proposed control law is distributed, demands the positioning information about its GV-Delaunay neighbors and has an inherent collision avoidance property.</description>

      <title>Integrating Reinforcement Learning and Large Language Models for Crop Production Process Management Optimization and Control through A New Knowledge-Based Deep Learning Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and sustainable crop production process management is crucial to meet the growing global demand for food, fuel, and feed while minimizing environmental impacts. Traditional crop management practices, often developed through empirical experience, face significant challenges in adapting to the dynamic nature of modern agriculture, which is influenced by factors such as climate change, soil variability, and market conditions. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs) bring transformative potential, with RL providing adaptive methodologies to learn optimal strategies and LLMs offering vast, superhuman knowledge across agricultural domains, enabling informed, context-specific decision-making. This paper systematically examines how the integration of RL and LLMs into crop management decision support systems (DSSs) can drive advancements in agricultural practice. We explore recent advancements in RL and LLM algorithms, their application within crop management, and the use of crop management simulators to develop these technologies. The convergence of RL and LLMs with crop management DSSs presents new opportunities to optimize agricultural practices through data-driven, adaptive solutions that can address the uncertainties and complexities of crop production. However, this integration also brings challenges, particularly in real-world deployment. We discuss these challenges and propose potential solutions, including the use of offline RL and enhanced LLM integration, to maximize the effectiveness and sustainability of crop management. Our findings emphasize the need for continued research and innovation to unlock the full potential of these advanced tools in transforming agricultural systems into optimal and controllable ones.</description>

      <title>Flexible Operation of Electricity-HCNG Networks with Variable Hydrogen Fraction: A Distributionally Robust Joint Chance-Constrained Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen-enriched compressed natural gas (HCNG) is a promising way to utilize surplus renewable energy through hydrogen electrolysis and blending it into natural gas. However, the optimal hydrogen volume fraction (HVF) of HCNG varies following the daily fluctuations of renewable energy. Besides, facing the rapid volatility of renewable energy, ensuring rapid and reliable real-time adjustments is challenging for electricity-HCNG (E-HCNG) coupling networks. To this end, this paper proposes a flexible operation framework for electricity-HCNG (E-HCNG) networks against the fluctuations and volatility of renewable energy. Based on operations with variable HVF, the framework developed an E-HCNG system-level affine policy, which allows real-time re-dispatch of operations according to the volatility. Meanwhile, to guarantee the operational reliability of the affine policy, a distributionally robust joint chance constraint (DRJCC) is introduced, which limits the violation probability of operational constraints under the uncertainties of renewable energy volatility. Furthermore, in the solving process, to mitigate the over-conservation in DRJCC decomposition, an improved risk allocation method is proposed, utilizing the correlations among violations under the affine policy. Moreover, to tackle the non-convexities arising from the variable HVF, customized approximations for HCNG flow formulations are developed. The problem is finally reformulated into a mix-integer second-order cone programming problem. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated both in small-scale and large-scale experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article studies the Set-Membership Smoothing (SMSing) problem for non-stochastic Hidden Markov Models. By adopting the mathematical concept of uncertain variables, an optimal SMSing framework is established for the first time. This optimal framework reveals the principles of SMSing and the relationship between set-membership filtering and smoothing. Based on the design principles, we put forward two SMSing algorithms: one for linear systems with zonotopic constrained uncertainties, where the solution is given in a closed form, and the other for a class of nonlinear systems. Numerical simulations corroborate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Detection of High-Impedance Low-Current Arc Faults at Electrical Substations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arcing faults in low voltage (LV) distribution systems associated with arc-flash risk and potentially significant equipment damage are notoriously difficult to detect under some conditions. Especially so when attempting to detect using sensing at the line, high voltage side of a substation transformer. This paper presents an analytics-based physics-aware approach to detect high-impedance, low-current arcing faults from the primary side of the substation transformer at current thresholds, below normal operating events, along with transformer inrush currents. The proposed methodology leverages the Hankel Alternative View Of Koopman Operator approach to differentiate arcing faults from standard operations, while the Series2Graph method is employed to identify the time of fault occurrence and duration. Unlike prior studies that detect such faults at the device or secondary transformer side, this work demonstrates successful fault detection at the primary side of the distribution substation transformer for faults occurring on the secondary side. The approach addresses the practical challenges of differentiating primary side expected and acceptable transients from similar magnitude LV arcing fault currents that may occur on the secondary side. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in accurately identifying fault occurrence and duration, minimizing the risk of false positives during similar characteristic events, thus improving the reliability and operational efficiency of power distribution systems. This approach can benefit both traditional and smart power grids that employ similar transformer configurations.</description>

      <title>Sequential drone routing for data assimilation on a 2D airborne contaminant dispersion problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combined use of data from different sources can be critical in emergencies, where accurate models are needed to make real-time decisions, but high-fidelity representations and detailed information are simply unavailable. This study presents a data assimilation framework based on an ensemble Kalman filter that sequentially exploits and improves an advection-diffusion model in a case study concerning an airborne contaminant dispersion problem over a complex two-dimensional domain. An autonomous aerial drone is used to sequentially observe the actual contaminant concentration in a small fraction of the domain, orders of magnitude smaller than the total domain area. Such observations are synchronized with the data assimilation framework, iteratively adjusting the simulation. The path of the drone is sequentially optimized by balancing exploration and exploitation according to the available knowledge at each decision time. Starting from an erroneous initial model based on approximated assumptions that represent the limited initial knowledge available during emergency scenarios, results show how the proposed framework sequentially improves its belief about the dispersion dynamics, thus providing a reliable contaminant concentration map.</description>

      <title>Robust Tracking Control with Neural Network Dynamic Models under Input Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust control problem has significant practical implication since external disturbances can significantly impact the performance of control method. Existing robust control method excels at control-affine system but fails at neural network dynamic models. Developing robust control methods for such systems remains a complex challenge. In this paper, we focus on robust tracking method for neural network dynamic models. We first propose reachability analysis tool designed for this system and then introduce how to reformulate robust tracking problem with the reachable sets. In addition, we prove the existence of feedback policy that bounds the growth of reachable set over infinite horizon. The effectiveness of proposed approach is validated through numerical tracking task simulations, where we compare it with a standard tube MPC method.</description>

      <title>Cooperative nonlinear distributed model predictive control with dissimilar control horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a nonlinear distributed model predictive control (DMPC) algorithm, which allows for dissimilar and time-varying control horizons among agents, thereby addressing a common limitation in current DMPC schemes. We consider cooperative agents with varying computational capabilities and operational objectives, each willing to manage varying numbers of optimization variables at each time step. Recursive feasibility and a non-increasing evolution of the optimal cost are proven for the proposed algorithm. Through numerical simulations on systems with three agents, we show that our approach effectively approximates the performance of traditional DMPC, while reducing the number of variables to be optimized. This advancement paves the way for a more decentralized yet coordinated control strategy in various applications, including power systems and traffic management.</description>

      <title>Towards more realistic co-simulation of cyber-physical energy distribution systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increased integration of information and communications technology at the distribution grid level offers broader opportunities for active operational management concepts. At the same time, requirements for resilience against internal and external threats to the power supply, such as outages or cyberattacks, are increasing. The emerging threat landscape needs to be investigated to ensure the security of supply of future distribution grids. This extended abstract presents a co-simulation environment to study communication infrastructures for the resilient operation of distribution grids. For this purpose, a communication network emulation and a power grid simulation are combined in a common modular environment. This will provide the basis for cybersecurity investigations and testing of new active operation management concepts for smart grids. Exemplary laboratory tests and attack replications will be used to demonstrate the diverse use cases of our co-simulation approach.</description>

      <title>Robust co-design framework for buildings operated by predictive control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cost-effective decarbonisation of the built environment is a stepping stone to achieving net-zero carbon emissions since buildings are globally responsible for more than a quarter of global energy-related CO$_2$ emissions. Improving energy utilization and decreasing costs naturally requires considering multiple domain-specific performance criteria. The resulting problem is often computationally infeasible. The paper proposes an approach based on decomposition and selection of significant operating conditions to achieve a formulation with reduced computational complexity. We present a robust framework to optimise the physical design, the controller, and the operation of residential buildings in an integrated fashion, considering external weather conditions and time-varying electricity prices. The framework explicitly includes operational constraints and increases the utilization of the energy generated by intermittent resources. A case study illustrates the potential of co-design in enhancing the reliability, flexibility and self-sufficiency of a system operating under different conditions. Specifically, numerical results demonstrate reductions in costs up to $30$% compared to a deterministic formulation. Furthermore, the proposed approach achieves a computational time reduction of at least $10$ times lower compared to the original problem with a deterioration in the performance of only 0.6%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel parameterization to characterize unknown linear time-invariant systems using noisy data. The presented parameterization describes exactly the set of all systems consistent with the available data. We then derive verifiable conditions, when the consistency constraint reduces the set to the true system and when it does not have any impact. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to use this parameterization to perform a direct data-driven estimator synthesis with guarantees on the H_{\infty}-norm. Lastly, we conduct numerical experiments to compare our approach to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Directed Testing of ORAN using a Partially Specified Declarative Digital Twin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real Time performance testing can be divided into two distinct parts: system test and algorithm test. System test checks that the right functions operate on the right data within power, latency, and other constraints under all conditions. Major RAN OEMs, put as much effort into system test and debug as they do into algorithm test, to ensure a competitive product. An algorithm tester will provide little insight into real time and hardware-software (HW-SW) capacity as it is unaware of the system implementation. In this paper we present an innovative Digital Twin technology, which we call Declarative Digital Twin (DDT). A DDT can describe the system requirements of the RAN such that critical corner cases can be found via automation, that would normally be missed by conventional testing. This is possible even when the RAN requirements are only partially specified. We present a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for declarative description of the RAN and show results from an automated solver that demonstrate how potential HW-SW implementation related corner cases can be identified from the DDT of an ORAN DU.</description>

      <title>Soft Tester UE: A Novel Approach for Open RAN Security Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise of 5G and open radio access networks (O-RAN), there is a growing demand for customizable experimental platforms dedicated to security testing, as existing testbeds do not prioritize this area. Traditional, hardware-dependent testing methods pose challenges for smaller companies and research institutions. The growing wireless threat landscape highlights the critical need for proactive security testing, as 5G and O-RAN deployments are appealing targets for cybercriminals. To address these challenges, this article introduces the Soft Tester UE (soft T-UE), a software-defined test equipment designed to evaluate the security of 5G and O-RAN deployments via the Uu air interface between the user equipment (UE) and the network. The outcome is to deliver a free, open-source, and expandable test instrument to address the need for both standardized and customizable automated security testing. By extending beyond traditional security metrics, the soft T-UE promotes the development of new security measures and enhances the capability to anticipate and mitigate potential security breaches. The tool's automated testing capabilities are demonstrated through a scenario where the Radio Access Network (RAN) under test is evaluated when it receives fuzzed data when initiating a connection with an UE.</description>

      <title>LSTM-Based Proactive Congestion Management for Internet of Vehicle Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks support a variety of safety, entertainment, and commercial applications. This is realized by applying the principles of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) to facilitate connectivity among vehicles and between vehicles and roadside units (RSUs). Network congestion management is essential for IoVs and it represents a significant concern due to its impact on improving the efficiency of transportation systems and providing reliable communication among vehicles for the timely delivery of safety-critical packets. This paper introduces a framework for proactive congestion management for IoV networks. We generate congestion scenarios and a data set to predict the congestion using LSTM. We present the framework and the packet congestion dataset. Simulation results using SUMO with NS3 demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework for forecasting IoV network congestion and clustering/prioritizing packets employing recurrent neural networks.</description>

      <title>Optimal Inferential Control of Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success in representing and simulating complex spatio-temporal dynamic systems within the burgeoning field of scientific machine learning. However, optimal control of CNNs poses a formidable challenge, because the ultra-high dimensionality and strong nonlinearity inherent in CNNs render them resistant to traditional gradient-based optimal control techniques. To tackle the challenge, we propose an optimal inferential control framework for CNNs that represent a complex spatio-temporal system, which sequentially infers the best control decisions based on the specified control objectives. This reformulation opens up the utilization of sequential Monte Carlo sampling, which is efficient in searching through high-dimensional spaces for nonlinear inference. We specifically leverage ensemble Kalman smoothing, a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm, to take advantage of its computational efficiency for nonlinear high-dimensional systems. Further, to harness graphics processing units (GPUs) to accelerate the computation, we develop a new sequential ensemble Kalman smoother based on matrix variate distributions. The smoother is capable of directly handling matrix-based inputs and outputs of CNNs without vectorization to fit with the parallelized computing architecture of GPUs. Numerical experiments show that the proposed approach is effective in controlling spatio-temporal systems with high-dimensional state and control spaces. All the code and data are available at https://github.com/Alivaziri/Optimal-Inferential-Control-of-CNNs.</description>

      <title>Stability and Transparency in Mixed Reality Bilateral Human Teleoperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work introduced the concept of human teleoperation (HT), where the remote robot typically considered in conventional bilateral teleoperation is replaced by a novice person wearing a mixed reality head mounted display and tracking the motion of a virtual tool controlled by an expert. HT has advantages in cost, complexity, and patient acceptance for telemedicine in low-resource communities or remote locations. However, the stability, transparency, and performance of bilateral HT are unexplored. In this paper, we therefore develop a mathematical model and simulation of the HT system using test data. We then analyze various control architectures with this model and implement them with the HT system to find the achievable performance, investigate stability, and determine the most promising teleoperation scheme in the presence of time delays. We show that instability in HT, while not destructive or dangerous, makes the system impossible to use. However, stable and transparent teleoperation are possible with small time delays (&lt;200 ms) through 3-channel teleoperation, or with large time delays through model-mediated teleoperation with local pose and force feedback for the novice.</description>

      <title>Generalization of Compositional Tasks with Logical Specification via Implicit Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of learning generalizable policies for compositional tasks given by a logic specification. These tasks are composed by temporally extended subgoals. Due to dependencies of subgoals and long task horizon, previous reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, e.g., task-conditioned and goal-conditioned policies, still suffer from slow convergence and sub-optimality when solving the generalization problem of compositional tasks. In order to tackle these issues, this paper proposes a new hierarchical RL framework for the efficient and optimal generalization of compositional tasks. In the high level, we propose a new implicit planner designed specifically for generalizing compositional tasks. Specifically, the planner produces the selection of next sub-task and estimates the multi-step return of completing the rest of task from current state. It learns a latent transition model and conducts planning in the latent space based on a graph neural network (GNN). Then, the next sub-task selected by the high level guides the low-level agent efficiently to solve long-horizon tasks and the multi-step return makes the low-level policy consider dependencies of future sub-tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show the advantage of proposed framework over previous methods in terms of optimality and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Flying Quadrotors in Tight Formations using Learning-based Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flying quadrotors in tight formations is a challenging problem. It is known that in the near-field airflow of a quadrotor, the aerodynamic effects induced by the propellers are complex and difficult to characterize. Although machine learning tools can potentially be used to derive models that capture these effects, these data-driven approaches can be sample inefficient and the resulting models often do not generalize as well as their first-principles counterparts. In this work, we propose a framework that combines the benefits of first-principles modeling and data-driven approaches to construct an accurate and sample efficient representation of the complex aerodynamic effects resulting from quadrotors flying in formation. The data-driven component within our model is lightweight, making it amenable for optimization-based control design. Through simulations and physical experiments, we show that incorporating the model into a novel learning-based nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) framework results in substantial performance improvements in terms of trajectory tracking and disturbance rejection. In particular, our framework significantly outperforms nominal MPC in physical experiments, achieving a 40.1% improvement in the average trajectory tracking errors and a 57.5% reduction in the maximum vertical separation errors. Our framework also achieves exceptional sample efficiency, using only a total of 46 seconds of flight data for training across both simulations and physical experiments. Furthermore, with our proposed framework, the quadrotors achieve an exceptionally tight formation, flying with an average separation of less than 1.5 body lengths throughout the flight. A video illustrating our framework and physical experiments is given here: https://youtu.be/Hv-0JiVoJGo</description>

      <title>FedECADO: A Dynamical System Model of Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning harnesses the power of distributed optimization to train a unified machine learning model across separate clients. However, heterogeneous data distributions and computational workloads can lead to inconsistent updates and limit model performance. This work tackles these challenges by proposing FedECADO, a new algorithm inspired by a dynamical system representation of the federated learning process. FedECADO addresses non-IID data distribution through an aggregate sensitivity model that reflects the amount of data processed by each client. To tackle heterogeneous computing, we design a multi-rate integration method with adaptive step-size selections that synchronizes active client updates in continuous time. Compared to prominent techniques, including FedProx and FedNova, FedECADO achieves higher classification accuracies in numerous heterogeneous scenarios.</description>

      <title>Improving accuracy and convergence of federated learning edge computing methods for generalized DER forecasting applications in power grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This proposal aims to develop more accurate federated learning (FL) methods with faster convergence properties and lower communication requirements, specifically for forecasting distributed energy resources (DER) such as renewables, energy storage, and loads in modern, low-carbon power grids. This will be achieved by (i) leveraging recently developed extensions of FL such as hierarchical and iterative clustering to improve performance with non-IID data, (ii) experimenting with different types of FL global models well-suited to time-series data, and (iii) incorporating domain-specific knowledge from power systems to build more general FL frameworks and architectures that can be applied to diverse types of DERs beyond just load forecasting, and with heterogeneous clients.</description>

      <title>Efficiently Obtaining Reachset Conformance for the Formal Analysis of Robotic Contact Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Formal verification of robotic tasks requires a simple yet conformant model of the used robot. We present the first work on generating reachset conformant models for robotic contact tasks considering hybrid (mixed continuous and discrete) dynamics. Reachset conformance requires that the set of reachable outputs of the abstract model encloses all previous measurements to transfer safety properties. Aiming for industrial applications, we describe the system using a simple hybrid automaton with linear dynamics. We inject non-determinism into the continuous dynamics and the discrete transitions, and we optimally identify all model parameters together with the non-determinism required to capture the recorded behaviors. Using two 3-DOF robots, we show that our approach can effectively generate models to capture uncertainties in system behavior and substantially reduce the required testing effort in industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Coupled autoregressive active inference agents for control of multi-joint dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an active inference agent to identify and control a mechanical system with multiple bodies connected by joints. This agent is constructed from multiple scalar autoregressive model-based agents, coupled together by virtue of sharing memories. Each subagent infers parameters through Bayesian filtering and controls by minimizing expected free energy over a finite time horizon. We demonstrate that a coupled agent of this kind is able to learn the dynamics of a double mass-spring-damper system, and drive it to a desired position through a balance of explorative and exploitative actions. It outperforms the uncoupled subagents in terms of surprise and goal alignment.</description>

      <title>Consensus in Multiagent Systems with lack of connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider multi-agent systems with cooperative interactions and study the convergence to consensus in the case of time-dependent lack of interaction.
  We prove a new condition ensuring consensus: we define a graph in which directed arrows correspond to connection functions that converge (in the weak sense) to some function with a positive integral on all intervals of the form $[t,+\infty)$. If the graph has a vertex reachable from all other indices, then the system converges to consensus. We show that this requirement generalizes some known sufficient conditions for convergence, such as the Persistent Excitation one. We also give a second new condition, transversal to the known ones: total connectedness of the undirected graph formed by the non-vanishing of limiting functions.</description>

      <title>Reflexive Input-Output Causality Mechanisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the concept of reflexive actuation, examining how robots may leverage both internal and external stimuli to trigger changes in the motion, performance, or physical characteristics of the robot, such as its size, shape, or configuration, and so on. These changes themselves may in turn be sequentially re-used as input to drive further adaptations. Drawing inspiration from biological systems, where reflexes are an essential component of the response to environmental changes, reflexive actuation is critical to enable robots to adapt to diverse situations and perform complex tasks. The underlying principles of reflexive actuation are analyzed, with examples provided from existing implementations such as contact-sensitive reflexive arms, physical counters, and their applications. The paper also outlines future directions and challenges for advancing this research area, emphasizing its significance in the development of adaptive, responsive robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Mindalogue: LLM -- Powered Nonlinear Interaction for Effective Learning and Task Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current generative AI models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are widely used for knowledge dissemination, task decomposition, and creative thinking. However, their linear interaction methods often force users to repeatedly compare and copy contextual information when handling complex tasks, increasing cognitive load and operational costs. Moreover, the ambiguity in model responses requires users to refine and simplify the information further. To address these issues, we developed "Mindalogue", a system using a non-linear interaction model based on "nodes + canvas" to enhance user efficiency and freedom while generating structured responses. A formative study with 11 users informed the design of Mindalogue, which was then evaluated through a study with 16 participants. The results showed that Mindalogue significantly reduced task steps and improved users' comprehension of complex information. This study highlights the potential of non-linear interaction in improving AI tool efficiency and user experience in the HCI field.</description>

      <title>Constrained Trajectory Optimization on Matrix Lie Groups via Lie-Algebraic Differential Dynamic Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02018v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matrix Lie groups are an important class of manifolds commonly used in control and robotics, and optimizing control policies on these manifolds is a fundamental problem. In this work, we propose a novel computationally efficient approach for trajectory optimization on matrix Lie groups using an augmented Lagrangian-based constrained discrete Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP). The method involves lifting the optimization problem to the Lie algebra during the backward pass and retracting back to the manifold during the forward pass. Unlike previous approaches that addressed constraint handling only for specific classes of matrix Lie groups, the proposed method provides a general solution for nonlinear constraint handling across generic matrix Lie groups. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed DDP method in handling constraints within a mechanical system characterized by rigid body dynamics in SE(3), assessing its computational efficiency compared to existing direct optimization solvers. Additionally, the method demonstrates robustness under external disturbances when applied as a Lie-algebraic feedback control policy on SE(3), and in optimizing a quadrotor's trajectory in a challenging realistic scenario. Experiments show that the proposed approach effectively manages general constraints defined on configuration, velocity, and inputs during optimization, while also maintaining stability under external disturbances when executing the resultant control policy in closed-loop.</description>

      <title>Decompositions of Nonlinear Input-Output Systems to Zero the Output</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider an input-output system where the output is the tracking error given some desired reference signal. It is natural to consider under what conditions the problem has an exact solution, that is, the tracking error is exactly the zero function. If the system has a well defined relative degree and the zero function is in the range of the input-output map, then it is well known that the system is locally left invertible, and thus, the problem has a unique exact solution. A system will fail to have relative degree when more than one exact solution exists. The general goal of this paper is to describe a decomposition of an input-output system having a Chen-Fliess series representation into a parallel product of subsystems in order to identify possible solutions to the problem of zeroing the output. For computational purposes, the focus is on systems whose generating series are polynomials. It is shown that the shuffle algebra on the set of generating polynomials is a unique factorization domain so that any polynomial can be uniquely factored modulo a permutation into its irreducible elements for the purpose of identifying the subsystems in a parallel product decomposition. This is achieved using the fact that this shuffle algebra is isomorphic to the symmetric algebra over the vector space spanned by Lyndon words. A specific algorithm for factoring generating polynomials into its irreducible factors is presented based on the Chen-Fox-Lyndon factorization of words.</description>

      <title>Study on the Time Domain Precision Evolution Mechanism of CNC Machine Tool Feed Systems Based on Acceleration and Deceleration Capability Indicator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09693v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The escalating demand for high-speed and high-precision machining in machine tool feed system has brought to the forefront the challenge of its design method. Currently, existing methodologies struggle to ascertain compliance with dynamic performance requirements during the design phase, often resulting in either excessive or insufficient design. Therefore, there is an urgent need for research focused on feed system design methods that directly address time domain dynamic precision. The dynamic precision of the feed system is influenced by the motor, mechanical structure, motion processes, and control system. However, existing studies on the impact mechanisms of electromechanical matching on feed system precision often overlook the roles of control and motion processes. This paper innovatively proposes the need to consider the coupling effects among subsystems, directing the optimization design of CNC machine tool feed systems towards time domain dynamic precision. Furthermore, it introduces acceleration and deceleration capability as a key indicator of electromechanical matching. Following the decoupling of control system parameters, this study elucidates the influence mechanisms of electromechanical matching on the overall dynamic performance of the feed system under various motion processes. This research offers a novel design philosophy and theoretical foundation for the optimization of CNC machine tool feed systems.</description>

      <title>TSViT: A Time Series Vision Transformer for Fault Diagnosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional fault diagnosis methods using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) often struggle with capturing the temporal dynamics of vibration signals. To overcome this, the application of Transformer-based Vision Transformer (ViT) methods to fault diagnosis is gaining attraction. Nonetheless, these methods typically require extensive preprocessing, which increases computational complexity, potentially reducing the efficiency of the diagnosis process. Addressing this gap, this paper presents the Time Series Vision Transformer (TSViT), tailored for effective fault diagnosis. TSViT incorporates a convolutional layer to extract local features from vibration signals, alongside a transformer encoder to discern long-term temporal patterns. A thorough experimental comparison on three diverse datasets demonstrates TSViT's effectiveness and adaptability. Moreover, the paper delves into the influence of hyperparameter tuning on the model's performance, computational demand, and parameter count. Remarkably, TSViT achieves an unprecedented 100% average accuracy on two test sets and 99.99% on another, showcasing its exceptional diagnostic capabilities.</description>

      <title>Signal Temporal Logic Control Synthesis among Uncontrollable Dynamic Agents with Conformal Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The control of dynamical systems under temporal logic specifications among uncontrollable dynamic agents is challenging due to the agents' a-priori unknown behavior. Existing works have considered the problem where either all agents are controllable, the agent models are deterministic and known, or no safety guarantees are provided. We propose a predictive control synthesis framework that guarantees, with high probability, the satisfaction of signal temporal logic (STL) tasks that are defined over a controllable system in the presence of uncontrollable stochastic agents. We use trajectory predictors and conformal prediction to construct probabilistic prediction regions for each uncontrollable agent that are valid over multiple future time steps. Specifically, we construct a normalized prediction region over all agents and time steps to reduce conservatism and increase data efficiency. We then formulate a worst-case bilevel mixed integer program (MIP) that accounts for all agent realizations within the prediction region to obtain an open-loop controller that provably guarantee task satisfaction with high probability. To efficiently solve this bilevel MIP, we propose an equivalent MIP program based on KKT conditions of the original bilevel formulation. Building upon this, we design a closed-loop controller, where both recursive feasibility and task satisfaction can be guaranteed with high probability. We illustrate our control synthesis framework on two case studies.</description>

      <title>A Parameter Privacy-Preserving Strategy for Mixed-Autonomy Platoon Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been demonstrated that leading cruise control (LCC) can improve the operation of mixed-autonomy platoons by allowing connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) to make longitudinal control decisions based on the information provided by surrounding vehicles. However, LCC generally requires surrounding human-driven vehicles (HDVs) to share their real-time states, which can be used by adversaries to infer drivers' car-following behavior, potentially leading to financial losses or safety concerns. This paper aims to address such privacy concerns and protect the behavioral characteristics of HDVs by devising a parameter privacy-preserving approach for mixed-autonomy platoon control. First, we integrate a parameter privacy filter into LCC to protect sensitive car-following parameters. The privacy filter allows each vehicle to generate seemingly realistic pseudo states by distorting the true parameters to pseudo parameters, which can protect drivers' privacy in behavioral parameters without significantly influencing the control performance. Second, to enhance the reliability and practicality of the privacy filter within LCC, we first introduce an individual-level parameter privacy preservation constraint to the privacy filter, focusing on the privacy level of each individual parameter pair. Subsequently, we extend the current approach to accommodate continuous parameter spaces through a neural network estimator. Third, analysis of head-to-tail string stability reveals the potential impact of privacy filters in degrading mixed traffic flow performance. Simulation shows that this approach can effectively trade off privacy and control performance in LCC. We further demonstrate the benefit of such an approach in networked systems, i.e., by applying the privacy filter to a preceding vehicle, one can also achieve a certain level of privacy for the following vehicle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous agents should be able to coordinate with other agents without knowing their intents ahead of time. While prior work has studied how agents can gather information about the intent of others, in this work, we study the inverse problem: how agents can demonstrate their intent to others, within the framework of general-sum dynamic games. We first present a model of this intent demonstration problem and then propose an algorithm that enables an agent to trade off their task performance and intent demonstration to improve the overall system's performance. To scale to continuous states and action spaces as well as to nonlinear dynamics and costs, our algorithm leverages linear-quadratic approximations with an efficient intent teaching guarantee. Our empirical results show that intent demonstration accelerates other agents' learning and enables the demonstrating agent to balance task performance with intent expression.</description>

      <title>Self-tuning moving horizon estimation of nonlinear systems via physics-informed machine learning Koopman modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a physics-informed learning-based Koopman modeling approach and present a Koopman-based self-tuning moving horizon estimation design for a class of nonlinear systems. Specifically, we train Koopman operators and two neural networks - the state lifting network and the noise characterization network - using both data and available physical information. The two neural networks account for the nonlinear lifting functions for Koopman modeling and describing system noise distributions, respectively. Accordingly, a stochastic linear Koopman model is established in the lifted space to forecast the dynamic behavior of the nonlinear system. Based on the Koopman model, a self-tuning linear moving horizon estimation (MHE) scheme is developed. The weighting matrices of the MHE design are updated using the pre-trained noise characterization network at each sampling instant. The proposed estimation scheme is computationally efficient because only convex optimization is involved during online implementation, and updating the weighting matrices of the MHE scheme does not require re-training the neural networks. We verify the effectiveness and evaluate the performance of the proposed method via the application to a simulated chemical process.</description>

      <title>Towards a Deeper Understanding of Transformer for Residential Non-intrusive Load Monitoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03758v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer models have demonstrated impressive performance in Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) applications in recent years. Despite their success, existing studies have not thoroughly examined the impact of various hyper-parameters on model performance, which is crucial for advancing high-performing transformer models. In this work, a comprehensive series of experiments have been conducted to analyze the influence of these hyper-parameters in the context of residential NILM. This study delves into the effects of the number of hidden dimensions in the attention layer, the number of attention layers, the number of attention heads, and the dropout ratio on transformer performance. Furthermore, the role of the masking ratio has explored in BERT-style transformer training, providing a detailed investigation into its impact on NILM tasks. Based on these experiments, the optimal hyper-parameters have been selected and used them to train a transformer model, which surpasses the performance of existing models. The experimental findings offer valuable insights and guidelines for optimizing transformer architectures, aiming to enhance their effectiveness and efficiency in NILM applications. It is expected that this work will serve as a foundation for future research and development of more robust and capable transformer models for NILM.</description>

      <title>Transformer Temperature Management and Voltage Control in Electric Distribution Systems with High Solar PV Penetration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of photovoltaic (PV) systems in distribution grids can lead to overvoltage and transformer overloading issues. While voltage regulation has been extensively studied and some research has addressed transformer temperature control, there is limited work on simultaneously managing both challenges. This paper addresses this gap by proposing an optimization-based strategy that efficiently manages voltage regulation and transformer temperature while minimizing the curtailment of PV generation. In order to make this problem convex, a relaxation is applied to the transformer temperature dynamics constraint. We also provide analysis to determine under which conditions this relaxation remains tight. The proposed approach is validated through simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving the desired control objectives.</description>

      <title>ShieldNN: A Provably Safe NN Filter for Unsafe NN Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.09564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel closed-form Control Barrier Function (CBF) and associated controller shield for the Kinematic Bicycle Model (KBM) with respect to obstacle avoidance. The proposed CBF and shield -- designed by an algorithm we call ShieldNN -- provide two crucial advantages over existing methodologies. First, ShieldNN considers steering and velocity constraints directly with the non-affine KBM dynamics; this is in contrast to more general methods, which typically consider only affine dynamics and do not guarantee invariance properties under control constraints. Second, ShieldNN provides a closed-form set of safe controls for each state unlike more general methods, which typically rely on optimization algorithms to generate a single instantaneous for each state. Together, these advantages make ShieldNN uniquely suited as an efficient Multi-Obstacle Safe Actions (i.e. multiple-barrier-function shielding) during training time of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) enabled NN controller. We show via experiments that ShieldNN dramatically increases the completion rate of RL training episodes in the presence of multiple obstacles, thus establishing the value of ShieldNN in training RL-based controllers.</description>

      <title>The Brain-Inspired Cooperative Shared Control Framework for Brain-Machine Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09531v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In brain-machine interface (BMI) applications, a key challenge is the low information content and high noise level in neural signals, severely affecting stable robotic control. To address this challenge, we proposes a cooperative shared control framework based on brain-inspired intelligence, where control signals are decoded from neural activity, and the robot handles the fine control. This allows for a combination of flexible and adaptive interaction control between the robot and the brain, making intricate human-robot collaboration feasible. The proposed framework utilizes spiking neural networks (SNNs) for controlling robotic arm and wheel, including speed and steering. While full integration of the system remains a future goal, individual modules for robotic arm control, object tracking, and map generation have been successfully implemented. The framework is expected to significantly enhance the performance of BMI. In practical settings, the BMI with cooperative shared control, utilizing a brain-inspired algorithm, will greatly enhance the potential for clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Online Control with Adversarial Disturbance for Continuous-time Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01952v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study online control for continuous-time linear systems with finite sampling rates, where the objective is to design an online procedure that learns under non-stochastic noise and performs comparably to a fixed optimal linear controller. We present a novel two-level online algorithm, by integrating a higher-level learning strategy and a lower-level feedback control strategy. This method offers a practical and robust solution for online control, which achieves sublinear regret. Our work provides the first nonasymptotic results for controlling continuous-time linear systems with finite number of interactions with the system. Moreover, we examine how to train an agent in domain randomization environments from a non-stochastic control perspective. By applying our method to the SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) algorithm, we achieved improved results in multiple reinforcement learning tasks within domain randomization environments. Our work provides new insights into non-asymptotic analyses of controlling continuous-time systems. Furthermore, our work brings practical intuition into controller learning under non-stochastic environments.</description>

      <title>Quantum feedback control of a two-atom network closed by a semi-infinite waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study the delay-dependent coherent feedback dynamics by focusing on one typical realization, i.e., a two-atom quantum network whose feedback loop is closed by a semi-infinite waveguide. In this set-up, an initially excited two-level atom can emit a photon into the waveguide, where the propagating photon can be reflected by the terminal mirror of the waveguide or absorbed by the other atom, thus constructing various coherent feedback loops. We show that there can be two-photon, one-photon or zero-photon states in the waveguide, which can be controlled by the feedback loop length and the coupling strengths between the atoms and waveguide. The photonic states in the waveguide are analyzed in both the frequency domain and the spatial domain, and the transient process of photon emissions is better understood based on a comprehensive analysis using both domains. Interestingly, we clarify that this quantum coherent feedback network can be mathematically modeled as a linear control system with multiple delays, which are determined by the distances between atoms and the terminal mirror of the semi-infinite waveguide. Therefore, based on time-delayed linear control system theory, the influence of delays on the stability of the quantum state evolution and the steady-state atomic and photonic states is investigated, for both small and large delays.</description>

      <title>Sample-Efficient Linear Representation Learning from Non-IID Non-Isotropic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04428v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A powerful concept behind much of the recent progress in machine learning is the extraction of common features across data from heterogeneous sources or tasks. Intuitively, using all of one's data to learn a common representation function benefits both computational effort and statistical generalization by leaving a smaller number of parameters to fine-tune on a given task. Toward theoretically grounding these merits, we propose a general setting of recovering linear operators $M$ from noisy vector measurements $y = Mx + w$, where the covariates $x$ may be both non-i.i.d. and non-isotropic. We demonstrate that existing isotropy-agnostic representation learning approaches incur biases on the representation update, which causes the scaling of the noise terms to lose favorable dependence on the number of source tasks. This in turn can cause the sample complexity of representation learning to be bottlenecked by the single-task data size. We introduce an adaptation, $\texttt{De-bias &amp; Feature-Whiten}$ ($\texttt{DFW}$), of the popular alternating minimization-descent scheme proposed independently in Collins et al., (2021) and Nayer and Vaswani (2022), and establish linear convergence to the optimal representation with noise level scaling down with the $\textit{total}$ source data size. This leads to generalization bounds on the same order as an oracle empirical risk minimizer. We verify the vital importance of $\texttt{DFW}$ on various numerical simulations. In particular, we show that vanilla alternating-minimization descent fails catastrophically even for iid, but mildly non-isotropic data. Our analysis unifies and generalizes prior work, and provides a flexible framework for a wider range of applications, such as in controls and dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Active Inverse Learning in Stackelberg Trajectory Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08017v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Game-theoretic inverse learning is the problem of inferring a player's objectives from their actions. We formulate an inverse learning problem in a Stackelberg game between a leader and a follower, where each player's action is the trajectory of a dynamical system. We propose an active inverse learning method for the leader to infer which hypothesis among a finite set of candidates best describes the follower's objective function. Instead of using passively observed trajectories like existing methods, we actively maximize the differences in the follower's trajectories under different hypotheses by optimizing the leader's control inputs. Compared with uniformly random inputs, the optimized inputs accelerate the convergence of the estimated probability of different hypotheses conditioned on the follower's trajectory. We demonstrate the proposed method in a receding-horizon repeated trajectory game and simulate the results using virtual TurtleBots in Gazebo.</description>

      <title>From Optimization to Control: Quasi Policy Iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent control algorithms for Markov decision processes (MDPs) have been designed using an implicit analogy with well-established optimization algorithms. In this paper, we review this analogy across four problem classes with a unified solution characterization allowing for a systematic transformation of algorithms from one domain to the other. In particular, we identify equivalent optimization and control algorithms that have already been pointed out in the existing literature, but mostly in a scattered way. With this unifying framework in mind, we adopt the quasi-Newton method from convex optimization to introduce a novel control algorithm coined as quasi-policy iteration (QPI). In particular, QPI is based on a novel approximation of the "Hessian" matrix in the policy iteration algorithm by exploiting two linear structural constraints specific to MDPs and by allowing for the incorporation of prior information on the transition probability kernel. While the proposed algorithm has the same computational complexity as value iteration, it interestingly exhibits an empirical convergence behavior similar to policy iteration with a very low sensitivity to the discount factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11279v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid feedback control scheme for the autonomous robot navigation problem in three-dimensional environments with arbitrarily-shaped convex obstacles. The proposed hybrid control strategy, which consists in switching between the move-to-target mode and the obstacle-avoidance mode, guarantees global asymptotic stability of the target location in the obstacle-free workspace. We also provide a procedure for the implementation of the proposed hybrid controller in a priori unknown environments and validate its effectiveness through simulation results.</description>

      <title>Rapid nonlinear convex guidance using a monomial method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19324v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of accommodating nonlinear dynamics and constraints in rapid trajectory optimization, envisioned for use in the context of onboard guidance. We present a novel framework that uniquely employs overparameterized monomial coordinates and pre-computed fundamental solution expansions to facilitate rapid optimization while minimizing real-time computational requirements. The fundamental solution expansions are pre-computed using differential algebra. Unlike traditional approaches that repeatedly evaluate the nonlinear dynamics and constraints as part of complex shooting or collocation-based schemes, this method replaces the nonlinearity inherent to dynamics and constraint functions entirely with a computationally simpler manifold constraint. With this approach, trajectory optimization is posed efficiently as a path planning problem on the manifold. This problem is entirely convex except for the manifold constraint, readily lending itself to solution via sequential convex programming. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in computing fast and accurate delta-V optimal solutions for long-range spacecraft rendezvous, including problems with nonlinear state constraints.</description>

      <title>Input-to-State Stable Coupled Oscillator Networks for Closed-form Model-based Control in Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Even though a variety of methods have been proposed in the literature, efficient and effective latent-space control (i.e., control in a learned low-dimensional space) of physical systems remains an open challenge. We argue that a promising avenue is to leverage powerful and well-understood closed-form strategies from control theory literature in combination with learned dynamics, such as potential-energy shaping. We identify three fundamental shortcomings in existing latent-space models that have so far prevented this powerful combination: (i) they lack the mathematical structure of a physical system, (ii) they do not inherently conserve the stability properties of the real systems, (iii) these methods do not have an invertible mapping between input and latent-space forcing. This work proposes a novel Coupled Oscillator Network (CON) model that simultaneously tackles all these issues. More specifically, (i) we show analytically that CON is a Lagrangian system - i.e., it possesses well-defined potential and kinetic energy terms. Then, (ii) we provide formal proof of global Input-to-State stability using Lyapunov arguments. Moving to the experimental side, we demonstrate that CON reaches SoA performance when learning complex nonlinear dynamics of mechanical systems directly from images. An additional methodological innovation contributing to achieving this third goal is an approximated closed-form solution for efficient integration of network dynamics, which eases efficient training. We tackle (iii) by approximating the forcing-to-input mapping with a decoder that is trained to reconstruct the input based on the encoded latent space force. Finally, we show how these properties enable latent-space control. We use an integral-saturated PID with potential force compensation and demonstrate high-quality performance on a soft robot using raw pixels as the only feedback information.</description>

      <title>The Bouc-Wen Model for Binary Direct Collinear Collisions of Convex Viscoplastic Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study mathematical models of binary direct collinear collisions of convex viscoplastic bodies based on two incremental collision laws that employ the Bouc-Wen differential model of hysteresis to represent the elastoplastic behavior of the materials of the colliding bodies. These collision laws are the Bouc-Wen-Simon-Hunt-Crossley collision law (BWSHCCL) and the Bouc-Wen-Maxwell collision law (BWMCL). The BWSHCCL comprises of the Bouc-Wen model amended with the nonlinear Hertzian elastic spring element and connected in parallel to a nonlinear displacement-dependent and rate-dependent energy dissipation element. The BWMCL comprises of the Bouc-Wen model amended with the nonlinear Hertzian elastic spring element and connected in series to a linear rate-dependent energy dissipation element. The mathematical models of the collision process are presented in the form of finite-dimensional initial value problems. We show that the models possess favorable analytical properties (e.g., global existence, uniqueness and boundedness of the solutions) under suitable restrictions on the ranges of their parameters. Furthermore, we show that excellent agreement can be achieved between the experimental data and the data from the numerical simulation of the mathematical models across a wide range of initial relative velocities and material properties of the colliding bodies while using parameterizations that are independent of the initial relative velocity.</description>
