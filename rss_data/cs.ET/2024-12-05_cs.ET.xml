      <title>Online Soft Error Tolerance in ReRAM Crossbars for Deep Learning Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resistive Random-Access Memory (ReRAM) crossbar arrays are promising candidates for in-situ matrix-vector multiplication (MVM), a frequent operation in Deep Learning algorithms. Despite their advantages, these emerging non-volatile memories are susceptible to errors due to non-idealities such as immature fabrication processes and runtime errors, which lead to accuracy degradation in Processing-in-Memory (PIM) accelerators. This paper proposes an online soft error detection and correction method in ReRAM crossbar arrays. We utilize a test input vector and Error Correcting Codes (ECCs) to detect and correct faulty columns. The proposed approach demonstrates near fault-free accuracy for Neural Networks (NNs) on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, with low area overhead and power consumption compared to recent methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present experiments on reservoir computing (RC) using a network of vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) that we diffractively couple via an external cavity. Our optical reservoir computer consists of 24 physical VCSEL nodes. We evaluate the system's memory and solve the 2-bit XOR task and the 3-bit header recognition (HR) task with bit error ratios (BERs) below 1\,\% and the 2-bit digital-to-analog conversion (DAC) task with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.067.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing based Hybrid Strategies for Real Time Route Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most well-known problems in transportation and logistics is the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). It involves optimizing a set of truck routes to service a set of customers, subject to limits on truck capacity, to reduce travel costs. The biggest challenge faced whilst attempting to solve the issue is that the time complexity of the issue grows exponentially with the number of customers and trucks, rendering it virtually intractable to traditional computers and algorithms. In this paper, we propose a method to circumvent this limitation, employing quantum computers to aid classical computers in solving problems faster while reducing complexity. To obtain our results, we employ two algorithms: Hybrid Two Step (H2S) and Hybrid Three Step (H3S). Both algorithms involve two phases: clustering and routing. It has been observed that both algorithms produce promising results, both in terms of solution time and solution cost.</description>

      <title>Shaping AI's Impact on Billions of Lives</title>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI), like any transformative technology, has the potential to be a double-edged sword, leading either toward significant advancements or detrimental outcomes for society as a whole. As is often the case when it comes to widely-used technologies in market economies (e.g., cars and semiconductor chips), commercial interest tends to be the predominant guiding factor. The AI community is at risk of becoming polarized to either take a laissez-faire attitude toward AI development, or to call for government overregulation. Between these two poles we argue for the community of AI practitioners to consciously and proactively work for the common good. This paper offers a blueprint for a new type of innovation infrastructure including 18 concrete milestones to guide AI research in that direction. Our view is that we are still in the early days of practical AI, and focused efforts by practitioners, policymakers, and other stakeholders can still maximize the upsides of AI and minimize its downsides.
  We talked to luminaries such as recent Nobelist John Jumper on science, President Barack Obama on governance, former UN Ambassador and former National Security Advisor Susan Rice on security, philanthropist Eric Schmidt on several topics, and science fiction novelist Neal Stephenson on entertainment. This ongoing dialogue and collaborative effort has produced a comprehensive, realistic view of what the actual impact of AI could be, from a diverse assembly of thinkers with deep understanding of this technology and these domains. From these exchanges, five recurring guidelines emerged, which form the cornerstone of a framework for beginning to harness AI in service of the public good. They not only guide our efforts in discovery but also shape our approach to deploying this transformative technology responsibly and ethically.</description>

      <title>Synergistic Development of Perovskite Memristors and Algorithms for Robust Analog Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analog computing using non-volatile memristors has emerged as a promising solution for energy-efficient deep learning. New materials, like perovskites-based memristors are recently attractive due to their cost-effectiveness, energy efficiency and flexibility. Yet, challenges in material diversity and immature fabrications require extensive experimentation for device development. Moreover, significant non-idealities in these memristors often impede them for computing. Here, we propose a synergistic methodology to concurrently optimize perovskite memristor fabrication and develop robust analog DNNs that effectively address the inherent non-idealities of these memristors. Employing Bayesian optimization (BO) with a focus on usability, we efficiently identify optimal materials and fabrication conditions for perovskite memristors. Meanwhile, we developed "BayesMulti", a DNN training strategy utilizing BO-guided noise injection to improve the resistance of analog DNNs to memristor imperfections. Our approach theoretically ensures that within a certain range of parameter perturbations due to memristor non-idealities, the prediction outcomes remain consistent. Our integrated approach enables use of analog computing in much deeper and wider networks, which significantly outperforms existing methods in diverse tasks like image classification, autonomous driving, species identification, and large vision-language models, achieving up to 100-fold improvements. We further validate our methodology on a 10$\times$10 optimized perovskite memristor crossbar, demonstrating high accuracy in a classification task and low energy consumption. This study offers a versatile solution for efficient optimization of various analog computing systems, encompassing both devices and algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Quantum Neural Network for Approximate SRBB-Based Unitary Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, scalable quantum neural networks are introduced to approximate unitary evolutions through the Standard Recursive Block Basis (SRBB) and, subsequently, redesigned with a reduced number of CNOTs. This algebraic approach to the problem of unitary synthesis exploits Lie algebras and their topological features to obtain scalable parameterizations of unitary operators. First, the recursive algorithm that builds the SRBB is presented, framed in the original scalability scheme already known to the literature only from a theoretical point of view. Unexpectedly, 2-qubit systems emerge as a special case outside this scheme. Furthermore, an algorithm to reduce the number of CNOTs is proposed, thus deriving a new implementable scaling scheme that requires one single layer of approximation. From the mathematical algorithm, the scalable CNOT-reduced quantum neural network is implemented and its performance is assessed with a variety of different unitary matrices, both sparse and dense, up to 6 qubits via the PennyLane library. The effectiveness of the approximation is measured with different metrics in relation to two optimizers: a gradient-based method and the Nelder-Mead method. The approximate SRBB-based synthesis algorithm with CNOT-reduction is also tested on real hardware and compared with other valid approximation and decomposition methods available in the literature.</description>

      <title>MLQM: Machine Learning Approach for Accelerating Optimal Qubit Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum circuit mapping is a critical process in quantum computing that involves adapting logical quantum circuits to adhere to hardware constraints, thereby generating physically executable quantum circuits. Current quantum circuit mapping techniques, such as solver-based methods, often encounter challenges related to slow solving speeds due to factors like redundant search iterations. Regarding this issue, we propose a machine learning approach for accelerating optimal qubit mapping (MLQM). First, the method proposes a global search space pruning scheme based on prior knowledge and machine learning, which in turn improves the solution efficiency. Second, to address the limited availability of effective samples in the learning task, MLQM introduces a novel data augmentation and refinement scheme, this scheme enhances the size and diversity of the quantum circuit dataset by exploiting gate allocation and qubit rearrangement. Finally, MLQM also further improves the solution efficiency by pruning the local search space, which is achieved through an adaptive dynamic adjustment mechanism of the solver variables. Compared to state-of-the-art qubit mapping approaches, MLQM achieves optimal qubit mapping with an average solving speed-up ratio of 1.79 and demonstrates an average advantage of 22% in terms of space complexity.</description>

      <title>SPICE: Smart Projection Interface for Cooking Enhancement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tangible User Interfaces (TUI) for human--computer interaction (HCI) provide the user with physical representations of digital information with the aim to overcome the limitations of screen-based interfaces. Although many compelling demonstrations of TUIs exist in the literature, there is a lack of research on TUIs intended for daily two-handed tasks and processes, such as cooking. In response to this gap, we propose SPICE (Smart Projection Interface for Cooking Enhancement). SPICE investigates TUIs in a kitchen setting, aiming to transform the recipe following experience from simply text-based to tangibly interactive. SPICE includes a tracking system, an agent-based software, and vision large language models to create and interpret a kitchen environment where recipe information is projected directly onto the cooking surface. We conducted a comparative usability study of SPICE and text-based recipe following with 30 participants, assessing the task difficulty, total duration, and efficiency, as well as user confidence and taste perception. The results indicate that SPICE allowed participants to perform the recipe with less stops and in shorter time while also improving self-reported efficiency, confidence, and taste. Despite this, participants self-reported no change in overall difficulty, which is a direction for future research. Overall, the SPICE project demonstrates the potential of using TUIs to improve everyday activities, paving the way for future research in HCI and new computing interfaces.</description>

      <title>Distributed Binary Optimization with In-Memory Computing: An Application for the SAT Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09152v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-memory computing (IMC) has been shown to be a promising approach for solving binary optimization problems while significantly reducing energy and latency. Building on the advantages of parallel computation, we propose an IMC-compatible parallelism framework inspired by parallel tempering (PT), enabling cross-replica communication to improve the performance of IMC solvers. This framework enables an IMC solver not only to improve performance beyond what can be achieved through parallelization, but also affords greater flexibility for the search process with low hardware overhead. We justify that the framework can be applied to almost any IMC solver. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework for the Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem, using the WalkSAT heuristic as a proxy for existing IMC solvers. The resulting PT-inspired cooperative WalkSAT (PTIC-WalkSAT) algorithm outperforms the traditional WalkSAT heuristic in terms of the iterations-to-solution in 76.3% of the tested problem instances and its na\"ive parallel variant (PA-WalkSAT) does so in 68.4% of the instances. An estimate of the energy overhead of the PTIC framework for two hardware accelerator architectures indicates that in both cases the overhead of running the PTIC framework would be less than 1% of the total energy required to run each accelerator.</description>

Abstract: The development of advanced quantum-classical algorithms is among the most prominent strategies in quantum computing. Numerous hybrid solvers have been introduced recently. Many of these methods are created ad hoc to address specific use cases. However, several well-established schemes are frequently utilized to address optimization problems. In this context, D-Wave launched the Hybrid Solver Service in 2020, offering a portfolio of methods designed to accelerate time-to-solution for users aiming to optimize performance and operational processes. Recently, a new technique has been added to this portfolio: the Nonlinear-Program Hybrid Solver. This paper describes this solver and evaluates its performance through a benchmark of 45 instances across three combinatorial optimization problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem, the Knapsack Problem, and the Maximum Cut Problem. To facilitate the use of this relatively unexplored solver, we provide details of the implementation used to solve these three optimization problems.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Simulation Framework for CXL Disaggregated Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02282v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compute eXpress Link (CXL) is a pivotal technology for memory disaggregation in future heterogeneous computing systems, enabling on-demand memory expansion and improved resource utilization. Despite its potential, CXL is in its early stages with limited market products, highlighting the need for a reliable system-level simulation tool. This paper introduces CXL-DMSim, an open-source, high-fidelity full-system simulator for CXL disaggregated memory systems, comparable in speed to gem5. CXL-DMSim includes a flexible CXL memory expander model, device driver, and support for CXL\.io and CXL\.mem protocols. It supports both app-managed and kernel-managed modes, with the latter featuring a NUMA-compatible mechanism. Rigorous verification against real hardware testbeds with FPGA-based and ASIC-based CXL memory prototypes confirms CXL-DMSim's accuracy, with an average simulation error of 4.1%. Benchmark results using LMbench and STREAM indicate that CXL-FPGA memory has approximately ~2.88x higher latency than local DDR, while CXL-ASIC latency is about ~2.18x. CXL-FPGA achieves 45-69% of local DDR's memory bandwidth, and CXL-ASIC reaches 82-83%. The performance of CXL memory is significantly more sensitive to Rd/Wr patterns than local DDR, with optimal bandwidth at a 74%:26% ratio rather than 50%:50% due to the current CXL+DDR controller design. The study also shows that CXL memory can markedly enhance the performance of memory-intensive applications, with the most improvement seen in Viper (~23x) and in bandwidth-sensitive scenarios like MERCI (16%). CXL-DMSim's observability and expandability are demonstrated through detailed case studies, showcasing its potential for research on future CXL-interconnected hybrid memory pools.</description>

      <title>Control-Flow Attestation: Concepts, Solutions, and Open Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06304v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Control-flow attestation unifies the worlds of control-flow integrity and platform attestation by measuring and reporting a target's run-time behaviour to a verifier. Trust assurances in the target are provided by testing whether its execution follows an authorised control-flow path. The problem has been explored in various settings, such as assessing the trustworthiness of cloud platforms, cyber-physical systems, and Internet of Things devices. Despite a significant number of proposals being made in recent years, the area remains fragmented, with different adversarial behaviours, verification paradigms, and deployment challenges being addressed. In this paper, we present the first survey of control-flow attestation, examining the core ideas and solutions in state-of-the-art schemes. In total, we survey over 30 papers published between 2016--2024, consolidate and compare their key features, and pose several challenges and recommendations for future research in the area.</description>

      <title>MQFL-FHE: Multimodal Quantum Federated Learning Framework with Fully Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) in federated learning (FL) has led to significant advances in data privacy. However, during the aggregation phase, it often results in performance degradation of the aggregated model, hindering the development of robust representational generalization. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal quantum federated learning framework that utilizes quantum computing to counteract the performance drop resulting from FHE. For the first time in FL, our framework combines a multimodal quantum mixture of experts (MQMoE) model with FHE, incorporating multimodal datasets for enriched representation and task-specific learning. Our MQMoE framework enhances performance on multimodal datasets and combined genomics and brain MRI scans, especially for underrepresented categories. Our results also demonstrate that the quantum-enhanced approach mitigates the performance degradation associated with FHE and improves classification accuracy across diverse datasets, validating the potential of quantum interventions in enhancing privacy in FL.</description>
