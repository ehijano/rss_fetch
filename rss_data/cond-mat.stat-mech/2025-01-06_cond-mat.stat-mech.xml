      <title>Acceleration of enzymatic reactions due to nearby inactive binding sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many biological molecular motors and machines are driven by chemical reactions that occur in specific catalytic sites. We study whether the arrival of molecules to such an active site can be accelerated by the presence of a nearby inactive site. Our approach is based on comparing the steady-state current in simple models to reference models without an inactive site. We identify two parameter regimes in which the reaction is accelerated. We then find the transition rates that maximize this acceleration, and use them to determine the underlying mechanisms in each region. In the first regime, the inactive site stores a molecule in order to release it following a reaction, when the neighboring catalytic site is empty. In the second regime, the inactive site releases a molecule when the catalytic site is full, in order to impede the molecules from leaving the active site before they react. For the storage mechanism, which is more likely to be biologically relevant, the acceleration can reach up to 15%, depending on parameters.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Model of the Emergence of Autocatalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a formal model of the emergence of self-constructing objects (e.g. heteropolymers with autocatalytic capability) in an open system, which don't contain such objects initially. The objects are constructed from subunits (e.g. monomers). Each object is characterized by the difference of self-instructed reproduction and decomposition rate only. This difference, divided by a common dimensional constant, is called ``productivity''. Due to external influence the productivity of each object can randomly change. The system as a whole is subjected to external limitation: the total number of the objects is conserved (e.g., by the controlled influx of monomers). We consider such process as possibly simplest example of self-organization. We obtained exact solutions of our model for several presumed mechanisms of random change of the productivity. We have shown that the probability to find self-constructing objects in the system necessarily increases, even if initially it was equal to zero.</description>

      <title>Projected ensemble in a system with conserved charges with local support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation of ergodicity or lack thereof in isolated quantum many-body systems has conventionally focused on the description of the reduced density matrices of local subsystems in the contexts of thermalization, integrability, and localization. Recent experimental capabilities to measure the full distribution of quantum states in Hilbert space and the emergence of specific state ensembles have extended this to questions of {\textit{deep thermalization}}, by introducing the notion of the {\textit{projected ensemble}} -- ensembles of pure states of a subsystem obtained by projective measurements on its complement. While previous work examined chaotic unitary circuits, Hamiltonian evolution, and systems with global conserved charges, we study the projected ensemble in systems where there are an extensive number of conserved charges all of which have (quasi)local support. We employ a strongly disordered quantum spin chain which shows many-body localized dynamics over long timescales as well as the $\ell$-bit model, a phenomenological archetype of a many-body localized system, with the charges being $1$-local in the latter. In particular, we discuss the dependence of the projected ensemble on the measurement basis. Starting with random direct product states, we find that the projected ensemble constructed from time-evolved states converges to a Scrooge ensemble at late times and in the large system limit except when the measurement operator is close to the conserved charges. This is in contrast to systems with global conserved charges where the ensemble varies continuously with the measurement basis. We relate these observations to the emergence of Porter-Thomas distribution in the probability distribution of bitstring measurement probabilities.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Thermodynamics of the Two-Dimensional Model of Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adopt a stochastic approach to study the charge transport in transistors. In this approach, the hole and electron densities are ruled by diffusion-reaction stochastic partial differential equations satisfying local detailed balance condition. The electric field is supposed to be concentrated in very narrow regions around the two junctions and is also approximated to be static. In this way, not only the laws of electricity, thermodynamics, and microreversibility is consistent within this approach, but also the transistor can be easily modeled as a two-dimensional system. We perform the full counting statistics of the two coupled currents, and the fluctuation theorem is shown to hold. Moreover, we show that the geometric shape of the transistor exert great influence on the transport behavior. By modeling the transistor in two dimensions, the signal-amplification factor up to about $164$ can be achieved, which is comparable to the typical value of realistic transistors in industry.</description>

      <title>Responses for one-dimensional quantum spin systems via tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor networks are adopted to calculate the responses for one-dimensional quantum spin systems that are initially in thermal equilibrium. The Ising chain in mixed transverse and longitudinal fields is used as the benchmarking system. The linear and second-order responses of the magnetization in $z$-direction induced by the time-dependent force conjugated with the magnetization in $x$-direction are calculated. In addition, the magnetization in $z$-direction is also exactly calculated in response to this excitation. As expected, the first two responses are shown to be excellent corrections to the equilibrium magnetization in $z$-direction when the excitation is weak. This result represents an illustrative example of the response theory for nontrivial quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Slow spatial migration can help eradicate cooperative antimicrobial resistance in time-varying environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat and combating its spread is of paramount importance. AMR often results from a cooperative behaviour with shared protection against drugs. Microbial communities generally evolve in volatile environments and spatial structures. Migration, fluctuations, and environmental variability thus have significant impacts on AMR, whose maintenance in static environments is generally promoted by migration. Here, we demonstrate that this picture changes dramatically in time-fluctuating spatially structured environments. To this end, we consider a two-dimensional metapopulation model consisting of demes in which drug-resistant and sensitive cells evolve in a time-changing environment in the presence of a toxin against which protection can be shared. Cells migrate between neighbouring demes and hence connect them. When the environment varies neither too quickly nor too slowly, the dynamics is characterised by bottlenecks causing fluctuation-driven local extinctions, a mechanism countered by migration that rescues AMR. Through simulations and mathematical analysis, we investigate how migration and environmental variability influence the probability of resistance eradication. We determine the near-optimal conditions for the fluctuation-driven AMR eradication, and show that slow but non-zero migration speeds up the clearance of resistance and can enhance its eradication probability. We discuss our study's impact on laboratory-controlled experiments.</description>

      <title>Generalized formulation for ideal light-powered systems through energy and entropy flow analysis Part1. Based on the first-order evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08223v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, the theoretical maximum efficien $\eta_{max}$ and the Boltzmann factor for photosynthetic systems under irradiation with arbitrary photon flux density $n_\gamma(\lambda)$, solid angle $\Omega$, and degree of polarization P, are formulated in the most fundamental and general way through the energy and entropy flow analysis, using reversibility and the first-order evaluable condition by the photon number change which is a quasi-equilibrium condition between the radiation and the system, as essential conditions. The radiation temperature for monochromatic light in non-equilibrium, i.e. in non-blackbody radiation, obtained by the fundamental formulation of this study is found to agree with the conventional radiation temperature, often called the effective temperature, for a given photon flux density (light intensity), provided that {\Omega} and P of the radiation are 4$\pi$ and 0, respectively. The reason for this agreement is discussed in the final section. The formulation in this study allows quantitative analyses that are not possible with conventional radiation temperature. As examples, the formulation of $\eta_{max}$ taking into account entropy changes due to photochemical reactions such as glucose production by photosynthesis, and various quantities under irradiation at arbitrary $\Omega$ and P are presented. In Appendix C, a specific and rigorous proof, using elementary geometry, of the fact that the entropy of radiation diluted on its way from the Sun to the Earth does not increase and remains unchanged from its original value, until it is scattered by the Earth's atmosphere, which is guaranteed only in general terms by Liouville's theorem, is given.</description>

      <title>Langevin equations and a geometric integration scheme for the overdamped limit of homogeneous rotational Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The translational motion of anisotropic or self-propelled colloidal particles is closely linked with the particle's orientation and its rotational Brownian motion. In the overdamped limit, the stochastic evolution of the orientation vector follows a diffusion process on the unit sphere and is characterised by an orientation-dependent ("multiplicative") noise. As a consequence, the corresponding Langevin equation attains different forms depending on whether Ito's or Stratonovich's stochastic calculus is used. We clarify that both forms are equivalent and derive them from a geometric construction of Brownian motion on the unit sphere, based on infinitesimal random rotations. Our approach suggests further a geometric integration scheme for rotational Brownian motion, which preserves the normalisation constraint of the orientation vector exactly. We show that a simple implementation of the scheme, based on Gaussian random rotations, converges weakly at order 1 of the integration time step, and we outline an advanced variant of the scheme that is weakly exact for an arbitrarily large time step. Due to a favourable prefactor of the discretisation error, already the Gaussian scheme allows for integration time steps that are one order of magnitude larger compared to a commonly used, ad hoc algorithm for rotational Brownian dynamics simulations. The discussion is restricted to time-homogeneous rotational Brownian motion (i.e., a single rotational diffusion constant), which is relevant for axisymmetric particles and also chemically anisotropic spheres such as self-propelled Janus particles.</description>

      <title>Navier-Stokes equations for nearly integrable quantum gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14292v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Navier-Stokes equations are paradigmatic equations describing hydrodynamics of an interacting system with microscopic interactions encoded in transport coefficients. In this work we show how the Navier-Stokes equations arise from the microscopic dynamics of nearly integrable $1d$ quantum many-body systems. We build upon the recently developed hydrodynamics of integrable models to study the effective Boltzmann equation with collision integral taking into account the non-integrable interactions. We compute the transport coefficients and find that the resulting Navier-Stokes equations have two regimes, which differ in the viscous properties of the fluid. We illustrate the method by computing the transport coefficients for an experimentally relevant case of coupled $1d$ cold-atomic gases.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the stochastic thermodynamics of Fisher information (FI), meaning we characterize both the \textit{fluctuations} of FI, introducing a parastatistics of that quantity, and thermodynamic quantities. We introduce two initial conditions: an equilibrium initial condition and a minimum entropy initial condition, both under a protocol that drives the system to equilibrium. Its results indicate a dependence of the average FI on both the initial condition and path taken. Furthermore, the results point the chosen parameter directly affects the FI of thermodynamic quantities such as irreversible work and entropy, along with fluctuations of a stochastic FI. Last, we assess the further role of FI of the distribution of thermal quantities within the context of thermostatistical inequalities.</description>

      <title>Hard rigid rods on Husimi lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic behavior of hard rigid rods of size $k$ (i.e., $k$-mers) on four- and six-coordinated Husimi lattices (HLs), respectively built with squares (square HL) and triangles (triangular HL). In both lattices, dimers ($k=2$) and trimers ($k=3$) only present a isotropic phase, whereas a isotropic-nematic transition is observed for $k \ge 4$. In the square HL, this transition is continuous and occurs at a critical \textit{monomer} activity which displays a nonmonotonic variation with $k$, while the critical \textit{rod} activity and density are always decreasing functions of $k$. The isotropic-nematic transition is discontinuous in the triangular HL, but the $k$-dependence of the coexistence activities and density is analogous to that found for the square case. No transition from the nematic to a high-density disordered phase is found in these HLs. In general, this scenario is very similar to that already observed for rods on the Bethe lattice, though the critical parameters obtained here are in most cases closer to those reported in the literature for the square and triangular lattices. The entropy per site of fully-packed rods is also investigated in detail in the triangular HL, where its value for dimers differs by only 0.7\% from the exact result for the triangular lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binding and unbinding of vortices drives Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition in two-dimensional XY model. Here we investigate whether similar mechanism works in two-dimensional Heisenberg model, by using the fluctuation of the topological charge inside a loop to characterize the nature of binding versus unbinding of defects. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we find that the fluctuation is proportional to the perimeter of the loop at low temperatures while to the area of the loop at high temperatures, implying binding of the defects at low temperatures and unbinding at high temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quenched randomness strongly affects properties of magnetic materials. Two-dimensional (2D) random singlet (RS) states emerge in random $J$-$Q$ model by destroying valence bond solid order with spatial randomness. We examine the 2D RS state in magnetic field with quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The magnetization and susceptibilities show power-law scaling with magnetic field at low temperature. Moreover, they show one-parameter scaling behavior with $B/T$, and the scaling functions are remarkably consistent with a phenomenological model of random spin pairs with a singular distribution of interactions. These universal scaling functions can be used to diagnose 2D RS states in experiments.</description>

      <title>Properties and Applications of the Kirkwood-Dirac Distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen the Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) distribution come to the forefront as a powerful quasi-probability distribution for analysing quantum mechanics. The KD distribution allows tools from statistics and probability theory to be applied to problems in quantum-information processing. A notable difference to the Wigner function is that the KD distribution can represent a quantum state in terms of arbitrary observables. This paper reviews the KD distribution, in three parts. First, we present definitions and basic properties of the KD distribution and its generalisations. Second, we summarise the KD distribution's extensive usage in the study or development of measurement disturbance; quantum metrology; weak values; direct measurements of quantum states; quantum thermodynamics; quantum scrambling and out-of-time-ordered correlators; and the foundations of quantum mechanics, including Leggett-Garg inequalities, the consistent-histories interpretation and contextuality. We emphasise connections between operational quantum advantages and negative or non-real KD quasi-probabilities. Third, we delve into the KD distribution's mathematical structure. We summarise the current knowledge regarding the geometry of KD-positive states (the states for which the KD distribution is a classical probability distribution), describe how to witness and quantify KD non-positivity, and outline relationships between KD non-positivity, coherence and observables' incompatibility.</description>

Abstract: Topological defects are singularities within a field that cannot be removed by continuous transformations. The definition of these irregularities requires an ordered reference configuration, calling into question whether they exist in disordered materials, such as glasses. However, recent work suggests that well-defined topological defects emerge in the dynamics of glasses, even if they are not evident in the static configuration. In this study, we reveal the presence of topological defects in the vibrational eigenspace of a two-dimensional experimental colloidal glass. These defects strongly correlate with the vibrational features and spatially correlate with each other and structural "soft spots", more prone to plastic flow. This work experimentally confirms the existence of topological defects in disordered systems revealing the complex interplay between topology, disorder, and dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the Wiedemann-Franz law violation in Graphene and quark-gluon plasma systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A comparative study of the thermodynamic and transport properties of the ultra-relativistic quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in Heavy ion collisions (HIC) with the "quasi-relativistic" massless electron-hole plasma in graphene sample has been performed. We observe that the enthalpy per net carrier density emerges as a useful physical quantity determining the hydrodynamic domain's transport variables. Lorenz ratio is defined as thermal to electrical conductivity ratio, normalized by temperature. In searching whether the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law is obeyed or violated by checking the Lorenz ratio as one or deviated from one, we find that the Lorenz ratio determined from the fluid-based framework will always be responsible for the violation of the WF law. The reason is the proportional relation between Lorenz ratio and enthalpy per particle in the fluid. Based on the experimental observation, graphene, and QGP, both systems at low net charge density, exhibit WF law violation due to their fluid nature. However, graphene at high net charge density obeys the WF law, followed by metals with high Fermi energy or density. It indicates a fluid to the non-fluid transition of the graphene system from low to high-density domain. In this regard, the fluid or non-fluid aspect of QGP at high density is yet to be explored by future facilities like Compressed Baryonic matter (CBM) and Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility (NICA) experiments.</description>
