      <title>The Impact of Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana on Indian Households</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study critically evaluates the impact of the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) on LPG accessibility among poor households in India. Using Propensity Score Matching and Difference-in-Differences estimators and the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) dataset, the Average Treatment Effect on the interdedly Treated is a modest 2.1 percentage point increase in LPG consumption due to PMUY, with a parallel decrease in firewood consumption. Regional analysis reveals differential impacts, with significant progress in the North, West, and South but less pronounced effects in the East and North East. The study also underscores variance across social groups, with Schedule Caste households showing the most substantial benefits, while Scheduled Tribes households are hardly affected. Despite the PMUY's initial success in facilitating LPG access, sustaining its usage remains challenging. Policy should emphasise targeted interventions, income support, and address regional and community-specific disparities for the sustained usage of LPG.</description>

      <title>Design Insights for Industrial CO2 Capture, Transport, and Storage Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present design methods and insights for CO2 capture, transport, and storage systems for clusters of industrial facilities, with a case-study focus on the state of Louisiana. Our analytical framework includes: (1) evaluating the scale and concentration of capturable CO2 emissions at individual facilities for the purpose of estimating the cost of CO2 capture retrofits, (2) a screening method to identify potential CO2 storage sites and estimate their storage capacities, injectivities, and costs; and (3) an approach for cost-minimized design of pipeline infrastructure connecting CO2 capture plants with storage sites that considers land use patterns, existing rights-of-way, demographics, and a variety of social and environmental justice factors. In applying our framework to Louisiana, we estimate up to 50 million tCO2/y of industrial emissions (out of today's total emissions of 130 MtCO2/y) can be captured at under 100 USD/tCO2, and up to 100 MtCO2/y at under 120 USD/tCO2. We identified 98 potential storage sites with estimated aggregate total injectivity between 330 and 730 MtCO2/yr and storage costs ranging from 8 to 17 USD/tCO2. We find dramatic reductions in the aggregate pipeline length and CO2 transport cost per tonne when groups of capture plants share pipeline infrastructure rather than build dedicated single-user pipelines. Smaller facilities (emitting less than 1 MtCO2/y), which account for a quarter of Louisiana's industrial emissions, see the largest transport cost benefits from sharing of infrastructure. Pipeline routes designed to avoid disadvantaged communities (social and environmental justice) so as not to reinforce historical practices of disenfranchisement involve only modestly higher pipeline lengths and costs.</description>

      <title>The Devil is in the Details: Heterogeneous Effects of the German Minimum Wage on Working Hours and Minijobs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2015, Germany introduced a national minimum wage. While the literature agrees on at most limited negative effects on the overall employment level, we go into detail and analyze the impact on the working hours dimension and on the subset of minijobs. Using data from the German Structure of Earnings Survey in 2010, 2014, and 2018, we find empirical evidence that the minimum wage significantly reduces inequality in hourly and monthly wages. While various theoretical mechanisms suggest a reduction in working hours, these remain unchanged on average. However, minijobbers experience a notable reduction in working hours which can be linked to the specific institutional framework. Regarding employment, the results show no effects for regular jobs, but there is a noteworthy decline in minijobs, driven by transitions to regular employment and non-employment. The transitions in non-employment imply a wage elasticity of employment of $-0.1$ for minijobs. Our findings highlight that the institutional setting leads to heterogeneous effects of the minimum wage.</description>

      <title>Ethical considerations when planning, implementing and releasing health economic model software: a new proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most health economic analyses are undertaken with the aid of computers. However, the research ethics of implementing health economic models as software (or computational health economic models (CHEMs)) are poorly understood. We propose that developers and funders of CHEMs should adhere to research ethics principles and pursue the goals of: (i) socially acceptable user requirements and design specifications; (ii) fit for purpose implementations; and (iii) socially beneficial post-release use. We further propose that a transparent (T), reusable (R) and updatable (U) CHEM is suggestive of a project team that has largely met these goals. We propose six criteria for assessing TRU CHEMs: (T1) software files are publicly available; (T2) developer contributions and judgments on appropriate use are easily identified; (R1) programming practices facilitate independent reuse of model components; (R2) licenses permit reuse and derivative works; (U1) maintenance infrastructure is in place; and (U2) releases are systematically retested and deprecated. Few existing CHEMs would meet all TRU criteria. Addressing these limitations will require the development of new and updated good practice guidelines and investments by governments and other research funders in enabling infrastructure and human capital.</description>

      <title>Decoding excellence: Mapping the demand for psychological traits of operations and supply chain professionals through text mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current study proposes an innovative methodology for the profiling of psychological traits of Operations Management (OM) and Supply Chain Management (SCM) professionals. We use innovative methods and tools of text mining and social network analysis to map the demand for relevant skills from a set of job descriptions, with a focus on psychological characteristics. The proposed approach aims to evaluate the market demand for specific traits by combining relevant psychological constructs, text mining techniques, and an innovative measure, namely, the Semantic Brand Score. We apply the proposed methodology to a dataset of job descriptions for OM and SCM professionals, with the objective of providing a mapping of their relevant required skills, including psychological characteristics. In addition, the analysis is then detailed by considering the region of the organization that issues the job description, its organizational size, and the seniority level of the open position in order to understand their nuances. Finally, topic modeling is used to examine key components and their relative significance in job descriptions. By employing a novel methodology and considering contextual factors, we provide an innovative understanding of the attitudinal traits that differentiate professionals. This research contributes to talent management, recruitment practices, and professional development initiatives, since it provides new figures and perspectives to improve the effectiveness and success of Operations Management and Supply Chain Management professionals.</description>

      <title>Firm-level supply chains to minimize decarbonization unemployment and economic losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urgently needed carbon emission reductions might lead to strict command-and-control decarbonization strategies with potentially negative economic consequences. Analyzing the entire firm-level production network of a European economy, we explore how the worst outcomes of such approaches can be avoided. We compare the systemic relevance of every firm with its annual CO2 emissions to identify optimal emission-reducing strategies with a minimum of additional unemployment and economic losses. Setting specific reduction targets we study various decarbonization scenarios and quantify their economic consequences. We show that for an emission-reduction of 20% the most effective strategy leads to losses of about 2% of jobs and 2% of economic output. In contrast, a naive scenario targeting largest emitters first, results in 28% job losses and 33% output reduction for the same target. This demonstrates that it is possible to use firm-level production networks to design highly effective decarbonization strategies that practically preserve employment and economic output.</description>

      <title>Frequency Regulation with Storage: On Losses and Profits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-carbon societies will need to store vast amounts of electricity to balance intermittent generation from wind and solar energy, for example, through frequency regulation. Here, we derive an analytical solution to the decision-making problem of storage operators who sell frequency regulation power to grid operators and trade electricity on day-ahead markets. Mathematically, we treat future frequency deviation trajectories as functional uncertainties in a receding horizon robust optimization problem. We constrain the expected terminal state-of-charge to be equal to some target to allow storage operators to make good decisions not only for the present but also the future. Thanks to this constraint, the amount of electricity traded on day-ahead markets is an implicit function of the regulation power sold to grid operators. The implicit function quantifies the amount of power that needs to be purchased to cover the expected energy loss that results from providing frequency regulation. We show how the marginal cost associated with the expected energy loss decreases with roundtrip efficiency and increases with frequency deviation dispersion. We find that the profits from frequency regulation over the lifetime of energy-constrained storage devices are roughly inversely proportional to the length of time for which regulation power must be committed.</description>

      <title>Epistemic Limits of Empirical Finance: Causal Reductionism and Self-Reference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16570v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The clarion call for causal reduction in the study of capital markets is intensifying. However, in self-referencing and open systems such as capital markets, the idea of unidirectional causation (if applicable) may be limiting at best, and unstable or fallacious at worst. In this research, we critically assess the use of scientific deduction and causal inference within the study of empirical finance and econometrics. We then demonstrate the idea of competing causal chains using a toy model adapted from ecological predator/prey relationships. From this, we develop the alternative view that the study of empirical finance, and the risks contained therein, may be better appreciated once we admit that our current arsenal of quantitative finance tools may be limited to ex post causal inference under popular assumptions. Where these assumptions are challenged, for example in a recognizable reflexive context, the prescription of unidirectional causation proves deeply problematic.</description>
