      <title>Assessing the effectiveness of test-trace-isolate interventions using a multi-layered temporal network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the early stage of an infectious disease outbreak, public health strategies tend to gravitate towards non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) given the time required to develop targeted treatments and vaccines. One of the most common NPIs is Test-Trace-Isolate (TTI). One of the factors determining the effectiveness of TTI is the ability to identify contacts of infected individuals. In this study, we propose a multi-layer temporal contact network to model transmission dynamics and assess the impact of different TTI implementations, using SARS-CoV-2 as a case study. The model was used to evaluate TTI effectiveness both in containing an outbreak and mitigating the impact of an epidemic. We estimated that a TTI strategy based on home isolation and testing of both primary and secondary contacts can contain outbreaks only when the reproduction number is up to 1.3, at which the epidemic prevention potential is 88.2% (95% CI: 87.9%-88.5%). On the other hand, for higher value of the reproduction number, TTI is estimated to noticeably mitigate disease burden but at high social costs (e.g., over a month in isolation/quarantine per person for reproduction numbers of 1.7 or higher). We estimated that strategies considering quarantine of contacts have a larger epidemic prevention potential than strategies that either avoid tracing contacts or require contacts to be tested before isolation. Combining TTI with other social distancing measures can improve the likelihood of successfully containing an outbreak but the estimated epidemic prevention potential remains lower than 50% for reproduction numbers higher than 2.1.</description>

      <title>MitraClip Device Automated Localization in 3D Transesophageal Echocardiography via Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MitraClip is the most widely percutaneous treatment for mitral regurgitation, typically performed under the real-time guidance of 3D transesophagel echocardiography (TEE). However, artifacts and low image contrast in echocardiography hinder accurate clip visualization. This study presents an automated pipeline for clip detection from 3D TEE images. An Attention UNet was employed to segment the device, while a DenseNet classifier predicted its configuration among ten possible states, ranging from fully closed to fully open. Based on the predicted configuration, a template model derived from computer-aided design (CAD) was automatically registered to refine the segmentation and enable quantitative characterization of the device. The pipeline was trained and validated on 196 3D TEE images acquired using a heart simulator, with ground-truth annotations refined through CAD-based templates. The Attention UNet achieved an average surface distance of 0.76 mm and 95% Hausdorff distance of 2.44 mm for segmentation, while the DenseNet achieved an average weighted F1-score of 0.75 for classification. Post-refinement, segmentation accuracy improved, with average surface distance and 95% Hausdorff distance reduced to 0.75 mm and 2.05 mm, respectively. This pipeline enhanced clip visualization, providing fast and accurate detection with quantitative feedback, potentially improving procedural efficiency and reducing adverse outcomes.</description>

      <title>WildSAT: Learning Satellite Image Representations from Wildlife Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What does the presence of a species reveal about a geographic location? We posit that habitat, climate, and environmental preferences reflected in species distributions provide a rich source of supervision for learning satellite image representations. We introduce WildSAT, which pairs satellite images with millions of geo-tagged wildlife observations readily-available on citizen science platforms. WildSAT uses a contrastive learning framework to combine information from species distribution maps with text descriptions that capture habitat and range details, alongside satellite images, to train or fine-tune models. On a range of downstream satellite image recognition tasks, this significantly improves the performance of both randomly initialized models and pre-trained models from sources like ImageNet or specialized satellite image datasets. Additionally, the alignment with text enables zero-shot retrieval, allowing for search based on general descriptions of locations. We demonstrate that WildSAT achieves better representations than recent methods that utilize other forms of cross-modal supervision, such as aligning satellite images with ground images or wildlife photos. Finally, we analyze the impact of various design choices on downstream performance, highlighting the general applicability of our approach.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Patient-Specific Calibration via Differentiable Hemodynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the goals of personalized medicine is to tailor diagnostics to individual patients. Diagnostics are performed in practice by measuring quantities, called biomarkers, that indicate the existence and progress of a disease. In common cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, biomarkers that are closely related to the clinical representation of a patient can be predicted using computational models. Personalizing computational models translates to considering patient-specific flow conditions, for example, the compliance of blood vessels that cannot be a priori known and quantities such as the patient geometry that can be measured using imaging. Therefore, a patient is identified by a set of measurable and nonmeasurable parameters needed to well-define a computational model; else, the computational model is not personalized, meaning it is prone to large prediction errors. Therefore, to personalize a computational model, sufficient information needs to be extracted from the data. The current methods by which this is done are either inefficient, due to relying on slow-converging optimization methods, or hard to interpret, due to using `black box` deep-learning algorithms. We propose a personalized diagnostic procedure based on a differentiable 0D-1D Navier-Stokes reduced order model solver and fast parameter inference methods that take advantage of gradients through the solver. By providing a faster method for performing parameter inference and sensitivity analysis through differentiability while maintaining the interpretability of well-understood mathematical models and numerical methods, the best of both worlds is combined. The performance of the proposed solver is validated against a well-established process on different geometries, and different parameter inference processes are successfully performed.</description>

      <title>Paradoxical non-Gaussian behavior in fractional Laplace motion with drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study fractional Laplace motion (FLM) obtained from subordination of fractional Brownian motion to a gamma process, in the presence of an external drift that acts on the composite process or of an internal drift acting solely on the parental process. We derive the statistical properties of this FLM process and find that the external drift does not influence the mean-squared displacement (MSD), whereas the internal drift leads to normal diffusion, dominating at long times in the subdiffusive Hurst exponent regime. We also investigate the intricate properties of the probability density function (PDF), demonstrating that it possesses a central Gaussian region, whose expansion in time is influenced by FBM's Hurst exponent. Outside of this region the PDF follows a non-Gaussian pattern. The kurtosis of this FLM process converges toward the Gaussian limit at long times insensitive to the extreme non-Gaussian tails. Additionally, in the presence of the external drift, the PDF remains symmetric and centered at $x=vt$. In contrast, for the internal drift this symmetry is broken. The results of our computer simulations are fully consistent with the theoretical predictions. The FLM model is suitable for describing stochastic processes with a non-Gaussian PDF and long-ranged correlations of the motion.</description>

      <title>Modeling therapy sequence for advanced cancer: A microsimulation approach leveraging Electronic Health Record data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many patients with advanced cancers undergo multiple lines of treatment. We develop methods for estimating quality-adjusted outcomes and cost-effectiveness of therapy sequences, informed by patient-level longitudinal data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). We develop microsimulation models with a discrete-time health-state transition framework and propose two methods: one using multi-state models to estimate transition probabilities, and one using observed patient trajectories through the health states. We use bootstrap resampling to estimate standard errors. We create synthetic EHR-like datasets to evaluate these methods where within-patient transition times depend on covariates and a copula generator, and compare with Markov cohort models. We demonstrate these methods in two treatment sequences for advanced bladder cancer (cisplatin or carboplatin-based therapy followed by immunotherapy), incorporating external information on costs, utilities, and expected adverse event. Both methods produced well-calibrated overall survivals, although the trajectory approach was often superior. The multi-state model approach generated lower standard errors but was biased when compared to known results from the synthetic datasets. The observed trajectory approach mostly produced confidence intervals that covered known values. In the bladder cancer example, both methods result in a Net Monetary Benefit (NMB)&gt;0 for the cisplatin-based treatment sequence with a willingness to pay of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year. Both microsimulation methods produce well-calibrated results and offer superior performance to a homogeneous Markov cohort approach when studying therapy sequence. Where available, patient level EHR-based data should be considered to inform cost-effectiveness models.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning-Based and Fully Automated Pipeline for Regurgitant Mitral Valve Anatomy Analysis from 3D Echocardiography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D transesophageal echocardiography (3DTEE), is the recommended method for diagnosing mitral regurgitation (MR). 3DTEE provides a high-quality 3D image of the mitral valve (MV), allowing for precise segmentation and measurement of the regurgitant valve anatomy. However, manual TEE segmentations are time-consuming and prone to intra-operator variability, affecting the reliability of the measurements. To address this, we developed a fully automated pipeline using a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) to segment MV substructures (annulus, anterior leaflet, and posterior leaflet) and quantify MV anatomy. The 3D CNN, based on a multi-decoder residual U-Net architecture, was trained and tested on a dataset comprising 100 3DTEE images with corresponding segmentations. Within the pipeline, a custom algorithm refines the CNN-based segmentations and extracts MV models, from which anatomical landmarks and features are quantified. The accuracy of the proposed method was assessed using Dice score and mean surface distance (MSD) against ground truth segmentations, and the extracted anatomical parameters were compared against a semiautomated commercial software TomTec Image Arena. The trained 3D CNN achieved an average Dice score of 0.79 and MSD of 0.47 mm for the combined segmentation of the annulus, anterior and posterior leaflet. The proposed CNN architecture outperformed a baseline residual U-Net architecture in MV substructure segmentation, and the refinement of the predicted annulus segmentation improved MSD by 8.36%. The annular and leaflet linear measurements differed by less than 7.94 mm and 3.67 mm, respectively, compared to the 3D measurements obtained with TomTec Image Arena. The proposed pipeline was faster than the commercial software, with a modeling time of 12.54 s and a quantification time of 54.42 s.</description>

      <title>Hair cells in the cochlea must tune resonant modes to the edge of instability without destabilizing collective modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sound produces surface waves along the cochlea's basilar membrane. To achieve the ear's astonishing frequency resolution and sensitivity to faint sounds, dissipation in the cochlea must be canceled via active processes in hair cells, effectively bringing the cochlea to the edge of instability. But how can the cochlea be globally tuned to the edge of instability with only local feedback? To address this question, we use a discretized version of a standard model of basilar membrane dynamics, but with an explicit contribution from active processes in hair cells. Surprisingly, we find the basilar membrane supports two qualitatively distinct sets of modes: a continuum of localized modes and a small number of collective extended modes. Localized modes sharply peak at their resonant position and are largely uncoupled. As a result, they can be amplified almost independently from each other by local hair cells via feedback reminiscent of self-organized criticality. However, this amplification can destabilize the collective extended modes; avoiding such instabilities places limits on possible molecular mechanisms for active feedback in hair cells. Our work illuminates how and under what conditions individual hair cells can collectively create a critical cochlea.</description>
