      <title>Essential Cartan subalgebras of $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.09634v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define essential commutative Cartan pairs of $C^*$-algebras generalising the definition of Renault and show that such pairs are given by essential twisted groupoid $C^*$-algebras as defined by Kwa\'sniewski and Meyer. We show that the underlying twisted groupoid is effective, and is unique up to isomorphism among twists over effective groupoids giving rise to the essential commutative Cartan pair. We also show that for twists over effective groupoids giving rise to such pairs, the automorphism group of the twist is isomorphic to the automorphism group of the induced essential Cartan pair via explicit constructions.</description>

      <title>Real $K$-Theory for $C^*$-Algebras: Just the Facts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is intended to present the basic properties of $KO$-theory for real $C^*$-algebras and to explain its relationship with complex $K$-theory and with $KR$- theory. Whenever possible we will rely upon proofs in printed literature, particularly the work of Karoubi, Wood, Schr\"oder, and more recent work of Boersema and J. M. Rosenberg. In addition, we shall explain how $KO$-theory is related to the Ten-Fold Way in physics and point out how some deeper features of $KO$-theory for operator algebras may provide powerful new tools there. Commutative real $C^*$-algebras not of the form $C(X, R)$ will play a special role.
  Unfortunately, there is no single reference for $KO$-theory for operator algebras that begins to compare with Blackadar's wonderful exposition of complex $K$-theory. This work is intended to provide a platform upon which mathematicians and mathematical physicists can rely in order to use these new tools in their research. As we are writing for a diverse audience of functional analysts, topologists, and physicists, we often present material well-known to one group of people and unfamiliar to another.</description>

      <title>Stable finiteness of ample groupoid algebras, traces and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.11194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study stable finiteness of ample groupoid algebras with applications to inverse semigroup algebras and Leavitt path algebras, recovering old results and proving some new ones. In addition, we develop a theory of (faithful) traces on ample groupoid algebras, mimicking the $C^*$-algebra theory but taking advantage of the fact that our functions are simple and so do not have integrability issues, even in the non-Hausdorff setting. The theory of traces is closely connected with the theory of invariant means on Boolean inverse semigroups. It turns out that for Hausdorff ample groupoids with compact unit space, having a stably finite algebra over some commutative ring implies the existence of a tracial state on its reduced $C^*$-algebra. We include an appendix on stable finiteness of more general semigroup algebras, improving on an earlier result of Munn, which is independent of the rest of the paper.</description>

      <title>Convergence of layer potentials and Riemann-Hilbert problem on extension domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the convergence of layer potential operators for the harmonic transmission problem over a sequence of converging two-sided extension domains. Consequently, the Neumann-Poincar{\'e} operators, Calder{\'o}n projectors, and associated Neumann series converge in this setting. As a result, we generalize the notion of Cauchy integrals and, in a sense, of Hilbert transforms for a class of extension domains. Our approach relies on dyadic approximations of arbitrary open sets, considering convergence in terms of characteristic functions, Hausdorff distance, and compact sets.</description>

      <title>Dilation on an annulus and von Neumann's inequality on certain varieties in the biball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an alternative proof to Agler's famous result on success of rational dilation on an annulus by an application of a result due to Dritschel and McCullough. We show interplay between operators associated with an annulus, $C_{1,r}$ or quantum annulus and operator pairs living on a certain variety in $\mathbb C^2$ and its intersection with the biball. It is shown that the minimal spectral sets and von Neumann's inequality for these classes $C_{1,r}$, quantum annulus can also be studied via appropriate operator pairs associated with the biball.</description>
