      <title>Robust Communication Between Parties with Nearly Independent Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study finite-state communication games in which the sender's preference is perturbed by random private idiosyncrasies. Persuasion is generically impossible within the class of statistically independent sender/receiver preferences -- contrary to prior research establishing persuasive equilibria when the sender's preference is precisely transparent.
  Nevertheless, robust persuasion may occur when the sender's preference is only slightly state-dependent/idiosyncratic. This requires approximating an `acyclic' equilibrium of the transparent preference game, generically implying that this equilibrium is also `connected' -- a generalization of partial-pooling equilibria. It is then necessary and sufficient that the sender's preference satisfy a monotonicity condition relative to the approximated equilibrium.
  If the sender's preference further satisfies a `semi-local' version of increasing differences, then this analysis extends to sender preferences that rank pure actions (but not mixed actions) according to a state-independent order.
  We apply these techniques to study (1) how ethical considerations, such as empathy for the receiver, may improve or impede comm</description>

      <title>A Majority Rule Philosophy for Instant Runoff Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the core support criterion, a voting criterion satisfied by Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) that is analogous to the Condorcet criterion but reflective of a different majority rule philosophy. Condorcet methods can be thought of as conducting elections between each pair of candidates, counting all ballots to determine the winner of each pair-election. IRV can also be thought of as conducting elections between all pairs of candidates but for each pair-election only counting ballots from voters who do not prefer another major candidate (as determined self-consistently from the IRV social ranking) to the two candidates in contention. The appropriateness of including all ballots or a subset of ballots for a pair-election, depends on whether the society deems the entire or a selected ballot set in compliance with freedom of association (which implies freedom of non-association) for a given pair election. Arguments based on freedom of association rely on more information about an electorate than can be learned from ranked ballots alone. We present a freedom-of-association based argument to explain why IRV may be preferable to Condorcet in some circumstances, including the 2022 Alaska special congressional election, based on the political context of that election.</description>

      <title>Ex-Ante Design of Persuasion Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02465v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How does receiver commitment affect incentives for information revelation in Bayesian persuasion? We study many-sender persuasion games where a single receiver commits to a posterior-dependent action profile, or allocation, before senders design the informational environment. We develop a novel revelation-like principle for ex-ante mechanism design settings where sender reports are Blackwell experiments and use it to characterize the set of implementable allocations in our model. We show global incentive constraints are pinned down by "worst-case" punishments at finitely many posterior beliefs, whose values are independent of the allocation. Moreover, the receiver will generically benefit from the ability to randomize over deterministic outcomes when solving for the constrained optimal allocation, in contrast to standard mechanism design models. Finally, we apply our results to analyze efficiency in multi-good allocation problems, full surplus extraction in auctions with allocation externalities, and optimal audit design, highlighting the role that monotone mechanisms play in these settings.</description>

      <title>The Dictator Dilemma: The Distortion of Information Flow in Autocratic Regimes and Its Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01666v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans have been arguing about the benefits of dictatorial versus democratic regimes for millennia. Despite drastic differences between the dictatorships in the world, one of the key common features is the \emph{Dictator's Dilemma} as defined by Wintrobe [1]: a dictator will never know the true state of affairs in his country and is perpetually presented distorted information, thus having difficulties in making the right governing decisions. The dictator's dilemma is essential to most autocratic regimes and is one of the key features in the literature on the subject. Yet, no quantitative theory of how the distortion of information develops from the initial state has been developed up to date. I present a model of the appearance and evolution of such information distortion, with subsequent degradation of control by the dictator. The model is based on the following fundamental and general premises: a) the dictator governs aiming to follow the desired trajectory of development based only on the information from the advisors; b) the deception from the advisors cannot decrease in time; and c) the deception change depends on the difficulties the country encounters. The model shows effective control in the short term (a few months to a year), followed by instability leading to the country's gradual deterioration of the state over many years. I derive some universal parameters applicable to all dictators and show that advisors' deception increases parallel with the decline of the control. In contrast, the dictator thinks the government is doing a reasonable, but not perfect, job. Finally, I present a match of our model to the historical data of grain production in the Soviet Union in 1928-1940.</description>
