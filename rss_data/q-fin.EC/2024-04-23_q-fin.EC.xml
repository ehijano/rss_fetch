      <title>Revisiting Granular Models of Firm Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit "granular models of firm growth" that have been proposed in the literature to explain the anomalously slow decrease of growth volatility with firms size and how this phenomenon shapes the distribution of their growth rates. In these models, firms' sales are viewed as collections of independent "sub-units", and these non-trivial statistical properties occur as a direct result of the fat-tailed distribution of the number or sizes of these sub-units.
  We present and discuss new theoretical results on the relation between firm size and growth rate statistics. Our results can be understood by noting that granular models imply the existence of three types of firms: well-diversified firms, with a size evenly distributed among several sub-units; firms with many sub-units but with their total size concentrated on only a handful of them, and lastly firms which are poorly diversified simply because they are made up of a small number of sub-units.
  We establish new empirical facts about growth rates and their relation with size. As predicted by the model, the distribution of growth rate volatilities is to a good approximation {independent of firm size}, once rescaled by the average size-conditioned volatility. However, the tail of this distribution is much too thin to be consistent with a granular mechanism. Moreover, the moments of growth volatility scale with size in a way that is at odds with theoretical predictions. We also find that the distribution of growth rates rescaled by firm-specific volatility, which is predicted to be Gaussian by all the models we consider, remains very fat-tailed in the data, even for large firms. This paper, in ruling out the granularity scenario, suggests that the overarching mechanisms underlying the growth of firms are not satisfactorily understood, and argues that they deserve further theoretical investigations.</description>

      <title>Liquid Democracy. Two Experiments on Delegation in Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.09715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proponents of participatory democracy praise Liquid Democracy: decisions are taken by referendum, but voters delegate their votes freely. When better informed voters are present, delegation can increase the probability of a correct decision. However, delegation must be used sparely because it reduces the information aggregated through voting. In two different experiments, we find that delegation underperforms both universal majority voting and the simpler option of abstention. In a tightly controlled lab experiment where the subjects' precision of information is conveyed in precise mathematical terms and very salient, the result is due to overdelegation. In a perceptual task run online where the precision of information is not known precisely, delegation remains very high and again underperforms both majority voting and abstention. In addition, subjects substantially overestimate the precision of the better informed voters, underlining that Liquid Democracy is fragile to multiple sources of noise. The paper makes an innovative methodological contribution by combining two very different experimental procedures: the study of voting rules would benefit from complementing controlled experiments with known precision of information with tests under ambiguity, a realistic assumption in many voting situations.</description>

      <title>ge_gravity2: a command for solving universal gravity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe an algorithm for computing counterfactual trade flows, prices, output, and welfare in a large class of general equilibrium trade models. We introduce a command called ge_gravity2 that allows users to perform these computations in Stata. This command extends the existing ge_gravity command by allowing users to compute the general equilibrium effects of changes in trade policy in positive supply elasticity models. It can be used to solve any model that falls into the class of universal gravity models as defined by Allen, Arkolakis, and Takahashi [Universal Gravity, Journal of Political Economy, 128(2), 2020, 393-433].</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Electric, Internal Combustion Engine, and Hybrid Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) are increasingly becoming popular as a viable means of transportation for the future. The use of EVs may help in providing better climatic conditions in urban areas with a pocket friendly cost for transportation to the consumers throughout its life. EVs enact as a boon to the society by providing zero tailpipe emissions, better comfort, low lifecycle cost and higher connectivity. The article aims to provide scientific information throughout the literature across various aspects of EVs in their lifetime and thus, assist the scholarly community and various organisations to understand the impact of EVs. In this study we have gathered information from the articles published in SCOPUS database and through grey literature with the focus of information post 2009. We have also used a hybrid methodology using Best-Worst Method (BWM) and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) for comparing EVs, internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) and hybrid vehicles in various price segments. The study has helped us conclude that EVs should be preferred over ICEVs and hybrids by the users.</description>

      <title>Approximating the set of Nash equilibria for convex games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04176v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Feinstein and Rudloff (2023), it was shown that the set of Nash equilibria for any non-cooperative $N$ player game coincides with the set of Pareto optimal points of a certain vector optimization problem with non-convex ordering cone. To avoid dealing with a non-convex ordering cone, an equivalent characterization of the set of Nash equilibria as the intersection of the Pareto optimal points of $N$ multi-objective problems (i.e.\ with the natural ordering cone) is proven. So far, algorithms to compute the exact set of Pareto optimal points of a multi-objective problem exist only for the class of linear problems, which reduces the possibility of finding the true set of Nash equilibria by those algorithms to linear games only.
  In this paper, we will consider the larger class of convex games. As, typically, only approximate solutions can be computed for convex vector optimization problems, we first show, in total analogy to the result above, that the set of $\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibria can be characterized by the intersection of $\epsilon$-approximate Pareto optimal points for $N$ convex multi-objective problems. Then, we propose an algorithm based on results from vector optimization and convex projections that allows for the computation of a set that, on one hand, contains the set of all true Nash equilibria, and is, on the other hand, contained in the set of $\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibria. In addition to the joint convexity of the cost function for each player, this algorithm works provided the players are restricted by either shared polyhedral constraints or independent convex constraints.</description>

      <title>An Economic Solution to Copyright Challenges of Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems are trained on large data corpora to generate new pieces of text, images, videos, and other media. There is growing concern that such systems may infringe on the copyright interests of training data contributors. To address the copyright challenges of generative AI, we propose a framework that compensates copyright owners proportionally to their contributions to the creation of AI-generated content. The metric for contributions is quantitatively determined by leveraging the probabilistic nature of modern generative AI models and using techniques from cooperative game theory in economics. This framework enables a platform where AI developers benefit from access to high-quality training data, thus improving model performance. Meanwhile, copyright owners receive fair compensation, driving the continued provision of relevant data for generative model training. Experiments demonstrate that our framework successfully identifies the most relevant data sources used in artwork generation, ensuring a fair and interpretable distribution of revenues among copyright owners.</description>
