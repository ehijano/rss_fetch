      <title>Exact solutions to the Weighted Region Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12028v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Weighted Region Problem. In the Weighted Region Problem, the length of a path is defined as the sum of the weights of the subpaths within each region, where the weight of a subpath is its Euclidean length multiplied by a weight $ \alpha \geq 0 $ depending on the region. We study a restricted version of the problem of determining shortest paths through a single weighted rectangular region. We prove that even this very restricted version of the problem is unsolvable within the Algebraic Computation Model over the Rational Numbers (ACMQ). On the positive side, we provide the equations for the shortest paths that are computable within the ACMQ. Additionally, we provide equations for the bisectors between regions of the Shortest Path Map for a source point on the boundary of (or inside) the rectangular region.</description>

      <title>Generating Diverse TSP Tours via a Combination of Graph Pointer Network and Dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the Diverse Traveling Salesman Problem (D-TSP), a bi-criteria optimization challenge that seeks a set of $k$ distinct TSP tours. The objective requires every selected tour to have a length at most $c|T^*|$ (where $|T^*|$ is the optimal tour length) while minimizing the average Jaccard similarity across all tour pairs. This formulation is crucial for applications requiring both high solution quality and fault tolerance, such as logistics planning, robotics pathfinding or strategic patrolling. Current methods are limited: traditional heuristics, such as the Niching Memetic Algorithm (NMA) or bi-criteria optimization, incur high computational complexity $O(n^3)$, while modern neural approaches (e.g., RF-MA3S) achieve limited diversity quality and rely on complex, external mechanisms.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel hybrid framework that decomposes D-TSP into two efficient steps. First, we utilize a simple Graph Pointer Network (GPN), augmented with an approximated sequence entropy loss, to efficiently sample a large, diverse pool of high-quality tours. This simple modification effectively controls the quality-diversity trade-off without complex external mechanisms. Second, we apply a greedy algorithm that yields a 2-approximation for the dispersion problem to select the final $k$ maximally diverse tours from the generated pool. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. On the Berlin instance, our model achieves an average Jaccard index of $0.015$, significantly outperforming NMA ($0.081$) and RF-MA3S. By leveraging GPU acceleration, our GPN structure achieves a near-linear empirical runtime growth of $O(n)$. While maintaining solution diversity comparable to complex bi-criteria algorithms, our approach is over 360 times faster on large-scale instances (783 cities), delivering high-quality TSP solutions with unprecedented efficiency and simplicity.</description>

      <title>Topological Signatures of ReLU Neural Network Activation Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the topological signatures of ReLU neural network activation patterns. We consider feedforward neural networks with ReLU activation functions and analyze the polytope decomposition of the feature space induced by the network. Mainly, we investigate how the Fiedler partition of the dual graph and show that it appears to correlate with the decision boundary -- in the case of binary classification. Additionally, we compute the homology of the cellular decomposition -- in a regression task -- to draw similar patterns in behavior between the training loss and polyhedral cell-count, as the model is trained.</description>
