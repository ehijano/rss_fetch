      <title>No missing flare in OJ~287</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasar OJ~287 has shown large flares since 1888, following a pattern that arises in a supermassive black hole binary when the secondary hits the accretion disk of the primary, and releases a hot bubble of gas at every disk crossing. A complete mathematical solution of the flare sequence produced a list of future flares, the latest happening in the summer of 2022. Here I look into the origin of the idea that the lack of seeing the 2022 flare is a theoretical problem. During the summer OJ~287 cannot be observed by ground-based optical telescopes. In a paper published in 2021, ahead of the 2022 observing campaign, this was clearly stated. The often repeated claim that there is a "missing flare problem", is a misunderstanding, as no detection was possible with the current instrumentation.</description>

      <title>Induced Compton scattering in magnetized electron and positron pair plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A formulation for the parametric instability of electromagnetic (EM) waves in magnetized pair plasma is developed. The linear growth rate of induced Compton scattering is derived analytically for frequencies below the cyclotron frequency for the first time. We identify three modes of density fluctuation: ordinary, charged, and neutral modes. In the charged mode, the ponderomotive force separates charges (electrons and positrons) longitudinally, in contrast to the nonmagnetized case. We also recognize two effects that significantly reduce the scattering rate for waves polarized perpendicular to the magnetic field: (1) the gyroradius effect due to the magnetic suppression of particle orbits, and (2) Debye screening for wavelengths larger than the Debye length. Applying this to fast radio bursts (FRBs), we find that these effects facilitate the escape of X-mode waves from the magnetosphere and outflow of a magnetar and neutron star, enabling 100\% polarization as observed. Our formulation provides a foundation for consistently addressing the nonlinear interaction of EM waves with magnetized plasma in astrophysics and laser physics.</description>

      <title>Machine- and deep-learning-driven angular momentum inference from BHEX observations of the $n=1$ photon ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $n=1$ photon ring is an important probe of black hole (BH) properties and will be resolved by the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) for the first time. However, extraction of black hole parameters from observations of the $n=1$ subring is not trivial. Developing this capability can be achieved by building a sample of $n=1$ subring simulations, as well as by performing feature extraction on this high-volume sample to track changes in the geometry, which presents significant computational challenges. Here, we present a framework for the study of $n=1$ photon ring behavior and BH property measurement from BHEX images. We use KerrBAM to generate a grid of $\gtrsim10^6$ images of $n=1$ photon rings spanning the entire space of Kerr BH spins and inclinations. Intensity profiles are extracted from images using a novel feature extraction method developed specifically for BHEX. This novel method is highly optimized and outperforms existing EHT methods by a factor of ${\sim}3000$. Additionally, we propose a novel, minimal set of geometric measurables for characterizing the behavior of the $n=1$ subring geometry. We apply these measurables to our simulation grid and test spin recovery on simulated images using: (i) gradient boosting, a machine learning algorithm; and (ii) an extension of Deep Horizon, a deep learning framework. We find $\gtrsim90$\% correct recovery of BH properties using the machine/deep learning approaches, and characterize the space of resolution-dependent geometric degeneracies. Finally, we test both approaches on GRMHD simulations of black hole accretion flows, and report accurate recovery of spin at the expected inclination of M87*.</description>

      <title>Detection of two TeV gamma-ray outbursts from NGC 1275 by LHAASO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Water Cherenkov Detector Array (WCDA) is one of the components of Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) and can monitor any sources over two-thirds of the sky for up to 7 hours per day with &gt;98\% duty cycle. In this work, we report the detection of two outbursts of the Fanaroff-Riley I radio galaxy NGC 1275 that were detected by LHAASO-WCDA between November 2022 and January 2023 with statistical significance of 5.2~$\sigma$ and 8.3~$\sigma$. The observed spectral energy distribution in the range from 500 GeV to 3 TeV is fitted by a power-law with a best-fit spectral index of $\alpha=-3.37\pm0.52$ and $-3.35\pm0.29$, respectively. The outburst flux above 0.5~TeV was ($4.55\pm 4.21)\times~10^{-11}~\rm cm^{-2}~s^{-1}$ and ($3.45\pm 1.78)\times~10^{-11}~\rm cm^{-2}~s^{-1}$, corresponding to 60\%, 45\% of Crab Nebula flux. Variation analysis reveals the variability time-scale of days at the TeV energy band. A simple test by one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model reproduces the data in the gamma-ray band well.</description>

      <title>PKS~2332$-$017 and PMN J1916$-$1519: Candidate Blazar Counterparts to Two High-energy Neutrino Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report our counterpart identification study for two high-energy, Gold neutrino events IC-130127A and IC-131204A listed in the IceCube Event Catalog of Alert Tracks. Within the events' 90\% positional uncertainty regions, we respectively find PKS~2332$-$017 and PMN J1916$-$1519. The first source is a flat-spectrum radio quasar at redshift $z= 1.18$ and the second a blazar of an uncertain type with photometric $z= 0.968$. As they correspondingly had a $\gamma$-ray flare temporally coincident with the arrival times of IC-130127A and IC-131204A, we identify them as the respective neutrino emitters. Detailed analysis of the $\gamma$-ray data for the two blazars, obtained with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard {\it the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi)}, is conducted. The two flares respectively from PKS~2332$-$017 and PMN~J1916$-$1519 lasted $\sim$4\,yr and $\sim$4\,month, and showed possible emission hardening by containing high-energy $\sim$2--10\,GeV photons in the emissions. Accompanying the flare of PKS~2332$-$017, optical and MIR brightening variations were also observed. We discuss the properties of the two sources and compare the properties with those of the previously reported (candidate) neutrino-emitting blazars.</description>

      <title>The X-ray re-brightening of GRB afterglow revisited: a possible signature from activity of the central engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are thought to be from core collapse of massive stars, and a rapidly spinning magnetar or black hole may be formed as the central engine. The extended emission in the prompt emission, flares and plateaus in X-ray afterglow, are proposed to be as the signature of central engine re-activity. However, the directly evidence from observations of identifying the central engines remain an open question. In this paper, we systemically search for long-duration GRBs that consist of bumps in X-ray afterglow detected by Swift/XRT, and find that the peak time of the X-ray bumps exhibit bimodal distribution (defined as early and late bumps) with division line at $t=7190$ s. Although we cannot rule out that such a bimodality arises from selection effects. We proposed that the long-duration GRBs with an early (or late) bumps may be originated from the fall-back accretion onto a new-born magnetar (or black hole). By adopting MCMC method to fit the early (or late) bumps of X-ray afterglow with the fall-back accretion of magnetar (or black hole), it is found that the initial surface magnetic filed and period of magnetars for most early bumps are clustered around $5.88\times10^{13}$ G and $1.04$ ms, respectively. Meanwhile, the derived accretion mass of black hole for late bumps is range of $[4\times10^{-4}, 1.8\times10^{-2}]~M_{\odot}$, and the typical fall-back radius is distributed range of $[1.04, 4.23]\times 10^{11}$ cm which is consistent with the typical radius of a Wolf-Rayet star. However, we also find that the fall-back accretion magnetar model is disfavored by the late bumps, but the fall-back accretion of black hole model can not be ruled out to interpret the early bumps of X-ray afterglow.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength variability of the blazar AO 0235+164</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the multiwavelength (MW) variability of the blazar AO 0235+164 based on the radio-to-$\gamma$-ray data covering a long time period from 1997 to 2023. The radio data are represented by the 1-22 GHz measurements from the RATAN-600 radio telescope, the 5 and 8 GHz data from the RT-32 telescopes, and the 37 GHz data from the RT-22 telescope. The optical measurements in the $R$-band were collected with the 1-m Zeiss-1000 and 0.5-m AS-500/2 telescopes. Additionally we used the archive data at 230~GHz from the SMA and the $\gamma$-ray data in the 0.1-100 GeV band from the Fermi-LAT point source 4FGL-DR2 catalogue. The variability properties during four epochs containing major flares and one epoch of relatively low activity were analysed. A significant correlation ($\geq\!2\sigma$) between the radio, optical, and $\gamma$-ray bands is found for all these periods with time delays from 0 to 1.7 yrs. The relation between time delay and frequency is described by a linear law with a negative slope of -10 day/GHz. The discovered properties of MW variability for the low activity period and for flaring states suggest that the mechanisms dominating the radio-$\gamma$-ray variations are not substantially different. The detected quasi-periodic oscillations of about 6 and 2 years are tentative, as the time span of the observations includes fewer than 4 full cycles for the radio and optical data and only about 3 cycles for the Fermi-LAT data. The physical parameters of the radio jet were obtained using the Hedgehog model applied to the average radio spectrum of AO 0235+164 in the range 0.1-300 GHz. The effectiveness of replacing electrons with protons in the synchrotron radio emission of relativistic jets is shown for describing the nature of blazars and the generation of high energy neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Intergalactic magnetism in a gamma-ray beam as a model of Porphyrion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We estimate the magnetic field in the jets of the recently discovered 7 Mpc long Porphyrion system. We use non-detection of the system in gamma-rays to derive a lower bound on the co-moving magnetic field strength at the level of ~10 nG. This value is consistent with recent estimates of magnetic fields in the filaments of the Large Scale Structure. We discuss the possibility that, instead of being the extreme case of a radio jet formation scenario, Porphyrion actually traces a very-high-energy gamma-ray beam emitted by an active galactic nucleus. In such a model, jets do not need to spread into the voids of the Large Scale Structure to appear straight on a very large distance range, and several anomalies of the standard radio jet scenarios can be solved at once.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion in binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion model is widely used to describe how a compact object accretes material from a companion's stellar wind in binary systems. However, this classical model becomes inaccurate when the wind velocity ($v_\mathrm{w}$) is comparable to or less than the orbital velocity ($v_\mathrm{o}$), predicting nonphysical accretion efficiencies above unity. This limits its applicability to systems with low wind-to-orbital velocity ratios ($w= v_\mathrm{w}/v_\mathrm{o} \leq 1$), such as symbiotic systems. We revisit the BHL model and introduce a geometric correction factor that accounts for the varying orientation of the accretion cylinder relative to the wind direction. This correction ensures physically plausible accretion efficiencies ($\eta\leq 1$) for all $w$ in circular orbits. Our modified model naturally predicts the flattening of the accretion efficiency observed in numerical simulations for $w&lt;1$, without the need for ad hoc adjustments. We also peer into the implications of our model for the less-explored case of eccentric orbits, highlighting the key role of the geometric correction factor in shaping the accretion process. We compare our predictions with numerical simulations, finding good agreement for a wide range of parameters. Applications to the symbiotic star R Aqr and the X-ray binary LS 5039 are presented. This improved model offers a more accurate description of wind accretion in binary systems, with implications for stellar evolution, population synthesis, and observational data interpretation.</description>

      <title>Askaryan Radio Array: searching for the highest energy neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searches for ultra-high energy ($E_\nu \geq 10$ PeV) cosmogenic and astrophysical neutrinos (UHENs) have been conducted by several experiments over the last two decades. The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA), located near the geographical South Pole, was one of the first two experiments that used radio antennas sensitive to orthogonal polarizations for detection of neutrino-induced Askaryan radiation. ARA comprises five independent autonomous stations, with an additional low threshold phased array merged with station 5, which were deployed at a depth of 100-200 m over the period 2012-2018, corresponding to a total livetime of more than 27 station years. In this article, we present a brief overview of the detector, its detection technique, and discuss a few of its major achievements with a focus on the current status of the array-wide UHEN search. We expect to produce the most sensitive results on the neutrino flux by any existing in-ice neutrino experiment below 1000 EeV energy.</description>

      <title>Very High-energy Gamma-Ray Episodic Activity of Radio Galaxy NGC 1275 in 2022-2023 Measured with MACE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radio galaxy NGC 1275, located at the central region of Perseus cluster, is a well-known very high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emitter. The Major Atmospheric Cherenkov Experiment Telescope has detected two distinct episodes of VHE (E &gt; 80 GeV) gamma-ray emission from NGC 1275 during 2022 December and 2023 January. The second outburst, observed on 2023 January 10, was the more intense of the two, with flux reaching 58$\%$ of the Crab Nebula flux above 80 GeV. The differential energy spectrum measured between 80 GeV and 1.5 TeV can be described by a power law with a spectral index of $\Gamma = - 2.90 \pm 0.16_{stat}$ for both flaring events. The broadband spectral energy distribution derived from these flares, along with quasisimultaneous low-energy counterparts, suggests that the observed gamma-ray emission can be explained using a homogeneous single-zone synchrotron self-Compton model. The physical parameters derived from this model for both flaring states are similar. The intermediate state observed between two flaring episodes is explained by a lower Doppler factor or magnetic field, which subsequently returned to its previous value during the high-activity state observed on 2023 January 10.</description>

      <title>Searching for orbital period modulation in X-ray observations of the symbiotic X-ray binary GX 1+4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symbiotic X-ray binary GX 1+4 possesses a number of peculiar properties that have been studied since the early 1970s. In particular, the orbital period has been a point of debate for many years, until radial velocity measurements were able to settle the debate. These radial velocity findings have so far not been confirmed using X-ray data, even though multiple factors would cause a periodic variation on the same timescale as the orbital period at these energies. Because the orbit of GX 1+4 is eccentric and not seen face-on, changes in the accretion rate and column density along the line of sight could cause a periodic variation in the spin-frequency measurements, X-ray light curves, and hardness ratios of the source. Furthermore, for a high inclination of the orbital plane, the neutron star could be eclipsed by the companion, which would lead to periodic decreases in brightness. We used data from a number of different X-ray telescopes to search directly for periodicity by applying the Lomb-Scargle and epoch-folding approaches to long-term light-curve and spin-frequency measurement data of the source. We support our findings using folded light curves, hardness ratios, and images. We find that our results agree with the radial velocity findings, and we form a self-consistent model that is supported by folded hardness-ratios and light curves. We find that the source is clearly detected in X-rays during the predicted eclipse. Motivated by this absence of an eclipse in the system, we constrain the inclination of the system to $\sim 76^\circ-84^\circ$ and the mass of the neutron star in the system to $\sim1.23M_\odot - 1.45M_\odot$ using the constraints on the red giant mass and surface gravity provided in the literature. Furthermore, we constrain the radius of the red giant to $\sim 60R_\odot - 150R_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength coverage of the 2024 periastron passage of PSR B1259-63 / LS 2883</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PSR B1259-63 is a gamma-ray binary system with a 48 ms radio pulsar orbiting around an O9.5Ve star, LS 2883, in a highly eccentric ~3.4 yr long orbit. Close to the periastron the system is detected from radio up to the TeV energies due to the interaction of LS 2883 and pulsar's outflows. The observations of last 4 periastra passages taken in 2010-2021 demonstrate periastron to periastron variability at all wavelength, probably linked to the state of the decretion disk. In this paper we present the results of our optical, radio and X-ray observational campaigns on PSR B1259-63 performed in 2024 accompanied with the analysis of the publicly available GeV FERMI/LAT data. We show that this periastron passage was characterised by the early flaring of X-rays before the periastron passage and GeV emission after the periastron passage, which can be explained by a larger size of the decretion disk as supported by the optical observations. The structure of the GeV flare is also in agreement with the disruption of the large dense disk. The possible X-ray/radio correlation was observed only during the post-periastron rise of X-ray and radio emission.</description>

      <title>Separating repeating fast radio bursts using the minimum spanning tree as an unsupervised methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) represent one of the most intriguing phenomena in modern astrophysics. However, their classification into repeaters and non-repeaters is challenging. Here, we present the application of the graph theory Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) methodology as an unsupervised classifier of repeaters and non-repeaters FRBs. By constructing MSTs based on various combinations of variables, we identify those that lead to MSTs that exhibit a localized high density of repeaters at each side of the node with the largest betweenness centrality. Comparing the separation power of this methodology against known machine learning methods, and with the random expectation results, we assess the efficiency of the MST-based approach to unravel the physical implications behind the graph pattern. We finally propose a list of potential repeater candidates derived from the analysis using the MST.</description>

      <title>Hints of spin-magnitude correlations and a rapidly spinning subpopulation of binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex astrophysical processes leading to the formation of binary black holes and their eventual merger are imprinted on the spins of the individual black holes. We revisit the astrophysical distribution of those spins based on gravitational waves from the third gravitational wave transient catalog GWTC-3, (Abbott et al. 2023a), looking for structure in the two-dimensional space defined by the dimensionless spin magnitudes of the heavier ($\chi_1$) and lighter ($\chi_2$) component black holes. We find support for two distinct subpopulations with greater than $95\%$ credibility. The dominant population is made up of black holes with small spins, preferring $\chi_1 \approx 0.2$ for the primary and $\chi_2 \approx 0$ for the secondary; we report signs of an anticorrelation between $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$, as well as as evidence against a subpopulation of binaries in which both components are nonspinning. The subdominant population consists of systems in which both black holes have relatively high spins and contains $20^{+18}_{-18}\%$ of the binaries. The binaries that are most likely to belong in this subpopulation are massive and slightly more likely to have spin-orientations aligned with the orbital angular momentum--potentially consistent with isolated binary formation channels capable of producing large spins, like chemically homogeneous evolution. This hint of a rapidly spinning subpopulation hinges on GW190517, a binary with large and well-measured spins. Our results, which are enabled by novel hierarchical inference methods, represent a first step towards more descriptive population models for black hole spins, and will be strengthened or refuted by the large number of gravitational wave detections expected in the next several years.</description>

      <title>Connecting dust and outflows in AGN: the intriguing case of NGC 6860</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic dust plays a crucial role in the evolution of galaxies, significantly influencing star formation and the interstellar medium. However, in active galactic nuclei (AGN), the role and origin of dust remain poorly understood. High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy is a powerful tool for probing the properties of dust in AGN. NGC 6860, an X-ray bright type-1 quasar, is an ideal target for investigating the connection between dust and winds in AGN. It exhibits reddening and X-ray absorption by both dust and winds. By modeling high-resolution X-ray spectra from XMM-Newton and Chandra observations, we determine the properties of dust and outflows in this AGN. Our analysis finds four photoionized components, outflowing with velocities of 50-300 km/s. The first two are relatively highly ionized with logxi = 3.4 and logxi = 2.9. The results of our photoionization modeling suggest that these two components are thermally unstable. The third component is ionized, with logxi = 2.3 and is located further away from the central black hole. The fourth component is less ionized, and is possibly located in the host galaxy. The application of dust models enables us to probe the abundance and location of the dust in NGC 6860. Our findings suggest that dust absorption and reddening originates from the extended narrow-line region and its host galaxy.</description>

      <title>Prospects for optical detections from binary neutron star mergers with the next-generation multi-messenger observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational wave (GW) observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer, will observe binary neutron star (BNS) mergers across cosmic history, providing precise parameter estimates for the closest ones. Innovative wide-field observatories, like the Vera Rubin Observatory, will quickly cover large portions of the sky with unprecedented sensitivity to detect faint transients. This study aims to assess the prospects for detecting optical emissions from BNS mergers with next-generation detectors, considering how uncertainties in neutron star (NS) population properties and microphysics may affect detection rates. Starting from BNS merger populations exploiting different NS mass distributions and equations of state (EOSs), we model the GW and kilonova (KN) signals based on source properties. We model KNe ejecta through numerical-relativity informed fits, considering the effect of prompt collapse of the remnant to black hole and new fitting formulas appropriate for more massive BNS systems, like GW190425. We include optical afterglow emission from relativistic jets consistent with observed short gamma-ray bursts. We evaluate the detected mergers and the source parameter estimations for different geometries of ET, operating alone or in a network of current or next-generation GW detectors. Finally, we estimate the number of detected optical signals simulating realistic observational strategies by the Rubin Observatory. ET as a single observatory will enable the detection of about ten to a hundred KNe per year by the Rubin Observatory. This improves by a factor of $\sim 10$ already when operating in the network with current GW detectors. Detection rate uncertainties are dominated by the poorly constrained local BNS merger rate, and depend to a lesser extent on the NS mass distribution and EOS.</description>

      <title>Observation of nonaxisymmetric standard magnetorotational instability induced by a free-shear layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard magnetorotational instability (SMRI) is widely believed to be responsible for the observed accretion rates in astronomical disks. It is a linear instability triggered in the differentially rotating ionized disk flow by a magnetic field component parallel to the rotation axis. Most studies focus on axisymmetric SMRI in conventional base flows with a Keplerian profile for accretion disks or an ideal Couette profile for Taylor-Couette flows, since excitation of nonaxisymmetric SMRI in such flows requires a magnetic Reynolds number Rm more than an order of magnitude larger. Here, we report that in a magnetized Taylor-Couette flow, nonaxisymmetric SMRI can be destabilized in a free-shear layer in the base flow at Rm $\gtrsim$ 1, the same threshold as for axisymmetric SMRI. Global linear analysis reveals that the free-shear layer reduces the required Rm, possibly by introducing an extremum in the vorticity of the base flow. Nonlinear simulations validate the results from linear analysis and confirm that a novel instability recently discovered experimentally (Nat. Commun. 13, 4679 (2022)) is the nonaxisymmetric SMRI. Our finding has astronomical implications since free-shear layers are ubiquitous in celestial systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent nonmagnetized studies of binary neutron star mergers have indicated the possibility of identifying equation of state features, such as a phase transition or a quark-hadron crossover, based on the frequency shift of the main peak in the postmerger gravitational wave spectrum. By performing a series of general relativistic, magnetohydrodynamic simulations we show that similar frequency shifts can be obtained due to the effect of the magnetic field. The existing degeneracy can either mask or nullify a shift due to a specific equation of state feature, and therefore the interpretation of observational data is more complicated than previously thought, requiring a more complete treatment that would necessarily include the neutron star's magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Post-merger gravitational wave signals from binary neutron stars: Effect of the magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The oscillation modes of neutron star (NS) merger remnants, as encoded by the kHz postmerger gravitational wave (GW) signal, hold great potential for constraining the as-yet undetermined equation of state (EOS) of dense nuclear matter. Previous works have used numerical relativity simulations to derive quasi-universal relations for the key oscillation frequencies, but most of them omit the effects of a magnetic field. We conduct full general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of NSNS mergers with two different masses and two different EOSs (SLy and ALF2) with three different initial magnetic field topologies (poloidal and toroidal only, confined to the interior, and "pulsar-like": dipolar poloidal extending from the interior to the exterior), with four different initial magnetic field strengths. We find that the magnetic braking and magnetic effective turbulent viscosity drives the merger remnants towards uniform rotation and increases their overall angular momentum loss. This causes the remnant to contract and the angular velocity of the quadrupole density oscillation to increase in such a way that it rotates faster than the fluid itself, in stark contrast with nonmagnetized simulations. As a result, the $f_2$ frequency of the dominant postmerger GW mode shifts upwards over time. The overall shift is up to ~ 200Hz for the strongest magnetic field we consider and ~ 50Hz for the median case and is therefore detectable in principle by future GW observatories, which should include the magnetic field in their analyses.</description>

      <title>Standing torsional Alfv\'en waves as the source of the rotational period variation in magnetic early-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The influence of magnetic fields on stellar evolution remains unresolved. It has been proposed that if there is a large-scale magnetic field in the stellar interior, torsional waves could arise, efficiently transporting angular momentum. In fact, the observed variations in the rotation periods of some magnetic stars may be attributed to these torsional waves' standing waves. Aims. To demonstrate the existence of torsional waves through modeling of the rotational period variations. Method. We conduct an eigenmode analysis of standing waves based on one-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic equations. The internal magnetic field structures are parametrically represented to treat poloidal fields with different degrees of central/surface concentration. The obtained frequencies are compared with the observed frequencies of the rotational period variations, thereby constraining the internal magnetic field structures. Results. The 67.6 years exhibited by CU Vir is reproduced for surface-concentrated magnetic field structures. The rotational period variations of all ten magnetic stars analyzed in this study are inconsistent with a centrally concentrated magnetic field. Conclusions. Torsional waves can reproduce the observations of rotational period variations. The large-scale magnetic fields within magnetic stars would be concentrated on the surface.</description>

      <title>Is bouncing easier with a negative effective dark fluid density ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assuming that a cosmological model can describe the whole Universe history, we look for the conditions of a cosmological bounce thus in agreement with late time observations. Our approach involves casting such a theory into General Relativity with curvature ($\Omega_{\kappa}$), matter ($\Omega_{m}$), radiation ($\Omega_{r}$) and an effective dark fluid ($\Omega_{d}$) and formulating the corresponding field equations as a 2D dynamical system, wherein phase space points corresponding to extrema of the metric function are constrained by observational data. We show that if this effective dark fluid density is positive at the bounce, these observational constraints imply its occurrence in the future at a redshift $z&lt;-0.81$ whatever the cosmological model (dark energy, brane, $f(R)$, etc.) corresponding to this effective dark fluid and even with a positive curvature. Hence, the effective dark fluid density must be negative at the bounce such as it arises for $z&gt;-0.81$ and thus possibly in the past. Observations also impose that the dark fluid effective density can change sign only within the redshift range $0.54&lt;z&lt;0.61$. We then proceed by examining 3 cosmological models: a non linear dark fluid model, a Randall Sundrum brane model and a $f(R)=R+mR^n+\Lambda$ model. For each of them, we examine the conditions for (1) a bounce at early time, (2) with a negative effective dark fluid energy density, (3) this having to change sign within the above specified redshift interval. We find that none of these three models satisfy all three constraints. We conclude that while a negative effective dark fluid energy density required by observational constraints for a bounce at early times facilitates this bounce, the requirement for $\Omega_d$ to change sign and become positive within the above specified narrow redshift interval proves exceedingly challenging to satisfy these same constraints.</description>

Abstract: We present the characterization of cosmogenic muon backgrounds for the Colorado Underground Research Institute (CURIE), located in the Edgar Experimental Mine (EEM) in Idaho Springs, Colorado. The CURIE facility at the EEM offers a versatile shallow underground environment, with accessible horizontal tunnel access and stable rock formations ideal for low-background physics experiments. We have measured the total underground muon flux in two locations, Site 0 and Site 1, yielding values of $\phi$ = 0.246 $\pm$ 0.020$_{sys.}$ $\pm$ 0.012$_{stat.}$ and 0.239 $\pm$ 0.025$_{sys.}$ $\pm$ 0.010$_{stat.}$ $\mu\text{/}m^{2}\text{/}s$, respectively. We have utilized GEANT4 and PROPOSAL Monte Carlo simulations with Daemonflux and MUTE to model the muon flux at both sites, as well as an additional future location. We find good agreement between measurement and simulations, demonstrating the first instance of this computational framework being successfully used for depths $&lt;$ 1 km.w.e. The measured underground flux corresponds to a factor of 700 reduction compared to the sea level flux. Additionally, we present a new depth-intensity relationship to normalize the mountain overburden to an equivalent flat depth, enabling direct comparison with other underground facilities. We report an average equivalent vertical depth of 0.415 $\pm$ 0.027 km.w.e. Based on our measurements, this work highlights the facility's capability for hosting low-background experiments, addressing the demand for shallow underground research spaces.</description>

      <title>Low Mass Contact Binaries: Orbital Stability at Extreme Low Mass Ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the ever-increasing number of light curve solutions of contact binary systems increasing number of potential bright red nova progenitors are being reported. There remains, however, only one confirmed event. In the present study we undertake a comprehensive review of orbital stability of contact binary systems considering the effects of the stellar internal composition (metallicity) and age on the evolution of the gyration radius and its effect on the instability mass ratio of contact binaries. We find that both metallicity and age have an independent effect on orbital stability with metal poor and older systems being more stable. The combined effects of age and metallicity are quite profound such that for most systems with primaries of solar mass or greater which are halfway or more through the main sequence lifespans have instability mass ratio at levels where the secondary component would be below the hydrogen fusion mass limit. We find that from the currently available solutions we cannot confidently assign any system as unstable. Although we identify 8 potential red nova progenitors all have methodological or astrophysical concerns which lower our confidence in designating any of them as potential merger candidates.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Hubble constant with scattering in host galaxies of fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring the Hubble constant (H$_0$) is one of the most important missions in astronomy. Nevertheless, recent studies exhibit differences between the employed methods. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are coherent radio transients with large dispersion measures (DM) with a duration of milliseconds. DM$_{\rm IGM}$, DM in the intergalactic medium (IGM), could open a new avenue for probing H$_0$. However, it has been challenging to separate DM contributions from different components (i.e., the IGM and the host galaxy plasma), and this hampers the accurate measurements of DM$_{\rm IGM}$ and hence H$_0$. We adopted a method to overcome this problem by using the temporal scattering of the FRB pulses due to the propagation effect through the host galaxy plasma (scattering time). The scattering-inferred DM in a host galaxy improves the estimate of DM$_{\rm IGM}$, which in turn leads to a better constraint on H$_0$. In previous studies, a certain value or distribution has conventionally been assumed of the dispersion measure in host galaxies (DM$_{\rm h}$). We compared this method with ours by generating 100 mock FRBs, and we found that our method reduces the systematic (statistical) error of H$_0$ by 9.1% (1%) compared to the previous method. We applied our method to 30 localized FRB sources with both scattering and spectroscopic redshift measurements to constrain H$_0$. Our result is H$_0$=74$_{-7.2}^{+7.5}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, where the central value prefers the value obtained from local measurements over the cosmic microwave background. We also measured DM$_{\rm h}$ with a median value of $103^{+68}_{-48}$ pc cm$^{-3}$. The reduction in systematic error is comparable to the Hubble tension ($\sim10$%). Combined with the fact that more localized FRBs will become available, our result indicates that our method can be used to address the Hubble tension using future FRB samples.</description>

Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are radio transients of extragalactic origin lasting for about a few to several milli-seconds. We have analyzed both non-CHIME and CHIME FRB data. To circumvent the absence of measured fluence and flux density of FRBs belonging to the CHIME catalog, we have devised a novel approach that utilizes the ratio of the lower limits of the flux density $S_{\nu_O}$ to the fluence $F_{\nu_O}$ of individual FRB events to construct several parameters to investigate the presence of underlying trends in the FRB population drawn from both CHIME and non-CHIME data sets. One of these parameters involves true brightness temperature as well as energy density, despite not knowing the actual size of the FRB emission region. Our first robust conclusion is that the non-CHIME FRBs fall under two broad categories - those with luminosity density less than about $4\times 10^{33} $ erg/s/Hz at the frequency 300 MHz and those having larger luminosity density values than this. Assuming that FRBs are caused by magnetar glitches, we have discussed in this paper a simple physical model, incorporating an abrupt change in the light cylinder radius of an oblique rotator, to address the existence of these two categories.</description>

      <title>Proton Acceleration in Low-beta Magnetic Reconnection with Energetic Particle Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection regions in space and astrophysics are known as active particle acceleration sites. There is ample evidence showing that energetic particles can take a substantial amount of converted energy during magnetic reconnection. However, there has been a lack of studies understanding the backreaction of energetic particles at magnetohydrodynamical scales in magnetic reconnection. To address this, we have developed a new computational method to explore the feedback by non-thermal energetic particles. This approach considers the backreaction from these energetic particles by incorporating their pressure into Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. The pressure of the energetic particles is evaluated from their distribution evolved through Parker's transport equation, solved using stochastic differential equations (SDE), so we coin the name MHD-SDE. Applying this method to low-beta magnetic reconnection simulations, we find that reconnection is capable of accelerating a large fraction of energetic particles that contain a substantial amount of energy. When the feedback from these particles is included, their pressure suppresses the compression structures generated by magnetic reconnection, thereby mediating particle energization. Consequently, the feedback from energetic particles results in a steeper power-law energy spectrum. These findings suggest that feedback from non-thermal energetic particles plays a crucial role in magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration.</description>

      <title>Very High Energy Afterglow of Structured Jets: GW 170817 and Prospects for Future Detections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a complete numerical model of the afterglow of a laterally structured relativistic ejecta from the radio to very high energies (VHE). This includes a self-consistent calculation of the synchrotron radiation, with its maximum frequency, and of synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) scattering that takes the Klein-Nishina regime into account. Attenuation due to pair production is also included. This model is computationally efficient and allows multi-wavelength data fitting. As a validation test, the radiative model was used to fit the broad-band spectrum of GRB 190114C at 90 s up to the TeV range. The full model was then used to fit the afterglow of GW 170817 and predict its VHE emission. We find that the SSC flux at the peak was much dimmer than the upper limit from H.E.S.S. observations. However, we show that either a smaller viewing angle or a higher external density would make similar off-axis events detectable in the future at VHE, even above 100 Mpc with the sensitivity of the Cherenkov telescope array. High external densities are expected in the case of fast mergers, but the existence of a formation channel for these binary neutron stars is still uncertain. We highlight that VHE afterglow detections would help to efficiently probe systems like this.</description>

      <title>Coport: A New Public Code for Polarized Radiative Transfer in a Covariant Framework$^\spadesuit$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General relativistic radiative transfer calculations are essential for comparing theoretical models of black hole accretion flows and jets with observational data. In this work, we introduce Coport, a novel public code specifically designed for covariant polarized ray-tracing radiative transfer computations in any spacetime. Written in Julia, Coport includes an interface for visualizing numerical results obtained from HARM, a publicly available implementation of the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics code. We validate the precision of our code by comparing its outputs with the results from a variety of established methodologies. This includes the verification against analytical solutions, the validation through thin-disk assessments, and the evaluation via thick-disk analyses. Notably, our code employs a methodology that eliminates the need for separating the computations of spacetime propagation and plasma propagation. Instead, it directly solves the coupled, covariant, polarized radiative transfer equation in curved spacetime, seamlessly integrating the effects of gravity with plasma influences. This approach sets our code apart from the existing alternatives and enhances its accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Lower-mass-gap Black Holes in Dense Star Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of compact stellar remnants in the mass range $2-5\,M_{\odot}$ has long been debated. This so-called lower mass gap was initially suggested by the lack of low-mass X-ray binary observations with accretors about $2-5\,M_{\odot}$, but it has recently been called into question following newer observations, including a lower-mass-gap candidate with a millisecond pulsar companion in the dense globular cluster NGC 1851. Here we model NGC 1851 with a grid of similar dense star clusters utilizing the state-of-the-art Monte Carlo $N$-body code \texttt{CMC}, and we specifically study the formation of lower-mass-gap black holes. We demonstrate that both massive star evolution and dynamical interactions can contribute to forming lower-mass-gap black holes. In general, the collapse of massive remnants formed through mergers of neutron stars or massive white dwarfs produces the largest number of lower-mass-gap black holes among all formation channels. However, in more massive clusters, supernova core collapse can contribute comparable numbers. Our NGC 1851-like models can reproduce millisecond pulsar -- lower-mass-gap black hole binaries similar to the observed system. Additionally, the lower-mass-gap black holes can also become components of dynamically assembled binaries, and some will be in merging black hole - neutron star systems similar to the recently detected gravitational wave source GW230529. However, the corresponding merger rate is probably $\lesssim 1~{\rm Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}$.</description>

Abstract: Although there is strong evidence that many long GRBs are associated with the collapse of a massive star, tantalizing results in recent years have upended the direct association of all long GRBs with massive stars. In particular, kilonova signals in some long GRB light curves as well as a suggested uptick in the rate density of long GRBs at low redshifts (deviating significantly from the star formation rate) suggest that compact object mergers may be a non-negligible fraction of the long GRB population. Here we investigate the contribution of white dwarf-black hole mergers to the long GRB population. We present evidence for the deviation of the long GRB rate density from the star formation rate at low redshifts, and provide analytic and numerical arguments for why a white dwarf-black hole merger system may be a viable progenitor to explain this deviation. We show the range of parameter space in which the durations, energetics, and rates of these systems can account for a significant sub-population of low-redshift long GRBs.</description>

      <title>Constraining the low-energy cosmic ray flux in the central molecular zone from MeV nuclear deexcitation line observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19350v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-energy cosmic rays (LECRs) dominate the ionization in dense regions of molecular clouds in which other ionizers such as UV or X-ray photons are effectively shielded. Thus it was argued that the high ionization rate at the central molecular zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy is mainly caused by LECRs. However, the required LECR flux is orders of magnitude higher than the extrapolation of GeV cosmic ray (CR) flux derived from GeV gamma-ray observations. In this paper, we considered two types of additional LECR components and found that only very soft anomalous CR components can explain such a high ionization rate. This LECR component will inevitably produce MeV nuclear deexcitation lines due to their inelastic scattering with the ambient gas. We calculated the MeV line emission and discussed the detectability of next-generation MeV instruments. We found that future MeV observations can be used to pin down the origin of the high ionization rate in the CMZ.</description>

      <title>Incidence of afterglow plateaus in gamma-ray bursts associated with binary neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most surprising gamma-ray burst (GRB) features discovered with the Swift-X ray telescope (XRT) is a plateau phase in the early X-ray afterglow light curves. These plateaus are observed in the majority of long GRBs, while their incidence in short GRBs (SGRBs) is still uncertain due to their fainter X-ray afterglow luminosity with respect to long GRBs. An accurate estimate of the fraction of SGRBs with plateaus is of utmost relevance given the implications that the plateau may have for our understanding of the jet structure and possibly of the nature of the binary neutron star (BNS) merger remnant. This work presents the results of an extensive data analysis of the largest and most up-to-date sample of short GRBs observed with the XRT, and for which the redshift has been measured. We find a plateau incidence of 18-37% in short GRBs, which is a significantly lower fraction than that measured in long GRBs (&gt;50%). Although still debated, the plateau phase could be explained as energy injection from the spin-down power of a newly born magnetized neutron star (NS; magnetar). We show that this scenario can nicely reproduce the observed short GRB plateaus, while at the same time providing a natural explanation for the different plateau fractions between short and long GRBs. In particular, our findings may imply that only a minority of BNS mergers generating short GRBs leave behind a sufficiently stable or long-lived neutron star (NS) to form a plateau. From the probability distribution of the BNS remnant mass, a fraction 18-37% of short GRB plateaus implies a maximum NS mass in the range $\sim$ 2.3 - 2.35 M$_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Impact of chaotic magnetic field on mass-radius relation of rotating neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11884v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations reveal that magnetic fields on neutron stars (NSs) are in the range of $10^{8-15}$ G. Apart from being celestial bodies, NSs are normally rotating. In this work, we study the impact of a chaotic magnetic field on the mass-radius relation of the rotating NSs. We employ an equation of state of NSs with the nuclei in the crust and hyperons in the core. We use Hartle-Thorne formalism as an approximation of the rotating NSs. For the magnetic field ansatz, we use the one coupled to the energy density. We find that the magnetic field can decrease radius of NS. NSs formed with stronger chaotic magnetic fields exhibit a lower maximum mass compared to those formed with weaker chaotic magnetic fields. In contrast, the increment of the magnetic field can increase the compactness and deformation of rotating NSs.</description>

      <title>The Influence of a Shock on the Nucleosynthesis Developing during the Explosion of a Low-Mass Neutron Star</title>

Abstract: The pattern of nucleosynthesis during the explosion of a low-mass neutron star formed in a close binary system in the stripping scenario is considered. In the scenario considered the shock arising during the explosion is shown to strongly heat the expanding neutron star matter. The heavy nuclei produced at the preceding stage of nucleosynthesis are partially destroyed as a result of a sharp increase in the role of photonuclear reactions. It is shown that even short-term heating of the matter by the shock can exert a noticeable influence on the results of the synthesis of elements in the r-process in the inner crust matter, while explosive nucleosynthesis gives rise to new elements in the outer crust matter with mass numbers A from 50 to 130.</description>

      <title>Elementary considerations on gravitational waves from hyperbolic encounters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the main properties of gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by transient hyperbolic encounters of black holes. We begin by building the set of basic variables most relevant to setting our problem. After exposing the ranges of masses and eccentricities accessible at a given GW frequency, we analyze the dependence of the gravitational strain on those parameters and determine the trajectories resulting in the most sizeable strains. Some non-trivial behaviors are unveiled, showing that highly eccentric events can be more easily detectable than parabolic ones. In particular, we underline the correct way to extend formulas from hyperbolic to parabolic orbits. Our reasonings are as general as possible, and we make a point of explaining our considerations pedagogically. The majority of the work is based on Newtonian dynamics and aims at being a benchmark to which more accurate calculations can be compared.</description>

      <title>Measurements of the charge ratio and polarization of cosmic-ray muons with the Super-Kamiokande detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the results of the charge ratio ($R$) and polarization ($P^{\mu}_{0}$) measurements using the decay electron events collected from 2008 September to 2022 June by the Super-Kamiokande detector. Because of its underground location and long operation, we performed high precision measurements by accumulating cosmic-ray muons. We measured the muon charge ratio to be $R=1.32 \pm 0.02$ $(\mathrm{stat.}{+}\mathrm{syst.})$ at $E_{\mu}\cos \theta_{\mathrm{Zenith}}=0.7^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ $\mathrm{TeV}$, where $E_{\mu}$ is the muon energy and $\theta_{\mathrm{Zenith}}$ is the zenith angle of incoming cosmic-ray muons. This result is consistent with the Honda flux model while this suggests a tension with the $\pi K$ model of $1.9\sigma$. We also measured the muon polarization at the production location to be $P^{\mu}_{0}=0.52 \pm 0.02$ $(\mathrm{stat.}{+}\mathrm{syst.})$ at the muon momentum of $0.9^{+0.6}_{-0.1}$ $\mathrm{TeV}/c$ at the surface of the mountain; this also suggests a tension with the Honda flux model of $1.5\sigma$. This is the most precise measurement ever to experimentally determine the cosmic-ray muon polarization near $1~\mathrm{TeV}/c$. These measurement results are useful to improve the atmospheric neutrino simulations.</description>

      <title>Ringing out General Relativity: Quasi-normal mode frequencies for black holes of any spin in modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12280v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After black holes collide, the remnant settles to a stationary state by emitting gravitational waves. Once non-linearities subside, these ringdown waves are dominated by exponentially-damped sinusoids, or quasinormal modes. We develop a general method using perturbative spectral expansions to calculate the quasinormal-mode frequencies and damping times in a wide class of modified gravity theories for black holes with any subextremal spin. We apply this method to scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity to show its accuracy, thus enabling robust ringdown tests with gravitational wave data.</description>

      <title>The coherent magnetic field of the Milky Way halo, Local Bubble and Fan Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent catalog of Faraday rotation measures (RM) of extragalactic sources together with the synchrotron polarization data from WMAP and Planck provides us with a wealth of information on magnetic fields of the Galaxy. However, the integral character of these observables together with our position inside the Galaxy makes the inference of the coherent Galactic magnetic field (GMF) complicated and ambiguous. We combine several phenomenological components of the GMF -- the spiral arms, the toroidal halo, the X-shaped field and the field of the Local Bubble -- to construct a new model of the regular GMF outside the thin disk. To have control over the relative contributions of the RM and polarization data to the fit we pay special attention to the estimation of errors in data bins. To this end we develop a systematic method which is uniformly applicable to different data sets. This method takes into account individual measurement errors, the variance in the bin as well as fluctuations in the data at angular scales larger than the bin size. This leads to decrease of the errors and, as a result, to better sensitivity of the data to the model content. We cross checked the stability of our method with the new LOFAR data. We found that the four components listed above are sufficient to fit both the RM and polarization data over the whole sky with only a small fraction masked out. Moreover, we have achieved several important improvements compared to previous approaches. Due to account of our location inside of the Local Bubble our model does not require introduction of striated fields. For the first time we showed that the Fan Region can be modeled as a Galactic-scale feature. The pitch angle of the magnetic field in our fit converged to the value around 20 degrees. Interestingly, with value is very close to the direction of the arms inferred recently from Gaia data on upper main sequence stars.</description>

      <title>A kiloparsec-scale ordered magnetic field in a galaxy at z=5.6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14596v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields are widely observed in various astronomical contexts, yet much remains unknown about their significance across different systems and cosmic epochs. Our current knowledge of the evolution of magnetic fields is limited by scarce observations in the distant Universe, where galaxies have recently been found to be more evolved than most model predictions. To address this gap, we conducted rest-frame 131 um full-polarisation observations of dust emission in a strongly lensed dusty star-forming galaxy, SPT0346-52, at z=5.6, when the Universe was only 1 Gyr old. Dust grains can become aligned with local magnetic fields, resulting in the emission of linearly polarised thermal infrared radiation. Our observations have revealed a median polarisation level of $0.9\pm0.2$ percent with a variation of $\pm0.4$ percent across the 3 kpc extention, indicating the presence of large-scale ordered magnetic fields. The polarised dust emission is patchy, offset from the total dust emission and mostly overlaps with the [C II] emission at a velocity of about -150 km/s. The bimodal distribution of field orientations, their spatial distribution, and the connection with the cold gas kinematics further emphasise the complexity of the magnetic environment in this galaxy and the potential role of mergers in shaping its magnetic fields. Such early formation of ordered galactic magnetic fields also suggests that both small-scale and large-scale dynamos could be efficient in early galaxies. Continued observations of magnetic fields in early galaxies, as well as expanding surveys to a wider galaxy population, are essential for a comprehensive understanding of the prevalence and impact of magnetic fields in the evolving Universe.</description>

      <title>Next-generation global gravitational-wave detector network: Impact of detector orientation on compact binary coalescence and stochastic gravitational-wave background searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational-wave detectors like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, currently in their preparatory phase, have the potential to significantly improve our understanding of astrophysics, cosmology and fundamental physics. We examine how the arm orientations of the proposed detectors influence the sensitivity of a combined Einstein Telescope - Cosmic Explorer network with respect to the sensitivity to the stochastic gravitational-wave background and compact binary coalescences, where measuring both gravitational-wave polarizations is favorable. We present a method to optimize the arm orientations in the network for these two targets, and also demonstrate how to achieve a balanced configuration for both stochastic background and compact binary coalescence searches. For five specific network configurations, we explicitly compare the sensitivity to the stochastic background and binary neutron star mergers. For the latter, we conduct Bayesian parameter estimation on the extrinsic parameters of a reference binary neutron star system to assess sky localization and distance estimation capabilities. These are illustrated through efficiency curves showing the fraction of events meeting sky localization and distance uncertainty criteria as a function of redshift. Our findings suggest that globally coordinating efforts towards the next-generation gravitational-wave detector network is advantageous.</description>

      <title>Novel inner shadows of the Kerr black hole illuminated by a tilted thin accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inner shadow of a black hole, as a projection of the event horizon, is regarded as a potential tool for testing gravitational theories and constraining system parameters. Whether this holds in the case of a tilted accretion disk warrants further investigation. In this paper, we employ a ray-tracing algorithm to simulate images of the Kerr black hole illuminated by a tilted thin accretion disk, with particular attention to the relationship between the inner shadow and system parameters. Our findings reveal that in the case of an equatorial accretion disk, the Kerr black hole exhibits a minimum inner shadow size of $S_{\textrm{min}} = 13.075$ M$^{2}$, where M denotes the black hole mass. This minimum is achieved when the viewing angle is $0^{\circ}$ and the spin parameter approaches $1$. However, with a non-zero disk tilt, the inner shadow exhibits novel configurations--taking on petal, crescent, or eyebrow shapes--significantly smaller than $S_{\textrm{min}}$ across various parameter spaces. This indicates that the inner shadow is highly sensitive to the accretion environment, suggesting that caution is needed when using it as a diagnostic tool for black holes. Notably, an observed inner shadow smaller than $S_{\textrm{min}}$ would either indicate the presence of a tilted accretion disk or support the viability of modified gravity. Moreover, in certain parameter spaces, we identify the emergence of a dual-shadow structure, which could also serve as a probe for the tilted accretion disk.</description>
