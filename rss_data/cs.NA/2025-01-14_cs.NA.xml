      <title>Tensorization of neural networks for improved privacy and interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a tensorization algorithm for constructing tensor train representations of functions, drawing on sketching and cross interpolation ideas. The method only requires black-box access to the target function and a small set of sample points defining the domain of interest. Thus, it is particularly well-suited for machine learning models, where the domain of interest is naturally defined by the training dataset. We show that this approach can be used to enhance the privacy and interpretability of neural network models. Specifically, we apply our decomposition to (i) obfuscate neural networks whose parameters encode patterns tied to the training data distribution, and (ii) estimate topological phases of matter that are easily accessible from the tensor train representation. Additionally, we show that this tensorization can serve as an efficient initialization method for optimizing tensor trains in general settings, and that, for model compression, our algorithm achieves a superior trade-off between memory and time complexity compared to conventional tensorization methods of neural networks.</description>

      <title>Isometric simplices for high-order anisotropic mesh adaptation. Part I: Definition and existence of isometric triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic mesh adaptation with Riemannian metrics has proven effective for generating straight-sided meshes with anisotropy induced by the geometry of interest and/or the resolved physics. Within the continuous mesh framework, anisotropic meshes are thought of as discrete counterparts to Riemannian metrics. Ideal, or unit, simplicial meshes consist only of simplices whose edges exhibit unit or quasi-unit length with respect to a given Riemannian metric. Recently, mesh adaptation with high-order (i.e., curved) elements has grown in popularity in the meshing community, as the additional flexibility of high-order elements can further reduce the approximation error. However, a complete and competitive methodology for anisotropic and high-order mesh adaptation is not yet available. The goal of this paper is to address a key aspect of metric-based high-order mesh adaptation, namely, the adequacy between a Riemannian metric and high-order simplices. This is done by extending the notions of unit simplices and unit meshes, central to the continuous mesh framework, to high-order elements. The existing definitions of a unit simplex are reviewed, then a broader definition involving Riemannian isometries is introduced to handle curved and high-order simplices. Similarly, the notion of quasi-unitness is extended to curved simplices to tackle the practical generation of high-order meshes. Proofs of concept for unit and (quasi-)isometric meshes are presented in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Parameter-robust Preconditioners for the Stokes-Darcy Coupled Problem without Fractional Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Stokes-Darcy coupled problem, which models the interaction between free-flow and porous medium flow. By enforcing the normal flux continuity interface condition directly within the finite-element spaces, we establish unified well-posedness results for the coupled system under various boundary condition scenarios. Using the operator preconditioning framework, we develop a parameter-robust preconditioner that avoids the use of fractional operators. Numerical experiments employing both $H(\operatorname{div})$-conforming and nonconforming finite-element methods are presented to confirm the theoretical findings and demonstrate the robustness of the proposed block preconditioners with respect to the physical parameters and mesh size.</description>

      <title>Realizability-Preserving Discontinuous Galerkin Method for Spectral Two-Moment Radiation Transport in Special Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a realizability-preserving numerical method for solving a spectral two-moment model to simulate the transport of massless, neutral particles interacting with a steady background material moving with relativistic velocities. The model is obtained as the special relativistic limit of a four-momentum-conservative general relativistic two-moment model. Using a maximum-entropy closure, we solve for the Eulerian-frame energy and momentum. The proposed numerical method is designed to preserve moment realizability, which corresponds to moments defined by a nonnegative phase-space density. The realizability-preserving method is achieved with the following key components: (i) a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) phase-space discretization with specially constructed numerical fluxes in the spatial and energy dimensions; (ii) a strong stability-preserving implicit-explicit (IMEX) time-integration method; (iii) a realizability-preserving conserved to primitive moment solver; (iv) a realizability-preserving implicit collision solver; and (v) a realizability-enforcing limiter. Component (iii) is necessitated by the closure procedure, which closes higher order moments nonlinearly in terms of primitive moments. The nonlinear conserved to primitive and the implicit collision solves are formulated as fixed-point problems, which are solved with custom iterative solvers designed to preserve the realizability of each iterate. With a series of numerical tests, we demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of this DG-IMEX method.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis of Wirtinger Flow for Poisson phase retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a rigorous theoretical convergence analysis of the Wirtinger Flow (WF) algorithm for Poisson phase retrieval, a fundamental problem in imaging applications. Unlike prior analyses that rely on truncation or additional adjustments to handle outliers, our framework avoids eliminating measurements or introducing extra computational steps, thereby reducing overall complexity. We prove that WF achieves linear convergence to the true signal under noiseless conditions and remains robust and stable in the presence of bounded noise for Poisson phase retrieval. Additionally, we propose an incremental variant of WF, which significantly improves computational efficiency and guarantees convergence to the true signal with high probability under suitable conditions.</description>

      <title>Some results on core EP Drazin matrices and partial isometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, by using the core EP inverse and the Drazin inverse which are two well known generalized inverses, a new class of matrices entitled core EP Drazin matrices (shortly, CEPD matrices) is introduced. This class contains the set of all EP matrices and also the set of normal matrices. Some algebraic properties of these matrices are also investigated. Moreover, some results about the Drazin inverse and the core EP inverse of partial isometries are derived, and using them, some conditions for which partial isometries are CEPD, are obtained. To illustrate the main results, some numerical examples are given.</description>

      <title>A theoretical analysis on the resolution of parametric PDEs via neural networks designed with Strassen algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a Neural Network that approximates the matrix multiplication operator for any activation functions for which there exist a Neural Network which can approximate the scalar multiplication function. In particular, we use the Strassen algorithm for reducing the number of weights and layers needed for such Neural Network. This allows us to define another Neural Network for approximating the inverse matrix operator. Also, by relying on the Galerkin method, we apply those Neural Networks for resolving parametric elliptic PDEs for a whole set of parameters at the same time. Finally, we discuss the improvements with respect to prior results.</description>

      <title>A Nonlocal size modified Poisson-Boltzmann Model and Its Finite Element Solver for Protein in Multi-Species Ionic Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) model is a widely used implicit solvent model in protein simulations. Although variants, such as the size modified PB and nonlocal modified PB models, have been developed to account for ionic size effects and nonlocal dielectric correlations, no existing PB variants simultaneously incorporate both, due to significant modeling and computational challenges. To address this gap, in this paper, a nonlocal size modified PB (NSMPB) model is introduced and solved using a finite element method for a protein with a three-dimensional molecular structure and an ionic solution containing multiple ion species. In particular, a novel solution decomposition is proposed to overcome the difficulties caused by the increased nonlinearity, nonlocality, and solution singularities of the model. It is then applied to the development of the NSMPB finite element solver, which includes an efficient modified Newton iterative method, an effective damping parameter selection strategy, and good selections of initial iterations. Moreover, the construction of the modified Newton iterative method is mathematically justified. Furthermore, an NSMPB finite element package is developed by integrating a mesh generation tool, a protein data bank file retrieval program, and the PDB2PQR package to simplify and accelerate its usage and application. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted on an ionic solution with four species, proteins with up to 11439 atoms, and irregular interface-fitted tetrahedral box meshes with up to 1188840 vertices. The numerical results confirm the fast convergence and strong robustness of the modified Newton iterative method, demonstrate the high performance of the package, and highlight the crucial roles played by the damping parameter and initial iteration selections in enhancing the method's convergence. The package will be a valuable tool in protein simulations.</description>

      <title>Generalized Optimal AMG Convergence Theory for Stokes Equations Using Smooth Aggregation and Vanka Relaxation Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses our recent generalized optimal algebraic multigrid (AMG) convergence theory applied to the steady-state Stokes equations discretized using Taylor-Hood elements ($\pmb{ \mathbb{P}}_2/\mathbb{P}_{1}$). The generalized theory is founded on matrix-induced orthogonality of the left and right eigenvectors of a generalized eigenvalue problem involving the system matrix and relaxation operator. This framework establishes a rigorous lower bound on the spectral radius of the two-grid error-propagation operator, enabling precise predictions of the convergence rate for symmetric indefinite problems, such as those arising from saddle-point systems. We apply this theory to the recently developed monolithic smooth aggregation AMG (SA-AMG) solver for Stokes, constructed using evolution-based strength of connection, standard aggregation, and smoothed prolongation. The performance of these solvers is evaluated using additive and multiplicative Vanka relaxation strategies. Additive Vanka relaxation constructs patches algebraically on each level, resulting in a nonsymmetric relaxation operator due to the partition of unity being applied on one side of the block-diagonal matrix. Although symmetry can be restored by eliminating the partition of unity, this compromises convergence. Alternatively, multiplicative Vanka relaxation updates velocity and pressure sequentially within each patch, propagating updates multiplicatively across the domain and effectively addressing velocity-pressure coupling, ensuring a symmetric relaxation. We demonstrate that the generalized optimal AMG theory consistently provides accurate lower bounds on the convergence rate for SA-AMG applied to Stokes equations. These findings suggest potential avenues for further enhancement in AMG solver design for saddle-point systems.</description>

      <title>A plastic damage model with mixed isotropic-kinematic hardening for low-cycle fatigue in 7020 aluminum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper at hand presents an in-depth investigation into the fatigue behavior of the high-strength aluminum alloy EN AW-7020 T6 using both experimental and numerical approaches. Two types of specimens are investigated: a dog-bone specimen subjected to cyclic loading in a symmetric strain-controlled regime, and a compact tension specimen subjected to repeated loading and unloading, which leads to damage growth from the notch tip. Experimental data from these tests are used to identify the different phases of fatigue. Subsequently, a plastic-damage model is developed, incorporating J2 plasticity with Chaboche-type mixed isotropic-kinematic hardening. A detailed investigation reveals that the Chaboche model must be blended with a suitable isotropic hardening and combined with a proper damage growth model to accurately describe cyclic fatigue including large plastic strains up to failure. Multiple back-stress components with independent properties are superimposed, and exponential isotropic hardening with saturation effects is introduced to improve alignment with experimental results. For damage, different stress splits are tested, with the deviatoric/volumetric split proving successful in reproducing the desired degradation in peak stress and stiffness. A nonlinear activation function is introduced to ensure smooth transitions between tension and compression. Two damage indices, one for the deviatoric part and one for the volumetric part, are defined, each of which is governed by a distinct trilinear damage growth function. The governing differential equation of the problem is regularized by higher-order gradient terms to address the ill-posedness induced by softening. Finally, the plasticity model is calibrated using finite element simulations of the dog-bone test and subsequently applied to the cyclic loading of the compact tension specimen.</description>

      <title>Full-waveform inversion via the scaled boundary finite element method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We begin by addressing the time-domain full-waveform inversion using the adjoint method. Next, we derive the scaled boundary semi-weak form of the scalar wave equation in heterogeneous media through the Galerkin method. Unlike conventional formulations, the resulting system incorporates variable density and two additional terms involving its spatial derivative. As a result, the coefficient matrices are no longer constant and depend on the radial coordinate, rendering the common solution methods inapplicable. Thus, we introduce a radial discretization scheme within the framework of the scaled boundary finite element method. We employ finite difference approximation, yet the choice underlying our ansatz is made for demonstration purposes and remains flexible. Next, we introduce an algorithmic condensation procedure to compute the dynamic stiffness matrices on the fly. Therefore, we maneuver around the need to introduce auxiliary unknowns. As a result, the optimization problem is structured in a two-level hierarchy. We obtain the Fr\'echet kernel by computing the zero-lag cross-correlations of the forward and adjoint wavefields, and solve the minimization problems iteratively by moving downhill on the cost function hypersurface through the limited-memory BFGS algorithm. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the new formulation and show that using the simplified differential equation along with the conventional formulation is highly inferior to applying the complete form of the differential equation. This approach effectively decomposes the computational load into independent local problems and a single coupled global system, making the solution method highly parallelizable. We demonstrate that, with a simple OpenMP implementation using 12 threads on a personal laptop, the new formulation outperforms the existing approach in terms of computation time.</description>

      <title>A globally divergence-free entropy stable nodal DG method for conservative ideal MHD equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an arbitrarily high-order globally divergence-free entropy stable nodal discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method to directly solve the conservative form of the ideal MHD equations using appropriate quadrature rules. The method ensures a globally divergence-free magnetic field by updating it at interfaces with a constraint-preserving formulation [5] and employing a novel least-squares reconstruction technique. Leveraging this property, the semi-discrete nodal DG scheme is proven to be entropy stable. To handle the problems with strong shocks, we introduce a novel limiting strategy that suppresses unphysical oscillations while preserving the globally divergence-free property. Numerical experiments verify the accuracy and efficacy of our method.</description>

      <title>Nitsche method under a semi-regular mesh condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitsche's method is a numerical approach that weakly enforces boundary conditions for partial differential equations. In recent years, Nitsche's method has experienced a revival owing to its natural application in modern computational methods, such as the cut and immersed finite element methods. This study investigates Nische's methods based on an anisotropic weakly over-penalized symmetric interior penalty method for Poisson and Stokes equations on convex domains. As our primary contribution, we provide a new proof for the consistency term, which allows us to obtain an estimate of the anisotropic consistency error. The key idea of the proof is to apply the relationship between the Crouzeix and Raviart finite element space and the Raviart--Thomas finite element space. We present the error estimates in the energy norm on anisotropic meshes. We compared the calculation results for the anisotropic mesh partitions in the numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Optimal convergence of the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian interface tracking method for two-phase Navier--Stokes flow without surface tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal-order convergence in the $H^1$ norm is proved for an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian interface tracking finite element method for the sharp interface model of two-phase Navier-Stokes flow without surface tension, using high-order curved evolving mesh. In this method, the interfacial mesh points move with the fluid's velocity to track the sharp interface between two phases of the fluid, and the interior mesh points move according to a harmonic extension of the interface velocity. The error of the semidiscrete arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian interface tracking finite element method is shown to be $O(h^k)$ in the $L^\infty(0, T; H^1(\Omega))$ norm for the Taylor-Hood finite elements of degree $k \ge 2$. This high-order convergence is achieved by utilizing the piecewise smoothness of the solution on each subdomain occupied by one phase of the fluid, relying on a low global regularity on the entire moving domain. Numerical experiments illustrate and complement the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Provable Low-Rank Tensor-Train Approximations in the Inverse of Large-Scale Structured Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the low-rank property of the inverse of a class of large-scale structured matrices in the tensor-train (TT) format, which is typically discretized from differential operators. An interesting question that we are concerned with is: Does the inverse of the large-scale structured matrix still admit the low-rank TT representation with guaranteed accuracy? In this paper, we provide a computationally verifiable sufficient condition such that the inverse matrix can be well approximated in a low-rank TT format. It not only answers what kind of structured matrix whose inverse has the low-rank TT representation but also motivates us to develop an efficient TT-based method to compute the inverse matrix. Furthermore, we prove that the inverse matrix indeed has the low-rank tensor format for a class of large-scale structured matrices induced by differential operators involved in several PDEs, such as the Poisson, Boltzmann, and Fokker-Planck equations. Thus, the proposed algorithm is suitable for solving these PDEs with massive degrees of freedom. Numerical results on the Poisson, Boltzmann, and Fokker-Planck equations validate the correctness of our theory and the advantages of our methodology.</description>

      <title>Summation-by-Parts Finite-Difference Method for Linear Shallow Water Equations on Staggered Curvilinear Grids in Closed Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on developing high-order energy-stable schemes for wave-dominated problems in closed domains using staggered finite-difference summation-by-parts (SBP FD) operators. We extend the previously presented uniform staggered grid SBP FD approach to non-orthogonal curvilinear multi-block grids and derive new higher-order approximations. The combination of Simultaneous-Approximation-Terms (SAT) and projection method is proposed for the treatment of interface conditions on a staggered grid. This reduces approximation stiffness and mitigates stationary wave modes of pure SAT approach. Also, energy-neutral discrete Coriolis terms operators are presented. The proposed approach is tested using the linearized shallow water equations on a rotating sphere, a testbed relevant for ocean and atmospheric dynamics. Numerical experiments show significant improvements in capturing wave dynamics compared to collocated SBP FD methods.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Low-Rank Approximation Strategies for Nonlinear Feedback Control Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the stabilization of dynamical systems in the infinite horizon optimal control setting using nonlinear feedback control based on State-Dependent Riccati Equations (SDREs). While effective, the practical implementation of such feedback strategies is often constrained by the high dimensionality of state spaces and the computational challenges associated with solving SDREs, particularly in parametric scenarios. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce the Dynamical Low-Rank Approximation (DLRA) methodology, which provides an efficient and accurate framework for addressing high-dimensional feedback control problems. DLRA dynamically constructs a compact, low-dimensional representation that evolves with the problem, enabling the simultaneous resolution of multiple parametric instances in real-time.
  We propose two novel algorithms to enhance numerical performances: the cascade-Newton-Kleinman method and Riccati-based DLRA (R-DLRA). The cascade-Newton-Kleinman method accelerates convergence by leveraging Riccati solutions from the nearby parameter or time instance, supported by a theoretical sensitivity analysis. R-DLRA integrates Riccati information into the DLRA basis construction to improve the quality of the solution. These approaches are validated through nonlinear one-dimensional and two-dimensional test cases showing transport-like behavior, demonstrating that R-DLRA outperforms standard DLRA and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition-based model order reduction in both speed and accuracy, offering a superior alternative to Full Order Model solutions.</description>

      <title>An efficient preconditioner for mixed-dimensional contact poromechanics based on the fixed stress splitting scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulation of fracture contact poromechanics is essential for various applications, including CO2 sequestration, geothermal energy production and underground gas storage. Modeling this problem accurately presents significant challenges due to the complex physics involved in strongly coupled poromechanics and frictional contact mechanics of fractures. The robustness and efficiency of the simulation heavily depends on a preconditioner for the linear solver, which addresses the Jacobian matrices arising from Newton's method in fully implicit time-stepping schemes. Developing an effective preconditioner is difficult because it must decouple three interdependent subproblems: momentum balance, fluid mass balance, and contact mechanics. The challenge is further compounded by the saddle-point structure of the contact mechanics problem, a result of the Augmented Lagrange formulation, which hinders the direct application of the well-established fixed stress approximation to decouple the poromechanics subproblem. In this work, we propose a preconditioner hat combines nested Schur complement approximations with a linear transformation, which addresses the singular nature of the contact mechanics subproblem. This approach extends the fixed stress scheme to both the matrix and fracture subdomains. We investigate analytically how the contact mechanics subproblem affects the convergence of the proposed fixed stress-based iterative scheme and demonstrate how it can be translated into a practical preconditioner. The scalability and robustness of the method are validated through a series of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Sampling Theory for Function Approximation with Numerical Redundancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of numerical rounding errors is often greatly simplified in the analytical treatment of mathematical problems, or even entirely separated from it. In sampling theory, for instance, it is standard to assume the availability of an orthonormal basis for computations, ensuring that numerical errors are negligible. In reality, however, this assumption is often unmet. In this paper, we discard it and demonstrate the advantages of integrating numerical insights more deeply into sampling theory. To clearly pinpoint when the numerical phenomena play a significant role, we introduce the concept of numerical redundancy. A set of functions is numerically redundant if it spans a lower-dimensional space when analysed numerically rather than analytically. This property makes it generally impossible to compute the best approximation of a function in its span using finite precision. In contrast, $\ell^2$-regularized approximations are computable and, therefore, form the foundation of many practical methods. Regularization generally reduces accuracy compared to the best approximation, but our analysis shows that there is a benefit: it also significantly reduces the amount of data needed for accurate approximation. Furthermore, we present a constructive method for optimally selecting data points for $L^2$-approximations, explicitly accounting for the effects of regularization. The results are illustrated for two common scenarios that lead to numerical redundancy: (1) approximations on irregular domains and (2) approximations that incorporate specific features of the function to be approximated. In doing so, we obtain new results on random sampling for Fourier extension frames. Finally, we establish that regularization is implicit in numerical orthogonalization of a numerically redundant set, indicating that its analysis cannot be bypassed in a much broader range of methods.</description>

      <title>An Error Analysis of Second Order Elliptic Optimal Control Problem via Hybrid Higher Order Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and analysis of a Hybrid High-Order (HHO) approximation for a distributed optimal control problem governed by the Poisson equation. We propose three distinct schemes to address unconstrained control problems and two schemes for constrained control problems. For the unconstrained control problem, while standard finite elements achieve a convergence rate of \( k+1 \) (with \( k \) representing the polynomial degree), our approach enhances this rate to \( k+2 \) by selecting the control from a carefully constructed reconstruction space. For the box-constrained problem, we demonstrate that using lowest-order elements (\( \mathbb{P}_0 \)) yields linear convergence, in contrast to finite element methods (FEM) that require linear elements to achieve comparable results. Furthermore, we derive a cubic convergence rate for control in the variational discretization scheme. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Wavelet Method for the Solution of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a high-order spacetime wavelet method for the solution of nonlinear partial differential equations with a user-prescribed accuracy. The technique utilizes wavelet theory with a priori error estimates to discretize the problem in both the spatial and temporal dimensions simultaneously. We also propose a novel wavelet-based recursive algorithm to reduce the system sensitivity stemming from steep initial and/or boundary conditions. The resulting nonlinear equations are solved using the Newton-Raphson method. We parallelize the construction of the tangent operator along with the solution of the system of algebraic equations. We perform rigorous verification studies using the nonlinear Burgers' equation. The application of the method is demonstrated solving Sod shock tube problem using the Navier-Stokes equations. The numerical results of the method reveal high-order convergence rates for the function as well as its spatial and temporal derivatives. We solve problems with steep gradients in both the spatial and temporal directions with a priori error estimates.</description>

      <title>Parrondo's effects with aperiodic protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02987v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the effectiveness of employing archetypal aperiodic sequencing -- namely Fibonacci, Thue-Morse, and Rudin-Shapiro -- on the Parrondian effect. From a capital gain perspective, our results show that these series do yield a Parrondo's Paradox with the Thue-Morse based strategy outperforming not only the other two aperiodic strategies but benchmark Parrondian games with random and periodical ($AABBAABB\ldots$) switching as well. The least performing of the three aperiodic strategies is the Rudin-Shapiro. To elucidate the underlying causes of these results, we analyze the cross-correlation between the capital generated by the switching protocols and that of the isolated losing games. This analysis reveals that a strong anticorrelation with both isolated games is typically required to achieve a robust manifestation of Parrondo's effect. We also study the influence of the sequencing on the capital using the lacunarity and persistence measures. In general, we observe that the switching protocols tend to become less performing in terms of the capital as one increases the persistence and thus approaches the features of an isolated losing game. For the (log-)lacunarity, a property related to heterogeneity, we notice that for small persistence (less than 0.5) the performance increases with the lacunarity with a maximum around 0.4. In respect of this, our work shows that the optimization of a switching protocol is strongly dependent on a fine-tuning between persistence and heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Analysis of kinematics of mechanisms containing revolute joints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinematics of rigid bodies can be analyzed in many different ways. The advantage of using Euler parameters is that the resulting equations are polynomials and hence computational algebra, in particular Gr\"obner bases, can be used to study them. The disadvantage of the Gr\"obner basis methods is that the computational complexity grows quite fast in the worst case in the number of variables and the degree of polynomials. In the present article we show how to simplify computations when the mechanism contains revolute joints. The idea is based on the fact that the ideal representing the constraints of the revolute joint is not prime. Choosing the appropriate prime component reduces significantly the computational cost. We illustrate the method by applying it to the well known Bennett's and Bricard's mechanisms, but it can be applied to any mechanism which has revolute joints.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a Shear beam model with suspenders in thermoelasticity of type III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct an analysis of a one-dimensional linear problem that describes the vibrations of a connected suspension bridge. In this model, the single-span roadbed is represented as a thermoelastic Shear beam without rotary inertia. We incorporate thermal dissipation into the transverse displacement equation, following Green and Naghdi's theory. Our work demonstrates the existence of a global solution by employing classical Faedo-Galerkin approximations and three a priori estimates. Furthermore, we establish exponential stability through the application of the energy method. For numerical study, we propose a spatial discretization using finite elements and a temporal discretization through an implicit Euler scheme. In doing so, we prove discrete stability properties and a priori error estimates for the discrete problem. To provide a practical dimension to our theoretical findings, we present a set of numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Mathematics of Digital Twins and Transfer Learning for PDE Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a digital twin (DT) of a physical system governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) as a model for real-time simulations and control of the system behavior under changing conditions. We construct DTs using the Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve Neural Network (KL-NN) surrogate model and transfer learning (TL). The surrogate model allows fast inference and differentiability with respect to control parameters for control and optimization. TL is used to retrain the model for new conditions with minimal additional data. We employ the moment equations to analyze TL and identify parameters that can be transferred to new conditions. The proposed analysis also guides the control variable selection in DT to facilitate efficient TL.
  For linear PDE problems, the non-transferable parameters in the KL-NN surrogate model can be exactly estimated from a single solution of the PDE corresponding to the mean values of the control variables under new target conditions. Retraining an ML model with a single solution sample is known as one-shot learning, and our analysis shows that the one-shot TL is exact for linear PDEs. For nonlinear PDE problems, transferring of any parameters introduces errors. For a nonlinear diffusion PDE model, we find that for a relatively small range of control variables, some surrogate model parameters can be transferred without introducing a significant error, some can be approximately estimated from the mean-field equation, and the rest can be found using a linear residual least square problem or an ordinary linear least square problem if a small labeled dataset for new conditions is available. The former approach results in a one-shot TL while the latter approach is an example of a few-shot TL. Both methods are approximate for the nonlinear PDEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new framework for statistical inference on Riemannian manifolds that achieves high-order accuracy, addressing the challenges posed by non-Euclidean parameter spaces frequently encountered in modern data science. Our approach leverages a novel and computationally efficient procedure to reach higher-order asymptotic precision. In particular, we develop a bootstrap algorithm on Riemannian manifolds that is both computationally efficient and accurate for hypothesis testing and confidence region construction. Although locational hypothesis testing can be reformulated as a standard Euclidean problem, constructing high-order accurate confidence regions necessitates careful treatment of manifold geometry. To this end, we establish high-order asymptotics under a fixed normal chart centered at the true parameter, thereby enabling precise expansions that incorporate curvature effects. We demonstrate the versatility of this framework across various manifold settings-including spheres, the Stiefel manifold, fixed-rank matrices manifolds, and rank-one tensor manifolds-and, for Euclidean submanifolds, introduce a class of projection-like coordinate charts with strong consistency properties. Finally, numerical studies confirm the practical merits of the proposed procedure.</description>

      <title>OpenGERT: Open Source Automated Geometry Extraction with Geometric and Electromagnetic Sensitivity Analyses for Ray-Tracing Propagation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate RF propagation modeling in urban environments is critical for developing digital spectrum twins and optimizing wireless communication systems. We introduce OpenGERT, an open-source automated Geometry Extraction tool for Ray Tracing, which collects and processes terrain and building data from OpenStreetMap, Microsoft Global ML Building Footprints, and USGS elevation data. Using the Blender Python API, it creates detailed urban models for high-fidelity simulations with NVIDIA Sionna RT. We perform sensitivity analyses to examine how variations in building height, position, and electromagnetic material properties affect ray-tracing accuracy. Specifically, we present pairwise dispersion plots of channel statistics (path gain, mean excess delay, delay spread, link outage, and Rician K-factor) and investigate how their sensitivities change with distance from transmitters. We also visualize the variance of these statistics for selected transmitter locations to gain deeper insights. Our study covers Munich and Etoile scenes, each with 10 transmitter locations. For each location, we apply five types of perturbations: material, position, height, height-position, and all combined, with 50 perturbations each. Results show that small changes in permittivity and conductivity minimally affect channel statistics, whereas variations in building height and position significantly alter all statistics, even with noise standard deviations of 1 meter in height and 0.4 meters in position. These findings highlight the importance of precise environmental modeling for accurate propagation predictions, essential for digital spectrum twins and advanced communication networks. The code for geometry extraction and sensitivity analyses is available at github.com/serhatadik/OpenGERT/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an enhanced zeroth-order stochastic Frank-Wolfe framework to address constrained finite-sum optimization problems, a structure prevalent in large-scale machine-learning applications. Our method introduces a novel double variance reduction framework that effectively reduces the gradient approximation variance induced by zeroth-order oracles and the stochastic sampling variance from finite-sum objectives. By leveraging this framework, our algorithm achieves significant improvements in query efficiency, making it particularly well-suited for high-dimensional optimization tasks. Specifically, for convex objectives, the algorithm achieves a query complexity of O(d \sqrt{n}/\epsilon ) to find an epsilon-suboptimal solution, where d is the dimensionality and n is the number of functions in the finite-sum objective. For non-convex objectives, it achieves a query complexity of O(d^{3/2}\sqrt{n}/\epsilon^2 ) without requiring the computation ofd partial derivatives at each iteration. These complexities are the best known among zeroth-order stochastic Frank-Wolfe algorithms that avoid explicit gradient calculations. Empirical experiments on convex and non-convex machine learning tasks, including sparse logistic regression, robust classification, and adversarial attacks on deep networks, validate the computational efficiency and scalability of our approach. Our algorithm demonstrates superior performance in both convergence rate and query complexity compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Estimating quantum relative entropies on quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum relative entropy, a quantum generalization of the well-known Kullback-Leibler divergence, serves as a fundamental measure of the distinguishability between quantum states and plays a pivotal role in quantum information science. Despite its importance, efficiently estimating quantum relative entropy between two quantum states on quantum computers remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose the first quantum algorithm for estimating quantum relative entropy and Petz R\'{e}nyi divergence from two unknown quantum states on quantum computers, addressing open problems highlighted in [Phys. Rev. A 109, 032431 (2024)] and [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 70, 5653-5680 (2024)]. This is achieved by combining quadrature approximations of relative entropies, the variational representation of quantum f-divergences, and a new technique for parameterizing Hermitian polynomial operators to estimate their traces with quantum states. Notably, the circuit size of our algorithm is at most 2n+1 with n being the number of qubits in the quantum states and it is directly applicable to distributed scenarios, where quantum states to be compared are hosted on cross-platform quantum computers. We validate our algorithm through numerical simulations, laying the groundwork for its future deployment on quantum hardware devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.04443v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The finite element method offers attractive methods for the numerical solution of coupled field problems arising in sensors and actuator simulations of various physical domains, like electrodynamics, mechanics, and thermodynamics. With this application perspective and being open, accessible, and fast implementations are possible, openCFS was launched in 2020. It provides an open-source framework for implementing partial differential equations using the finite element method. In particular, the acoustic module is part of active development, including several key methods. These methods include the perfectly-matched layer technique, non-confirming interface formulations, Lagrangian basis function, Legendre basis functions, spectral element formulations, a nodal element type, edge-based element type (aeroacoustic post-processing), absorbing boundary conditions, frequency dependent-material for time-harmonic and time-dependent simulations. Time-dependent simulations, time-harmonic simulations, and eigenvalue simulations are supported. Several variants of acoustic equations are implemented, including the relevant source terms and wave operators for aeroacoustics. The package includes rotating domains and non-conforming interfaces for fan noise simulations. It also contains an API to the Python3 package pyCFS. This paper presents openCFS with a focus on the acoustic module.</description>

      <title>Measure transfer via stochastic slicing and matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies iterative schemes for measure transfer and approximation problems, which are defined through a slicing-and-matching procedure. Similar to the sliced Wasserstein distance, these schemes benefit from the availability of closed-form solutions for the one-dimensional optimal transport problem and the associated computational advantages. While such schemes have already been successfully utilized in data science applications, not too many results on their convergence are available. The main contribution of this paper is an almost sure convergence proof for stochastic slicing-and-matching schemes. The proof builds on an interpretation as a stochastic gradient descent scheme on the Wasserstein space. Numerical examples on step-wise image morphing are demonstrated as well.</description>

      <title>Generalized Optimal AMG Convergence Theory for Nonsymmetric and Indefinite Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algebraic multigrid (AMG) is known to be an effective solver for many sparse symmetric positive definite (SPD) linear systems. For SPD systems, the convergence theory of AMG is well-understood in terms of the $A$-norm, but in a nonsymmetric setting, such an energy norm is non-existent. For this reason, convergence of AMG for nonsymmetric systems of equations remains an open area of research. A particular aspect missing from theory of nonsymmetric and indefinite AMG is the incorporation of general relaxation schemes. In the SPD setting, the classical form of optimal AMG interpolation provides a useful insight in determining the best possible two-grid convergence rate of a method based on an arbitrary symmetrized relaxation scheme. In this work, we discuss a generalization of the optimal AMG convergence theory targeting nonsymmetric problems, using a certain matrix-induced orthogonality of the left and right eigenvectors of a generalized eigenvalue problem relating the system matrix and relaxation operator. We show that using this generalization of the optimal convergence theory, one can obtain a measure of the spectral radius of the two grid error transfer operator that is mathematically equivalent to the derivation in the SPD setting for optimal interpolation, which instead uses norms. In addition, this generalization of the optimal AMG convergence theory can be further extended for symmetric indefinite problems, such as those arising from saddle point systems so that one can obtain a precise convergence rate of the resulting two-grid method based on optimal interpolation. We provide supporting numerical examples of the convergence theory for nonsymmetric advection-diffusion problems, two-dimensional Dirac equation motivated by $\gamma_5$-symmetry, and the mixed Darcy flow problem corresponding to a saddle point system.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new numerical domain decomposition method for solving elliptic equations on compact Riemannian manifolds. One advantage of this method is its ability to bypass the need for global triangulations or grids on the manifolds. Additionally, it features a highly parallel iterative scheme. To verify its efficacy, we conduct numerical experiments on some $4$-dimensional manifolds without and with boundary.</description>

      <title>Improved weak convergence for the long time simulation of Mean-field Langevin equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the weak convergence behaviour of the Leimkuhler--Matthews method, a non-Markovian Euler-type scheme with the same computational cost as the Euler scheme, for the approximation of the stationary distribution of a one-dimensional McKean--Vlasov Stochastic Differential Equation (MV-SDE). The particular class under study is known as mean-field (overdamped) Langevin equations (MFL). We provide weak and strong error results for the scheme in both finite and infinite time. We work under a strong convexity assumption.
  Based on a careful analysis of the variation processes and the Kolmogorov backward equation for the particle system associated with the MV-SDE, we show that the method attains a higher-order approximation accuracy in the long-time limit (of weak order convergence rate $3/2$) than the standard Euler method (of weak order $1$). While we use an interacting particle system (IPS) to approximate the MV-SDE, we show the convergence rate is independent of the dimension of the IPS and this includes establishing uniform-in-time decay estimates for moments of the IPS, the Kolmogorov backward equation and their derivatives. The theoretical findings are supported by numerical tests.</description>

      <title>Preconditioning of the generalized Stokes problem arising from the approximation of the time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper compares standard iterative methods for solving the generalized Stokes problem arising from the time and space approximation of the time-dependent incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Various preconditioning techniques are considered (Schur complement, fully coupled system, with and without augmented Lagrangian). One investigates whether these methods can compete with traditional pressure-correction and velocity-correction methods in terms of throughput (number of degrees of freedom per time step per core per second). Numerical tests on fine unstructured meshes (68 millions degrees of freedoms) demonstrate GMRES/CG convergence rates that are independent of the mesh size and improve with the Reynolds number for most methods. Three conclusions are drawn: (1) Whether solving the pressure Schur complement or the fully coupled system does not make any significant difference in terms of throughput. (2) Although very good parallel scalability is observed for the augmented Lagrangian method, the best throughput is achieved without using the augmented Lagrangian formulation. (3) The throughput of all the methods tested in the paper are on average 25 times slower than that of traditional pressure-correction and velocity-correction methods. Hence, although all these methods are very efficient for solving steady state problems, none of them is unfortunately competitive for solving time-dependent problems.</description>

      <title>Parametric holomorphy of elliptic eigenvalue problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of parameter-dependent partial differential equations (parametric PDEs) with countably many parameters has been actively studied for the last few decades. In particular, it has been well known that a certain type of parametric holomorphy of the PDE solutions allows the application of deep neural networks without encountering the curse of dimensionality. This paper aims to propose a general framework for verifying the desired parametric holomorphy by utilizing the bounds on parametric derivatives. The framework is illustrated with examples of parametric elliptic eigenvalue problems (EVPs), encompassing both linear and semilinear cases. As the results, it will be shown that the ground eigenpairs have the desired holomorphy. Furthermore, under the same conditions, improved bounds for the mixed derivatives of the ground eigenpairs are derived. These bounds are well known to take a crucial role in the error analysis of quasi-Monte Carlo methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The randomized singular value decomposition proposed in [25] has certainly become one of the most well-established randomization-based algorithms in numerical linear algebra. The key ingredient of the entire procedure is the computation of a subspace which is close to the column space of the target matrix $\mathbf{A}$ up to a certain probabilistic confidence. In this paper we employ a modification to the standard randomized SVD procedure which leads, in general, to better approximations to $\text{Range}(\mathbf{A})$ at the same computational cost. To this end, we explicitly construct information from the row space of $\mathbf{A}$ enhancing the quality of the approximation. We derive novel error bounds which improve over existing results for $\mathbf{A}$ having important gaps in its singular values. We also observe that very few pieces of information from $\text{Range}(\mathbf{A}^T)$ are indeed necessary. We thus design a variant of this algorithm equipped with a subsampling step which largely increases the efficiency of the procedure while attaining competitive accuracy records. Our findings are supported by both theoretical analysis and numerical results.</description>

      <title>Slicing of Radial Functions: a Dimension Walk in the Fourier Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computations in high-dimensional spaces can often be realized only approximately, using a certain number of projections onto lower dimensional subspaces or sampling from distributions. In this paper, we are interested in pairs of real-valued functions $(F,f)$ on $[0,\infty)$ that are related by the projection/slicing formula $F (\| x \|) = \mathbb E_{\xi} \big[ f \big(|\langle x,\xi \rangle| \big) \big]$ for $x\in\mathbb R^d$, where the expectation value is taken over uniformly distributed directions in $\mathbb R^d$. While it is known that $F$ can be obtained from $f$ by an Abel-like integral formula, we construct conversely $f$ from given $F$ using their Fourier transforms. First, we consider the relation between $F$ and $f$ for radial functions $F(\| \cdot\| )$ that are Fourier transforms of $L^1$ functions. Besides $d$- and one-dimensional Fourier transforms, it relies on a rotation operator, an averaging operator and a multiplication operator to manage the walk from $d$ to one dimension in the Fourier space. Then, we generalize the results to tempered distributions, where we are mainly interested in radial regular tempered distributions. Based on Bochner's theorem, this includes positive definite functions $F(\| \cdot\| )$ and, by the theory of fractional derivatives, also functions $F$ whose derivative of order $\lfloor d/2\rfloor$ is slowly increasing and continuous.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this research, we address Darcy flow problems with random permeability using iterative solvers, enhanced by a two-grid preconditioner based on a generalized multiscale prolongation operator, which has been demonstrated to be stable for high contrast profiles. To circumvent the need for repeatedly solving spectral problems with varying coefficients, we harness deep learning techniques to expedite the construction of the generalized multiscale prolongation operator. Considering linear transformations on multiscale basis have no impact on the performance of the preconditioner, we devise a loss function by the coefficient-based distance between subspaces instead of the plain $l^2$-norm of the difference of the corresponding multiscale bases. We discover that leveraging the inherent symmetry in the local spectral problem can effectively accelerate the neural network training process. In scenarios where training data are limited, we utilize the Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion to augment the dataset. Extensive numerical experiments with various types of random coefficient models are exhibited, showing that the proposed method can significantly reduce the time required to generate the prolongation operator while maintaining the original efficiency of the two-grid preconditioner. Notably, the neural network demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, as evidenced by its satisfactory performance on unseen random permeability fields.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a large-scale parallel solver, specifically designed to tackle the challenges of solving high-dimensional and high-contrast linear systems in heat transfer topology optimization. The solver incorporates an interpolation technique to accelerate convergence in high-resolution domains, along with a multiscale multigrid preconditioner to handle complex coefficient fields with significant contrast. All modules of the optimization solver are implemented on a high performance computing cluster by the PETSc numerical library. Through a series of numerical investigations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing convergence and robustness during the optimization process, particularly in high-contrast scenarios with resolutions up to $1024^3$. Our performance results indicate that the proposed preconditioner achieves over $2\times$ speedup against the default algebraic multigrid in PETSc for high-contrast cases.</description>

      <title>Generalized Fractional Repetition Codes for Binary Coded Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.10484v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the gradient coding and coded matrix multiplication problems in distributed optimization and coded computing. We present a numerically stable binary coding method which overcomes the drawbacks of the \textit{Fractional Repetition Coding} gradient coding method proposed by Tandon et al., and can also be leveraged by coded computing networks whose servers are of heterogeneous nature. Specifically, we propose a construction for fractional repetition gradient coding; while ensuring that the generator matrix remains close to perfectly balanced for any set of coded parameters, as well as a low complexity decoding step. The proposed binary encoding avoids operations over the real and complex numbers which are inherently numerically unstable, thereby enabling numerically stable distributed encodings of the partial gradients. We then make connections between gradient coding and coded matrix multiplication. Specifically, we show that any gradient coding scheme can be extended to coded matrix multiplication. Furthermore, we show how the proposed binary gradient coding scheme can be used to construct two different coded matrix multiplication schemes, each achieving different trade-offs.</description>

      <title>Wellposedness, exponential ergodicity and numerical approximation of fully super-linear McKean--Vlasov SDEs and associated particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05133v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of McKean--Vlasov Stochastic Differential Equations (MV-SDEs) with drifts and diffusions having super-linear growth in measure and space -- the maps have general polynomial form but also satisfy a certain monotonicity condition. The combination of the drift's super-linear growth in measure (by way of a convolution) and the super-linear growth in space and measure of the diffusion coefficient requires novel technical elements in order to obtain the main results. We establish wellposedness, propagation of chaos (PoC), and under further assumptions on the model parameters, we show an exponential ergodicity property alongside the existence of an invariant distribution. No differentiability or non-degeneracy conditions are required.
  Further, we present a particle system based Euler-type split-step scheme (SSM) for the simulation of this type of MV-SDEs. The scheme attains, in stepsize, the strong error rate $1/2$ in the non-path-space root-mean-square error metric and we demonstrate the property of mean-square contraction. Our results are illustrated by numerical examples including: estimation of PoC rates across dimensions, preservation of periodic phase-space, and the observation that taming appears to be not a suitable method unless strong dissipativity is present.</description>

      <title>Symmetry &amp; Critical Points for Symmetric Tensor Decomposition Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07886v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the nonconvex optimization problem associated with the decomposition of a real symmetric tensor into a sum of rank one terms. Use is made of the rich symmetry structure to construct infinite families of critical points represented by Puiseux series in the problem dimension, and so obtain precise analytic estimates on the value of the objective function and the Hessian spectrum. The results allow an analytic characterization of various obstructions to using local optimization methods, revealing in particular a complex array of saddles and minima differing by their symmetry, structure and analytic properties. A~desirable phenomenon, occurring for all critical points considered, concerns the number of negative Hessian eigenvalues increasing with the value of the objective function. Our approach makes use of Newton polyhedra as well as results from real algebraic geometry, notably the Curve Selection Lemma, to determine the extremal character of degenerate critical points, establishing in particular the existence of infinite families of third-order saddles which can significantly slow down the optimization process.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification for charge transport in GNRs through particle Galerkin methods for the semiclassical Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate some issues related to the quantification of uncertainties associated with the electrical properties of graphene nanoribbons. The approach is suited to understand the effects of missing information linked to the difficulty of fixing some material parameters, such as the band gap, and the strength of the applied electric field. In particular, we focus on the extension of particle Galerkin methods for kinetic equations in the case of the semiclassical Boltzmann equation for charge transport in graphene nanoribbons with uncertainties. To this end, we develop an efficient particle scheme which allows us to parallelize the computation and then, after a suitable generalization of the scheme to the case of random inputs, we present a Galerkin reformulation of the particle dynamics, obtained by means of a generalized Polynomial Chaos approach, which allows the reconstruction of the kinetic distribution. As a consequence, the proposed particle-based scheme preserves the physical properties and the positivity of the distribution function also in the presence of a complex scattering in the transport equation of electrons. The impact of the uncertainty of the band gap and applied field on the electrical current is analysed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuits for the heat equation with physical boundary conditions via Schrodingerisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15895v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the explicit design of quantum circuits for quantum simulation of partial differential equations (PDEs) with physical boundary conditions. These equations and/or their discretized forms usually do not evolve via unitary dynamics, thus are not suitable for quantum simulation. Boundary conditions (either time-dependent or independent) make the problem more difficult. To tackle this challenge, the Schrodingerisation method can be employed, which converts linear partial and ordinary differential equations with non-unitary dynamics into systems of Schrodinger-type equations, via the so-called warped phase transformation that maps the equation into one higher dimension. Despite advancements in Schrodingerisation techniques, the explicit implementation of quantum circuits for solving general PDEs, especially with physical boundary conditions, remains underdeveloped. We present two methods for handling the inhomogeneous terms arising from time-dependent physical boundary conditions. One approach utilizes Duhamel's principle to express the solution in integral form and employs linear combination of unitaries (LCU) for coherent state preparation. Another method applies an augmentation to transform the inhomogeneous problem into a homogeneous one. We then apply the quantum simulation technique from [CJL23] to transform the resulting non-autonomous system to an autonomous system in one higher dimension. We provide detailed implementations of these two methods and conduct a comprehensive complexity analysis in terms of queries to the time evolution input oracle.</description>

      <title>The effective use of BLAS interface for implementation of finite-element ADER-DG and finite-volume ADER-WENO methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical methods of the ADER family, in particular finite-element ADER-DG and finite-volume ADER-WENO methods, are among the most accurate numerical methods for solving quasilinear PDE systems. The internal structure of ADER-DG and ADER-WENO numerical methods contains a large number of basic linear algebra operations related to matrix multiplications. The main interface of software libraries for matrix multiplications for high-performance computing is BLAS. This paper presents an effective method for integration the standard functions of the BLAS interface into the implementation of these numerical methods. The calculated matrices are small matrices; at the same time, the proposed implementation makes it possible to effectively use existing JIT technologies. The proposed approach immediately operates on AoS, which makes it possible to efficiently calculate flux, source and non-conservative terms without need to carry out transposition. The obtained computational costs demonstrated that the effective implementation, based on the use of the JIT functions of the BLAS, outperformed both the implementation based on the general BLAS functions and the vanilla implementations by several orders of magnitude. At the same time, the complexity of developing an implementation based on the approach proposed in this work does not exceed the complexity of developing a vanilla implementation.</description>

      <title>Hammerstein equations for sparse random matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding eigenvalue distributions for a number of sparse random matrix ensembles can be reduced to solving nonlinear integral equations of the Hammerstein type. While a systematic mathematical theory of such equations exists, it has not been previously applied to sparse matrix problems. We close this gap in the literature by showing how one can employ numerical solutions of Hammerstein equations to accurately recover the spectra of adjacency matrices and Laplacians of random graphs. While our treatment focuses on random graphs for concreteness, the methodology has broad applications to more general sparse random matrices.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning on Multi-Dimensional Data: A Novel Approach to Neural Network-Based Surrogate Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of efficient surrogates for partial differential equations (PDEs) is a critical step towards scalable modeling of complex, multiscale systems-of-systems. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have gained popularity as the basis for such surrogate models due to their success in capturing high-dimensional input-output mappings and the negligible cost of a forward pass. However, the high cost of generating training data -- typically via classical numerical solvers -- raises the question of whether these models are worth pursuing over more straightforward alternatives with well-established theoretical foundations, such as Monte Carlo methods. To reduce the cost of data generation, we propose training a CNN surrogate model on a mixture of numerical solutions to both the $d$-dimensional problem and its ($d-1$)-dimensional approximation, taking advantage of the efficiency savings guaranteed by the curse of dimensionality. We demonstrate our approach on a multiphase flow test problem, using transfer learning to train a dense fully-convolutional encoder-decoder CNN on the two classes of data. Numerical results from a sample uncertainty quantification task demonstrate that our surrogate model outperforms Monte Carlo with several times the data generation budget.</description>

      <title>Sinkhorn Algorithm for Sequentially Composed Optimal Transports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03120v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sinkhorn algorithm is the de-facto standard approximation algorithm for optimal transport, which has been applied to a variety of applications, including image processing and natural language processing. In theory, the proof of its convergence follows from the convergence of the Sinkhorn--Knopp algorithm for the matrix scaling problem, and Altschuler et al. show that its worst-case time complexity is in near-linear time. Very recently, sequentially composed optimal transports were proposed by Watanabe and Isobe as a hierarchical extension of optimal transports. In this paper, we present an efficient approximation algorithm, namely Sinkhorn algorithm for sequentially composed optimal transports, for its entropic regularization. Furthermore, we present a theoretical analysis of the Sinkhorn algorithm, namely (i) its exponential convergence to the optimal solution with respect to the Hilbert pseudometric, and (ii) a worst-case complexity analysis for the case of one sequential composition.</description>
