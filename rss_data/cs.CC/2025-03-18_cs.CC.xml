      <title>Semi-Streaming Algorithms for Graph Property Certification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the {\em certification} of solutions to graph problems when access to the input is restricted. This topic has received a lot of attention in the distributed computing setting, and we introduce it here in the context of \emph{streaming} algorithms, where the input is too large to be stored in memory.
  Given a graph property $\mbox{P}$, a \emph{streaming certification scheme} for $\mbox{P}$ is a \emph{prover-verifier} pair where the prover is a computationally unlimited but non-trustable oracle, and the verifier is a streaming algorithm. For any input graph, the prover provides the verifier with a \emph{certificate}. The verifier then receives the input graph as a stream of edges in an adversarial order, and must check whether the certificate is indeed a \emph{proof} that the input graph satisfies $\mbox{P}$. The main complexity measure for a streaming certification scheme is its \emph{space complexity}, defined as the sum of the size of the certificate provided by the oracle, and of the memory space required by the verifier.
  We give streaming certification schemes for several graph properties, including maximum matching, diameter, degeneracy, and coloring, with space complexity matching the requirement of \emph{semi-streaming}, i.e., with space complexity $O(n\,\mbox{polylog}\, n)$ for $n$-node graphs. All these problems do {\em not} admit semi-streaming algorithms, showing that also in the (semi) streaming setting, certification is sometimes easier than calculation (like $NP$). For each of these properties, we provide upper and lower bounds on the space complexity of the corresponding certification schemes, many being tight up to logarithmic multiplicative factors. We also show that some graph properties are hard for streaming certification, in the sense that they cannot be certified in semi-streaming, as they require $\Omega(n^2)$-bit certificates.</description>

      <title>Deciding if a DAG is Interesting is Hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \emph{interestingness score} of a directed path $\Pi = e_1, e_2, e_3, \dots, e_\ell$ in an edge-weighted directed graph $G$ is defined as $\texttt{score}(\Pi) := \sum_{i=1}^\ell w(e_i) \cdot \log{(i+1)}$, where $w(e_i)$ is the weight of the edge $e_i$. We consider two optimization problems that arise in the analysis of Mapper graphs, which is a powerful tool in topological data analysis. In the IP problem, the objective is to find a collection $\mathcal{P}$ of edge-disjoint paths in $G$ with the maximum total interestingness score. %; that is, two raised to the power of the sum of the weights of the paths in $\mathcal{P}$. For $k \in \mathbb{N}$, the $k$-IP problem is a variant of the IP problem with the extra constraint that each path in $\mathcal{P}$ must have exactly $k$ edges. Kalyanaraman, Kamruzzaman, and Krishnamoorthy (Journal of Computational Geometry, 2019) claim that both IP and $k$-IP (for $k \geq 3$) are NP-complete. We point out some inaccuracies in their proofs. Furthermore, we show that both problems are NP-hard in directed acyclic graphs.</description>

      <title>On Some Fundamental Problems for Multi-Agent Systems Over Multilayer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many researchers have considered multi-agent systems over single-layer networks as models for studying diffusion phenomena. Since real-world networks involve connections between agents with different semantics (e.g., family member, friend, colleague), the study of multi-agent systems over multilayer networks has assumed importance. Our focus is on one class of multi-agent system models over multilayer networks, namely multilayer synchronous dynamical systems (MSyDSs). We study several fundamental problems for this model. We establish properties of the phase spaces of MSyDSs and bring out interesting differences between single-layer and multilayer dynamical systems. We show that, in general, the problem of determining whether two given MSyDSs are inequivalent is NP-complete. This hardness result holds even when the only difference between the two systems is the local function at just one node in one layer. We also present efficient algorithms for the equivalence problem for restricted versions of MSyDSs (e.g., systems where each local function is a bounded-threshold function, systems where the number of layers is fixed and each local function is symmetric). In addition, we investigate the expressive power of MSyDSs based on the number of layers. In particular, we examine conditions under which a system with k &gt;= 2 layers has an equivalent system with k-1 or fewer layers.</description>

      <title>Problems in NP can Admit Double-Exponential Lower Bounds when Parameterized by Treewidth or Vertex Cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08149v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Treewidth (tw) is an important parameter that, when bounded, yields tractability for many problems. For example, graph problems expressible in Monadic Second Order (MSO) logic and QUANTIFIED SAT or, more generally, QUANTIFIED CSP, are FPT parameterized by the tw of the input's (primal) graph plus the length of the MSO-formula [Courcelle, Information &amp; Computation 1990] and the quantifier rank [Chen, ECAI 2004], resp. The algorithms from these (meta-)results have running times whose dependence on tw is a tower of exponents. A conditional lower bound by Fichte et al. [LICS 2020] shows that, for QUANTIFIED SAT, the height of this tower is equal to the number of quantifier alternations. Lower bounds showing that at least double-exponential factors in the running time are necessary are rare: there are very few (for tw and vertex cover vc parameterizations) and they are for problems that are complete for #NP, $\Sigma_2^p$, $\Pi_2^p$, or higher levels of the polynomial hierarchy.
  We show, for the first time, that it is not necessary to go higher up in the polynomial hierarchy to obtain such lower bounds. We design a novel, yet simple versatile technique based on Sperner families to obtain such lower bounds and apply it to 3 problems: METRIC DIMENSION, STRONG METRIC DIMENSION, and GEODETIC SET. We prove that they do not admit $2^{2^{o(tw)}} \cdot n^{O(1)}$-time algorithms, even on bounded diameter graphs, unless the ETH fails. For STRONG METRIC DIMENSION, the lower bound holds even for vc. We complement our lower bounds with matching upper bounds.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Complexity of (d,r)-Domination via Modular Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rise of social media, misinformation has significant negative effects on the decision-making of individuals, organizations and communities within society. Identifying and mitigating the spread of fake information is a challenging issue. We consider a generalization of the Domination problem that can be used to detect a set of individuals who, through an awareness process, can prevent the spreading of fake narratives. The considered problem, named \textsc{$(d,r)$-Domination} generalizes both distance and multiple domination. We study the parameterized complexity of the problem according to standard and structural parameters. We give fixed-parameter algorithms as well as polynomial compressions/kernelizations for some variants of the problem and parameter combinations.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Summation of Multivariate Rational Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.06968v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symbolic summation as an active research topic of symbolic computation provides efficient algorithmic tools for evaluating and simplifying different types of sums arising from mathematics, computer science, physics and other areas. Most of existing algorithms in symbolic summation are mainly applicable to the problem with univariate inputs. A long-term project in symbolic computation is to develop theories, algorithms and software for the symbolic summation of multivariate functions. This paper will give complete solutions to two challenging problems in symbolic summation of multivariate rational functions, namely the rational summability problem and the existence problem of telescopers for multivariate rational functions. Our approach is based on the structure of Sato's isotropy groups of polynomials, which enables us to reduce the problems to testing the shift equivalence of polynomials. Our results provide a complete solution to the discrete analogue of Picard's problem on differential forms and can be used to detect the applicability of the Wilf-Zeilberger method to multivariate rational functions.</description>

      <title>Metric Dimension and Geodetic Set Parameterized by Vertex Cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, a subset $S\subseteq V(G)$ is called a resolving set of $G$ if, for any two vertices $u,v\in V(G)$, there exists a vertex $w\in S$ such that $d(w,u)\neq d(w,v)$. The Metric Dimension problem takes as input a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices and a positive integer $k$, and asks whether there exists a resolving set of size at most $k$. In another metric-based graph problem, Geodetic Set, the input is a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, and the objective is to determine whether there exists a subset $S\subseteq V(G)$ of size at most $k$ such that, for any vertex $u \in V(G)$, there are two vertices $s_1, s_2 \in S$ such that $u$ lies on a shortest path from $s_1$ to $s_2$.
  These two classical problems turn out to be intractable with respect to the natural parameter, i.e., the solution size, as well as most structural parameters, including the feedback vertex set number and pathwidth. Some of the very few existing tractable results state that they are both FPT with respect to the vertex cover number $vc$.
  More precisely, we observe that both problems admit an FPT algorithm running in time $2^{\mathcal{O}(vc^2)}\cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$, and a kernelization algorithm that outputs a kernel with $2^{\mathcal{O}(vc)}$ vertices. We prove that unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis fails, Metric Dimension and Geodetic Set, even on graphs of bounded diameter, neither admit an FPT algorithm running in time $2^{o(vc^2)}\cdot n^{\mathcal(1)}$, nor a kernelization algorithm that reduces the solution size and outputs a kernel with $2^{o(vc)}$ vertices. The versatility of our technique enables us to apply it to both these problems.
  We only know of one other problem in the literature that admits such a tight lower bound. Similarly, the list of known problems with exponential lower bounds on the number of vertices in kernelized instances is very short.</description>

      <title>Improving Merge Sort and Quick Sort Performance by Utilizing Alphadev's Sorting Networks as Base Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05934v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work by Google DeepMind introduced assembly-optimized sorting networks that achieve faster performance for small fixed-size arrays (3-8). In this research, we investigate the integration of these networks as base cases in classical divide-and-conquer sorting algorithms, specifically Merge Sort and Quick Sort, to leverage these efficient sorting networks for small subarrays generated during the recursive process. We conducted benchmarks with 11 different optimization configurations and compared them to classical Merge Sort and Quick Sort. We tested the configurations with random, sorted and nearly sorted arrays.
  Our optimized Merge Sort, using a configuration of three sorting networks (sizes 6, 7, and 8), achieves at least 1.5x speedup for random and nearly sorted arrays, and at least 2x speedup for sorted arrays, in comparison to classical Merge Sort. This optimized Merge Sort surpasses both classical Quick Sort and similarly optimized Quick Sort variants when sorting random arrays of size 10,000 and larger.
  When comparing our optimized Quick Sort to classical Quick Sort, we observe a 1.5x speedup using the 3-to-5 configuration on sorted arrays of size 10,000. The 6-to-8 configuration maintains a consistent 1.5x improvement across sorted arrays from 25,000 to 1 million elements. Our findings demonstrate the potential of integrating AI-optimized sorting networks to enhance the performance of classical sorting algorithms.</description>
