      <title>Relational bulk reconstruction from modular flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entanglement wedge reconstruction paradigm in AdS/CFT states that for a bulk qudit within the entanglement wedge of a boundary subregion $\bar{A}$, operators acting on the bulk qudit can be reconstructed as CFT operators on $\bar{A}$. This naturally fits within the framework of quantum error correction, with the CFT states containing the bulk qudit forming a code protected against the erasure of the boundary subregion $A$. In this paper, we set up and study a framework for relational bulk reconstruction in holography: given two code subspaces both protected against erasure of the boundary region $A$, the goal is to relate the operator reconstructions between the two spaces. To accomplish this, we assume that the two code subspaces are smoothly connected by a one-parameter family of codes all protected against the erasure of $A$, and that the maximally-entangled states on these codes are all full-rank. We argue that such code subspaces can naturally be constructed in holography in a "measurement-based" setting. In this setting, we derive a flow equation for the operator reconstruction of a fixed code subspace operator using modular theory which can, in principle, be integrated to relate the reconstructed operators all along the flow. We observe a striking resemblance between our formulas for relational bulk reconstruction and the infinite-time limit of Connes cocycle flow, and take some steps towards making this connection more rigorous. We also provide alternative derivations of our reconstruction formulas in terms of a canonical reconstruction map we call the modular reflection operator.</description>

      <title>Constructing Non-Relativistic AdS$_5$/CFT$_4$ Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a new type of holographic correspondence between non-relativistic string theory in String Newton-Cartan AdS$_5\times$S$^5$ and Galilean Electrodynamics supplemented with 5 uncharged massless free scalar fields living on the 3+1 dimensional Penrose conformal boundary. In our derivation, we start with Maldacena's setting of a stack of $N$ coincident D3-branes and we show that the near-horizon/decoupling limit commutes with the non-relativistic limit, giving a unique answer both from the gravity and gauge theory perspectives. As a first evidence, we systematically compute the Killing vectors on the string theory side, and find that they match the on-shell symmetries of the dual gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Marginally deformed AdS$_5$/CFT$_4$ and spindle-like orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study marginal deformations of ${\cal N}=2$, $d=4$ long linear quiver CFTs using the holographic description. We find a two-parameter family of AdS$_5$ solutions that generically break all of supersymmetry, but preserve ${\cal N}=1$ for a particular tuning of the parameters. We study the G-structure of the ${\cal N}=2$ ``parent'' and the ${\cal N}=1$ backgrounds and carefully discuss the quantisation of charges in all cases. For the ${\cal N}=1$ and ${\cal N}=0$ cases, a picture emerges with ``branes" back-reacted on either a spindle or its higher dimensional analogue. Comments on the marginally deformed dual CFTs are given, together with the study of some observables.</description>

      <title>Rigid Vacua with Brane Supersymmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct new string vacua featuring Brane Supersymmetry Breaking, based on $T^4/\mathbb{Z}_N$ orientifolds with $\text{O}5_+$ planes and $\overline{\text{D}5}$ branes. Differently from the original construction, in these vacua the cancellation of twisted R-R charges of D-branes and orientifold planes is achieved in a non-trivial way, and results in rigid configurations with few open-string moduli, which highly restrict the possible deformations of the model. The breaking of supersymmetry and, consequently, the non-vanishing untwisted and twisted NS-NS tadpoles, generates a rich potential both for the dilaton and the blown-up moduli. We also uncover the stringy origin of the $J$ form entering the gauge kinetic functions in the low-energy effective action, and display its relation to the NS-NS tadpoles for the scalars in the tensor multiplets. As a result, the $J$ form can be consistently identified also when supersymmetry is broken, thus solving an embarrassing puzzle related to its very existence. We also discuss the unitarity constraints for one-dimensional defects in these vacua, where the Ka$\check{\text{c}}$-Moody algebra for D9 and $\overline{\text{D}5}$ can be realised both in the left-moving and right-moving sectors.</description>

      <title>Kazhdan-Lusztig Correspondence for Vertex Operator Superalgebras from Abelian Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the Kazhdan-Lusztig correspondence for a class of vertex operator superalgebras which, via the work of Costello-Gaiotto, arise as boundary VOAs of topological B twist of 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ abelian gauge theories. This means that we show equivalences of braided tensor categories of modules of certain affine vertex superalgebras and corresponding quantum supergroups.
  We build on the work of Creutzig-Lentner-Rupert to this large class of VOAs and extend it since in our case the categories don't have projective objectives and objects can have arbitrary Jordan H\"older length.
  Our correspondence significantly improves the understanding of the braided tensor category of line defects associated to this class of TQFT, by realizing line defects as modules of a Hopf algebra. In the process, we prove a case of the conjecture of Semikhatov-Tipunin, relating logarithmic CFTs to Nichols algebras of screening operators.</description>

      <title>Higher-derivative corrections to flavoured BPS black hole thermodynamics and holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Cardy-like regime of the four-dimensional superconformal index has been shown to be governed by 't Hooft anomalies and to single out a large-$N$ saddle carrying the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of dual supersymmetric black holes in AdS$_5$. For the universal index where no flavour fugacities are turned on, this correspondence has been improved by matching the first subleading corrections to the saddle-point action with the four-derivative corrections to the black hole action in minimal gauged supergravity, as well as the respective corrected entropies. Here, we extend this match by including flavour symmetries. We consider five-dimensional gauged supergravity with vector multiplet and four-derivative couplings, and provide an effective theory reproducing the 't Hooft anomalies of the R- and flavour symmetries of generic holographic superconformal field theories at next-to-leading order in the large-$N$ expansion. Then we focus on a specific model dual to $\mathbb{C}^3/\mathbb{Z}_\nu$ quiver gauge theories, where the 't Hooft anomaly coefficients receive simple but sufficiently generic corrections. In this model, we evaluate the four-derivative corrections to the on-shell action of the supersymmetric multi-charge black hole, showing agreement with the flavoured Cardy-like formula from the index. We give a prediction for the corrected entropy of the supersymmetric black hole and discuss the general validity of our results. Taking the limit of infinite AdS$_5$ radius, we also obtain four-derivative corrections to the action and entropy of supersymmetric asymptotically flat black holes.</description>

      <title>Canonical aspects of pregeometric vector-based first order gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recently proposed pregeometric auxiliary vector mediated gauge theory is studied in its canonical domain, by performing the Legendre transform on a curved background and by considering its covariant phase space. This uncovers several curious properties and problems, even if the viability of the theory itself is questionable at best. The constraints become differential equations, although the Dirac-Bergmann algorithm appears consistent with electromagnetic degrees of freedom, background permitting. Solving the consistency conditions provides what appears to be spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking to obtain a secondary constraint. In parallel, the covariant phase space defines the symplectic structure, immediately relevant for quantization. Conserved currents naturally follow: some details are collected and elaborated. Properties of degenerate metric geometry are discussed throughout. The full phenomenology of the vector theory, classical and quantum, is established to be that of gauge theory on a classical electromagnetic background. This leads into the fundamental question of background independence in all physical theories.</description>

      <title>Sengupta Transformations and Carrollian Relativistic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A detailed and systematic formulation of Carrollian relativity is provided. Based on the transformations, first provided by Sengupta [18], we construct a mapping between Lorentz relativistic and Carrollian relativistic vectors. Using this map the Carroll theory is built from the standard Maxwell action. We show that we get self-consistent equations of motion from the action, both in electric and magnetic limits. We introduce Carroll electric and magnetic fields. A new set of maps is derived that connects Carroll electric and magnetic fields with the usual Maxwell ones and yields Carroll equations in terms of fields. Consistency of results with the potential formulation is shown. Carroll version of symmetries like duality, gauge, shift, Noether and boost are treated in details and their implications elaborated. Especially, boost symmetry provides a link to the various maps used in this paper.</description>

      <title>The Mass Gap of the Space-time and its Shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Snyder's quantum space-time which is Lorentz invariant is investigated. It is found that the quanta of space-time have a positive mass that is interpreted as a positive real mass gap of space-time. This mass gap is related to the minimal length of measurement which is provided by Snyder's algebra. Several reasons to consider the space-time quanta as a 24-cell are discussed. Geometric reasons include its self-duality property and its 24 vertices that may represent the standard model of elementary particles. The 24-cell symmetry group is the Weyl/Coxeter group of the $F_4$ group which was found recently to generate the gauge group of the standard model. It is found that 24-cell may provide a geometric interpretation of the mass generation, Avogadro number, color confinement, and the flatness of the observable universe. The phenomenology and consistency with measurements is discussed.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of topological semimetal states in holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a holographic model that exhibits a coexistence state of the Weyl semimetal and the topological nodal line state, providing us with a valuable tool to investigate the system's behavior in the strong coupling regime. Nine types of bulk solutions exhibiting different IR behaviors have been identified, corresponding to nine different types of boundary states. These nine states include four distinct phases, namely the Weyl-nodal phase, the gap-nodal phase, the Weyl gap phase and the gap-gap phase, four phase boundaries, which are the Weyl-Dirac phase, the gap-Dirac phase, the Dirac-gap phase and the Dirac-nodal phase, and finally a double critical point. A phase diagram is plotted that exhibits qualitative similarity to the one obtained in the weak coupling limit. The anomalous Hall conductivity, which serves as an order parameter, and the free energy are calculated, with the latter showing the continuity of the topological phase transitions within the system. Our study highlights the similarities and differences in such a topological system between the weak and strong coupling regimes, paving the way for further experimental observations.</description>

Abstract: In this thesis we study classical aspects of superconformal field theory via symmetry principles. Specifically, by employing the powerful setup of conformal superspace, we obtain a plethora of new results in the fields of geometric and higher symmetries, (super)conformal higher-spin theory and conformal supergravity.

      <title>Recent Developments in Holographic Black Hole Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the major developments in classical black hole thermodynamics is the inclusion of vacuum energy in the form of thermodynamic pressure. Known as Black Hole Chemistry, this subdiscipline has led to the realization that anti de Sitter black holes exhibit a broad variety of phase transitions that are essentially the same as those observed in chemical systems. Since the pressure is given in terms of a negative cosmological constant (which parametrizes the vacuum energy), the holographic interpretation of Black Hole Chemistry has remained unclear. In the last few years there has been considerable progress in developing an exact dictionary between the bulk laws of Black Hole Chemistry and the laws of the dual Conformal Field Theory (CFT). Holographic Black Hole Chemistry is now becoming an established subfield, with a full thermodynamic bulk/boundary correspondence, and an emergent understanding of CFT phase behaviour and its correspondence in the bulk. Here I review these developments, highlighting key advances and briefly discussing future prospects for further research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study families of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifolds of toroidal conformal field theories based on both factorizable and non-factorizable target space tori. For these classes of theories, we analyze their moduli spaces, and compute their partition functions. Building on previous work, we express the calculated partition functions in terms of suitable Siegel-Narain theta functions that allow us to determine their ensemble averages. We express the derived averaged partition functions of the studied families of conformal field theories in a manifest modular invariant finite sum of products of real analytic Eisenstein series. We speculate on a tentative holographic three-dimensional dual bulk interpretations for the considered $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold classes of ensembles of conformal field theories.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Fixed-Point Structure of Asymptotically Safe QED with a Pauli Term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We test the physical viability of a recent proposal for an asymptotically safe modification of quantum electrodynamics (QED), whose ultraviolet physics is dominated by a non-perturbative Pauli spin-field coupling. We focus in particular on its compatibility with the absence of dynamical generation of fermion mass in QED. Studying the renormalization group flow of chiral four-fermion operators and their fixed points, we discover a distinct class of behavior compared to the standard picture of fixed-point annihilation at large gauge couplings and the ensuing formation of chiral condensates. Instead, transcritical bifurcations, where the fixed points merely exchange infrared stability, are observed. Provided that non-chiral operators remain irrelevant, our theory accommodates a universality class of light fermions for $N_{\text{f}} &gt; 1$ irreducible Dirac flavors. On the contrary, in the special case of $N_{\text{f}} = 1$ flavor, this comes only at the expense of introducing one additional relevant parameter.</description>

      <title>Higher form symmetries and orbifolds of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We undertake a detailed study of the gaugings of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory by its intrinsic charge conjugation 0-form and centre 1-form global symmetries, elucidating their higher algebraic and geometric structures, as well as the meaning of dual lower form symmetries. Our derivations of orbifold gauge theories make use of a combination of standard continuum path integral methods, networks of topological defects, and techniques from higher gauge theory. We provide a unified description of higher and lower form gauge fields for a $p$-form symmetry in the geometric setting of $p$-gerbes, and derive reverse orbifolds by the dual $(-1)$-form symmetries. We identify those orbifolds in which charge conjugation symmetry is spontaneously broken, and relate the breaking to mixed anomalies involving $(-1)$-form symmetries. We extend these considerations to gaugings by the non-invertible 1-form symmetries of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory by introducing a notion of generalized $\theta$-angle.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy of a Scalar Field in a Squeezed State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy within a spherical region for a free scalar field in a squeezed state in 3+1 dimensions. We show that, even for small squeezing, a volume term appears, whose coefficient is essentially independent of the field mass. This is in line with Page's argument that the entanglement entropy in an arbitrary quantum state is proportional to the number of degrees of freedom of the smaller subsystem. It follows that squeezed states can be considered as arbitrary quantum states, in contrast to the ground or coherent states that give rise to entanglement entropy that is dominated by a term proportional to the area of the entangling surface.</description>

      <title>Quantum 2D Liouville Path-Integral Is a Sum over Geometries in AdS$_3$ Einstein Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a renowned solution of the modular bootstrap that defines the UV complete quantum Liouville theory. We triangulate the path-integral of this Liouville CFT on any 2D surface $\mathcal{M}$, by proposing a shrinkable boundary condition for this special CFT that allows small holes to close, analogous to the proposal in rational CFTs [1-3]. This is essentially a tensor network that admits an interpretation of a state-sum of a 3D topological theory constructed with quantum 6j symbols of $\mathcal{U}_q(SL(2,\mathbb{R}))$ with non-trivial boundary conditions, and it reduces to a sum over 3D geometries weighted by the Einstein-Hilbert action to leading order in large $c$. The boundary conditions of quantum Liouville theory specifies a very special sum over bulk geometries to faithfully reproduce the CFT path-integral. The triangulation coincides with producing a network of geodesics in the AdS bulk, which can be changed making use of the pentagon identity and orthogonality condition satisfied by the 6j symbols, and arranged into a precise holographic tensor network.</description>

      <title>Tunable quantum criticality and pseudocriticality across the fixed-point annihilation in the anisotropic spin-boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-boson models are simple examples of quantum dissipative systems, but also serve as effective models in quantum magnetism and exhibit nontrivial quantum criticality. Recently, they have been established as a platform to study the nontrivial renormalization-group (RG) scenario of fixed-point annihilation, in which two intermediate-coupling RG fixed points collide and generate an extremely slow RG flow near the collision. For the Bose Kondo model, a single $S=1/2$ spin where each spin component couples to an independent bosonic bath with power-law spectrum $\propto \omega^s$ via dissipation strengths $\alpha_i$, $i\in\{x,y,z\}$, such phenomena occur sequentially for the U(1)-symmetric model at $\alpha_z=0$ and the SU(2)-symmetric case at $\alpha_z = \alpha_{xy}$, as the bath exponent $s&lt;1$ is tuned. Here we use an exact wormhole quantum Monte Carlo method to show how fixed-point annihilations within symmetry-enhanced parameter manifolds affect the anisotropy-driven criticality across them. We find a tunable transition between two long-range-ordered localized phases that can be continuous or strongly first-order, and even becomes weakly first-order in an extended regime close to the fixed-point collision. We extract critical exponents at the continuous transition, but also find scaling behavior at the symmetry-enhanced first-order transition, for which the inverse correlation-length exponent is given by the bath exponent $s$. In particular, we provide direct numerical evidence for pseudocritical scaling on both sides of the fixed-point collision, which manifests in an extremely slow drift of the correlation-length exponent. In addition, we also study the crossover behavior away from the SU(2)-symmetric case and determine the phase boundary of an extended U(1)-symmetric critical phase for $\alpha_z &lt; \alpha_{xy}$.</description>

      <title>Signatures of ultralight bosons in the orbital eccentricity of binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the existence of clouds of ultralight particles surrounding black holes during their cosmological history as members of a binary system can leave a measurable imprint on the distribution of masses and orbital eccentricities observable with future gravitational-wave detectors. Notably, we find that for nonprecessing binaries with chirp masses ${\cal M} \lesssim 10\,M_\odot$, formed exclusively in isolation, larger-than-expected values of the eccentricity, i.e. $e\gtrsim 10^{-2}$ at gravitational-wave frequencies $f_{\rm GW} \simeq 10^{-2}\,$Hz, would provide tantalizing evidence for a new particle of mass between $[0.5,2.5] \times 10^{-12}\,$eV in nature. The predicted evolution of the eccentricity can also drastically affect the in-band phase evolution and peak frequency. These results constitute unique signatures of boson clouds of ultralight particles in the dynamics of binary black holes, which will be readily accessible with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, as well as future mid-band and Deci-hertz detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we would like to examine whether stable de Sitter inflationary solutions appear within power-law extensions of the Starobinsky model. In particular, we will address general constraints for the existence along with the stability of de Sitter inflationary solutions in a general case involving not only the Starobinsky $R^2$ term but also an additional power-law $R^n$ one. According to the obtained results, we will be able to identify which extension is more suitable for an early inflationary phase rather than a late-time cosmic acceleration phase. To be more specific, we will consider several values of $n$ to see whether the corresponding de Sitter inflationary solutions are stable or not.</description>

      <title>Impact of (magneto-)thermoelectric effect on diffusion of conserved charges in hot and dense hadronic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric effect, which describes the generation of an electric field induced by temperature and conserved charge chemical potential gradients, in the hot and dense hadronic matter created in heavy-ion collisions. Utilizing the Boltzmann kinetic theory within the repulsive mean-field hadron resonance gas model, we evaluate both the diffusion thermopower matrix and diffusion coefficient matrix for the baryon number ($B$), electric charge ($Q$), and strangeness ($S$).The Landau-Lifshitz frame is enforced in the derivation. We find that the thermoelectric effect hinders the diffusion processes of multiple conserved charges, particularly reducing the coupling between electric charge and baryon number (strangeness) in baryon (strangeness) diffusion. Based on the fact that the repulsive mean-field interactions between hadrons have a significant effect on the diffusion thermopower matrix and diffusion coefficient matrix in the baryon-rich region, we extend the investigation to include the impact of the magnetic field, analyzing the magneto-thermoelectric effect on both the diffusion coefficient matrix and the Hall-like diffusion coefficient matrix. The sensitivity of the magnetic field-dependent diffusion thermopower matrix and magneto-thermoelectric modified diffusion coefficient matrix to the choices of various transverse conditions is also studied.</description>

Abstract: Matrix-valued holomorphic quantum modular forms are intricate objects that arise in successive refinements of the Volume Conjecture of knots and involve three holomorphic, asymptotic and arithmetic objects. It is expected that the algebraic properties of these objects can be deduced from the algebraic properties of descendant state integrals, and we illustrate this for the case of the $(-2,3,7)$-pretzel knot.</description>

      <title>Generalized Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau oscillator under Aharonov-Bohm flux in topological defects backgrounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the generalized Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau (DKP) oscillator under the influence of quantum flux field in the topological defects produced by a cosmic string space-time and point-like global monopole. The generalized DKP oscillator will be investigated through a non-minimal substitution of the momentum operator $\vec{p} \to \left(\vec{p}+i\,M\,\omega\,\eta^0\,f(r)\,\hat{r}\right)$ in the relativistic DKP equation. We solve this generalized DKP oscillator in a cosmic string space-time background and obtain the energy levels and wave function of the oscillator field using the parametric Nikiforov-Uvarov method. Afterwards, we solve the generalized DKP-oscillator in a point-like global monopole space-time and obtain the energy levels and wave functions following the same method. In fact, it is shown there that the energy eigenvalues are influenced by the topological defect of cosmic string and point-like global monopole and gets modified compared to flat space results, and breaks the degeneracy of the energy levels. Furthermore, we observe that the eigenvalue solutions depends on the quantum flux field that shows the gravitational analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm effect and also gives us a persistent currents</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotating black holes can produce superradiant clouds of ultralight bosons. When the black hole is part of a binary system, its cloud can undergo resonances and ionization. These processes leave a distinct signature on the gravitational waveform that depends on the cloud's properties. To determine the state of the cloud by the time the system enters the band of future millihertz detectors, we study the chronological sequence of resonances encountered during the inspiral. For the first time, we consistently take into account the nonlinearities induced by the orbital backreaction and we allow the orbit to have generic eccentricity and inclination. We find that the resonance phenomenology exhibits striking new features. Resonances can "start" or "break" above critical thresholds of the parameters, which we compute analytically, and induce dramatic changes in eccentricity and inclination. Applying these results to realistic systems, we find two possible outcomes. If the binary and the cloud are sufficiently close to counter-rotating, the cloud survives in its original state until the system enters in band; otherwise, the cloud is destroyed during a resonance at large separations, but leaves an imprint on the eccentricity and inclination. In both scenarios, we characterize the observational signatures, with particular focus on future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

Abstract: Supersymmetric states in M-theory are mapped after compactification to perturbatively non-supersymmetric states in type IIA string theory, with the supersymmetric parts being encoded in the non-perturbative section of the string theory. An observer unable to recognise certain topological features of string theory will not detect supersymmetry. Such relativity of symmetry can also be derived in the context of Theorem 3 in ref. [11]. The tool of choice in this context is the universal coefficient theorem linking cohomology theories with coefficients that reveal respectively hide certain topological features. As a consequence of these observations, it is shown that the same theorem is capable of linking perturbative with non-perturbative string theoretical domains. A discussion of inflow anomaly cancellation is also included in the context of universal coefficient theorems.</description>

      <title>Decoherence and entropy generation at one loop in the inflationary de Sitter spacetime for Yukawa interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decoherence mechanism is believed to be possibly connected to the quantum to classical transition of the primordial cosmological perturbations in the early universe. In this paper, we extend our previous analysis on decoherence in a fermion and scalar quantum field theory coupled via the Yukawa interaction in the Minkowski spacetime, to the inflationary de Sitter background. We treat the scalar field as the system and the fermions as the environment, and both the fields are taken to be massless. We utilise a non-equilibrium effective field theory formalism, suitable for open quantum systems such as this. We assume that an observer measures only the Gaussian 2-point correlator for the scalar field, as the simplest realistic scenario. In order to compute the von Neumann entropy generated at late times as a measure of the decoherence, we construct the one loop renormalised Kadanoff-Baym equation, which is the equation of motion satisfied by the 2-point correlators in the closed time path Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. These equations account to the self energy corrections. Using this, we next construct the one loop corrected statistical propagator for the scalar, which is related to its phase space area, to compute the von Neumann entropy. We also compute the variation of the von Neumann entropy with respect to relevant parameters. We note the qualitative similarity between our findings and the scenario where both the system and the environment are scalars. Our result is also qualitatively similar to an earlier one found by using the influence functional technique for a massive Yukawa theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08917v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a UV divergence of the propagator integral implies the divergences of the UV/IR mixing in the two-point function at one-loop for a $\phi^4$-theory on a generic Lie algebra-type noncommutative space-time. The UV/IR mixing is defined as a UV divergence of the planar contribution and an IR singularity of the non-planar contribution, the latter being due to the former UV divergence, and the UV finiteness of the non-planar contribution. Some properties of this general treatment are discussed. The UV finiteness of the non-planar contribution and the renormalizability of the theory are not treated but commented. Applications are performed for the Moyal space, having a UV/IR mixing, and the $\kappa$-Minkowski space for which the two-point function at one-loop is finite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14066v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) model, representing the isotropic and homogeneous Universe, has an inherent diffeomorphism (or reparametrization) invariance. For a given local time-reparametrization symmetry transformation of (0+1)-dimensional (1D) diffeomorphism invariant FLRW model, we derive the off-shell nilpotent and absolutely anticommuting (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations in a consistent manner. The supervariable approach to BRST formalism is used as a guiding tool in finding the proper (anti-)BRST transformations. An application of (super-)diffeomorphism invariance, in the context of superspace formalism, yields horizontality conditions. Moreover, the celebrated CF-type condition which is universal for 1D diffeomorphism invariant theories, emerges as an off-shoot of the horizontality condition and provides the absolute anticommutativity of the (anti-)BRST transformations. In addition, this CF-type condition leads to the derivation of coupled (but equivalent) (anti-)BRST invariant quantum Lagrangians for FLRW model. We also capture the geometrical interpretation of the (anti-)BRST transformations and their properties in terms of the Grassmannian translational generators and supervariables.</description>

Abstract: The Casimir effect is induced by the interplay between photon fields and boundary conditions, and in particular, photon fields modified in axion electrodynamics may lead to the sign-flipping of the Casimir energy. We propose a theoretical approach to derive the Casimir effect in axion electrodynamics. This approach is based on a lattice regularization and enables us to discuss the dependence on the lattice spacing for the Casimir energy. With this approach, the sign-flipping behavior of the Casimir energy is correctly reproduced. By taking the continuum limit of physical quantity calculated on the lattice, we can obtain the results consistent with the continuum theory. This approach can also be applied to the Casimir effect at nonzero temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the null asymptotic structure of Einstein-Maxwell theory in three-dimensional (3D) spacetimes. Although devoid of bulk gravitational degrees of freedom, the system admits a massless photon and can therefore accommodate electromagnetic radiation. We derive fall-off conditions for the Maxwell field that contain both Coulombic and radiative modes with non-vanishing news. The latter produces non-integrability and fluxes in the asymptotic surface charges, and gives rise to a non-trivial 3D Bondi mass loss formula. The resulting solution space is thus analogous to a dimensional reduction of 4D pure gravity, with the role of gravitational radiation played by its electromagnetic cousin. We use this simplified setup to investigate choices of charge brackets in detail, and compute in particular the recently introduced Koszul bracket. When the latter is applied to Wald-Zoupas charges, which are conserved in the absence of news, it leads to the field-dependent central extension found earlier in [arXiv:1503.00856]. We also consider (Anti-)de Sitter asymptotics to further exhibit the analogy between this model and 4D gravity with leaky boundary conditions.</description>

Abstract: We reformulate the analysis of singularities of Feynman integrals in a way that can be practically applied to perturbative computations in the Standard Model in dimensional regularization. After highlighting issues in the textbook treatment of Landau singularities, we develop an algorithm for classifying and computing them using techniques from computational algebraic geometry. We introduce an algebraic variety called the principal Landau determinant, which captures the singularities even in the presence of massless particles or UV/IR divergences. We illustrate this for 114 example diagrams, including a cutting-edge 2-loop 5-point non-planar QCD process with multiple mass scales. The algorithms introduced in this work are implemented in the open-source Julia package PLD.jl available at https://mathrepo.mis.mpg.de/PLD/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the STU sectors of the four-dimensional maximal gauged supergravities with gauge groups ${\rm SO(8)}$, ${\rm SO(6)}\ltimes\mathbb{R}^{12}$ and $[{\rm SO(6)}\times{\rm SO(2)}]\ltimes\mathbb{R}^{12}$, and construct new domain-wall black-hole solutions in $D=4$. The consistent Kaluza-Klein embedding of these theories is obtained using the techniques of Exceptional Field Theory combined with the 4$d$ tensor hierarchies, and their respective uplifts into $D=11$ and type IIB supergravities are connected through singular limits that relate the different gaugings.</description>

      <title>A Smooth Horizon without a Smooth Horizon</title>

Abstract: Recent observations on type III algebras in AdS/CFT raise the possibility that smoothness of the black hole horizon is an emergent feature of the large-$N$ limit. In this paper, we present a $bulk$ model for the finite-$N$ mechanism underlying this transition. We quantize a free scalar field on a BTZ black hole with a Planckian stretched horizon placed as a Dirichlet boundary for the field. This is a tractable model for the stretched horizon that does not ignore the angular directions, and it defines a black hole vacuum which has similarities to (but is distinct from) the Boulware state. Using analytic approximations for the normal modes, we first improve upon 't Hooft's brick wall calculation: we are able to match $both$ the entropy and the temperature, $exactly$. Emboldened by this, we compute the boundary Wightman function of the scalar field in a typical pure state built on our stretched horizon vacuum, at an energy sliver at the mass of the black hole. A key result is that despite the manifest lack of smoothness, this single-sided pure state calculation yields precisely the Hartle-Hawking thermal correlator associated to the smooth horizon, in the small-$G_N$ limit. At finite $G_N$, there are variance corrections that are suppressed as $\mathcal{O}(e^{-S_{BH}/2})$. They become important at late times and resolve Maldacena's information paradox. Highly excited typical pure states on the stretched horizon vacuum are therefore models for black hole microstates, while the smooth horizon describes the thermal state. We note that heavy excited states on the stretched horizon are better defined than the vacuum itself. These results suggest that complementarity in the bulk EFT could arise from a UV complete bulk description in which the black hole interior is not manifest.</description>

      <title>Modular flow in JT gravity and entanglement wedge reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been shown in recent works that JT gravity with matter with two boundaries has a type II$_\infty$ algebra on each side. As the bulk spacetime between the two boundaries fluctuates in quantum nature, we can only define the entanglement wedge for each side in a pure algebraic sense. As we take the semiclassical limit, we will have a fixed long wormhole spacetime for a generic partially entangled thermal state (PETS), which is prepared by inserting heavy operators on the Euclidean path integral. Under this limit, with appropriate assumptions of the matter theory, geometric notions of the causal wedge and entanglement wedge emerge in this background. In particular, the causal wedge is manifestly nested in the entanglement wedge. Different PETS are orthogonal to each other, and thus the Hilbert space has a direct sum structure over sub-Hilbert spaces labeled by different Euclidean geometries. The full algebra for both sides is decomposed accordingly. From the algebra viewpoint, the causal wedge is dual to an emergent type III$_1$ subalgebra, which is generated by boundary light operators. To reconstruct the entanglement wedge, we consider the modular flow in a generic PETS for each boundary. We show that the modular flow acts locally and is the boost transformation around the global RT surface in the semiclassical limit. It follows that we can extend the causal wedge algebra to a larger type III$_1$ algebra corresponding to the entanglement wedge. Within each sub-Hilbert space, the original type II$_\infty$ reduces to type III$_1$.</description>

      <title>Fractional Spins, Unfolding, and Holography: I. Parent field equations for dual higher-spin gravity reductions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work and in the companion paper arXiv:2403.02301 we initiate an approach to holography based on the AKSZ formalism. As a first step, we refine Vasiliev's holography proposal in arXiv:1203.5554 by obtaining 4D higher-spin gravity (HSG) and 3D coloured conformal higher-spin gravity (CCHSG) -- i.e., coloured conformal matter fields coupled to conformal higher-spin gauge fields and colour gauge fields -- as two distinct and classically consistent reductions of a single parent theory. The latter consists, on-shell, of a flat superconnection valued in a fractional-spin extension of Vasiliev's higher-spin algebra. The 4D HSG and 3D CCHSG reductions are characterized by dual structure groups and two-form cohomology elements, and their embedding in a common parent model provides a rationale for deriving holographic relations from multi-dimensional AKSZ partition functions on cylinders with dual boundary conditions, to appear separately. In this work we i) construct the underlying non-commutative geometry as a metaplectic operator algebra represented in a Hermitian module of a pair of conformal particles; ii) identify a discrete modular group, arising from twisted boundary conditions of the first-quantized system, and connecting different boundary conditions of the second-quantized system; and iii) identify the holonomies, structure groups and two-form cohomology elements that characterize the HSG and CCHSG reductions, and equate the dual second Chern classes.</description>

Abstract: This paper completes the analysis initiated in the companion work arXiv:2403.02283 -- referred to as Paper I -- by showing how 4D higher-spin gravity (HSG) and 3D coloured conformal matter fields coupled to conformal higher-spin gauge fields and colour gauge fields (coloured conformal HSG, or CCHSG) emerge as consistent reductions of a common parent model. The latter is a Frobenius-Chern-Simons model with superconnection valued in a fractional-spin extension of Vasiliev's higher-spin algebra, and was defined and studied in Paper I. Here, we i) realize HSG as a subcase of a more general 4D reduction, describing HSG coupled to coloured, fractional-spin matter, which we refer to as 4D fractional-spin gravity; ii) study the CCHSG model, in particular exhibiting the crucial role played by novel colour gauge fields in coupling conformal matter to conformal HSG, thereby completing the perturbatively defined models of conformal HSG due to Vasiliev and Nilsson; iii) extract conformal currents and composite coloured sources in an expansion of the CCHSG model around 3D Minkowskian leaves; and iv) compare our results with Vasiliev's holography proposal of arXiv:1203.5554. The common origin of HSG and CCHSG, besides relating the two models directly, is also the starting point for establishing the holographic correspondence between the two models via overlap conditions, to be presented separately.</description>

Abstract: The shortest distance around the Universe through us is unlikely to be much larger than the horizon diameter if microwave background anomalies are due to cosmic topology. We show that observational constraints from the lack of matched temperature circles in the microwave background leave many possibilities for such topologies. We evaluate the detectability of microwave background multipole correlations for sample cases. Searches for topology signatures in observational data over the large space of possible topologies pose a formidable computational challenge.</description>

      <title>Unscrambling Quantum Information with Clifford decoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11337v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum information scrambling is a unitary process that destroys local correlations and spreads information throughout the system, effectively hiding it in nonlocal degrees of freedom. In principle, unscrambling this information is possible with perfect knowledge of the unitary dynamics [B. Yoshida and A. Kitaev, arXiv:1710.03363.]. However, this Letter demonstrates that even without previous knowledge of the internal dynamics, information can be efficiently decoded from an unknown scrambler by monitoring the outgoing information of a local subsystem. Surprisingly, we show that scramblers with unknown internal dynamics, which are rapidly mixing but not fully chaotic, can be decoded using Clifford decoders. The essential properties of a scrambling unitary can be efficiently recovered, even if the process is exponentially complex. Specifically, we establish that a unitary operator composed of $t$ non-Clifford gates admits a Clifford decoder up to $t\le n$.</description>

      <title>Quark clusters, QCD vacuum and the cosmological 7Li, Dark Matter and Dark Energy problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.06820v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a non-exotic electromagnetic solution (within the standard model of particle physics) to the cosmological 7Li problem based upon a narrow 2 MeV photo-emission line from the decay of light Glueballs (LGBs). These LGBs form within color superconducting, tens of Fermi in size, quark clusters (SQCs) in the radiation-dominated post-BBN epoch. The mono-chromatic line from the LGB -&gt; gamma+gamma decay reduces Big-Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) 7Be by 2/3 without affecting other abundances or CMB physics, provided the combined mass of the SQCs is greater than the total baryonic mass in the Universe. Following the LGB emission, the in-SQC Quantum-ChromoDynamics (QCD) vacuum becomes unstable and "leaks" (via quantum tunnelling) into the external space-time (trivial) vacuum inducing a decoupling of SQCs from hadrons. In seeking a solution to the 7Li problem, we uncovered a solution which also addresses the dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) problem making these critical problems intertwined in our model. Being colorless, charge neutral, optically thin and transparent to hadrons, SQCs interact only gravitationally making them a viable CDM candidate. The quantum tunnelling of the in-SQC QCD vacuum to the trivial vacuum offers an explanation of DE in our model and allows for a cosmology which evolves into a LambdaCDM universe at low redshift with a possible resolution of the Hubble tension. Our model distinguishes itself by proposing that the QCD vacuum within SQCs possesses the ability to tunnel into the exterior trivial vacuum, resulting in the generation of DE. This implies the possibility that DM and hadrons might represent distinct phases of quark matter within QCD, characterized by different vacuum properties. We discuss SQC formation in heavy-ion collision experiments at moderate temperatures and the possibility of detection of MeV photons from LGB -&gt; gamma+gamma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.05978v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the idea that the inflaton may have dissipated part of its energy into a thermal bath during inflation, considering monomial inflationary potentials and three different forms of dissipation rate. Using a numerical Fokker-Planck approach to describe the stochastic dynamics of inflationary fluctuations, we confront this scenario with current bounds on the spectrum of curvature fluctuations and primordial gravitational waves. We also obtain purely analytical approximations that improve over previously used ones in the small dissipation regime for the amplitude of the spectrum and its tilt. We show that only our numerical Fokker-Planck method is accurate, fast and precise enough to test these models against current data. We advocate its use in future studies of warm inflation. We also apply the stochastic inflation formalism to this scenario, finding that the resulting spectrum is the same as the one obtained with standard perturbation theory. We discuss the origin and convenience of using a commonly implemented large thermal correction to the primordial spectrum and the implications of such a term for a specific scenario. Improved bounds on the scalar spectral index will further constrain warm inflation in the near future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the real-time dynamics during the spontaneous deformation of an unstable spherical black hole in asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. For the initial value, the static solutions with spherical symmetry are obtained numerically, revealing the presence of a spinodal region in the phase diagram. From the linear stability analysis, we find that only the central part of such a thermodynamically unstable spinodal region leads to the emergence of a type of axial instability. To trigger the dynamical instability, an axial perturbation is imposed on the scalar field. As a result, by the fully nonlinear dynamical simulation, the spherical symmetry of the gravitational system is broken spontaneously, leading to the formation of an axisymmetric black hole.</description>

      <title>An Attractive Proposal for Resolving the Hubble Tension: Dynamical Attractors that Unify Early and Late Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Early dark energy is a promising potential resolution of the Hubble tension. Unfortunately, many models suffer from the need to fine-tune their initial conditions to ensure that the epoch of early dark energy coincides with matter-radiation equality. We propose a class of attractive early dark energy models where this coincidence arises naturally as a saddle point of a dynamical system that attracts a large volume of phase-space trajectories regardless of the initial conditions. The system approaches a global dark energy attractor at late-times. Our framework therefore unifies early and late dark energy using a single scalar degree of freedom. We analyze a fiducial attractive early dark energy model and find that it is disfavored by cosmological data due to the presence of a long-lived saddle point in the matter era where the scalar plays the role of an additional component of (non-clustering) dark matter. Our investigations provide lessons for future model-building efforts aimed at constructing viable attractive early dark energy models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05700v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the experience of a linearly accelerated observer with acceleration $a$, interacting with a massless scalar field in its vacuum state in $3+1$ Minkowski spacetime, is identical to that of a static observer interacting with a massless scalar field in a thermal state of temperature $a/2\pi$ in $3+1$ Minkowski spacetime. We study the robustness of this duality by comparing an observer undergoing circular motion in a thermal bath with an observer that undergoes circular motion around a linearly accelerated trajectory. We find that in most regimes, observers in these two cases experience the field in different ways, and are generally able to tell the difference between the two cases by measuring observables localized along their trajectories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a calculation of the spin alignment for unflavored vector mesons in thermalized quark-gluon plasma based on the Kubo formula in linear response theory. This is achieved by expanding the system to the first order of the coupling constant and the spatial gradient. The effect strongly relies on the vector meson's spectral functions which are determined by the interaction and medium properties. The spectral functions are calculated for the one-quark-loop self-energy with meson-quark interaction. The numerical results show that the correction to the spin alignment from the thermal shear tensor is of the order $10^{-4}\sim10^{-5}$ for the chosen values of quark-meson coupling constant, if the magnitude of thermal shear tensor is $10^{-2}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a superconductor-barrier-superconductor configuration built with Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl semimetal, which features four bands crossing at a single nodal point. Assuming a homogeneous s-wave pairing in each superconducting region, and the barrier region created by applying a voltage of magnitude $V_0 $ across a piece of normal state semimetal, we apply the BdG formalism to compute the discrete energy spectrum $\varepsilon $ of the subgap Andreev bound states in the short-barrier regime. In contrast with the two-band semimetals studied earlier, we find upto four pairs of localized states (rather than one pair for two-band semimetals) in the thin-barrier limit, and each value of $\varepsilon $ has a complicated dependence on the phase difference $\varphi_{12} $ via cosine and sine functions, which cannot be determined analytically. These are artifacts of multi-band nodes hosting quasiparticles of pseudospin values greater than $1/2$. Using the bound state energies, we compute the Josephson current across the junction configuration.</description>

Abstract: We study the chiral phase transition within the Linear Sigma Model with quarks from its thermodynamical potential considering quantum corrections up to ring diagrams in the high-temperature regime. Demanding a second order phase transition as expected in the chiral limit at low baryon chemical potential, that the curvature of the critical line matches the one obtained in lattice simulations and that the value of the speed of sound at high temperature and zero density has its measured value, we constrain the couplings and other free parameters of the model. We set restrictions to locate the position of the Critical End Point in the phase diagram from a fast drop-off of the critical line reminiscent from the behavior of the speed of sound near criticality. Our results set tight constrains in parameter space for the model to exhibit realistic features.</description>

Abstract: In this work we explore generalized Bronnikov-Ellis wormholes backgrounds and investigate the propagation of massive scalar fields. The first generalized wormhole geometry arises from General Relativity with a phantom scalar field while the second one arises from $f(R)$-gravity. For the first geometry we employ the continued fraction method to calculate accurately the quasinormal frequencies of massive scalar fields, particularly focusing on low values of the angular number, and we show an anomalous behaviour of the decay rate of the quasinormal frequencies, for $n \geq \ell$. Also, we show that for massive scalar field the effective potential allows potential wells for some values of the parameters which support bound states which are obtained using the continued fraction method and these are characterized by having only a frequency of oscillation and they do not decay. For the second wormhole geometry the quasinormal modes can be obtained analytically, being the longest-lived modes the one with lowest angular number $\ell$. So, in this wormhole background the anomalous behaviour is avoided.</description>
