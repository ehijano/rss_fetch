      <title>Perfect adaptation in eukaryotic gradient sensing using cooperative allosteric binding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eukaryotic cells generally sense chemical gradients using the binding of chemical ligands to membrane receptors. In order to perform chemotaxis effectively in different environments, cells need to adapt to different concentrations. We present a model of gradient sensing where the affinity of receptor-ligand binding is increased when a protein binds to the receptor's cytosolic side. This interior protein (allosteric factor) alters the sensitivity of the cell, allowing the cell to adapt to different ligand concentrations. We propose a reaction scheme where the cell alters the allosteric factor's availability to adapt the average fraction of bound receptors to 1/2. We calculate bounds on the chemotactic accuracy of the cell, and find that the cell can reach near-optimal chemotaxis over a broad range of concentrations. We find that the accuracy of chemotaxis depends strongly on the diffusion of the allosteric compound relative to other reaction rates. From this, we also find a trade-off between adaptation time and gradient sensing accuracy.</description>

      <title>When Blood Parts Ways: Phase Separation in Microstructured Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how red blood cell (RBC) suspensions navigate porous materials is critical for for both fundamental physiology, such as maternal-fetal exchange in the placenta, and transformative biomedical applications, including rapid, low-cost disease diagnostics from a single drop of blood in resource-constrained settings. Here we elucidate how RBC movement through fibrous microporous structures is influenced by cell aggregation agents, emphasizing the impact of their clustering, membrane flexibility, and confinement. By varying the volume fraction of the RBC (hematocrit) and aggregation strength, we reveal a surprising phase separation: a dense RBC core surrounded by a cell-free layer, an effect not previously reported in whole blood studies. This separation is shown to be more pronounced with rigidified cells and persists even at high hematocrit levels, unlike in healthy samples. By connecting RBC deformability and aggregability to pore-mediated phase dynamics, our study provides a foundation for new diagnostic tools capable of classifying blood disorders or evaluating blood quality using only a sheet of structured paper, seamlessly integrating fundamental fluid mechanics with translational biomedical innovation in a previously unexplored manner.</description>
