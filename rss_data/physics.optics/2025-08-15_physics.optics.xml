      <title>Formation of axially modulated plasma strings by filamentation of interfering femtosecond Bessel beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the formation of axially modulated plasma strings through the filamentation of two interfering femtosecond Bessel beams. The constituent Bessel beams have different central spot sizes and propagate collinearly. Our results show that filamentation of these beams in air leads to the formation of intense axially modulated light filaments, and corrugated plasma strings with high modulation depths and tunable modulation periods. We find that the modulation periods of the intensity and the plasma density are identical and comparable to the modulation period of the intensity in the linear propagation regime. Furthermore, we show that, in the nonlinear propagation regime, the modulation period is independent of the pulse energy and can be tuned by selecting appropriate central spot sizes for the interfering Bessel beams. Finally, we propose a simple interferometric arrangement using a single axicon to generate two interfering Bessel beams with adjustable spot sizes enabling the creation of axially-modulated plasma strings with tunable periodicity at high input powers.</description>

      <title>High-sensitivity Optical Microcavity Acoustic Sensor Covering Free Spectral Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical whispering gallery mode microcavity acoustic sensors have emerged significant potential in high-sensitivity acoustic signal detection, but the narrow dynamic range limits the application prospect. To address the challenge, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a high-sensitivity acoustic sensor in optical whispering gallery mode microcavity. The proposed sensor integrates an extended Mach-Zehnder polarization interferometer with postselection, extending the dynamic range to the free spectral range. The sensing regions can be categorized into phase-drastic and phase-enhanced regions, both of which yield an optimal acoustic response that surpasses traditional transmission method. Experiment results demonstrate improvements of 57.87 dB in detection sensitivity and 26 times in minimal detectable acoustic pressure over the transmission method. Moreover, the application of coherent state and heterodyne detection can enhance response amplitude, further improving the detection sensitivity. Given the wide application range for acoustic dispersion and dissipation response, as well as the performance advantages of high sensitivity and wide dynamic range, the proposed WGM sensor offers a promising solution for acoustic sensing. Potentially, the structural design may be adaptable to other application scenarios involving time-varying signals through optical microcavity sensing.</description>

      <title>Multipulse Soliton Attractors Facilitated by High-Birefringence Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of optical solitons is a crucial factor in various applications. This work reveals a novel stable multipulse soliton attractor in fiber lasers. The attractor represents a bound state of multiple solitons, pulling other dynamical states toward itself. By introducing a polarization-maintaining fiber (PMF), the enhanced birefringence in the cavity induces the differential group delay (DGD) between the polarization components of the pulse, leading to soliton splitting and, ultimately, the formation of multi-soliton states. These multi-solitons, affected by intracavity nonlinear and dissipative effects, form attractors consisting of one to seven soliton pulses. Through a combination of experiments and numerical simulations, we systematically investigate the robustness and dynamical behavior of the multipulse soliton attractors. In this context, we analyze disturbances introduced by "rogue" solitons with different frequencies and conduct a comprehensive study of their interaction with the multipulse soliton attractors. The results show that the multipulse soliton attractors are structurally stable and highly resistant to external disturbances, highlighting their potential for high-precision fiber lasers and advanced multipulse systems.</description>

      <title>Characterization of non-planar ring oscillators at a wavelength of 1064 nm for high precision metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-stable laser light is essential for high-precision interferometric measurements, in particular for the next generation of gravitational wave detectors, where high power lasers with unprecedented low power and frequency noise are demanded. Since the seed laser for high-power laser system has a large influence on the overall noise characteristics, the use of the lowest noise seed laser is beneficial. This study compares a newly developed seed laser, based on a non-planar ring oscillator (NPRO) design, at a wavelength of 1064 nm with two commercial NPROs and shows that the new laser exhibits ten times lower power and frequency noise. This noise advantage is retained even after subsequent amplification to 40 W.</description>

      <title>Multichannel Hybrid Quantum Cryptography for Submarine Optical Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multichannel hybrid quantum cryptography approach intended for submarine quantum optical communications between Alice and Bob separated a distance beyond the current QKD possibilities, each located on a coastline. It is based on the difficult of a simultaneous access to $M$ optical submarine channels. The optical lines from the coastline and ideally to the end of the continental platform are governed by the quantum properties of the light under an autocompensating high-dimensional discrete-modulation continuous variable QKD protocol. The hybrid approach consists of combining several secret keys of the $M$ channels and introducing extra layers of security, passive and/or active, on the non quantum optical lines located beyond the continental platform.</description>

      <title>Artificial discovery of lattice models for wave transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave transport devices, such as amplifiers, frequency converters, and nonreciprocal devices, are essential for modern communication, signal processing, and sensing applications. Of particular interest are traveling wave setups, which offer excellent gain and bandwidth properties. So far, the conceptual design of those devices has relied on human ingenuity. This makes it difficult and time-consuming to explore the full design space under a variety of constraints and target functionalities. In our work, we present a method which automates this challenge. By optimizing the discrete and continuous parameters of periodic coupled-mode lattices, our approach identifies the simplest lattices that achieve the target transport functionality, and we apply it to discover new schemes for directional amplifiers, isolators, and frequency demultiplexers. Leveraging automated symbolic regression tools, we find closed analytical expressions that facilitate the discovery of generalizable construction rules. Moreover, we utilize important conceptual connections between the device transport properties and non-Hermitian topology. The resulting structures can be implemented on a variety of platforms, including microwave, optical, and optomechanical systems. Our approach opens the door to extensions like the artificial discovery of lattice models with desired properties in higher dimensions or with nonlinear interactions.</description>

      <title>Theory of superlensing with complex frequency illuminations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have demonstrated that the resolution of superlensing slabs can be significantly enhanced with complex frequency illuminations. In this study, we introduce a novel theoretical framework for analyzing superlensing effects with flat lenses. The framework yields a simple and transparent expression for the steady-state transfer function of lossy superlensing slabs and offers clear criteria for selecting complex frequencies that maximize resolution. It also clarifies the conditions under which the steady-state response dominates over the transient response, highlighting key advantages of synthesized complex frequency excitations compared to direct approaches involving exponentially damped illuminations with an initial time step.</description>

      <title>Phased-Array Laser Power Beaming from Cislunar Space to the Lunar Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a rigorous analytical framework for quantitatively evaluating space-based laser power beaming from lunar-orbiting spacecraft to surface receivers, addressing the critical need for continuous, high-density energy to sustain lunar exploration and habitation. The framework integrates physics-based models of spacecraft photovoltaic generation, precise orbital geometries, time-dependent link availability and slant-range variations, coherent beam propagation (including transmitter aperture diameter, beam quality factor, path losses, and pointing jitter), and photonic-to-electrical conversion at the lunar surface. Particular emphasis is placed on phased-array transmitter systems, whose large effective apertures significantly reduce beam divergence relative to single-aperture designs, resulting in orders-of-magnitude increases in delivered surface power under equivalent orbital and power conditions. Parametric sensitivity analyses and illustrative numerical simulations demonstrate how phased-array architectures improve power density and end-to-end efficiency at operational lunar distances. The study also examines advanced orbital configurations (e.g., Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbits, Earth-Moon Lagrange points), real-time adaptive beam steering and wavefront control, optimized receiver geometries, and thermal/dust mitigation strategies. The results establish a clear pathway toward scalable, efficient laser power beaming infrastructures capable of overcoming lunar-specific challenges - including prolonged darkness and permanently shadowed regions - and enabling sustained robotic and crewed surface operations.</description>

      <title>Attosecond Transient Absorption Study of Coherent Hole Oscillation in Ar+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the observation, characterization, and control of the electron dynamics in ionized argon atoms. We utilized an intense mid-infrared (MIR) pulse to create a coherent superposition of the spin-orbit split ground state of the ion. A weak extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulse then probes the hole oscillation through time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy. We investigated several 3p to nd transitions accessible with our XUV high harmonics which show a 23fs beat corresponding to the energy separation between the initially populated states. The experimental attosecond transient absorption signals for different pathways were simulated using detailed TDSE simulations and perturbative analytic calculations. The analysis of phase relations between the oscillations reveals important information about transition dipole moments in the system. In addition, we employed another strong MIR pulse to achieve transient control over the absorption by inducing Stark shifts of the states without affecting the electronic coherences.</description>

      <title>MCP-Enabled LLM for Meta-optics Inverse Design: Leveraging Differentiable Solver without LLM Expertise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic differentiation (AD) enables powerful metasurface inverse design but requires extensive theoretical and programming expertise. We present a Model Context Protocol (MCP) assisted framework that allows researchers to conduct inverse design with differentiable solvers through large language models (LLMs). Since LLMs inherently lack knowledge of specialized solvers, our proposed solution provides dynamic access to verified code templates and comprehensive documentation through dedicated servers. The LLM autonomously accesses these resources to generate complete inverse design codes without prescribed coordination rules. Evaluation on the Huygens meta-atom design task with the differentiable TorchRDIT solver shows that while both natural language and structured prompting strategies achieve high success rates, structured prompting significantly outperforms in design quality, workflow efficiency, computational cost, and error reduction. The minimalist server design, using only 5 APIs, demonstrates how MCP makes sophisticated computational tools accessible to researchers without programming expertise, offering a generalizable integration solution for other scientific tasks.</description>

      <title>Quantum Wavefront Correction via Machine Learning for Satellite-to-Earth CV-QKD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art free-space continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) protocols use phase reference pulses to modulate the wavefront of a real local oscillator at the receiver, thereby compensating for wavefront distortions caused by atmospheric turbulence. It is normally assumed that the wavefront distortion in these phase reference pulses is identical to the wavefront distortion in the quantum signals, which are multiplexed during transmission. However, in many real-world deployments, there can exist a relative wavefront error (WFE) between the reference pulses and quantum signals, which, among other deleterious effects, can severely limit secure key transfer in satellite-to-Earth CV-QKD. In this work, we introduce novel machine learning-based wavefront correction algorithms, which utilize multi-plane light conversion for decomposition of the reference pulses and quantum signals into the Hermite-Gaussian (HG) basis, then estimate the difference in HG mode phase measurements, effectively eliminating this problem. Through detailed simulations of the Earth-satellite channel, we demonstrate that our new algorithm can rapidly identify and compensate for any relative WFEs that may exist, whilst causing no harm when WFEs are similar across both the reference pulses and quantum signals. We quantify the gains available in our algorithm in terms of the CV-QKD secure key rate. We show channels where positive secure key rates are obtained using our algorithms, while information loss without wavefront correction would result in null key rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we present a high-dimensional discrete modulated CV-QKD protocol, with dimension 2N , in optical fibers, where N is the number of optical modes. We use N-dimensional product states of weak coherent states that undergo perturbations along optical fibers and that are cancelled in a passive way (autocompensation) and then measured by a standard balanced homodyne detection. We analyze the security of this high-dimensional protocol when an intercept and resend attack is implemented with simultaneous homodyne measurement in both quadratures and the resulting secure key gains are calculated showing a significative increase with dimension.</description>

      <title>System design and realisation towards optimising secure key bits in free space QKD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is rapidly transitioning from cutting-edge laboratory research to real-world deployment in established communication networks. Although QKD promises future-proof security, practical challenges stil exist due to imperfections in physical devices. Many protocols offer strong security guarantees, but their implementation can be complex and difficult. To bridge this gap, we present a practical and systematic framework for implementing QKD, focused on the BB84 protocol but designed with broader applicability in mind. The article includes key concepts for device calibration, synchronisation,optical alignment, and key post-processing. We outline a simple algorithm for key sifting that is easily implementable in hardware. Our results highlight the importance of selecting the temporal window to optimise both the key rate and the quantum bit error rate (QBER). In addition, we show that random sampling of the sifted key bits for error estimation yields more reliable results than sequential sampling. We also integrate the Entrapped Pulse Coincidence Detection (EPCD) protocol to boost key generation rates, further enhancing performance. Although our work focuses on BB84, the techniques and practices outlined are general enough to support a wide range of QKD protocols. This makes our framework a valuable tool for both research and real-world deployment of secure quantum communication systems.</description>

      <title>Compressive Spectral Imaging in View of Earth Observation Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earth observation from space is an important scientific and industrial activity that has applications in many sectors. The instruments employed are often large, complex, and expensive. In addition, they generate large amounts of data, which is challenging for storage and transfer purposes. Compressive spectral imaging would be a cheaper, more efficient, and well-adapted technique to perform Earth observation. An interesting architecture is compressive spectral imaging with diffractive lenses, which is extremely compact. This work investigates the possibility of replacing the diffractive lens in this system with a classical refractive lens. Taking advantage of the chromatic aberration of a lens makes the use of expensive diffractive lenses unnecessary. Simulations are performed to test the feasibility of the method. Signal recovery is a basis pursuit solved using the Douglas-Rashford algorithm.</description>

      <title>Criteria for objects suitable for reconstruction from holograms and diffraction patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17350v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, quantitative criteria for reconstruction of objects from their hologram and diffraction patterns, and in particular for the phase objects in digital holography, are derived. The criteria that allow distinguishing the hologram and diffraction pattern are outlined. Gabor derived his criterion for objects suitable for holography based on the condition that the background in the reconstructed object's distribution should be nearly flat so that its intensity contrast does not exceed 0.05. According to Gabor, an opaque object is suitable for holographic reconstruction if it occupies no more than one percent of the imaged area, and a phase-shifting object cannot be reconstructed in principle. We revisit these criteria and show that both amplitude-only and phase-only objects can be reconstructed when the object occupies less than one percent of the total illuminated area. In addition, a simplified derivation of the criteria is provided that is based on Parseval's theorem. It is shown that for objects (including amplitude-only and phase-only) reconstructed from their holograms and the twin image treated as noise, the signal-to-noise ratio of 10 or higher can be achieved provided the object occupies less than 0.5 percent of the total illuminated area. When a hologram is reconstructed by applying iterative algorithms, the requirement for the object size is much more generous and identical to that applied in coherent diffraction imaging: any type of object (amplitude-only, phase-only, or amplitude-and-phase mixed properties) is suitable for holography when the object's size in each dimension is less than half of the probed region's extent (or the field of view).</description>

      <title>Curvature-adaptive gigapixel microscopy at submicron resolution and centimeter scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-area microscopy with submicron resolution is limited by tradeoffs between field of view (FOV), resolution, and imaging speed. Samples are rarely flat across centimeter-scale FOV, which often requires existing solutions to use mechanical scanning to ensure focused capture at reduced throughput. Here, we present PANORAMA, a single-shot, re-imaging microscope that achieves seamless, gigapixel imaging over a 16.3$\times$18.8 $\text{mm}^2$ FOV at 0.84 um resolution without mechanical scanning. By using a telecentric photolithography lens, a large-aperture tube lens, and a flat micro-camera array with adaptive per-camera focus control, PANORAMA maintains submicron focus across flat, curved or uneven samples that span centimeters. This approach improves imaging throughput and adaptability, enabling gigapixel multi-modal microscopy of large flat and non-flat samples in one shot, thus broadening its applications in biomedical and materials imaging.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the optical response from variant InGaN nanowires emitting within the green spectral gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study provides a comprehensive physical and optical investigation of InGaN nanowires (NWs) designed to address the challenges posed by the green gap region. We conduct a detailed analysis of the morphology, structure, and optical characteristics of the NWs using characterization techniques such as scanning electron microscopy, cathodoluminescence spectroscopy, and confocal scanning microscopy. Notably, increasing the indium concentration causes a redshift in emission and alters the luminescence properties across different segments of NWs. Our findings provide valuable insight into the correlation between indium compositional nonuniformity and the optical emission properties of NWs. These insights contribute to optimizing the growth condition, color accuracy, and enhancing optical efficiency of NWs, highlighting their potential for next generation high-performance LEDs and optoelectronics devices.</description>

      <title>Vortex Light at the Nanoscale: Twists, Spins, and Surprises -- A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For over three decades, the study of optical vortex beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) has been at the forefront of optics, driven by fundamental questions about optical momentum as well as diverse applications in quantum information, communications, and optical manipulation. Most work has focused on paraxial beams, whose transverse fields are accurately described by conventional wave optics and the Stokes formalism. By contrast, when light is confined to the nanoscale and tightly focused beyond the paraxial regime, vortex beams exhibit complex electromagnetic structures that transcend these conventional models. In this deeply non-paraxial regime, the resulting fields display rich and often counterintuitive behaviour, opening new perspectives on light-matter interactions. This review unifies the emerging physics of nanoscale optical vortices by developing a coherent theoretical framework and offering a critical synthesis of recent advances, guiding readers toward a deeper understanding and stimulating future work in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Can randomly structured metasurfaces be used for quantum tomography of high-dimensional spatial qudits?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing the density matrix of the quantum state of photons through a tomographically complete set of measurements, known as quantum state tomography, is an essential task in nearly all applications of quantum science and technology, from quantum sensing to quantum communications. Recent advances in optical metasurfaces enable the design of ultra-thin nanostructured optical elements performing such state tomography tasks, promising greater simplicity, miniaturization, and scalability. However, reported metasurfaces on this goal were limited to a small Hilbert dimension, e.g., polarization qubits or spatial qudits with only a few states. When scaling up to higher-dimensional qudit tomography problems, especially those involving spatial qudits, a natural question arises: whether a metasurface with randomized nanostructures is sufficient to perform such qudit tomography, achieving optimal conditions. In this work, we attempt to answer this question through a set of numerical experiments with random metasurfaces, utilizing large-scale simulations of over 11,000 distinct metasurfaces each exceeding 200 wavelengths in size. We show that with sufficient redundancy in the number of detectors, random metasurfaces perform reasonably well in quantum photonic spatial qudit tomography encoded in Hermite-Gaussian states for up to approximately 10 states. Furthermore, we discuss additional considerations for optimizing metasurfaces in multi-photon cases. Our work opens a pathway toward computationally efficient, miniaturized, and error-tolerant quantum measurement platforms.</description>
