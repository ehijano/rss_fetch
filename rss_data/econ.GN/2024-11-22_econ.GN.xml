      <title>Process and Policy Insights from Intercomparing Electricity System Capacity Expansion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study undertakes a detailed intercomparison of four open-source electricity system capacity expansion models--Temoa, Switch, GenX, and USENSYS--to examine their suitability for guiding U.S. power sector decarbonization policies. We isolate the effects of model-specific differences on policy outcomes and investment decisions by harmonizing empirical inputs via PowerGenome and systematically defining "scenarios" (policy conditions) and "configurations" (model setup choices). Our framework allows each model to be tested on identical assumptions for policy, technology costs, and operational constraints, thus distinguishing results that arise from data inputs or configuration versus inherent model structure. Key findings highlight that, when harmonized, models produce very similar capacity portfolios under each current policies and net-zero configuration, with less than 1 percent difference in system costs for most configurations. This agreement across models allows us to examine the impact of configuration choices. For example, configurations that assume unit commitment constraints or economic retirement of generators reveal the difference in investment decisions and system costs that arise from these modeling choices, underscoring the need for clear scenario and configuration definitions in policy guidance. Through this study, we identify critical structural assumptions that influence model outcomes and demonstrate the advantages of a standardized approach when using capacity expansion models. This work offers a valuable benchmark and identifies a few key modeling choices for policymakers, which ultimately will enhance transparency and reliability in modeling efforts to inform the clean energy transition for clean energy planning.</description>

      <title>Public sentiments on the fourth industrial revolution: An unsolicited public opinion poll from Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores public perceptions on the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) through an analysis of social media discourse across six European countries. Using sentiment analysis and machine learning techniques on a dataset of tweets and media articles, we assess how the public reacts to the integration of technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics, and blockchain into society. The results highlight a significant polarization of opinions, with a shift from neutral to more definitive stances either embracing or resisting technological impacts. Positive sentiments are often associated with technological enhancements in quality of life and economic opportunities, whereas concerns focus on issues of privacy, data security, and ethical implications. This polarization underscores the need for policymakers to engage proactively with the public to address fears and harness the benefits of 4IR technologies. The findings also advocate for digital literacy and public awareness programs to mitigate misinformation and foster an informed public discourse on future technological integration. This study contributes to the ongoing debate on aligning technological advances with societal values and needs, emphasizing the role of informed public opinion in shaping effective policy.</description>

      <title>The Role of Central Banks in Advancing Sustainable Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the pivotal role central banks play in advancing sustainable finance, a crucial component in addressing global environmental and social challenges. As supervisors of financial stability and economic growth, central banks have dominance over the financial system to influence how a country moves towards sustainable economy. The chapter explores how central banks integrate sustainability into their monetary policies, regulatory frameworks, and financial market operations. It highlights the ways in which central banks can promote green finance through sustainable investment principles, climate risk assessments, and green bond markets. Additionally, the chapter examines the collaborative efforts between central banks, governments, and international institutions to align financial systems with sustainability goals. By investigating case studies and best practices, the chapter provides a comprehensive understanding of the strategies central banks employ to foster a resilient and sustainable financial landscape. The findings underscore the imperative for central banks to balance traditional mandates with the emerging necessity to support sustainable development, ultimately contributing to the broader agenda of achieving global sustainability targets.</description>

      <title>Does the square-root price impact law belong to the strict universal scalings?: quantitative support by a complete survey of the Tokyo stock exchange market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universal power laws have been scrutinised in physics and beyond, and a long-standing debate exists in econophysics regarding the strict universality of the nonlinear price impact, commonly referred to as the square-root law (SRL). The SRL posits that the average price impact $I$ follows a power law with respect to transaction volume $Q$, such that $I(Q) \propto Q^{\delta}$ with $\delta \approx 1/2$. Some researchers argue that the exponent $\delta$ should be system-specific, without universality. Conversely, others contend that $\delta$ should be exactly $1/2$ for all stocks across all countries, implying universality. However, resolving this debate requires high-precision measurements of $\delta$ with errors of around $0.1$ across hundreds of stocks, which has been extremely challenging due to the scarcity of large microscopic datasets -- those that enable tracking the trading behaviour of all individual accounts. Here we conclusively support the universality hypothesis of the SRL by a complete survey of all trading accounts for all liquid stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) over eight years. Using this comprehensive microscopic dataset, we show that the exponent $\delta$ is equal to $1/2$ within statistical errors at both the individual stock level and the individual trader level. Additionally, we rejected two prominent models supporting the nonuniversality hypothesis: the Gabaix-Gopikrishnan-Plerou-Stanley and the Farmer-Gerig-Lillo-Waelbroeck models. Our work provides exceptionally high-precision evidence for the universality hypothesis in social science and could prove useful in evaluating the price impact by large investors -- an important topic even among practitioners.</description>

      <title>Wavelet Analysis of Cryptocurrencies -- Non-Linear Dynamics in High Frequency Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we perform some analysis for the probability distributions in the space of frequency and time variables. However, in the domain of high frequencies, it behaves in such a way as the highly non-linear dynamics. The wavelet analysis is a powerful tool to perform such analysis in order to search for the characteristics of frequency variations over time for the prices of major cryptocurrencies. In fact, the wavelet analysis is found to be quite useful as it examine the validity of the efficient market hypothesis in the weak form, especially for the presence of the cyclical persistence at different frequencies. If we could find some cyclical persistence at different frequencies, that means that there exist some intrinsic causal relationship for some given investment horizons defined by some chosen sampling scales. This is one of the characteristic results of the wavelet analysis in the time-frequency domains.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Shock Compensation in the Multi-layer Network of Global Food Production and Trade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global food production and trade networks are highly dynamic, especially in response to shortages when countries adjust their supply strategies. In this study, we examine adjustments across 123 agri-food products from 192 countries resulting in 23616 individual scenarios of food shortage, and calibrate a multi-layer network model to understand the propagation of the shocks. We analyze shock mitigation actions, such as increasing imports, boosting production, or substituting food items. Our findings indicate that these lead to spillover effects potentially exacerbating food inequality: an Indian rice shock resulted in a 5.8 % increase in rice losses in countries with a low Human Development Index (HDI) and a 14.2 % decrease in those with a high HDI. Considering multiple interacting shocks leads to super-additive losses of up to 12 % of the total available food volume across the global food production network. This framework allows us to identify combinations of shocks that pose substantial systemic risks and reduce the resilience of the global food supply.</description>
