      <title>Simultaneous real-time multispectral fluorescence and reflectance imaging for enhanced intraoperative guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intraoperative optical imaging is essential for surgical precision and patient safety, but current systems present anatomical and fluorescence information separately, causing delays and increasing cognitive load. A unified system for simultaneous visualization is critically needed to enhance guidance and efficiency. To develop and validate a multispectral imaging system that overcomes fragmented intraoperative imaging by simultaneously capturing and integrating white light reflectance and multiple fluorescence signals in real-time, enhancing surgical precision and safety. The system integrates two synchronized color cameras with optimized optical components, including custom filters and a beam splitter, tailored for clinically relevant fluorophores protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), fluorescein sodium, and indocyanine green (ICG). Advanced image processing techniques enhance visualization accuracy. Performance was evaluated using phantoms simulating clinical conditions. The system provided real time, simultaneous visualization of white light and multiple fluorescence signals without mode switching. Fluorescence emissions from PpIX, fluorescein sodium, and ICG were accurately separated using linear unmixing algorithms. Reflectance images showed high color fidelity, with Delta E values indicating imperceptible to barely perceptible differences compared to a conventional camera. Latency was minimal, ensuring immediate visual feedback suitable for intraoperative use. This multispectral imaging system addresses the limitations of fragmented intraoperative imaging by enabling continuous, real time, integrated visualization of anatomical and fluorescence information. It streamlines workflow, reduces cognitive load, and supports more precise interventions. By leveraging components similar to conventional surgical microscopes, it offers a practical, cost effective solution aligned with clinical needs.</description>

      <title>Scalable CVD Graphene Field-Effect Transistor Platform for Viral Detection: Application to COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid and global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), underscored the urgent need for fast, reliable, and adaptable diagnostic tools capable of responding to current and future viral threats. Early diagnosis is key to limiting transmission, and biosensors based on nanomaterials offer promising solutions for accurate and rapid bioanalyte detection. In this work, we present a scalable matrix of graphene-based field-effect transistors (GFETs) for the direct and rapid detection of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. High-quality graphene is functionalized in a single step with ACE2-His, enabling detection of the spike protein with a limit of detection as low as 1 fg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). A robust statistical analysis, based on measurements from approximately 70 devices per analyte concentration, demonstrates the reproducibility and reliability of the platform. This label-free, scalable, and reproducible COVID-19 antigen sensor can be readily adapted to detect emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants or other viral pathogens, offering a flexible approach for future diagnostic applications.</description>

      <title>Prior-Adapted Progressive Time-Resolved CBCT Reconstruction Using a Dynamic Reconstruction and Motion Estimation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cone-beam CT (CBCT) provides on-board volumetric anatomy for image guidance and treatment adaptation in radiotherapy. To compensate for respiration-induced anatomical motion, time-resolved CBCT is highly desired to capture the spatiotemporal anatomical variations but faces challenges in accuracy and efficiency due to substantial optimization needed in image reconstruction and motion modeling. We proposed a fast time-resolved CBCT reconstruction framework, based on a dynamic reconstruction and motion estimation method with new reconstructions initialized and conditioned on prior reconstructions in an adaptive fashion (DREME-adapt). DREME-adapt reconstructs a time-resolved CBCT sequence from a fractional standard CBCT scan while simultaneously generating a machine learning-based motion model that allows single-projection-driven intra-treatment CBCT estimation and motion tracking. Via DREME-adapt, a virtual fraction is generated from a pre-treatment 4D-CT set of each patient for a clean, 'cold-start' reconstruction. For subsequent fractions of the same patient, DREME-adapt uses pre-derived motion models and reference CBCTs as initializations to drive a 'warm-start' reconstruction, based on a lower-cost refining strategy. Three strategies: DREME-cs which drops the 'warm-start' component, DREME-adapt-vfx which uses a fixed initialization (virtual fraction's reconstruction results), and DREME-adapt-pro which initialize reconstructions through a progressive daisy chain scheme (virtual fraction for fraction 1, fraction 1 for fraction 2, and so on), were evaluated on a digital phantom study and a patient study. DREME-adapt allows fast and accurate time-resolved CBCT reconstruction and enhances the clinical adoption potential of the DREME framework.</description>

      <title>Commissioning, characterization and first high dose rate irradiations at a compact X-ray tube for microbeam and minibeam radiation therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09536</link>

Abstract: Minibeam and microbeam radiation therapy promise improved treatment outcomes through reduced normal tissue toxicity at better tumor control rates. The lack of suitable compact radiation sources limits the clinical application of minibeams to superficial tumors and renders it impossible for microbeams. We developed the first prototype of a compact line-focus X-ray tube (LFXT) with technology potentially suitable for clinical translation of minibeams and microbeams. We give an overview of the commissioning process preceding first operation, present optical and radiological focal spot characterization methods, and dosimetric measurements. Additionally, we report on first preclinical in vitro cell and in vivo mouse brain irradiations conducted with the LFXT prototype. The LFXT was high voltage conditioned up to 300 kV.The focal spot characterization resulted in a strongly eccentric electron distribution with a width of 72.3 $\mu$m. Dosimetry showed sharp microbeam dose profiles with steep lateral penumbras and a peak-to-valley dose ratio above 10 throughout a 70 mm thick PMMA phantom. An open-field dose rate of 4.3 Gy/s was measured at an acceleration voltage of 150 kV and a beam current of 17.4 mA at 150 mm distance from the focal spot. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated the feasibility of the LFXT for minibeam and microbeam applications with field sizes of 1.5-2 cm. The mice displayed no observable side effects after whole-brain 260 $\mu$m-minibeam irradiation. We successfully constructed and commissioned the first proof-of-concept LFXT prototype. Dosimetric characterizations of the achieved microbeam field showed the superiority of the LFXT compared to conventional X-ray tubes in terms of beam quality. In future developments, the remaining limitations of the prototype will be addressed for improved minibeam and first ever microbeam radiation therapy in a clinical setting.</description>

      <title>Online Dose Verification in VHEE Radiotherapy Using Bremsstrahlung Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Very high energy electrons (VHEE) in the 50-250 MeV range, delivered in short pulses at ultra-high dose rates, are proposed for clinical FLASH radiotherapy (RT) targeting deep-seated tumors. The clinical implementation of VHEE-FLASH RT requires online verification to optimize dose delivery. In this study we propose a novel online dose verification technique based on the detection of bremsstrahlung photons during VHEE interactions with matter. A polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) phantom was simulated to evaluate the dose deposited by a VHEE beam and to optimise the system design to detect the bremsstralung radiation. Experimental validation was performed at the Beam Test Facility at Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati (Isituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare-INFN). A deep learning pipeline was developed to reconstruct the dose distribution in the phantom based on the bremsstrahlung radiation profile. Experimental results demonstrated successful detection of bremsstrahlung radiation emitted orthogonally to the beam axis. The deep learning model achieved accurate dose reconstruction based on the bremsstrahlung radiation profile with a discrepancy of less than 2 percent compared to the simulated dose distribution. This study confirms that bremsstrahlung detection provides a viable online verification for VHEE RT.</description>
