      <title>Real-time raw signal genomic analysis using fully integrated memristor hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in third-generation sequencing have enabled portable and real-time genomic sequencing, but real-time data processing remains a bottleneck, hampering on-site genomic analysis due to prohibitive time and energy costs. These technologies generate a massive amount of noisy analog signals that traditionally require basecalling and digital mapping, both demanding frequent and costly data movement on von Neumann hardware. To overcome these challenges, we present a memristor-based hardware-software co-design that processes raw sequencer signals directly in analog memory, effectively combining the separated basecalling and read mapping steps. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, end-to-end memristor-based genomic analysis in a fully integrated memristor chip. By exploiting intrinsic device noise for locality-sensitive hashing and implementing parallel approximate searches in content-addressable memory, we experimentally showcase on-site applications including infectious disease detection and metagenomic classification. Our experimentally-validated analysis confirms the effectiveness of this approach on real-world tasks, achieving a state-of-the-art 97.15% F1 score in virus raw signal mapping, with 51x speed up and 477x energy saving compared to implementation on a state-of-the-art ASIC. These results demonstrate that memristor-based in-memory computing provides a viable solution for integration with portable sequencers, enabling truly real-time on-site genomic analysis for applications ranging from pathogen surveillance to microbial community profiling.</description>

      <title>A UAV-Aided Digital Twin Framework for IoT Networks with High Accuracy and Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the continued growth of its core technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), Big Data and data analytics, and edge computing, digital twin (DT) technology has witnessed a significant increase in industrial applications, helping the industry become more sustainable, smart, and adaptable. Hence, DT technology has emerged as a promising link between the physical and virtual worlds, enabling simulation, prediction, and real-time performance optimization. This work aims to explore the development of a high-fidelity digital twin framework, focusing on synchronization and accuracy between physical and digital systems to enhance data-driven decision making. To achieve this, we deploy several stationary UAVs in optimized locations to collect data from industrial IoT devices, which were used to monitor multiple physical entities and perform computations to evaluate their status. We consider a practical setup in which multiple IoT devices may monitor a single physical entity, and as a result, the measurements are combined and processed together to determine the status of the physical entity. The resulting status updates are subsequently uploaded from the UAVs to the base station, where the DT resides. In this work, we consider a novel metric based on the Age of Information (AoI), coined as the Age of Digital Twin (AoDT), to reflect the status freshness of the digital twin. Factoring AoDT in the problem formulation ensures that the DT reliably mirrors the physical system with high accuracy and synchronization. We formulate a mixed-integer non-convex program to maximize the total amount of data collected from all IoT devices while ensuring a constrained AoDT. Using successive convex approximations, we solve the problem, conduct extensive simulations and compare the results with baseline approaches to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Advances Towards a Realizable Quantum Lattice Boltzmann Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Lattice Boltzmann Method (QLBM) is one of the most promising approaches for realizing the potential of quantum computing in simulating computational fluid dynamics. Many recent works mostly focus on classical simulation, and rely on full state tomography. Several key algorithmic issues like observable readout, data encoding, and impractical circuit depth remain unsolved. As a result, these are not directly realizable on any quantum hardware. We present a series of novel algorithmic advances which allow us to implement the QLBM algorithm, for the first time, on a quantum computer. Hardware results for the time evolution of a 2D Gaussian initial density distribution subject to a uniform advection-diffusion field are presented. Furthermore, 3D simulation results are presented for particular non-uniform advection fields, devised so as to avoid the problem of diminishing probability of success due to repeated post-selection operations required for multiple timesteps. We demonstrate the evolution of an initial quantum state governed by the advection-diffusion equation, accounting for the iterative nature of the explicit QLBM algorithm. A tensor network encoding scheme is used to represent the initial condition supplied to the advection-diffusion equation, significantly reducing the two-qubit gate count affording a shorter circuit depth. Further reductions are made in the collision and streaming operators. Collectively, these advances give a path to realizing more practical, 2D and 3D QLBM applications with non-trivial velocity fields on quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>LLMs meet Federated Learning for Scalable and Secure IoT Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of IoT ecosystems introduces severe challenges in scalability, security, and real-time decision-making. Traditional centralized architectures struggle with latency, privacy concerns, and excessive resource consumption, making them unsuitable for modern large-scale IoT deployments. This paper presents a novel Federated Learning-driven Large Language Model (FL-LLM) framework, designed to enhance IoT system intelligence while ensuring data privacy and computational efficiency. The framework integrates Generative IoT (GIoT) models with a Gradient Sensing Federated Strategy (GSFS), dynamically optimizing model updates based on real-time network conditions. By leveraging a hybrid edge-cloud processing architecture, our approach balances intelligence, scalability, and security in distributed IoT environments. Evaluations on the IoT-23 dataset demonstrate that our framework improves model accuracy, reduces response latency, and enhances energy efficiency, outperforming traditional FL techniques (i.e., FedAvg, FedOpt). These findings highlight the potential of integrating LLM-powered federated learning into large-scale IoT ecosystems, paving the way for more secure, scalable, and adaptive IoT management solutions.</description>

      <title>Modular Compilation for Quantum Chiplet Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08478v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As quantum computing technology matures, industry is adopting modular quantum architectures to keep quantum scaling on the projected path and meet performance targets. However, the complexity of chiplet-based quantum devices, coupled with their growing size, presents an imminent scalability challenge for quantum compilation. Contemporary compilation methods are not well-suited to chiplet architectures - in particular, existing qubit allocation methods are often unable to contend with inter-chiplet links, which don't necessarily support a universal basis gate set. Furthermore, existing methods of logical-to-physical qubit placement, swap insertion (routing), unitary synthesis, and/or optimization, are typically not designed for qubit links of significantly varying latency or fidelity. In this work, we propose SEQC, a hierarchical parallelized compilation pipeline optimized for chiplet-based quantum systems, including several novel methods for qubit placement, qubit routing, and circuit optimization. SEQC attains a $9.3\%$ average increase in circuit fidelity (up to $49.99\%$). Additionally, owing to its ability to parallelize compilation, SEQC achieves $3.27\times$ faster compilation on average (up to $6.74\times$) over a chiplet-unaware Qiskit baseline.</description>

      <title>GainSight: Application-Guided Profiling for Composing Heterogeneous On-Chip Memories in AI Hardware Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As AI workloads drive soaring memory requirements, there is a need for higher-density on-chip memory for domain-specific accelerators that goes beyond what current SRAM technology can provide. We motivate that algorithms and application behavior should guide the composition of heterogeneous on-chip memories. However, there has been little work in factoring dynamic application profiles into such design decisions. We present GainSight, a profiling framework that analyzes fine-grained memory access patterns and computes data lifetimes in domain-specific accelerators. By combining instrumentation and simulation across retargetable hardware backends, GainSight aligns heterogeneous memory designs with workload-specific traffic and lifetime metrics. Case studies on MLPerf Inference and PolyBench workloads using NVIDIA H100 GPUs and systolic arrays reveal key insights: (1) 40% of L1 and 18% of L2 GPU cache accesses, and 79% of systolic array scratchpad accesses across profiled workloads are short-lived and suitable for silicon-based gain cell RAM (Si-GCRAM); (2) Si-GCRAM reduces active energy by 11-28% compared to SRAM; (3) Up to 90% of GPU cache fetches are never reused, highlighting inefficiencies in terms of cache pollution. These insights that GainSight provides can be used to better understand the design spaces of both emerging on-chip memories and software algorithmic optimizations for the next generation of AI accelerators.</description>
