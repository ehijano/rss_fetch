      <title>Volume preservation of Butcher series methods from the operad viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a coloured operad involving rooted trees and directed cycles of rooted trees that generalizes the operad of rooted trees of Chapoton and Livernet. We describe all the relations between the generators of a certain suboperad of that operad, and compute the Chevalley-Eilenberg homology of two naturally arising differential graded Lie algebras. This allows us to give short and conceptual new proofs of two important results on Butcher series methods of numerical solution of ODEs: absence of volume-preserving integration schemes and the acyclicity of the aromatic bicomplex, the key step in a complete classification of volume-preserving integration schemes using the so called aromatic Butcher series.</description>

      <title>Closed subcategories of quotient categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spectrum of closed subcategories in a quasi-scheme, i.e. a Grothendieck category $X$. The closed subcategories are the direct analogs of closed subschemes in the commutative case, in the sense that when $X$ is the category of quasi-coherent sheaves on a quasi-projective scheme $S$, then the closed subschemes of $S$ correspond bijectively to the closed subcategories of $X$. Many interesting quasi-schemes, such as the noncommutative projective scheme Qgr-$B$ = Gr-$B$/Tors-$B$ associated to a graded algebra $B$, arise as quotient categories of simpler abelian categories. In this paper we will show how to describe the closed subcategories of any quotient category $X/Y$ in terms of closed subcategories of $X$ with special properties, when $X$ is a category with a set of compact projective generators.</description>

      <title>Homotopy type theory as a language for diagrams of $\infty$-logoses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that certain diagrams of $\infty$-logoses are reconstructed in homotopy type theory extended with some lex, accessible modalities, which enables us to use plain homotopy type theory to reason about not only a single $\infty$-logos but also a diagram of $\infty$-logoses. This also provides a higher dimensional version of Sterling's synthetic Tait computability -- a type theory for higher dimensional logical relations.</description>

      <title>Weakly invertible cells in a weak $\omega$-category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14907v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study weakly invertible cells in weak $\omega$-categories in the sense of Batanin-Leinster, adopting the coinductive definition of weak invertibility. We show that weakly invertible cells in a weak $\omega$-category are closed under globular pasting. Using this, we generalise elementary properties of weakly invertible cells known to hold in strict $\omega$-categories to weak $\omega$-categories, and show that every weak $\omega$-category has a largest weak $\omega$-subgroupoid.</description>

      <title>A Tangent Category Perspective on Connections in Algebraic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is an abstract notion of connection in any tangent category. In this paper, we show that when applied to the tangent category of affine schemes, this recreates the classical notion of a connection on a module (and similarly, in the tangent category of schemes, this recreates the notion of connection on a quasi-coherent sheaf of modules). By contrast, we also show that in the tangent category of algebras, there are no non-trivial connections.</description>

      <title>Correspondences between codensity and coupling-based liftings, a practical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kantorovich distance is a widely used metric between probability distributions. The Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality states that it can be defined in two equivalent ways: as a supremum, based on non-expansive functions into [0, 1], and as an infimum, based on probabilistic couplings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orthogonally, there are categorical generalisations of both presentations proposed in the literature, in the form of codensity liftings and what we refer to as coupling-based liftings. Both lift endofunctors on the category Set of sets and functions to that of pseudometric spaces, and both are parameterised by modalities from coalgebraic modal logic. A generalisation of the Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality has been more nebulous-it is known not to work in some cases. In this paper we propose a compositional approach for obtaining such generalised dualities for a class of functors, which is closed under coproducts and products. Our approach is based on an explicit construction of modalities and also applies to and extends known cases such as that of the powerset functor.</description>

      <title>Linear Arboreal Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10088v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Arboreal categories, introduced by Abramsky and Reggio, axiomatise categories with tree-shaped objects. These categories provide a categorical language for formalising behavioural notions such as simulation, bisimulation, and resource-indexing. In this paper, we strengthen the axioms of an arboreal category to exclude `branching' behaviour, obtaining a notion of `linear arboreal category'. We then demonstrate that every arboreal category satisfying a linearisability condition has an associated linear arboreal subcategory related via an adjunction. This identifies the relationship between the pebble-relation comonad, of Montacute and Shah, and the pebbling comonad, of Abramsky, Dawar, and Wang, and generalises it further. As another outcome of this new framework, we obtain a linear variant of the arboreal category for modal logic. By doing so we recover different linear-time equivalences between transition systems as instances of their categorical definitions. We conclude with new preservation and characterisation theorems relating trace inclusion and trace equivalence with different linear fragments of modal logic.</description>
