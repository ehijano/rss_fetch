      <title>Algebra bundles, projective flatness and rationally-deformed tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that isomorphism classes $[\mathcal{A}]$ of flat $q\times q$ matrix bundles $\mathcal{A}$ (or projectively flat rank-$q$ complex vector bundles $\mathcal{E}$) on a pro-torus $\mathbb{T}$ are in bijective correspondence with the \v{C}ech cohomology group $H^2(\mathbb{T},\mu_q:=\text{$q^{th}$ roots of unity})$ (respectively $H^2(\mathbb{Z})$) via the image of $[A]\in H^1(\mathbb{T},PGL(q,\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}}))$ through $H^1(\mathbb{T},PGL(q,\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}}))\xrightarrow{\quad}H^2(\mathbb{T},\mu(q,\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}}))$ (respectively the first Chern class $c_1(\mathcal{E})$). This is in the spirit of Auslander-Szczarba's result identifying real flat bundles on the torus with their first two Stiefel-Whitney classes, and contrasts with classifying spaces $B\Gamma$ of compact Lie groups $\Gamma$ (as opposed to $\mathbb{T}^n\cong B\mathbb{Z}^n$), on which flat non-trivial vector bundles abound. The discussion both recovers the Disney-Elliott-Kumjian-Raeburn classification of rational non-commutative tori $\mathbb{T}^n_{\theta}$ with a different, bundle-theoretic proof, and sheds some light on the connection between topological invariants associated to $\mathbb{T}^2_{\theta}$, $\theta\in\mathbb{Q}$ by Rieffel and respectively H{\o}egh-Krohn-Skjelbred.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study equivariant Hurewicz fibrations, obtain their internal characteristics, and prove theorems on relationship between equivariant fibrations and fibrations generated by them. Local and global properties of equivariant fibrations are examined. An equivariant analog of the Hurewicz theorem on passing from local fibrations to global fibrations is proved. A classification of equivariant fibrations with the property of uniqueness of a covering path is given.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems for Verbose Persistence Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The persistence diagram is a central object in the study of persistent homology and has also been investigated in the context of random topology. The more recent notion of the verbose diagram (a.k.a. verbose barcode) is a refinement of the persistence diagram that is obtained by incorporating ephemeral persistence features as extra points along the diagonal. In this work, we initiate the study of random verbose diagrams. We establish a strong law of large numbers for verbose diagrams as a random point cloud grows in size -- that is, we prove the existence of a limiting verbose diagram, viewed as a measure on the half-plane on and above the diagonal. Also, we characterize its support and compute its total mass. Along the way, we extend the notion of the persistent Betti number, reveal the relation between this extended notion and the verbose diagram (which is an extension of the fundamental lemma of persistent homology), and establish results on the asymptotic behavior of the extended persistent Betti numbers.
  This work extends the main results of the work by Hiraoka, Shirai, and Trinh and its sequel by Shirai and Suzaki to the setting of verbose diagrams.</description>

      <title>The cohomology of $\mathbb{R}$-motivic $\mathcal{A}(2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the cohomology of the quotient algebra $\mathcal{A}(2)$ of the $\mathbb{R}$-motivic dual Steenrod algebra. We do so by running a $\rho$-Bockstein spectral sequence whose input is the cohomology of $\mathbb{C}$-motivic $\mathcal{A}(2)$. The purpose of our computation is that the cohomology of $\mathcal{A}(2)$ is the input to an Adams spectral sequence of a hypothetical $\mathbb{R}$-motivic modular forms spectrum. This Adams spectral sequence computes the homotopy groups of such an $\mathbb{R}$-motivic modular forms spectrum, which in turn can be used to make inferences about the homotopy groups of the $\mathbb{R}$-motivic sphere spectrum and eventually about the classical stable stems.</description>

      <title>A new approach to rational stable parametrized homotopy theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops a comprehensive algebraic model for rational stable parametrized homotopy theory over arbitrary base spaces. Building on the simplicial analogue of the foundational framework of May-Sigurdsson for parametrized spectra, and the homotopy theory of complete differential graded Lie algebras, we construct an explicit sequence of Quillen equivalences that translate the homotopy theory of rational spectra of retractive simplicial sets into the purely algebraic framework of complete differential graded modules over the completed universal enveloping algebra $\widehat{UL}$ of a Lie model $L$ of the base simplicial set $B$. Explicitly, there is a sequence of Quillen adjunctions $$ \mathbf{Sp}_B \leftrightarrows \mathbf{Sp}_L \leftrightarrows \mathbf{Sp}_{\widehat{UL}}^0 \leftrightarrows
  \mathbf{cdgm}_{\widehat{UL}} $$ which induces a natural, strong monoidal equivalence of categories $$
  {\rm Ho}\,\mathbf{Sp}_B^{\Bbb Q}\cong {\rm Ho}\, \mathbf{cdgm}_{\widehat{UL}}.
  $$ This equivalence is highly effective in practice as it provides direct computational access to invariants of simplicial spectra by translating them into homotopy invariants of $\widehat{UL}$-modules. Here $\mathbf{Sp}_B$ denotes the stable model category of spectra of retractive simplicial sets over $B$, $\mathbf{Sp}_L$ denotes the stable model category of spectra of retractive complete differential graded Lie algebras over $L$, $\mathbf{Sp}_{\widehat{UL}}^0$ denotes the stable model category of connected $\widehat{UL}$-module spectra, and $\mathbf{cdgm}_{\widehat{UL}}$ denotes the category of complete differential graded $\widehat{UL}$-modules.</description>

Abstract: We prove the conjecture of James W. Cannon and Gregory R. Conner that the fundamental group of the Griffiths double cone space is isomorphic to that of the harmonic archipelago. From this and earlier work in this area, we conclude that the isomorphism class of these groups is quite large and includes groups with a great variety of descriptions.</description>

      <title>Cohomological Calibration and Curvature Constraints on Product Manifolds: A Topological Lower Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a quantitative relationship between mixed cohomology classes and the geometric complexity of cohomologically calibrated metric connections with totally skew torsion on product manifolds. Extending the results of Pigazzini--Toda (2025), we show that the dimension of the off-diagonal curvature subspace of a connection $\nabla^C$ is bounded below by the sum of tensor ranks of the mixed K\"unneth components of its calibration class. The bound depends only on the mixed class $[\omega]_{\mathrm{mixed}}\in H^3(M;\mathbb{R})$, hence is topological and independent of the chosen product metric. This provides a computational criterion for geometric complexity and quantifies the interaction between topology and curvature, yielding a quantified version of ``forced irreducibility'' via the dimension of $\mathfrak{hol}_p^{\mathrm{off}}(\nabla^C)$.</description>

      <title>The \v{C}ech homotopy groups of a shrinking wedge of spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the \v{C}ech homotopy groups of the $m$-dimensional infinite earring space $\mathbb{E}_m$, i.e. a shrinking wedge of $m$-spheres. In particular, for all $n,m\geq 2$, we prove that $\check{\pi}_n(\mathbb{E}_m)$ is isomorphic to a direct sum of countable powers of homotopy groups of spheres: $\bigoplus_{1\leq j\leq \frac{n-1}{m-1}}\left(\pi_{n}(S^{mj-j+1})\right)^{\mathbb{N}}$. Equipped with this isomorphism and infinite-sum algebra, we also construct new elements of $\pi_n(\mathbb{E}_m)$ with a view toward characterizing the image of the canonical homomorphism $\Psi_{n}:\pi_n(\mathbb{E}_m)\to \check{\pi}_{n}(\mathbb{E}_m)$. We prove that $\Psi_{n}$ is a split epimorphism when $n\leq 2m-1$ and we identify a candidate for the image of $\Psi_n$ when $n&gt;2m-1$.</description>

      <title>On integral extensions between the abelianization functor and its symmetric powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to study Ext-groups between certain functors defined on the category of finitely generated free groups. Rational Ext-groups between the abelianization functor and its symmetric powers are known, and are almost always equal to zero. Recently, using homotopical methods, Arone constructed an explicit bounded complex whose homology corresponds to the integral Ext-groups between the abelianization functor and its symmetric powers. The homology of this complex is far from being trivial. Using this complex, we explicitly calculate some of these Ext-groups. More precisely, we compute Ext^1, Ext^2, Ext^{d-1} and Ext^{d-2} between the abelianization functor and its dth symmetric power. We further explain how Arone's complex can be obtained from an explicit projective resolution of the abelianization functor. We compare our results with the computation of Ext-groups between functors from finitely generated free abelian groups, obtained by Franjou and Pirashvili. In particular, we obtain that the composition with the abelianization functor induces an isomorphism for the Ext^1 considered in this paper.</description>

      <title>The Negation Of Singer's Conjecture For The Sixth Algebraic Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09455v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr A$ be the Steenrod algebra over the field of characteristic two, $\mathbb F_2.$ Denote by $GL(q)$ the general linear group of rank $q$ over $\mathbb F_2.$ The algebraic transfer, introduced by W. Singer [Math. Z. 202 (1989), 493-523], is a rather effective tool for unraveling the intricate structure of the (mod-2) cohomology of the Steenrod algebra, ${\rm Ext}_{\mathscr A}^{q,*}(\mathbb F_2, \mathbb F_2).$ The Kameko homomorphism is one of the useful tools to study the dimension of the domain of the Singer transfer. Singer conjectured that the algebraic transfer is always a monomorphism, but this remains open for all homology degrees $q\geq 5.$ In this paper, by constructing a novel algorithm implemented in the computer algebra system OSCAR for computing $GL(q)$-invariants of the kernel of the Kameko homomorphism, we disprove Singer's conjecture for bidegree $(6, 6+36).$</description>

Abstract: We study the action of the orthogonal group on the little $n$-disks operads. As an application we provide small models (over the reals) for the framed little $n$-disks operads. It follows in particular that the framed little $n$-disks operads are formal (over the reals) for $n$ even and coformal for all $n$.</description>

      <title>Equivariant toric geometry and Euler-Maclaurin formulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16785v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider equivariant versions of the motivic Chern and Hirzebruch characteristic classes of a quasi-projective toric variety, and extend many known results from non-equivariant to the equivariant setting. The corresponding generalized equivariant Hirzebruch genus of a torus-invariant Cartier divisor is also calculated. Further global formulae for equivariant Hirzebruch classes are obtained in the simplicial context by using the Cox construction and the equivariant Lefschetz-Riemann-Roch theorem. Alternative proofs of all these results are given via localization at the torus fixed points in equivariant K- and homology theories. In localized equivariant K-theory, we prove a weighted version of a classical formula of Brion for a full-dimensional lattice polytope. We also generalize to the context of motivic Chern classes the Molien formula of Brion-Vergne. Similarly, we compute the localized Hirzebruch class, extending results of Brylinski-Zhang for the localized Todd class.
  We also elaborate on the relation between the equivariant toric geometry via the equivariant Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch and Euler-Maclaurin type formulae for full-dimensional simple lattice polytopes. Our results provide generalizations to arbitrary coherent sheaf coefficients, and algebraic geometric proofs of (weighted versions of) the Euler-Maclaurin formulae of Cappell-Shaneson, Brion-Vergne, Guillemin, etc., via the equivariant Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch formalism. Our approach, based on motivic characteristic classes, allows us to obtain such Euler-Maclaurin formulae also for (the interior of) a face, or for the polytope with several facets removed. We also prove such results in the weighted context, and for Minkovski summands of the given full-dimensional lattice polytope. Some of these results are extended to local Euler-Maclaurin formulas for the tangent cones at the vertices of the given lattice polytope.</description>

      <title>Classification of orientable torus bundles over closed orientable surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14138v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $g$ be a non-negative integer, $\Sigma _g$ a closed orientable surface of genus $g$, and $\mathcal{M}_g$ its mapping class group. We classify all the group homomorphisms $\pi _1(\Sigma _g)\to G$ up to the action of $\mathcal{M}_g$ on $\pi _1(\Sigma _g)$ in the following cases; (1) $G=PSL(2;\mathbb{Z})$, (2) $G=SL(2;\mathbb{Z})$. As an application of the case (2), we completely classify orientable $T^2$-bundles over closed orientable surfaces up to bundle isomorphisms. In particular, we show that any orientable $T^2$-bundle over $\Sigma _g$ with $g\geq 1$ is isomorphic to the fiber connected sum of $g$ pieces of $T^2$-bundles over $T^2$. Moreover, the classification result in the case (1) can be generalized into the case where $G$ is the free product of finite number of finite cyclic groups. We also apply it to an extension problem of maps from a closed surface to the connected sum of lens spaces.</description>

      <title>Functors on the category of finite sets revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11623v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the structure of the category of representations of $\mathbf{FA}$, the category of finite sets and all maps, mostly working over a field of characteristic zero. This category is not semi-simple and exhibits interesting features.
  We first construct the simple representations, recovering the classification given by Wiltshire-Gordon. The construction given here also yields explicit descriptions of the indecomposable projectives.
  These results are used to give a convenient set of projective generators of the category of representations of $\mathbf{FA}$ and hence a Morita equivalence result. This is used to explain how to calculate the multiplicities of the composition factors of an arbitrary object, based only on its underlying $\mathbf{FB}$-representation, where $\mathbf{FB}$ is the category of finite sets and bijections.
  This is applied to show how to calculate the morphism spaces between projectives in our chosen set of generators, as well as for a closely related family of objects (the significance of which can be shown by relative nonhomogeneous Koszul duality theory).</description>

Abstract: We study transformations between discrete Morse functions on a finite simplicial complex via birth-death transitions--elementary chain maps between discrete Morse complexes that either create or cancel pairs of critical simplices. We prove that any two discrete Morse functions $f_1$, $f_2$ on a finite simplicial complex $K$ are linked by a finite sequence of such transitions.As applications, we present alternative proofs of several of Forman's fundamental results in discrete Morse theory and study the topology of the space of discrete Morse functions.</description>
