      <title>Synthetic frequency-controlled gene circuits unlock expanded cellular states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural biological systems process environmental information through both amplitude and frequency-modulated signals, yet engineered biological circuits have largely relied on amplitude-based regulation alone. Despite the prevalence of frequency-encoded signals in natural systems, fundamental challenges in designing and implementing frequency-responsive gene circuits have limited their development in synthetic biology. Here we present a Time-Resolved Gene Circuit (TRGC) architecture that enables frequency-to-amplitude signal conversion in engineered biological systems. Through systematic analysis, we establish a theoretical framework that guides the design of synthetic circuits capable of distinct frequency-dependent responses, implementing both high-pass and low-pass filtering behaviors. To enable rigorous characterization of these dynamic circuits, we developed a high-throughput automated platform that ensures stable and reproducible measurements of frequency-dependent r esponses across diverse conditions. Using this platform, we demonstrate that these frequency-modulated circuits can access cellular states unreachable through conventional amplitude modulation, significantly expanding the controllable gene expression space in multi-gene systems. Our results show that frequency modulation expands the range of achievable expression patterns when controlling multiple genes through a single input, demonstrating a new paradigm for engineering cellular behaviors. This work establishes frequency modulation as a powerful strategy for expanding the capabilities of engineered biological systems and enhancing cellular response to dynamic signals.</description>

      <title>P2DFlow: A Protein Ensemble Generative Model with SE(3) Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological processes, functions, and properties are intricately linked to the ensemble of protein conformations, rather than being solely determined by a single stable conformation. In this study, we have developed P2DFlow, a generative model based on SE(3) flow matching, to predict the structural ensembles of proteins. We specifically designed a valuable prior for the flow process and enhanced the model's ability to distinguish each intermediate state by incorporating an additional dimension to describe the ensemble data, which can reflect the physical laws governing the distribution of ensembles, so that the prior knowledge can effectively guide the generation process. When trained and evaluated on the MD datasets of ATLAS, P2DFlow outperforms other baseline models on extensive experiments, successfully capturing the observable dynamic fluctuations as evidenced in crystal structure and MD simulations. As a potential proxy agent for protein molecular simulation, the high-quality ensembles generated by P2DFlow could significantly aid in understanding protein functions across various scenarios.

      <title>A fluorescent-protein spin qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optically-addressable spin qubits form the foundation of a new generation of emerging nanoscale sensors. The engineering of these sensors has mainly focused on solid-state systems such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. However, NVs are restricted in their ability to interface with biomolecules due to their bulky diamond host. Meanwhile, fluorescent proteins have become the gold standard in bioimaging, as they are genetically encodable and easily integrated with biomolecules. While fluorescent proteins have been suggested to possess a metastable triplet state, they have not been investigated as qubit sensors. Here, we realize an optically-addressable spin qubit in the Enhanced Yellow Fluorescent Protein (EYFP) enabled by a novel spin-readout technique. A near-infrared laser pulse allows for triggered readout of the triplet state with up to 44% spin contrast. Using coherent microwave control of the EYFP spin at liquid-nitrogen temperatures, we measure a spin-lattice relaxation time of $(141 \pm 5)$ {\mu}s, a $(16 \pm 2)$ {\mu}s coherence time under Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) decoupling, and a predicted oscillating (AC) magnetic field sensitivity with an upper bound of $183 \, \mathrm{fT}\, \mathrm{mol}^{1/2}\, \mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. We express the qubit in mammalian cells, maintaining contrast and coherent control despite the complex intracellular environment. Finally, we demonstrate optically-detected magnetic resonance at room temperature in aqueous solution with contrast up to 3%, and measure a static (DC) field sensitivity with an upper bound of $93 \, \mathrm{pT}\, \mathrm{mol}^{1/2}\, \mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. Our results establish fluorescent proteins as a powerful new qubit sensor platform and pave the way for applications in the life sciences that are out of reach for solid-state technologies.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of flow sensing in plankton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planktonic organisms, despite their passive drift in the ocean, exhibit complex responses to fluid flow, including escape behaviors and larval settlement detection. But what flow signals can they perceive? This paper addresses this question by considering an organism covered with sensitive cilia and immersed in a background flow. The organism is modeled as a spherical particle in Stokes flow, with cilia assumed to measure the local shear at the particle surface. This study reveals that, while these organisms can always measure certain components of the flow strain, bottom-heaviness is necessary to measure the horizontal component of vorticity. These findings shed light on flow sensing by plankton, contributing to a better understanding of their behavior.</description>

      <title>A Method for Fabricating CMOS Back-End-of-Line-Compatible Solid-State Nanopore Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state nanopores, nm-sized holes in thin, freestanding membranes, are powerful single-molecule sensors capable of interrogating a wide range of target analytes, from small molecules to large polymers. Interestingly, due to their high spatial resolution, nanopores can also identify tags on long polymers, making them an attractive option as the reading element for molecular information storage strategies. To fully leverage the compact and robust nature of solid-state nanopores, however, they will need to be packaged in a highly parallelized manner with on-chip electronic signal processing capabilities to rapidly and accurately handle the data generated. Additionally, the membrane itself must have specific physical, chemical, and electrical properties to ensure sufficient signal-to-noise ratios are achieved, with the traditional membrane material being SiNX . Unfortunately, the typical method of deposition, low-pressure vapour deposition, requires temperatures beyond the thermal budget of CMOS back-end-of-line integration processes, limiting the potential to generate an on-chip solution. To this end, we explore various lower-temperature deposition techniques that are BEOL-compatible to generate SiNx membranes for solid-state nanopore use, and successfully demonstrate the ability for these alternative methods to generate low-noise nanopores that are capable of performing single-molecule experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantifying information stored in synaptic connections rather than in firing patterns of neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A cornerstone of our understanding of both biological and artificial neural networks is that they store information in the strengths of connections among the constituent neurons. However, in contrast to the well-established theory for quantifying information encoded by the firing patterns of neural networks, little is known about quantifying information encoded by its synaptic connections. Here, we develop a theoretical framework using continuous Hopfield networks as an exemplar for associative neural networks, and data that follow mixtures of broadly applicable multivariate log-normal distributions. Specifically, we analytically derive the Shannon mutual information between the data and singletons, pairs, triplets, quadruplets, and arbitrary n-tuples of synaptic connections within the network. Our framework corroborates well-established insights about storage capacity of, and distributed coding by, neural firing patterns. Strikingly, it discovers synergistic interactions among synapses, revealing that the information encoded jointly by all the synapses exceeds the 'sum of its parts'. Taken together, this study introduces an interpretable framework for quantitatively understanding information storage in neural networks, one that illustrates the duality of synaptic connectivity and neural population activity in learning and memory.</description>

      <title>A physical perspective on lithium therapy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04455v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lithium salts have strong medical properties in neurological disorders such as bipolar disorder and lithium-responsive headaches. They have recently gathered attention due to their potential preventive effect in viral infections. Though the therapeutic effect of lithium was documented by Cade in the late 1940s, its underlying mechanism of action is still disputed. Acute lithium exposure has an activating effect on excitable organic tissue and organisms, and is highly toxic. Lithium exposure is associated with a strong metabolic response in the organism, with large changes in phospholipid and cholesterol expression. Opposite to acute exposure, this metabolic response alleviates excessive cellular activity.
  The presence of lithium ions strongly affects lipid conformation and membrane phase unlike other alkali ions, with consequences for membrane permeability, buffer property and excitability. This review investigates how lithium ions affect lipid membrane composition and function, and how lithium response might in fact be the body's attempt to counteract the physical presence of lithium ions at cell level. Ideas for further research in microbiology and drug development are discussed.</description>

      <title>A Mechanical Route for Cooperative Transport in Autonomous Robotic Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cooperative transport is a striking phenomenon where multiple agents join forces to transit a payload too heavy for the individual. While social animals such as ants are routinely observed to coordinate transport at scale, reproducing the effect in artificial swarms remains challenging, as it requires synchronization in a noisy many-body system. Here we show that cooperative transport spontaneously emerges in swarms of stochastic self-propelled robots. Robots deprived of sensing and communication, are isotropically initialized around a passive circular payload, where directional motion is not expected without an external cue. And yet it moves. We find that a minute modification to the mechanical design of the individual agent dramatically changes its alignment response to an external force. We then show experimentally that by controlling the individual's friction and mass distribution, a swarm of active particles autonomously cooperates in the directional transport of larger objects. Surprisingly, transport increases with increasing payload size, and its persistence surpasses the persistence of the active particles by over an order of magnitude. A mechanical, coarse-grained description reveals that force-alignment is intrinsic and captured by a signed, charge-like parameter with units of curvature. Numerical simulations of swarms of active particles with a negative active charge corroborate the experimental findings. We analytically derive a geometrical criterion for cooperative transport which results from a bifurcation in a non-linear dynamical system. Our findings generalize existing models of active particles, offer new design rules for distributed robotic systems, and shed light on cooperation in natural swarms.</description>

      <title>Active morphodynamics of intracellular organelles in the trafficking pathway</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From the Golgi apparatus to endosomes, organelles in the endomembrane system exhibit complex and varied morphologies that are often related to their function. Such membrane-bound organelles operate far from equilibrium due to directed fluxes of smaller trafficking vesicles; the physical principles governing the emergence and maintenance of these structures have thus remained elusive. By understanding individual fission and fusion events in terms of active mechano-chemical cycles, we show how such trafficking manifests at the hydrodynamic scale, resulting not only in fluxes of material -- such as membrane area and encapsulated volume -- but also in active stresses that drive momentum transfer between an organelle and its cytosolic environment. Due to the fluid and deformable nature of the bounding membrane, this gives rise to novel physics, coupling nonequilibrium forces to organelle composition, morphology and hydrodynamic flows. We demonstrate how both stable compartment drift and ramified sac-like morphologies, each reminiscent of Golgi-cisternae, emerge naturally from the same underlying nonequilibrium dynamics of fission and fusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2023, Lubineau et al. published an article [1] detailing several experiments carried out with dyslexic readers. These authors attempted to measure the change in reading performance under different reading conditions using flickering devices. Beyond the low-frequency systems which have nevertheless shown their interest for some cases, we restrict here our response to the high-frequency systems, i.e. electronically controlled glasses (Lexilens) and lamps, designed and built upon recent work by Le Floch and Ropars [2]. Lubineau et al. found no significant change in reading performance at either low or high frequencies and concluded that these devices provide no or minor benefits. Unfortunately, experimental misunderstandings and some methodological issues invalidate namely the main conclusion concerning the high frequency systems.</description>
