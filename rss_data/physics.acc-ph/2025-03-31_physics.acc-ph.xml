      <title>Electron Acceleration by the Axisymmetric TE$_{011}$ Mode in a Slowly Varying External Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the autoresonant acceleration of electrons using the GYRAC mechanism in a cylindrical cavity excited in the TE$_{011}$ microwave mode, under a slowly increasing external magnetic field. The acceleration process is driven by the interaction between electrons and the right-hand circularly polarized (RHP) component of the electric field, maintained in phase through electron cyclotron resonance (ECR). A simplified single-particle model and numerical simulations based on the relativistic Newton-Lorentz equation were employed to evaluate particle dynamics under different values of the magnetic field growth parameter $ \alpha $.
  The results demonstrate that efficient trapping and energy transfer can be achieved for appropriate values of $ \alpha $, and that the spatial non-uniformity of the TE$_{011}$ mode introduces critical sensitivity to initial particle positioning. The study further identifies a ring-shaped region in which electrons are consistently captured in the GYRAC regime, and shows how the evolution of the Larmor radius, phase shift, and energy distribution depends on the electromagnetic configuration.
  Simulations involving disk-like and ring-like electron clouds reveal the fraction of captured, escaped, and uncaptured particles, confirming that precise control of the magnetic field variation is essential to optimize the efficiency of the acceleration process. These findings provide a basis for future self-consistent plasma simulations and support the development of compact radiation sources based on GYRAC-TE$_{011}$ acceleration.</description>

      <title>Leaky surface plasmon-based wakefield acceleration in nanostructured carbon nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metallic carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can provide ultra-dense, homogeneous plasma capable of sustaining resonant plasma waves-known as plasmons-with ultra-high field amplitudes. These waves can be efficiently driven by either high-intensity laser pulses or high-density relativistic charged particle beams. In this study, we use numerical simulations to propose that electrons and positrons can be accelerated in wakefields generated by the leaky electromagnetic field of surface plasmons. These plasmons are excited when a high-intensity optical laser pulse propagates paraxially through a cylindrical vacuum channel structured within a CNT forest. The wakefield is stably sustained by a non-evanescent longitudinal field with $\si{TV/m}$-level amplitudes. This mechanism differs significantly from the plasma wakefield generation in uniform gaseous plasmas. Traveling at the speed of light in vacuum, with phase-matched focusing fields, the wakefield acceleration is highly efficient for both electron and positron beams. We also examine two potential electron injection mechanisms: edge injection and self-injection. Both mechanisms are feasible with current laser facilities, paving the way for experimental realization. Beyond presenting a promising pathway toward ultra-compact, high-energy solid-state plasma particle accelerators, this work also expands the potential of high-energy plasmonics.</description>
