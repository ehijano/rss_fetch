      <title>CLAIP-Emo: Parameter-Efficient Adaptation of Language-supervised models for In-the-Wild Audiovisual Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audiovisual emotion recognition (AVER) in the wild is still hindered by pose variation, occlusion, and background noise. Prevailing methods primarily rely on large-scale domain-specific pre-training, which is costly and often mismatched to real-world affective data. To address this, we present CLAIP-Emo, a modular framework that reframes in-the-wild AVER as a parameter-efficient adaptation of language-supervised foundation models (CLIP/CLAP). Specifically, it (i) preserves language-supervised priors by freezing CLIP/CLAP backbones and performing emotion-oriented adaptation via LoRA (updating \ensuremath{\le}4.0\% of the total parameters), (ii) allocates temporal modeling asymmetrically, employing a lightweight Transformer for visual dynamics while applying mean pooling for audio prosody, and (iii) applies a simple fusion head for prediction. On DFEW and MAFW, CLAIP-Emo (ViT-L/14) achieves 80.14\% and 61.18\% weighted average recall with only 8M training parameters, setting a new state of the art. Our findings suggest that parameter-efficient adaptation of language-supervised foundation models provides a scalable alternative to domain-specific pre-training for real-world AVER. The code and models will be available at \href{https://github.com/MSA-LMC/CLAIP-Emo}{https://github.com/MSA-LMC/CLAIP-Emo}.</description>

      <title>MMED: A Multimodal Micro-Expression Dataset based on Audio-Visual Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are crucial leakages of concealed emotion, yet their study has been constrained by a reliance on silent, visual-only data. To solve this issue, we introduce two principal contributions. First, MMED, to our knowledge, is the first dataset capturing the spontaneous vocal cues that co-occur with MEs in ecologically valid, high-stakes interactions. Second, the Asymmetric Multimodal Fusion Network (AMF-Net) is a novel method that effectively fuses a global visual summary with a dynamic audio sequence via an asymmetric cross-attention framework. Rigorous Leave-One-Subject-Out Cross-Validation (LOSO-CV) experiments validate our approach, providing conclusive evidence that audio offers critical, disambiguating information for ME analysis. Collectively, the MMED dataset and our AMF-Net method provide valuable resources and a validated analytical approach for micro-expression recognition.</description>

      <title>Music4All A+A: A Multimodal Dataset for Music Information Retrieval Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music is characterized by aspects related to different modalities, such as the audio signal, the lyrics, or the music video clips. This has motivated the development of multimodal datasets and methods for Music Information Retrieval (MIR) tasks such as genre classification or autotagging. Music can be described at different levels of granularity, for instance defining genres at the level of artists or music albums. However, most datasets for multimodal MIR neglect this aspect and provide data at the level of individual music tracks. We aim to fill this gap by providing Music4All Artist and Album (Music4All A+A), a dataset for multimodal MIR tasks based on music artists and albums. Music4All A+A is built on top of the Music4All-Onion dataset, an existing track-level dataset for MIR tasks. Music4All A+A provides metadata, genre labels, image representations, and textual descriptors for 6,741 artists and 19,511 albums. Furthermore, since Music4All A+A is built on top of Music4All-Onion, it allows access to other multimodal data at the track level, including user--item interaction data. This renders Music4All A+A suitable for a broad range of MIR tasks, including multimodal music recommendation, at several levels of granularity. To showcase the use of Music4All A+A, we carry out experiments on multimodal genre classification of artists and albums, including an analysis in missing-modality scenarios, and a quantitative comparison with genre classification in the movie domain. Our experiments show that images are more informative for classifying the genres of artists and albums, and that several multimodal models for genre classification struggle in generalizing across domains. We provide the code to reproduce our experiments at https://github.com/hcai-mms/Music4All-A-A, the dataset is linked in the repository and provided open-source under a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.</description>

      <title>SpeechWeave: Diverse Multilingual Synthetic Text &amp; Audio Data Generation Pipeline for Training Text to Speech Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-quality Text-to-Speech (TTS) model training requires extensive and diverse text and speech data. It is challenging to procure such data from real sources due to issues of domain specificity, licensing, and scalability. Large language models (LLMs) can certainly generate textual data, but they create repetitive text with insufficient variation in the prompt during the generation process. Another important aspect in TTS training data is text normalization. Tools for normalization might occasionally introduce anomalies or overlook valuable patterns, and thus impact data quality. Furthermore, it is also impractical to rely on voice artists for large scale speech recording in commercial TTS systems with standardized voices. To address these challenges, we propose SpeechWeave, a synthetic speech data generation pipeline that is capable of automating the generation of multilingual, domain-specific datasets for training TTS models. Our experiments reveal that our pipeline generates data that is 10-48% more diverse than the baseline across various linguistic and phonetic metrics, along with speaker-standardized speech audio while generating approximately 97% correctly normalized text. Our approach enables scalable, high-quality data generation for TTS training, improving diversity, normalization, and voice consistency in the generated datasets.</description>

      <title>AToken: A Unified Tokenizer for Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present AToken, the first unified visual tokenizer that achieves both high-fidelity reconstruction and semantic understanding across images, videos, and 3D assets. Unlike existing tokenizers that specialize in either reconstruction or understanding for single modalities, AToken encodes these diverse visual inputs into a shared 4D latent space, unifying both tasks and modalities in a single framework. Specifically, we introduce a pure transformer architecture with 4D rotary position embeddings to process visual inputs of arbitrary resolutions and temporal durations. To ensure stable training, we introduce an adversarial-free training objective that combines perceptual and Gram matrix losses, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. By employing a progressive training curriculum, AToken gradually expands from single images, videos, and 3D, and supports both continuous and discrete latent tokens. AToken achieves 0.21 rFID with 82.2% ImageNet accuracy for images, 3.01 rFVD with 32.6% MSRVTT retrieval for videos, and 28.19 PSNR with 90.9% classification accuracy for 3D. In downstream applications, AToken enables both visual generation tasks (e.g., image generation with continuous and discrete tokens, text-to-video generation, image-to-3D synthesis) and understanding tasks (e.g., multimodal LLMs), achieving competitive performance across all benchmarks. These results shed light on the next-generation multimodal AI systems built upon unified visual tokenization.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Sight Trajectories: Tracking, Fusion, and Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a critical task in computer vision and autonomous systems, playing a key role in autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and virtual reality. Existing methods often rely on complete and noise-free observational data, overlooking the challenges associated with out-of-sight objects and the inherent noise in sensor data caused by limited camera coverage, obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised trajectories. These limitations pose safety risks and hinder reliable prediction in real-world scenarios. In this extended work, we present advancements in Out-of-Sight Trajectory (OST), a novel task that predicts the noise-free visual trajectories of out-of-sight objects using noisy sensor data. Building on our previous research, we broaden the scope of Out-of-Sight Trajectory Prediction (OOSTraj) to include pedestrians and vehicles, extending its applicability to autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and virtual reality. Our enhanced Vision-Positioning Denoising Module leverages camera calibration to establish a vision-positioning mapping, addressing the lack of visual references, while effectively denoising noisy sensor data in an unsupervised manner. Through extensive evaluations on the Vi-Fi and JRDB datasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both trajectory denoising and prediction, significantly surpassing previous baselines. Additionally, we introduce comparisons with traditional denoising methods, such as Kalman filtering, and adapt recent trajectory prediction models to our task, providing a comprehensive benchmark. This work represents the first initiative to integrate vision-positioning projection for denoising noisy sensor trajectories of out-of-sight agents, paving the way for future advances.

      <title>Two Web Toolkits for Multimodal Piano Performance Dataset Acquisition and Fingering Annotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Piano performance is a multimodal activity that intrinsically combines physical actions with the acoustic rendition. Despite growing research interest in analyzing the multimodal nature of piano performance, the laborious process of acquiring large-scale multimodal data remains a significant bottleneck, hindering further progress in this field. To overcome this barrier, we present an integrated web toolkit comprising two graphical user interfaces (GUIs): (i) PiaRec, which supports the synchronized acquisition of audio, video, MIDI, and performance metadata. (ii) ASDF, which enables the efficient annotation of performer fingering from the visual data. Collectively, this system can streamline the acquisition of multimodal piano performance datasets.</description>

      <title>MAVL: A Multilingual Audio-Video Lyrics Dataset for Animated Song Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18614v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lyrics translation requires both accurate semantic transfer and preservation of musical rhythm, syllabic structure, and poetic style. In animated musicals, the challenge intensifies due to alignment with visual and auditory cues. We introduce Multilingual Audio-Video Lyrics Benchmark for Animated Song Translation (MAVL), the first multilingual, multimodal benchmark for singable lyrics translation. By integrating text, audio, and video, MAVL enables richer and more expressive translations than text-only approaches. Building on this, we propose Syllable-Constrained Audio-Video LLM with Chain-of-Thought SylAVL-CoT, which leverages audio-video cues and enforces syllabic constraints to produce natural-sounding lyrics. Experimental results demonstrate that SylAVL-CoT significantly outperforms text-based models in singability and contextual accuracy, emphasizing the value of multimodal, multilingual approaches for lyrics translation.</description>

      <title>FreeAudio: Training-Free Timing Planning for Controllable Long-Form Text-to-Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-audio (T2A) generation has achieved promising results with the recent advances in generative models. However, because of the limited quality and quantity of temporally-aligned audio-text pairs, existing T2A methods struggle to handle the complex text prompts that contain precise timing control, e.g., "owl hooted at 2.4s-5.2s". Recent works have explored data augmentation techniques or introduced timing conditions as model inputs to enable timing-conditioned 10-second T2A generation, while their synthesis quality is still limited. In this work, we propose a novel training-free timing-controlled T2A framework, FreeAudio, making the first attempt to enable timing-controlled long-form T2A generation, e.g., "owl hooted at 2.4s-5.2s and crickets chirping at 0s-24s". Specifically, we first employ an LLM to plan non-overlapping time windows and recaption each with a refined natural language description, based on the input text and timing prompts. Then we introduce: 1) Decoupling and Aggregating Attention Control for precise timing control; 2) Contextual Latent Composition for local smoothness and Reference Guidance for global consistency. Extensive experiments show that: 1) FreeAudio achieves state-of-the-art timing-conditioned T2A synthesis quality among training-free methods and is comparable to leading training-based methods; 2) FreeAudio demonstrates comparable long-form generation quality with training-based Stable Audio and paves the way for timing-controlled long-form T2A synthesis. Demo samples are available at: https://freeaudio.github.io/FreeAudio/</description>
