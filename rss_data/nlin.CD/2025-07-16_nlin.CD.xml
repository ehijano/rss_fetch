      <title>Making rare events typical in $d$-dimensional chaotic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the deterministic nature of chaotic systems, fluctuations in their trajectories arise solely from the choice of initial conditions. Some of these dynamical fluctuations may lead to extremely unlikely scenarios. Understanding the impact of such rare events and the trajectories that give rise to them is of significant interest across disciplines. Yet, identifying the initial conditions responsible for those events is a challenging task due to the inherent sensitivity to small perturbations of chaotic dynamics. In a recent paper [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 227201 (2023)], this challenge was addressed by finding the effective dynamics that make rare events typical for one-dimensional chaotic maps. Here we extend such large-deviation framework to $d$-dimensional chaotic maps. Specifically, for any such map, we propose a method to find an effective topologically-conjugate map which reproduces the rare-event statistics in the long-time limit. We demonstrate the applicability of this result using several observables of paradigmatic examples of two-dimensional chaos, namely the two-dimensional tent map and Arnold's cat map.</description>

      <title>Chaos in a Nonequilibrium Two-Temperature (Tx, Ty) Nos\'e-Hoover Cell Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit a two-temperature Nos\'e-Hoover wanderer particle embedded in a two-dimensional periodic 2x2 cell with four smooth repulsive corners to explore chaos with anisotropic thermostatting. The model employs separate thermostats in the x and y directions, enabling controlled deviations from equilibrium. By integrating the full six-dimensional equations of motion and computing the complete Lyapunov spectrum, we confirm chaos and quantify phase-space contraction with high numerical precision. The total contraction rate, interpreted as entropy production, grows nonlinearly with the thermostat anisotropy and follows a superquadratic power law, $\Lambda\propto -\delta^{2.44}$, deviating from linear-response theory. The approximate Kaplan-Yorke dimension reveals a fractal attractor that concentrates as |Tx - Ty| increases. Momentum statistics show significant non-Gaussian behavior under strong driving. Despite its dissipative nature, the model remains strictly time-reversible, offering a pedagogically rich example of microscopic reversibility coexisting with macroscopic entropy production.</description>

      <title>SVD-based Causal Emergence for Gaussian Iterative Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Causal emergence (CE) based on effective information (EI) shows that macro-states can exhibit stronger causal effects than micro-states in dynamics. However, the identification of CE and the maximization of EI both rely on coarse-graining strategies, which is a key challenge. A recently proposed CE framework based on approximate dynamical reversibility utilizing singular value decomposition (SVD) is independent of coarse-graining but is limited to transition probability matrices (TPM) in discrete states. To address this problem, this article proposes a pioneering CE quantification framework for Gaussian iterative systems (GIS), based on approximate dynamical reversibility derived from the SVD of covariance matrices in forward and backward dynamics. The positive correlation between SVD-based and EI-based CE, along with the equivalence condition, are given analytically. After that, we can provide precise coarse-graining strategies directly from singular value spectrums and orthogonal matrices. This new framework can be applied to any dynamical system with continuous states and Gaussian noise, such as auto-regressive growth models, Markov Gaussian systems, and even SIR modeling by neural networks (NN). Numerical simulations on typical cases validate our theory and offer a new approach to studying the CE phenomenon, emphasizing noise and covariance over dynamical functions in both known models and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer entropy in non-integrable quantum evolutions</title>

Abstract: Entanglement and stabilizer entropy are both involved in the onset of complex behavior in quantum many-body systems. Their interplay is at the root of complexity of simulability, scrambling, thermalization and typicality. In this work, we study the dynamics of entanglement, stabilizer entropy, and the anti-flatness of the entanglement spectrum after a quantum quench in a spin chain. We find that free-fermion theories show a gap in the long-time behavior of these resources compared to their random matrix theory value while non-integrable models saturate it.</description>

      <title>Many-body quantum chaos and time reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate universal signatures of quantum chaos in the presence of time reversal symmetry (TRS) in generic many body quantum chaotic systems (gMBQCs). We study three classes of minimal models of gMBQCs with TRS, realized through random quantum circuits with (i) local TRS, (ii) global TRS, and (iii) TRS combined with discrete time-translation symmetry. In large local Hilbert space dimension $q$, we derive the emergence of random matrix theory (RMT) universality in the spectral form factor (SFF) at times larger than the Thouless time $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$, which diverges with system sizes in gMBQCs. At times before $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$, we identify universal behaviour beyond RMT by deriving explicit scaling functions of SFF in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, in the simplest non-trivial setting - preserving global TRS while breaking time translation symmetry - we show that the SFF is mapped to the partition function of an emergent classical ferromagnetic Ising model, where the Ising spins correspond to the time-parallel and time-reversed pairings of Feynman paths, and external magnetic fields are induced by TRS-breaking mechanisms. Without relying on the large-$q$ limit, we develop a second independent derivation of the Ising scaling behaviour of SFF using space-time duality and parity symmetric non-Hermitian Ginibre ensembles. Moreover, we show that many body effects originating from time-reversed pairings of Feynman paths manifest in the two-point autocorrelation function (2PAF), the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), and the partial spectral form factor - quantities sensitive to both eigenvalue and eigenstate correlations. We establish that the fluctuations of 2PAF are governed by an emergent three-state Potts model, leading to an exponential scaling with the operator support size, at a rate set by the three-state Potts model.

      <title>Hierarchical Synchronization and Distortion Scaling in Social Media Networks: A Fractal-Like Topology Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05769v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of social media as a dominant channel for information dissemination has intensified concerns over systemic information distortion, whereby content is progressively altered through successive layers of transmission. While prior studies have explored such distortion qualitatively, the quantitative interplay between propagation topology and stochastic cognitive perturbations remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we propose a novel fractal-inspired directed hierarchical network model to capture the structural patterns of propagation, and introduce a Noise-Frustrated Hegselmann-Krause (NFHK) framework to model opinion dynamics under noise. Analytical results, supported by group and graph theory, reveal that noise accumulation leads to increasing opinion distortion and the emergence of intra-layer synchronization. Multi-agent simulations confirm these effects, showing that noise intensity shapes both convergence rates and weak intra-layer clustering. Empirical validation using a representative retweet cascade demonstrates that the proposed model reproduces real-world distortion patterns and synchronization behaviors, even without direct links. This work uncovers a unified mechanism for information distortion in digital platforms and offers topology-aware insights for public opinion governance and platform regulation.</description>
