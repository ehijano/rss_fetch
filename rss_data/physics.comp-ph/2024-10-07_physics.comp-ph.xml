      <title>Vehicle Suspension Recommendation System: Multi-Fidelity Neural Network-based Mechanism Design Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanisms are designed to perform functions in various fields. Often, there is no unique mechanism that performs a well-defined function. For example, vehicle suspensions are designed to improve driving performance and ride comfort, but different types are available depending on the environment. This variability in design makes performance comparison difficult. Additionally, the traditional design process is multi-step, gradually reducing the number of design candidates while performing costly analyses to meet target performance. Recently, AI models have been used to reduce the computational cost of FEA. However, there are limitations in data availability and different analysis environments, especially when transitioning from low-fidelity to high-fidelity analysis. In this paper, we propose a multi-fidelity design framework aimed at recommending optimal types and designs of mechanical mechanisms. As an application, vehicle suspension systems were selected, and several types were defined. For each type, mechanism parameters were generated and converted into 3D CAD models, followed by low-fidelity rigid body dynamic analysis under driving conditions. To effectively build a deep learning-based multi-fidelity surrogate model, the results of the low-fidelity analysis were analyzed using DBSCAN and sampled at 5% for high-cost flexible body dynamic analysis. After training the multi-fidelity model, a multi-objective optimization problem was formulated for the performance metrics of each suspension type. Finally, we recommend the optimal type and design based on the input to optimize ride comfort-related performance metrics. To validate the proposed methodology, we extracted basic design rules of Pareto solutions using data mining techniques. We also verified the effectiveness and applicability by comparing the results with those obtained from a conventional deep learning-based design process.</description>

      <title>Fast Algorithm for Full-wave EM Scattering Analysis of Large-scale Chaff Cloud with Arbitrary Orientation, Spatial Distribution, and Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new fast algorithm optimized for full-wave electromagnetic (EM) scattering analysis of a large-scale cloud of chaffs with arbitrary orientation, spatial distribution, and length. By leveraging the unique EM scattering characteristics in chaff clouds, we introduce the {\it sparsification via neglecting far-field coupling} strategy, which makes an impedance matrix block-banded and sparse and thereby significantly accelerates thin-wire approximate method-of-moments solvers. Our numerical studies demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can estimate the monostatic and bistatic radar cross section (RCS) of large-scale chaff clouds much faster and with greater memory efficiency than the conventional multilevel fast multipole method, while retaining the high accuracy. This algorithm is expected to be highly useful for RCS estimation of large-scale chaff clouds in practical scenarios, serving as a cost-effective ground-truth generator.</description>

      <title>Complexity order of multiple resource algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithmic efficiency is essential to reducing energy use and time taken for computational problems. Optimizing efficiency is important for tasks involving multiple resources, for example in stochastic calculations where the size of the random ensemble competes with the time-step. We define the complexity order of an algorithm needing multiple resources as the exponent of inverse total error with respect to the total resources used. The optimum order c is predicted for cases involving competing, factorable resources. As an illustration, this is applied to computing averages in a stochastic differential equation, with numerical examples that agree with earlier literature, as well as with the more general analytic theory that is obtained here.</description>

      <title>Neural DDEs with Learnable Delays for Partially Observed Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many successful methods to learn dynamical systems from data have recently been introduced. Such methods often rely on the availability of the system's full state. However, this underlying hypothesis is rather restrictive as it is typically not confirmed in practice, leaving us with partially observed systems. Utilizing the Mori-Zwanzig (MZ) formalism from statistical physics, we demonstrate that Constant Lag Neural Delay Differential Equations (NDDEs) naturally serve as suitable models for partially observed states. In empirical evaluation, we show that such models outperform existing methods on both synthetic and experimental data.</description>

      <title>Rapid optimization in high dimensional space by deep kernel learning augmented genetic algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploration of complex high-dimensional spaces presents significant challenges in fields such as molecular discovery, process optimization, and supply chain management. Genetic Algorithms (GAs), while offering significant power for creating new candidate spaces, often entail high computational demands due to the need for evaluation of each new proposed solution. On the other hand, Deep Kernel Learning (DKL) efficiently navigates the spaces of preselected candidate structures but lacks generative capabilities. This study introduces an approach that amalgamates the generative power of GAs to create new candidates with the efficiency of DKL-based surrogate models to rapidly ascertain the behavior of new candidate spaces. This DKL-GA framework can be further used to build Bayesian Optimization (BO) workflows. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through the optimization of the FerroSIM model, showcasing its broad applicability to diverse challenges, including molecular discovery and battery charging optimization.</description>

      <title>Probing 3D Velocity Distributions Insights from a Vibrated Dual-Species Granular System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the velocity distributions in a vibrated binary granular gas system, focusing on how these distributions are influenced by the coefficient of restitution (CoR) and the inelasticity of particle collisions. Through molecular dynamics simulations, we examine the system's behavior for a range of CoR values below unity: specifically, 0.80, 0.85, 0.90, and 0.95. We track the evolution of velocity distributions as the system approaches a non-equilibrium steady state. Our findings reveal a clear departure from the classical Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, with increasing deviations as CoR decreases, indicating non-equipartition of energy between the two particle types. This behavior underscores the intricate dynamics inherent in inelastic collisions and highlights the significance of particle inelasticity in determining the system's velocity distributions. These results provide insight into non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and have implications for real-world applications where granular materials are subject to external vibrations.</description>

      <title>Assessing many-body methods on the potential energy surface of the (H$_2$)$_2$ hydrogen dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The anisotropic potential energy surface of the (H$_2$)$_2$ dimer represents a challenging problem for many-body methods. Here, we determine the potential energy curves of five different dimer configurations (T, Z, X, H, L) using the lattice regularized diffusion Monte Carlo (LRDMC) method and a number of approximate functionals within density functional theory (DFT), including advanced orbital-dependent functionals based on the random phase approximation (RPA). We assess their performance in describing the potential wells, bond distances and relative energies. The repulsive potential wall is studied by looking at the relative stability of the different dimer configurations as a function of an applied force acting along the intermolecular axis. It is shown that most functionals within DFT break down at finite compression, even those that give an accurate description around the potential well minima. Only by including exchange within RPA a qualitatively correct description along the entire potential energy curve is obtained. Finally, we discuss these results in the context of solid molecular hydrogen at finite pressures.</description>

      <title>Unmasking hidden ignition sources: A new approach to finding extreme charge peaks in powder processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Powders acquire a high electrostatic charge during transport and processing. Consequently, in the aftermath of dust explosions, electrostatic discharge is often suspected to be the ignition source. However, definite proof is usually lacking since the rise of electrostatic charge cannot be seen or smelled, and the explosion destroys valuable evidence. Moreover, conventional methods to measure the bulk charge of powder flows, such as the Faraday pail, provide only the aggregate charge for the entire particle ensemble. Our simulations show that, depending on the flow conditions, contacts between particles lead to bipolar charging. Bipolar charged powder remains overall neutral; thus, a Faraday pail detects no danger, even though individual particles are highly charged. To address this gap, we have developed a measurement technology to resolve the powder charge spatially. The first measurements have revealed a critical discovery: a localized charge peak near the inner wall of the conveying duct is 85 times higher than the average charge that would be measured using the Faraday pail. This finding underscores the possibility of extremely high local charges that can serve as ignition sources, even though they remain undetected by conventional measurement systems. Our new technology offers a solution by spatially resolving the charge distribution within powder flows, unmasking hidden ignition sources, and preventing catastrophic incidents in the industry.</description>

      <title>Compressing multivariate functions with tree tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks are a compressed format for multi-dimensional data. One-dimensional tensor networks -- often referred to as tensor trains (TT) or matrix product states (MPS) -- are increasingly being used as a numerical ansatz for continuum functions by "quantizing" the inputs into discrete binary digits. Here we demonstrate the power of more general tree tensor networks for this purpose. We provide direct constructions of a number of elementary functions as generic tree tensor networks and interpolative constructions for more complicated functions via a generalization of the tensor cross interpolation algorithm. For a range of multi-dimensional functions we show how more structured tree tensor networks offer a significantly more efficient ansatz than the commonly used tensor train. We demonstrate an application of our methods to solving multi-dimensional, non-linear Fredholm equations, providing a rigorous bound on the rank of the solution which, in turn, guarantees exponentially scaling accuracy with the size of the tree tensor network for certain problems.</description>

      <title>Physically Agnostic Quasinormal Mode Expansion in Time Dispersive Structures:from Mechanical Vibrations to Nanophotonic Resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resonances, also known as quasi normal modes (QNM) in the non-Hermitian case, play an ubiquitous role in all domains of physics ruled by wave phenomena, notably in continuum mechanics, acoustics, electrodynamics, and quantum theory. In this paper, we present a QNM expansion for dispersive systems, recently applied to photonics but based on sixty year old techniques in mechanics. The resulting numerical algorithm appears to be physically agnostic, that is independent of the considered physical problem and can therefore be implemented as a mere toolbox in a nonlinear eigenvalue computation library.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Fast Multipole Algorithm for Electromagnetic Scattering by Large Metasurfaces using Static Mode Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metasurfaces, consisting of large arrays of interacting subwavelength scatterers, pose significant challenges for general-purpose computational methods due to their large electric dimensions and multiscale nature. This paper introduces an efficient boundary element method specifically tailored for metasurfaces, leveraging the Poggio-Miller-Chang-Harrington-Wu-Tsai (PMCHWT) formulation. Our method combines the Multilevel Fast Multipole Algorithm (MLFMA) with a representation of the unknown equivalent surface current density by means of static modes, a set of entire domain basis functions dependent only on object shape but independent of the material and frequency. The compression of the number of unknowns enabled by the Static Mode Representation (SMR), combined with the \(\mathcal{O}(N \log N)\) complexity of MLFMA matrix-vector products, significantly reduces CPU time and memory requirements compared to classical MLFMA with RWG basis functions. We demonstrate the accuracy, time, and memory requirements of this method through several test cases including the full-wave simulation of a $100 \lambda \times 100 \lambda$ canonical metalens. The MLFMA-SMR method offers substantial benefits for the analysis and optimization of metasurfaces and metalenses.</description>

      <title>Tensorized orbitals for computational chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Choosing a basis set is the first step of a quantum chemistry calculation and it sets its maximum accuracy. This choice of orbitals is limited by strong technical constraints as one must be able to compute a large number of six dimensional Coulomb integrals from these orbitals. Here we use tensor network techniques to construct representations of orbitals that essentially lift these technical constraints. We show that a large class of orbitals can be put into ``tensorized'' form including the Gaussian orbitals, Slater orbitals, linear combination thereof as well as new orbitals beyond the above. Our method provides a path for building more accurate and more compact basis sets beyond what has been accessible with previous technology. As an illustration, we construct optimized tensorized orbitals and obtain a 85\% reduction of the error on the energy of the $H_2$ molecules with respect to a reference double zeta calculation (cc-pvDz) of the same size.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Crank-Nicolson and Method of Lines for the Solution of Initial Value Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07016v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we use a Variational Quantum Algorithm to solve Initial Value Problems with the Implicit Crank-Nicolson and the Method of Lines (MoL) evolution schemes. The unknown functions use a spectral decomposition with the Fourier basis. The examples developed to illustrate the implementation are the Advection equation, the wave equation written as a system of first order coupled equations and the viscous Burgers equation as a non-linear case. The problems are solved using: i) standard Finite Differences as the solution to compare with, ii) the State Vector Formalism (SVF), and iii) the Sampling Error Formalism (SEF). The contributions of this paper include: 1) cost functions for generic first order in time PDEs using the implicit Crank-Nicholson and the MoL, 2) detailed convergence or self-convergence tests are presented for all the equations solved, 3) a system of three coupled PDEs is solved, 4) solutions using sampling error are presented, which highlights the importance of simulating the sampling process and 5) a fast version of the SVF and SEF was developed which can be used to test different optimizers faster.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning for anisotropic p-adaptation and error estimation in high-order solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to automate and optimize anisotropic p-adaptation in high-order h/p solvers using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The dynamic RL adaptation uses the evolving solution to adjust the high-order polynomials. We develop an offline training approach, decoupled from the main solver, which shows minimal overcost when performing simulations. In addition, we derive an inexpensive RL-based error estimation approach that enables the quantification of local discretization errors. The proposed methodology is agnostic to both the computational mesh and the partial differential equation to be solved.
  The application of RL to mesh adaptation offers several benefits. It enables automated and adaptive mesh refinement, reducing the need for manual intervention. It optimizes computational resources by dynamically allocating high-order polynomials where necessary and minimizing refinement in stable regions. This leads to computational cost savings while maintaining the accuracy of the solution. Furthermore, RL allows for the exploration of unconventional mesh adaptations, potentially enhancing the accuracy and robustness of simulations. This work extends our original research, offering a more robust, reproducible, and generalizable approach applicable to complex three-dimensional problems. We provide validation for laminar and turbulent cases: circular cylinders, Taylor Green Vortex and a 10MW wind turbine to illustrate the flexibility of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Explain Like I'm Five: Using LLMs to Improve PDE Surrogate Models with Text</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is ubiquitous in science and engineering. Computational complexity and difficulty in writing numerical solvers has motivated the development of machine learning techniques to generate solutions quickly. Many existing methods are purely data driven, relying solely on numerical solution fields, rather than known system information such as boundary conditions and governing equations. However, the recent rise in popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled easy integration of text in multimodal machine learning models. In this work, we use pretrained LLMs to integrate various amounts known system information into PDE learning. Our multimodal approach significantly outperforms our baseline model, FactFormer, in both next-step prediction and autoregressive rollout performance on the 2D Heat, Burgers, Navier-Stokes, and Shallow Water equations. Further analysis shows that pretrained LLMs provide highly structured latent space that is consistent with the amount of system information provided through text.</description>
