      <title>Three expressions of the $n$-th prime number: discrete sieving, spectral analysis and probabilistic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for a closed-form expression of the $n$-th prime number, $p_n$, has long oscillated between the rigid determinism of analytic functions and the apparent randomness of local distributions. This paper explores three different approaches to $p_n$. The first one formalizes an analytical identity for $p_{n}$ based on a harmonic summation filtered by a M\"obius-derived coprimality indicator. Unlike Gandhi's 1971 identity, which employs a geometric density and logarithmic extraction, this formula operates through a discrete summation over the range defined by Bertrand's postulate. In the second one, we refine the ``harmonic resonance'' model, which posits that primes emerge as spectral nodes from von Mangoldt oscillations. Third, we adopt a ``survival dynamics'' approach, inspired by Mertens' theorems, treating prime spacing as an evolutionary growth process. By bridging these perspectives, we offer a comprehensive framework for understanding the transition from asymptotic trends to discrete arithmetic realities.</description>

      <title>Learning constitutive laws under explicit strain limits: An interpretable strain-limiting elasticity--Kolmogorov Arnold neural network framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A physically consistent framework for modeling materials with saturating deformation, such as elastomers and biological tissues, is provided by strain-limiting elasticity. Fundamental limitations of classical elasticity are addressed through the enforcement of bounded strains; however, significant challenges for data-driven learning are posed by the strong nonlinearity of these laws. In this work, an interpretable hybrid constitutive modeling framework integrating strain-limiting elasticity (SLE) with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) is proposed to balance mechanical admissibility with data-driven flexibility. The dominant nonlinear response is captured by the SLE backbone, while smooth residual corrections are learned exclusively via a KAN. Essential mechanical principles-including symmetry, monotonicity, and bounded strain-are embedded directly into the model structure to ensure physical admissibility. The framework is assessed on synthetic benchmarks, where near-exact recovery is achieved in smooth regimes and consistency is retained under sharp transitions. Application to Treloar's rubber elasticity data demonstrates systematic improvement in stress-stretch agreement while preserving explicit strain limits. A regime-based analysis reveals a transparent trade-off between data fidelity and mechanical admissibility, demonstrating that deviations arise from deliberately imposed physical restrictions rather than unconstrained model expressivity. This SLE-KAN framework offers a robust, physics-consistent alternative to black-box neural networks for constitutive modeling.</description>
