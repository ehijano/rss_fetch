      <title>One dimensional models for supercritical and subcritical transitions in rotating convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous study on natural and man made systems including rotating convection report the phenomena of supercritical and subcritical transitions from one state to another with the variation of relevant control parameters. However, the complexity of the rotating convection system even under the idealized Rayleigh-B\'enard geometry, hindered the simplest possible description of these transitions to convection. Here we present an one dimensional description of the stationary subcritical and supercritical transitions to rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection both for rigid and free-slip boundary conditions. The analysis of the one dimensional models and performance of three dimensional direct numerical simulations of the system show qualitatively similar results in a wide region of the parameter space. A brief discussion on time dependent convection of overstable origin is also presented.</description>

      <title>Associative memory by virtual oscillator network based on single spin-torque oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13198v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A coupled oscillator network may be able to perform an energy-efficient associative memory operation. However, its realization has been difficult because inhomogeneities unavoidably arise among the oscillators during fabrication and lead to an unreliable operation. This issue could be resolved if the oscillator network were able to be formed from a single oscillator. Here, we performed numerical simulations and theoretical analyses on an associative memory operation that uses a virtual oscillator network based on a spin-torque oscillator. The virtual network combines the concept of coupled oscillators with that of feedforward neural networks. Numerical experiments demonstrate successful associations of $60$-pixel patterns with various memorized patterns. Moreover, the origin of the associative memory is shown to be forced synchronization driven by feedforward input, where phase differences among oscillators are fixed and correspond to the colors of the pixels in the pattern.</description>
