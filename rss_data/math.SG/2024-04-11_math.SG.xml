      <title>Floer Homology with DG Coefficients. Applications to cotangent bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define Hamiltonian Floer homology with differential graded (DG) local coefficients for symplectically aspherical manifolds. The differential of the underlying complex involves chain representatives of the fundamental classes of the moduli spaces of Floer trajectories of arbitrary dimension. This setup allows in particular to define and compute Floer homology with coefficients in chains on fibers of fibrations over the free loop space of the underlying symplectic manifold. We develop the DG Floer toolset, including continuation maps and homotopies, and we also define and study symplectic homology groups with DG local coefficients. We define spectral invariants and establish general criteria for almost existence of contractible periodic orbits on regular energy levels of Hamiltonian systems inside Liouville domains.
  In the case of cotangent bundles, we prove a Viterbo isomorphism theorem with DG local coefficients. This serves as a stepping stone for applications to the almost existence of contractible closed characteristics on closed smooth hypersurfaces. In this context, our methods allow to access for the first time the dichotomy between closed manifolds that are aspherical and those that are not.</description>

      <title>Representability of Elliptic Moduli Problems in Derived $C^{\infty}$-Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study moduli spaces of solutions of nonlinear Partial Differential Equations on manifolds in the framework of derived $C^{\infty}$-geometry. For an arbitrary smooth stack $S$, we define $S$-families of nonlinear PDEs acting between $S$-families of submersions over an $S$-family of manifolds and show that in case the family of PDEs is elliptic and the base family of manifolds is proper over $S$, then the moduli stack of solutions is relatively representable by quasi-smooth derived $C^{\infty}$-schemes over $S$. Along the way, we develop tools to analyse the local structure of families of mapping stacks between manifolds and explain how to compare mapping stacks in smooth and in derived geometry. To access the notion of a family of PDEs over an arbitrary smooth base stack, we introduce a formalism of stacks of relative jets. Finally, we show how natural ideas from (higher) topos theory can be leveraged to facilitate the application of nonlinear Fredholm analysis to derived stacks of solutions of elliptic PDEs.</description>
