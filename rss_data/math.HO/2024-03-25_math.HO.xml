      <title>Revisiting the Sleeping Beauty problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sleeping Beauty problem is a probability riddle with no definite solution for more than two decades and its solution is of great interest in many fields of knowledge. There are two main competing solutions to the problem: the halfer approach, and the thirder approach. The main reason for disagreement in the literature is connected to the use of different probability spaces to represent the same probabilistic riddle. In this work, we analyse the problem from a mathematical perspective, identifying probability distributions induced directly from the thought experiment's rules. The precise choices of probability spaces provide both halfer and thirder solutions to the problem. To try and decide on which approach to follow, a criterion involving the information available to Sleeping Beauty is proposed.</description>

      <title>Helping students deal with Ethical Reasoning: The Proto-Guidelines for Ethical Practice in Mathematics as a deck of cards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tractenberg, Piercey, and Buell 2024 presented a list of 44 proto-Guidelines for Ethical Mathematical Practice, developed through examination of codes of ethics of adjacent disciplines and consultation with members of the mathematics community, and gave justifications for the use of these proto-Guidelines. We propose formatting the list as a deck of 44 cards and describe ways to use the cards in classes at any stage of the undergraduate mathematics program. A simple game or encounter with the cards can be used exclusively as an introduction, or the cards can be used repeatedly in order to help students move to higher levels of achievement with respect to the proto-Guidelines and ethical reasoning in general. We present, in Appendix A, a sample semester long sequence of assignments for such a purpose, with activities at various levels of Blooms taxonomy.</description>
