      <title>Accelerating true orbit pseudorandom number generation using Newton's method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The binary expansions of irrational algebraic numbers can serve as high-quality pseudorandom binary sequences. This study presents an efficient method for computing the exact binary expansions of real quadratic algebraic integers using Newton's method. To this end, we clarify conditions under which the first $N$ bits of the binary expansion of an irrational number match those of its upper rational approximation. Furthermore, we establish that the worst-case time complexity of generating a sequence of length $N$ with the proposed method is equivalent to the complexity of multiplying two $N$-bit integers, showing its efficiency compared to a previously proposed true orbit generator. We report the results of numerical experiments on computation time and memory usage, highlighting in particular that the proposed method successfully accelerates true orbit pseudorandom number generation. We also confirm that a generated pseudorandom sequence successfully passes all the statistical tests included in RabbitFile of TestU01.</description>

      <title>Splitting Regularized Wasserstein Proximal Algorithms for Nonsmooth Sampling Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sampling from nonsmooth target probability distributions is essential in various applications, including the Bayesian Lasso. We propose a splitting-based sampling algorithm for the time-implicit discretization of the probability flow for the Fokker-Planck equation, where the score function defined as the gradient logarithm of the current probability density function, is approximated by the regularized Wasserstein proximal. When the prior distribution is the Laplace prior, our algorithm is explicitly formulated as a deterministic interacting particle system, incorporating softmax operators and shrinkage operations to efficiently compute the gradient drift vector field and the score function. The proposed formulation introduces a particular class of attention layers in transformer structures, which can sample sparse target distributions. We verify the convergence towards target distributions regarding R\'enyi divergences under suitable conditions. Numerical experiments in high-dimensional nonsmooth sampling problems, such as sampling from mixed Gaussian and Laplace distributions, logistic regressions, image restoration with L1-TV regularization, and Bayesian neural networks, demonstrate the efficiency and robust performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Localized Ensemble Kalman Bucy Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we propose and develop a new methodology which is inspired from Kalman filtering and multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC), entitle the multilevel localized ensemble Kalman--Bucy Filter (MLLEnKBF). Based on the work of Chada et al. \cite{CJY20}, we provide an important extension on this which is to include the technique of covariance localization. Localization is important as it can induce stability and remove long spurious correlations, particularly with a small ensemble size. Our resulting algorithm is used for both state and parameter estimation, for the later we exploit our method for normalizing constant estimation. As of yet, MLMC has only been applied to localized data assimilation methods in a discrete-time setting, therefore this work acts as a first in the continuous-time setting. Numerical results indicate its performance, and benefit through a range of model problems, which include a linear Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process, of moderately high dimension, and the Lorenz 96 model, for parameter estimation. Our results demonstrate improved stability, and that with MLMC, one can reduce the computational complexity to attain an order is MSE $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$, for $\epsilon&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>On the computation of the cumulative distribution function of the Normal Inverse Gaussian distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain various series and asymptotic expansions involving the modified Bessel function of the second kind for the normal inverse Gaussian cumulative distribution function. The new expansions accelerate computations, complementing the numerical integration methods implemented in statistical software packages. We also provide a detailed description of the algorithm and its corresponding implementation in C++. The performance and accuracy of the algorithm are extensively tested and benchmarked with open-source implementations, offering superior accuracy and speed-ups of a factor from 5 to 60.</description>

      <title>Differential privacy guarantees of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to provide differential privacy (DP) guarantees for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. In a first part, we establish DP guarantees on samples output by MCMC algorithms as well as Monte Carlo estimators associated with these methods under assumptions on the convergence properties of the underlying Markov chain. In particular, our results highlight the critical condition of ensuring the target distribution is differentially private itself. In a second part, we specialise our analysis to the unadjusted Langevin algorithm and stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics and establish guarantees on their (R\'enyi) DP. To this end, we develop a novel methodology based on Girsanov's theorem combined with a perturbation trick to obtain bounds for an unbounded domain and in a non-convex setting. We establish: (i) uniform in $n$ privacy guarantees when the state of the chain after $n$ iterations is released, (ii) bounds on the privacy of the entire chain trajectory. These findings provide concrete guidelines for privacy-preserving MCMC.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent global sensitivity analysis of the Doyle-Fuller-Newman model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Doyle-Fuller-Newman model is arguably the most ubiquitous electrochemical model in lithium-ion battery research. Since it is a highly nonlinear model, its input-output relations are still poorly understood. Researchers therefore often employ sensitivity analyses to elucidate relative parametric importance for certain use cases. However, some methods are ill-suited for the complexity of the model and appropriate methods often face the downside of only being applicable to scalar quantities of interest. We implement a novel framework for global sensitivity analysis of time-dependent model outputs and apply it to a drive cycle simulation. We conduct a full and a subgroup sensitivity analysis to resolve lowly sensitive parameters and explore the model error when unimportant parameters are set to arbitrary values. Our findings suggest that the method identifies insensitive parameters whose variations cause only small deviations in the voltage response of the model. By providing the methodology, we hope research questions related to parametric sensitivity for time-dependent quantities of interest, such as voltage responses, can be addressed more easily and adequately in simulative battery research and beyond.</description>

      <title>Giga-scale Kernel Matrix Vector Multiplication on GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.01085v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel matrix-vector multiplication (KMVM) is a foundational operation in machine learning and scientific computing. However, as KMVM tends to scale quadratically in both memory and time, applications are often limited by these computational constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel approximation procedure coined \textit{Faster-Fast and Free Memory Method} ($\fthreem$) to address these scaling issues of KMVM for tall~($10^8\sim 10^9$) and skinny~($D\leq7$) data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $\fthreem$ has empirical \emph{linear time and memory} complexity with a relative error of order $10^{-3}$ and can compute a full KMVM for a billion points \emph{in under a minute} on a high-end GPU, leading to a significant speed-up in comparison to existing CPU methods. We demonstrate the utility of our procedure by applying it as a drop-in for the state-of-the-art GPU-based linear solver FALKON, \emph{improving speed 1.5-5.5 times} at the cost of $&lt;1\%$ drop in accuracy. We further demonstrate competitive results on \emph{Gaussian Process regression} coupled with significant speedups on a variety of real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>A flexible Bayesian g-formula for causal survival analyses with time-dependent confounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02306v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In longitudinal observational studies with time-to-event outcomes, a common objective in causal analysis is to estimate the causal survival curve under hypothetical intervention scenarios. The g-formula is a useful tool for this analysis. To enhance the traditional parametric g-formula, we developed an alternative g-formula estimator, which incorporates the Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) into the modeling of the time-evolving generative components, aiming to mitigate the bias due to model misspecification. We focus on binary time-varying treatments and introduce a general class of g-formulas for discrete survival data that can incorporate the longitudinal balancing scores. The minimum sufficient formulation of these longitudinal balancing scores is linked to the nature of treatment strategies, i.e., static or dynamic. For each type of treatment strategy, we provide posterior sampling algorithms. We conducted simulations to illustrate the empirical performance of the proposed method and demonstrate its practical utility using data from the Yale New Haven Health System's electronic health records.</description>

      <title>Geometry and factorization of multivariate Markov chains with applications to the swapping algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12589v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the factorizability and geometry of transition matrices of multivariate Markov chains. Specifically, we demonstrate that the induced chains on factors of a product space can be regarded as information projections with respect to the Kullback-Leibler divergence. This perspective yields Han-Shearer type inequalities and submodularity of the entropy rate of Markov chains, as well as applications in the context of large deviations and mixing time comparison. As a concrete algorithmic application, we introduce a projection sampler based on the swapping algorithm, which resamples the highest-temperature coordinate at stationarity at each step. We prove that such practice accelerates the mixing time by multiplicative factors related to the number of temperatures and the dimension of the underlying state space when compared with the original swapping algorithm.</description>

      <title>Hyperparameter Optimization for Randomized Algorithms: A Case Study on Random Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00584v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomized algorithms exploit stochasticity to reduce computational complexity. One important example is random feature regression (RFR) that accelerates Gaussian process regression (GPR). RFR approximates an unknown function with a random neural network whose hidden weights and biases are sampled from a probability distribution. Only the final output layer is fit to data. In randomized algorithms like RFR, the hyperparameters that characterize the sampling distribution greatly impact performance, yet are not directly accessible from samples. This makes optimization of hyperparameters via standard (gradient-based) optimization tools inapplicable. Inspired by Bayesian ideas from GPR, this paper introduces a random objective function that is tailored for hyperparameter tuning of vector-valued random features. The objective is minimized with ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI). EKI is a gradient-free particle-based optimizer that is scalable to high-dimensions and robust to randomness in objective functions. A numerical study showcases the new black-box methodology to learn hyperparameter distributions in several problems that are sensitive to the hyperparameter selection: two global sensitivity analyses, integrating a chaotic dynamical system, and solving a Bayesian inverse problem from atmospheric dynamics. The success of the proposed EKI-based algorithm for RFR suggests its potential for automated optimization of hyperparameters arising in other randomized algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fast computation of large kernel sums is a challenging task, which arises as a subproblem in any kernel method. We approach the problem by slicing, which relies on random projections to one-dimensional subspaces and fast Fourier summation. We prove bounds for the slicing error and propose a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) approach for selecting the projections based on spherical quadrature rules. Numerical examples demonstrate that our QMC-slicing approach significantly outperforms existing methods like (QMC-)random Fourier features, orthogonal Fourier features or non-QMC slicing on standard test datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Examples of stochastic processes whose state space representations involve functions of an integral type structure $$I_{t}^{(a,b)}:=\int_{0}^{t}b(Y_{s})e^{-\int_{s}^{t}a(Y_{r})dr}ds, \quad t\ge 0$$ are studied under an ergodic semi-Markovian environment described by an $S$ valued jump type process $Y:=(Y_{s}:s\in\mathbb{R}^{+})$ that is ergodic with a limiting distribution $\pi\in\mathcal{P}(S)$. Under different assumptions on signs of $E_{\pi}a(\cdot):=\sum_{j\in S}\pi_{j}a(j)$ and tail properties of the sojourn times of $Y$ we obtain different long time limit results for $I^{(a,b)}_{}:=(I^{(a,b)}_{t}:t\ge 0).$ In all cases mixture type of laws emerge which are naturally represented through an affine stochastic recurrence equation (SRE) $X\stackrel{d}{=}AX+B,\,\, X\perp\!\!\!\perp (A, B)$. Examples include explicit long-time representations of pitchfork bifurcation, and regime-switching diffusions under semi-Markov modulated environments, etc.</description>

      <title>Compactly-supported nonstationary kernels for computing exact Gaussian processes on big data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gaussian process (GP) is a widely used probabilistic machine learning method with implicit uncertainty characterization for stochastic function approximation, stochastic modeling, and analyzing real-world measurements of nonlinear processes. Traditional implementations of GPs involve stationary kernels (also termed covariance functions) that limit their flexibility, and exact methods for inference that prevent application to data sets with more than about ten thousand points. Modern approaches to address stationarity assumptions generally fail to accommodate large data sets, while all attempts to address scalability focus on approximating the Gaussian likelihood, which can involve subjectivity and lead to inaccuracies. In this work, we explicitly derive an alternative kernel that can discover and encode both sparsity and nonstationarity. We embed the kernel within a fully Bayesian GP model and leverage high-performance computing resources to enable the analysis of massive data sets. We demonstrate the favorable performance of our novel kernel relative to existing exact and approximate GP methods across a variety of synthetic data examples. Furthermore, we conduct space-time prediction based on more than one million measurements of daily maximum temperature and verify that our results outperform state-of-the-art methods in the Earth sciences. More broadly, having access to exact GPs that use ultra-scalable, sparsity-discovering, nonstationary kernels allows GP methods to truly compete with a wide variety of machine learning methods.</description>

      <title>A generalized Bayesian approach for high-dimensional robust regression with serially correlated errors and predictors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a loss-based generalized Bayesian methodology for high-dimensional robust regression with serially correlated errors and predictors. The proposed framework employs a novel scaled pseudo-Huber (SPH) loss function, which smooths the well-known Huber loss, effectively balancing quadratic ($\ell_2$) and absolute linear ($\ell_1$) loss behaviors. This flexibility enables the framework to accommodate both thin-tailed and heavy-tailed data efficiently. The generalized Bayesian approach constructs a working likelihood based on the SPH loss, facilitating efficient and stable estimation while providing rigorous uncertainty quantification for all model parameters. Notably, this approach allows formal statistical inference without requiring ad hoc tuning parameter selection while adaptively addressing a wide range of tail behavior in the errors. By specifying appropriate prior distributions for the regression coefficients--such as ridge priors for small or moderate-dimensional settings and spike-and-slab priors for high-dimensional settings--the framework ensures principled inference. We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees for accurate parameter estimation and correct predictor selection under sparsity assumptions for a wide range of data generating setups. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to traditional Bayesian regression methods based on $\ell_2$ and $\ell_1$-loss functions. The results highlight its flexibility and robustness, particularly in challenging high-dimensional settings characterized by data contamination.</description>

Abstract: The concept of concurrent mental health and substance use (MHSU) and its detection in patients has garnered growing interest among psychiatrists and healthcare policymakers over the past four decades. Researchers have proposed various diagnostic methods, including the Data-Driven Diagnostic Method (DDDM), for the identification of MHSU. However, the absence of a standalone statistical software package to facilitate DDDM for large healthcare administrative databases has remained a significant gap. This paper introduces the R statistical software package CMHSU, available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), for the diagnosis of mental health (MH), substance use (SU), and their concurrent status (MHSU). The package implements DDDM using hospital and medical service physician visit counts along with maximum time span parameters for MH, SU, and MHSU diagnoses. A working example using a simulated real-world dataset is presented to examine various analytical aspects, including three key dimensions of MHSU detection based on the DDDM framework, as well as temporal analysis to demonstrate the package's application for healthcare policymakers. Additionally, the limitations of the CMHSU package and potential directions for its future extension are discussed.</description>

Abstract: Transition probability estimation plays a critical role in multi-state modeling, especially in clinical research. This paper investigates the application of semi-Markov and Markov renewal frameworks to the EBMT dataset, focusing on six clinical states encountered during hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. By comparing Aalen-Johansen (AJ) and Dabrowska-Sun-Horowitz (DSH) estimators, we demonstrate that semi-Markov models, which incorporate sojourn times, provide a more nuanced and temporally sensitive depiction of patient trajectories compared to memoryless Markov models. The DSH estimator consistently yields smoother probability curves, particularly for transitions involving prolonged states. We use empirical process theory and Burkholder-Davis-Gundy inequality to show weak convergence of the estimator. Future work includes extending the framework to accommodate advanced covariate structures and non-Markovian dynamics.</description>
