      <title>gr-Orbit-Toolkit: A Python-Based Software for Simulating and Visualizing Relativistic Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating software dedicated to simulation is essential for teaching and research in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). Physics lecturing can be more effective when digital twins are used to accompany theory classes. Research in physics has greatly benefited from the advent of modern, high-level programming languages, which facilitate the implementation of user-friendly code. Here, we report our own Python-based software, the gr-orbit-toolkit, to simulate orbits in classical and general relativistic scenarios. First, we present the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for classical and relativistic orbital accelerations. For the latter, we follow a post-Newtonian approach. Second, we describe our algorithm, which numerically integrates these ODEs to simulate the orbits of small-sized objects orbiting around massive bodies by using Euler and Runge-Kutta methods. Then, we study a set of sample two-body models with either the Sun or a black hole in the center. Our simulations confirm that the orbital motions predicted by classical and relativistic ODEs drastically differ for bodies near the Schwarzschild radius of the central massive body. Classical mechanics explains the orbital motion of objects far away from a central massive body, but general relativity is required to study objects moving at close proximity to a massive body, where the gravitational field is strong. Our study on objects with different eccentricities confirms that our code captures relativistic orbital precession. Our convergence analysis shows the toolkit is numerically robust. Our gr-orbit-toolkit aims at facilitating teaching and research in general relativity, so a comprehensive user and developer guide is provided in the public code repository.</description>

      <title>From Pixels to Patterns: Decoding Smartphone Display Properties through Diffraction, Reflection, and Refraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show how students can measure optical features of smartphone displays through three experiments. Observing diffraction patterns from smartphone displays allows students to determine the Pixels Per Inch (PPI). Observing reflections within a smartphone display provides information about touch glass thickness and pixel layer properties. Finally, water drops are used as miniature lenses to see the magnified image of the pixels beneath. An enhanced theoretical model that covers both small and large droplets is provided.</description>

      <title>AstronomyCalc: A python toolkit for teaching Astronomical Calculations and Data Analysis methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding astrophysical and cosmological processes can be challenging due to their complexity and lack of intuitive analogies. To address this, we present \texttt{AstronomyCalc}, a Python package specifically designed to aid university-level teaching by integrating theoretical physics with practical astronomical data analysis methods. The package enables students to solve key cosmological calculations, such as the Friedmann equations, and explore various models while visualizing how parameter variations affect cosmic dynamics. It includes tools for generating synthetic astronomical data, such as Type Ia supernova measurements, and supports analysis of publicly available datasets, including Pantheon+ and the SPARC galaxy database. Simplified implementations of advanced algorithms, such as Monte Carlo Markov Chains, allow students to engage with data analysis techniques used in contemporary research. Additionally, \texttt{AstronomyCalc} will be consistently updated with more tools and user-friendly Jupyter notebooks, making it a continually evolving educational resource for developing conceptual understanding and practical skills in astrophysics and cosmology.</description>
