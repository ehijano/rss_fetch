      <title>Predictability Limit of the 2021 Pacific Northwest Heatwave from Deep-Learning Sensitivity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The traditional method for estimating weather forecast sensitivity to initial conditions uses adjoint models, which are limited to short lead times due to linearization around a control forecast. The advent of deep-learning frameworks enables a new approach using backpropagation and gradient descent to iteratively optimize initial conditions to minimize forecast errors. We apply this approach to forecasts of the June 2021 Pacific Northwest heatwave using the GraphCast model, yielding over 90% reduction in 10-day forecast errors over the Pacific Northwest. Similar improvements are found for Pangu-Weather model forecasts initialized with the GraphCast-derived optimal, suggesting that model error is not an important part of the initial perturbations. Eliminating small scales from the initial perturbations also yields similar forecast improvements. Extending the length of the optimization window, we find forecast improvement to about 23 days, suggesting atmospheric predictability at the upper end of recent estimates.</description>

      <title>Improving Model Chain Approaches for Probabilistic Solar Energy Forecasting through Post-processing and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weather forecasts from numerical weather prediction models play a central role in solar energy forecasting, where a cascade of physics-based models is used in a model chain approach to convert forecasts of solar irradiance to solar power production, using additional weather variables as auxiliary information. Ensemble weather forecasts aim to quantify uncertainty in the future development of the weather, and can be used to propagate this uncertainty through the model chain to generate probabilistic solar energy predictions. However, ensemble prediction systems are known to exhibit systematic errors, and thus require post-processing to obtain accurate and reliable probabilistic forecasts. The overarching aim of our study is to systematically evaluate different strategies to apply post-processing methods in model chain approaches: Not applying any post-processing at all; post-processing only the irradiance predictions before the conversion; post-processing only the solar power predictions obtained from the model chain; or applying post-processing in both steps. In a case study based on a benchmark dataset for the Jacumba solar plant in the U.S., we develop statistical and machine learning methods for post-processing ensemble predictions of global horizontal irradiance and solar power generation. Further, we propose a neural network-based model for direct solar power forecasting that bypasses the model chain. Our results indicate that post-processing substantially improves the solar power generation forecasts, in particular when post-processing is applied to the power predictions. The machine learning methods for post-processing yield slightly better probabilistic forecasts, and the direct forecasting approach performs comparable to the post-processing strategies.</description>

      <title>NORA-Surge: A storm surge hindcast for the Norwegian Sea, the North Sea and the Barents Sea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge about statistics for water level variations along the coast due to storm surge is important for the utilization of the coastal zone. An open and freely available storm surge hindcast archive covering the coast of Norway and adjacent sea areas spanning the time period 1979-2022 is presented. The storm surge model is forced by wind stress and mean sea level pressure taken from the non-hydrostatic NORA3 atmospheric hindcast. A dataset consisting of observations of water level from more than 90 water level gauges along the coasts of the North Sea and the Norwegian Sea is compiled and quality controlled, and used to assess the performance of the hindcast. The observational dataset is distributed in both time and space, and when considering all the available quality controlled data, the comparison with modelled water levels yield a mean absolute error (MAE) of 9.7 cm and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 12.4 cm. Values for MAE and RMSE scaled by the standard deviation of the observed storm surge for each station are 0.42 and 0.54 standard deviations, repsectively. When considering the geographical differences in characteristics of storm surge for different countries/regions, the values of MAE and RMSE are in the range 5.7-13.9 cm and 7.6-17.8 cm respectively, and 0.33-0.46 and 0.42-0.59 standard deviations for the scaled values. The minimum and maximum values for water level in the hindcast are -2.60 m and 3.92 m. In addition, 100-year return level estimates are calculated from the hindcast, with minimum and maximum values of, respectively, -2.75 m and 3.98 m. All minimum and maximum values are found in the southern North Sea area.</description>

      <title>Field measurements reveal insights into the impact of turbulent wind on loads experienced by parabolic trough solar collectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To ensure efficient and reliable operation of a concentrating solar-thermal power (CSP) plant, its solar collector field needs to accurately focus sunlight. The optical efficiency and structural integrity of the solar collectors is significantly influenced by wind conditions in the field. In this study, we present insights into dynamic wind loading on parabolic trough CSP collectors. We derive novel conclusions by analyzing a first-of-a-kind measurement campaign of wind and structural loads, performed at an operational CSP plant. Previous research primarily relied on wind tunnel tests and simulations, leaving uncertainty about wind loading effects in operational settings. We demonstrate that the parabolic trough field significantly alters the turbulent wind field within the collector field, especially under winds perpendicular to the trough rows. Our measurements within the trough field show reduced wind speeds, changes in wind direction and turbulence properties, and vortex shedding from the trough assemblies. These modifications to the wind field directly impact both static and dynamic support structure loads. Our measurements reveal higher wind loads on trough assemblies compared to those observed previously in wind tunnel tests. The insights from this study offer a novel perspective on our understanding of wind-driven loads on CSP collectors. By informing the development of next-generation design tools and models, this research paves the way for enhanced structural integrity and improved optical performance in future parabolic trough systems.</description>
