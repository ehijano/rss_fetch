      <title>Analog Spiking Neuron in CMOS 28 nm Towards Large-Scale Neuromorphic Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computational complexity of deep learning algorithms has given rise to significant speed and memory challenges for the execution hardware. In energy-limited portable devices, highly efficient processing platforms are indispensable for reproducing the prowess afforded by much bulkier processing platforms.
  In this work, we present a low-power Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron design fabricated in TSMC's 28 nm CMOS technology as proof of concept to build an energy-efficient mixed-signal Neuromorphic System-on-Chip (NeuroSoC). The fabricated neuron consumes 1.61 fJ/spike and occupies an active area of 34 $\mu m^{2}$, leading to a maximum spiking frequency of 300 kHz at 250 mV power supply.
  These performances are used in a software model to emulate the dynamics of a Spiking Neural Network (SNN). Employing supervised backpropagation and a surrogate gradient technique, the resulting accuracy on the MNIST dataset, using 4-bit post-training quantization stands at 82.5\%. The approach underscores the potential of such ASIC implementation of quantized SNNs to deliver high-performance, energy-efficient solutions to various embedded machine-learning applications.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent VAE for Building Latent Factor from Visual Neural Activity with Complex Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seeking high-quality neural latent representations to reveal the intrinsic correlation between neural activity and behavior or sensory stimulation has attracted much interest. Currently, some deep latent variable models rely on behavioral information (e.g., movement direction and position) as an aid to build expressive embeddings while being restricted by fixed time scales. Visual neural activity from passive viewing lacks clearly correlated behavior or task information, and high-dimensional visual stimulation leads to intricate neural dynamics. To cope with such conditions, we propose Time-Dependent SwapVAE, following the approach of separating content and style spaces in Swap-VAE, on the basis of which we introduce state variables to construct conditional distributions with temporal dependence for the above two spaces. Our model progressively generates latent variables along neural activity sequences, and we apply self-supervised contrastive learning to shape its latent space. In this way, it can effectively analyze complex neural dynamics from sequences of arbitrary length, even without task or behavioral data as auxiliary inputs. We compare TiDe-SwapVAE with alternative models on synthetic data and neural data from mouse visual cortex. The results show that our model not only accurately decodes complex visual stimuli but also extracts explicit temporal neural dynamics, demonstrating that it builds latent representations more relevant to visual stimulation.</description>

      <title>KAN versus MLP on Irregular or Noisy Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we compare the performance of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) networks on irregular or noisy functions. We control the number of parameters and the size of the training samples to ensure a fair comparison. For clarity, we categorize the functions into six types: regular functions, continuous functions with local non-differentiable points, functions with jump discontinuities, functions with singularities, functions with coherent oscillations, and noisy functions. Our experimental results indicate that KAN does not always perform best. For some types of functions, MLP outperforms or performs comparably to KAN. Furthermore, increasing the size of training samples can improve performance to some extent. When noise is added to functions, the irregular features are often obscured by the noise, making it challenging for both MLP and KAN to extract these features effectively. We hope these experiments provide valuable insights for future neural network research and encourage further investigations to overcome these challenges.</description>

      <title>Universality of Real Minimal Complexity Reservoir</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reservoir Computing (RC) models, a subclass of recurrent neural networks, are distinguished by their fixed, non-trainable input layer and dynamically coupled reservoir, with only the static readout layer being trained. This design circumvents the issues associated with backpropagating error signals through time, thereby enhancing both stability and training efficiency. RC models have been successfully applied across a broad range of application domains. Crucially, they have been demonstrated to be universal approximators of time-invariant dynamic filters with fading memory, under various settings of approximation norms and input driving sources.
  Simple Cycle Reservoirs (SCR) represent a specialized class of RC models with a highly constrained reservoir architecture, characterized by uniform ring connectivity and binary input-to-reservoir weights with an aperiodic sign pattern. For linear reservoirs, given the reservoir size, the reservoir construction has only one degree of freedom -- the reservoir cycle weight. Such architectures are particularly amenable to hardware implementations without significant performance degradation in many practical tasks. In this study we endow these observations with solid theoretical foundations by proving that SCRs operating in real domain are universal approximators of time-invariant dynamic filters with fading memory. Our results supplement recent research showing that SCRs in the complex domain can approximate, to arbitrary precision, any unrestricted linear reservoir with a non-linear readout. We furthermore introduce a novel method to drastically reduce the number of SCR units, making such highly constrained architectures natural candidates for low-complexity hardware implementations. Our findings are supported by empirical studies on real-world time series datasets.</description>

      <title>Federated Fairness Analytics: Quantifying Fairness in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a privacy-enhancing technology for distributed ML. By training models locally and aggregating updates - a federation learns together, while bypassing centralised data collection. FL is increasingly popular in healthcare, finance and personal computing. However, it inherits fairness challenges from classical ML and introduces new ones, resulting from differences in data quality, client participation, communication constraints, aggregation methods and underlying hardware. Fairness remains an unresolved issue in FL and the community has identified an absence of succinct definitions and metrics to quantify fairness; to address this, we propose Federated Fairness Analytics - a methodology for measuring fairness. Our definition of fairness comprises four notions with novel, corresponding metrics. They are symptomatically defined and leverage techniques originating from XAI, cooperative game-theory and networking engineering. We tested a range of experimental settings, varying the FL approach, ML task and data settings. The results show that statistical heterogeneity and client participation affect fairness and fairness conscious approaches such as Ditto and q-FedAvg marginally improve fairness-performance trade-offs. Using our techniques, FL practitioners can uncover previously unobtainable insights into their system's fairness, at differing levels of granularity in order to address fairness challenges in FL. We have open-sourced our work at: https://github.com/oscardilley/federated-fairness.</description>

      <title>Snuffy: Efficient Whole Slide Image Classifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification with multiple instance learning (MIL) in digital pathology faces significant computational challenges. Current methods mostly rely on extensive self-supervised learning (SSL) for satisfactory performance, requiring long training periods and considerable computational resources. At the same time, no pre-training affects performance due to domain shifts from natural images to WSIs. We introduce \textbf{\textit{Snuffy}} architecture, a novel MIL-pooling method based on sparse transformers that mitigates performance loss with limited pre-training and enables continual few-shot pre-training as a competitive option. Our sparsity pattern is tailored for pathology and is theoretically proven to be a universal approximator with the tightest probabilistic sharp bound on the number of layers for sparse transformers, to date. We demonstrate Snuffy's effectiveness on CAMELYON16 and TCGA Lung cancer datasets, achieving superior WSI and patch-level accuracies. The code is available on \url{https://github.com/jafarinia/snuffy}.</description>

      <title>EmoDM: A Diffusion Model for Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms have been successful in solving multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). However, as a class of population-based search methodology, evolutionary algorithms require a large number of evaluations of the objective functions, preventing them from being applied to a wide range of expensive MOPs. To tackle the above challenge, this work proposes for the first time a diffusion model that can learn to perform evolutionary multi-objective search, called EmoDM. This is achieved by treating the reversed convergence process of evolutionary search as the forward diffusion and learn the noise distributions from previously solved evolutionary optimization tasks. The pre-trained EmoDM can then generate a set of non-dominated solutions for a new MOP by means of its reverse diffusion without further evolutionary search, thereby significantly reducing the required function evaluations. To enhance the scalability of EmoDM, a mutual entropy-based attention mechanism is introduced to capture the decision variables that are most important for the objectives. Experimental results demonstrate the competitiveness of EmoDM in terms of both the search performance and computational efficiency compared with state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms in solving MOPs having up to 5000 decision variables. The pre-trained EmoDM is shown to generalize well to unseen problems, revealing its strong potential as a general and efficient MOP solver.</description>

      <title>LoAS: Fully Temporal-Parallel Datatflow for Dual-Sparse Spiking Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant research attention in the last decade due to their potential to drive resource-constrained edge devices. Though existing SNN accelerators offer high efficiency in processing sparse spikes with dense weights, opportunities are less explored in SNNs with sparse weights, i.e., dual-sparsity. In this work, we study the acceleration of dual-sparse SNNs, focusing on their core operation, sparse-matrix-sparse-matrix multiplication (spMspM). We observe that naively running a dual-sparse SNN on existing spMspM accelerators designed for dual-sparse Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) exhibits sub-optimal efficiency. The main challenge is that processing timesteps, a natural property of SNNs, introduces an extra loop to ANN spMspM, leading to longer latency and more memory traffic. To address the problem, we propose a fully temporal-parallel (FTP) dataflow, which minimizes both data movement across timesteps and the end-to-end latency of dual-sparse SNNs. To maximize the efficiency of FTP dataflow, we propose an FTP-friendly spike compression mechanism that efficiently compresses single-bit spikes and ensures contiguous memory access. We further propose an FTP-friendly inner-join circuit that can lower the cost of the expensive prefix-sum circuits with almost no throughput penalty. All the above techniques for FTP dataflow are encapsulated in LoAS, a Low-latency inference Accelerator for dual-sparse SNNs. With FTP dataflow, compression, and inner-join, running dual-sparse SNN workloads on LoAS demonstrates significant speedup (up to $8.51\times$) and energy reduction (up to $3.68\times$) compared to running it on prior dual-sparse accelerators.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning: a Heuristic Three-stage Mechanism for Grid Searches to Optimize the Future Risk Prediction of Breast Cancer Metastasis Using EHR-based Clinical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A grid search, at the cost of training and testing a large number of models, is an effective way to optimize the prediction performance of deep learning models. A challenging task concerning grid search is the time management. Without a good time management scheme, a grid search can easily be set off as a mission that will not finish in our lifetime. In this study, we introduce a heuristic three-stage mechanism for managing the running time of low-budget grid searches, and the sweet-spot grid search (SSGS) and randomized grid search (RGS) strategies for improving model prediction performance, in predicting the 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year risk of breast cancer metastasis. We develop deep feedforward neural network (DFNN) models and optimize them through grid searches. We conduct eight cycles of grid searches by applying our three-stage mechanism and SSGS and RGS strategies. We conduct various SHAP analyses including unique ones that interpret the importance of the DFNN-model hyperparameters. Our results show that grid search can greatly improve model prediction. The grid searches we conducted improved the risk prediction of 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year breast cancer metastasis by 18.6%, 16.3%, and 17.3% respectively, over the average performance of all corresponding models we trained using the RGS strategy. We not only demonstrate best model performance but also characterize grid searches from various aspects such as their capabilities of discovering decent models and the unit grid search time. The three-stage mechanism worked effectively. It made our low-budget grid searches feasible and manageable, and in the meantime helped improve model prediction performance. Our SHAP analyses identified both clinical risk factors important for the prediction of future risk of breast cancer metastasis, and DFNN-model hyperparameters important to the prediction of performance scores.</description>
