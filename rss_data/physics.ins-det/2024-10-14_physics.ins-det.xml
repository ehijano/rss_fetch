      <title>The fixed probe storage ring magnetometer for the Muon g-2 experiment at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of the FNAL E989 experiment is to measure the muon magnetic anomaly to unprecedented accuracy and precision at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. To meet this goal, the time and space averaged magnetic environment in the muon storage volume must be known to better than 70 ppb. A new pulsed proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) magnetometer was designed and built at the University of Washington, Seattle to track the temporal stability of the 1.45T magnetic field in the muon storage ring at this precision. It consists of an array of 378 petroleum jelly based NMR probes that are embedded in the walls of muon storage ring vacuum chambers and custom electronics built with readily available modular radio frequency (RF) components. We give NMR probe construction details and describe the functions of the custom electronic subsystems. The excellent performance metrics of the magnetometer are discussed where after 8 years of operation, the median single shot resolution of the array of probes remains at 11 ppb.</description>

      <title>Front-End ASIC for the STROBE-X HEMA and WFM Detectors: Concept and Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the NSX front-end ASIC, being developed to read charge signals from the HEMA and WFM X-ray detectors for the STROBE-X mission. The ASIC reads out signals from up to 64 anodes of linear Silicon Drift Detectors (SDDs). When unloaded, the ASIC channel has a charge resolution, expressed in Equivalent Noise Charge (ENC) of about 2.8 e-. Once connected to the SDD anode we anticipate, for the 80 keV energy range, a ENC of about 10.7 e- at a leakage current of 2 pA, which corresponds to a FWHM of about 145 eV at 6 keV once the Fano-limited statistics from charge generation in Si is included. The acquisition is event-triggered and, for events exceeding the threshold, the ASIC measures the peak amplitude and stores it in an analog memory for subsequent readout. The ASIC can also force the measurement of the sub-threshold channels neighboring the triggered channel, including the ones that belong to neighbor chips by using bi-directional differential inter-chip communication. Alternatively, the ASIC can measure the amplitudes of all channels at the time of the first detected peak. Additional features include a high-resolution option, channel power down and skip function, a low-noise pulse generator, a temperature sensor, and the monitoring of the channel analog output and trimmed threshold. The power consumption of the individual channel is ~590 $\mu$W and, when including all shared circuits, it averages to ~670 $\mu$W / channel.</description>

      <title>End-to-end design of multicolor scintillators for enhanced energy resolution in X-ray imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scintillators have been widely used in X-ray imaging due to their ability to convert high-energy radiation into visible light, making them essential for applications such as medical imaging and high-energy physics. Recent advances in the artificial structuring of scintillators offer new opportunities for improving the energy resolution of scintillator-based X-ray detectors. Here, we present a three-bin energy-resolved X-ray imaging framework based on a three-layer multicolor scintillator used in conjunction with a physics-aware image postprocessing algorithm. The multicolor scintillator is able to preserve X-ray energy information through the combination of emission wavelength multiplexing and energy-dependent isolation of X-ray absorption in specific layers. The dominant emission color and the radius of the spot measured by the detector are used to infer the incident X-ray energy based on prior knowledge of the energy-dependent absorption profiles of the scintillator stack. Through ab initio Monte Carlo simulations, we show that our approach can achieve an energy reconstruction accuracy of 49.7%, which is only 2% below the maximum accuracy achievable with realistic scintillators. We apply our framework to medical phantom imaging simulations where we demonstrate that it can effectively differentiate iodine and gadolinium-based contrast agents from bone, muscle, and soft tissue.</description>

      <title>Optimization of LYSO crystals and SiPM parameters for the CMS MIP timing detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the High-Luminosity (HL-LHC) phase, the upgrade of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at CERN will include a novel MIP Timing Detector (MTD). The central part of MTD, the barrel timing layer (BTL), is designed to provide a measurement of the time of arrival of charged particles with a precision of 30 ps at the beginning of HL-LHC, progressively degrading to 60 ps while operating in an extremely harsh radiation environment for over a decade. In this paper we present a comparative analysis of the time resolution of BTL module prototypes made of LYSO:Ce crystal bars read out by silicon photo-multipliers (SiPMs). The timing performance measured in beam test campaigns is presented for prototypes with different construction and operation parameters, such as different SiPM cell sizes (15, 20, 25 and 30 $\rm \mu m$), SiPM manufacturers and crystal bar thicknesses. The evolution of time resolution as a function of the irradiation level has been studied using non-irradiated SiPMs as well as SiPMs exposed up to $2\times 10^{14}~n_{eq}/cm^2$ fluence. The key parameters defining the module time resolution such as SiPM characteristics (gain, photon detection efficiency, radiation induced dark count rate) and crystal properties (light output and dimensions) are discussed. These results have informed the final choice of the MTD barrel sensor configuration and offer a unique starting point for the design of future large-area scintillator-based timing detectors in either low or high radiation environments.</description>

      <title>DUNE's low energy physics searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a long-baseline neutrino experiment that will precisely measure neutrino oscillation parameters, observe astrophysical neutrinos, and search for processes beyond the Standard Model such as nucleon decays, heavy neutral leptons, and dark matter. DUNE will build four liquid argon time projection chambers (LAr-TPC), as far detectors, with a total mass of $\sim70\,\text{kT}$ LAr located at Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF), $1.5\,\text{km}$ underground. A near-site complex, hosting different detectors, will measure the neutrino flux from an accelerated particle beam ($1.2\,\text{MW}$) produced at the Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) at Fermilab, $1300\,\text{km}$ away from SURF. Additionally, this few-MeV low-energy regime is of particular interest for detecting the burst of neutrinos from a galactic core-collapse supernova and solar neutrinos. DUNE will measure oscillation parameters from the solar neutrino flux analysis with much higher precision than previous experiments and discover the yet-unobserved hep flux component.</description>

      <title>Material Properties of Popular Radiation Detection Scintillator Crystals for Optical Physics Transport Modelling in Geant4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiation detection is vital for space, medical imaging, homeland security, and environmental monitoring applications. In the past, the Monte Carlo radiation transport toolkit, Geant4, has been employed to enable the effective development of emerging technologies in these fields. Radiation detectors utilising scintillator crystals have benefited from Geant4; however, Geant4 optical physics parameters for scintillator crystal modelling are sparse. This work outlines scintillator properties for GAGG:Ce, CLLBC:Ce, BGO, NaI:Tl, and CsI:Tl. These properties were implemented in a detailed SiPM-based single-volume scintillation detector simulation platform developed in this work. It was validated by its comparison to experimental measurements. For all five scintillation materials, the platform successfully predicted the spectral features for selected gamma ray emitting isotopes with energies between 30 keV to 2 MeV. The full width half maximum (FWHM) and normalised cross-correlation coefficient (NCCC) between simulated and experimental energy spectra were also compared. The majority of simulated FWHM values reproduced the experimental results within a 2% difference, and the majority of NCCC values demonstrated agreement between the simulated and experimental energy spectra. Discrepancies in these figures of merit were attributed to detector signal processing electronics modelling and geometry approximations within the detector and surrounding experimental environment.</description>

      <title>Proton Computed Tomography Based on Richardson-Lucy Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.00126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective: Proton therapy is an emerging method in cancer therapy. One of the main developments is to increase the accuracy of the Bragg-peak position calculation, which requires more precise relative stopping power (RSP) measurements. An excellent choice is the application of proton computed tomography (pCT) systems which takes the images under similar conditions, as they use the same irradiation device and hadron beam for imaging and treatment. A key aim is to develop an precise image reconstruction algorithm for pCT systems to reach their maximal performance. Approach: An image reconstruction algorithm was developed in this work, which is suitable to reconstruct pCT images from the deposited energy, position and direction measurement of individual protons. The flexibility of an iterative image reconstruction algorithm was utilised to appropriately model the trajectory of protons. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of a Derenzo and a CTP404 phantom was used to test the accuracy of the image reconstruction. Main results: The Richardson-Lucy algorithm was applied first and successfully for pCT image reconstruction. Authors used an averaged probability density based approach for the interaction (system) matrix generation, which is a relevant description to consider the uncertainty of the path of the protons in the patient. In case of an idealized setup, 1.43 lp/cm spatial resolution and 0.3% RSP accuracy was achieved. Significance: This work is the first application of the Richardson-Lucy algorithm, for pCT image reconstruction.</description>
