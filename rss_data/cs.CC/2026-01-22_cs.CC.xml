      <title>Complexity analysis and practical resolution of the data classification problem with private characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we analyze the problem of, given the probability distribution of a population, questioning an unknown individual that is representative of the distribution so that our uncertainty about certain characteristics is significantly reduced -but the uncertainty about others, deemed private or sensitive, is not. Thus, the goal of the problem is extracting information being relevant to a legitimate purpose while preserving the privacy of individuals, which is crucial to enable non-intrusive selection processes in several areas. For instance, it is essential in the design of non-discriminatory personnel selection, promotion, and layoff processes in companies and institutions; in the retrieval of customer information being relevant to the service provided by a company (and no more); in certifications not revealing sensitive industrial information being irrelevant for the certification itself; etc. Interactive questioning processes are constructed for this purpose, which requires generalizing the notion of decision trees to account the amount of desired and undesired information retrieved for each branch of the plan. Our findings about this problem are both theoretical and practical: on the one hand, we prove its NP-completeness by a reduction from the Set Cover problem; and on the other hand, given this intractability, we provide heuristic solutions to find reasonable solutions in affordable time. In particular, a greedy algorithm and two genetic algorithms are presented. Our experiments indicate that the best results are obtained using a genetic algorithm reinforced with a greedy strategy.</description>

      <title>Exponential lower bound via exponential sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00387v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Valiant's famous VP vs. VNP conjecture states that the symbolic permanent polynomial does not have polynomial-size algebraic circuits. However, the best upper bound on the size of the circuits computing the permanent is exponential. Informally, VNP is an exponential sum of VP-circuits. In this paper we study whether, in general, exponential sums (of algebraic circuits) require exponential-size algebraic circuits. We show that the famous Shub-Smale $\tau$-conjecture indeed implies such an exponential lower bound for an exponential sum. Our main tools come from parameterized complexity. Along the way, we also prove an exponential fpt (fixed-parameter tractable) lower bound for the parameterized algebraic complexity class VW$_{nb}^0$[P], assuming the same conjecture. VW$_{nb}^0$[P] can be thought of as the weighted sums of (unbounded-degree) circuits, where only $\pm 1$ constants are cost-free. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the Shub-Smale $\tau$-conjecture has been applied to prove explicit exponential lower bounds.
  Furthermore, we prove that when this class is fpt, then a variant of the counting hierarchy, namely the linear counting hierarchy collapses. Moreover, if a certain type of parameterized exponential sums is fpt, then integers, as well as polynomials with coefficients being definable in the linear counting hierarchy have subpolynomial $\tau$-complexity.
  Finally, we characterize a related class VW[F], in terms of permanents, where we consider an exponential sum of algebraic formulas instead of circuits. We show that when we sum over cycle covers that have one long cycle and all other cycles have constant length, then the resulting family of polynomials is complete for VW[F] on certain types of graphs.</description>

      <title>Hard Clique Formulas for Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how to convert any unsatisfiable 3-CNF formula which is sparse and exponentially hard to refute in Resolution into a negative instance of the $k$-clique problem whose corresponding natural encoding as a CNF formula is $n^{\Omega(k)}$-hard to refute in Resolution. This applies to any function $k = k(n)$ of the number $n$ of vertices, provided $k_0 \leq k \leq n^{1/c_0}$, where $k_0$ and $c_0$ are small constants. We establish this by demonstrating that Resolution can simulate the correctness proof of a particular kind of reduction from 3-SAT to the parameterized clique problem. This also re-establishes the known conditional hardness result for $k$-clique which states that if the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) holds, then the $k$-clique problem cannot be solved in time $n^{o(k)}$. Since it is known that the analogue of ETH holds for Resolution, unconditionally and with explicit hard instances, this gives a way to obtain explicit instances of $k$-clique that are unconditionally $n^{\Omega(k)}$-hard to refute in Resolution. This solves an open problem that appeared published in the literature at least twice.</description>

      <title>Reduced Groebner Bases With Double Exponential Cardinality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17602v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the cardinality of Groebner bases under various monomial orderings. We identify a family of polynomials F and a criterion such that the reduced Groebner basis of F is double exponential in cardinality with respect to any monomial ordering which satisfies this criterion. We also show that the said criterion is satisfied by orderings such as the lexicographic, degree lexicographic and weighted orderings.</description>

      <title>Group Order is in QCMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we show that verifying the order of a finite group given as a black-box is in the complexity class QCMA. This solves an open problem asked by Watrous in 2000 in his seminal paper on quantum proofs and directly implies that the Group Non-Membership problem is also in the class QCMA, which further proves a conjecture proposed by Aaronson and Kuperberg in 2006. Our techniques also give improved quantum upper bounds on the complexity of many other group-theoretical problems, such as group isomorphism in black-box groups.</description>
