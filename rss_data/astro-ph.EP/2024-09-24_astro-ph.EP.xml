      <title>Gaussian Process Models Impact the Inferred Properties of Giant Planets around Active Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent development of statistical methods that can distinguish between stellar activity and dynamical signals in radial velocity (RV) observations has facilitated the discovery and characterization of planets orbiting young stars. One such technique, Gaussian process (GP) regression, has been regularly employed to improve the detection of a growing number of planets, but the impact of this model for mitigating stellar activity has not been uniformly analyzed for a large sample with real observations. The goal of this study is to investigate how GPs can affect the inferred parameters of RV-detected planets. We homogeneously analyze how two commonly adopted GP frameworks, a GP trained on RVs alone and a GP pretrained on photometry and then applied to RVs, can influence the inferred physical and orbital parameters compared to a traditional Keplerian orbit fit. Our sample comprises 17 short-period giant planets orbiting stars that exhibit a broad range of activity levels. We find that the decision to adopt GPs, as well as the choice of GP framework, can result in variations of inferred parameters such as minimum planet mass and eccentricity by up to 67% and 95%, respectively. This implies that the method for modeling stellar activity in RVs of young planet-hosting stars can have widespread ramifications on the interpretation of planet properties including their masses, densities, circularization timescales, and tidal quality factors. When mitigating stellar activity with GPs, we recommend carrying out comparative tests between different models to assess the sensitivity of planet physical and orbital parameters to these choices.</description>

      <title>Dusty substructures induced by planets in ALMA disks: how dust growth and dynamics changes the picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disks exhibit a rich variety of substructure in millimeter continuum emission, often attributed to unseen planets. As these planets carve gaps in the gas, dust particles can accumulate in the resulting pressure bumps, forming bright features in the dust continuum. We investigate the role of dust dynamics in the gap-opening process with 2D radiation hydrodynamics simulations of planet--disk interaction and a two-population dust component modeled as a pressureless fluid. We consider the opacity feedback and backreaction due to drag forces as mm grains accumulate in pressure bumps at different stages of dust growth. We find that dust dynamics can significantly affect the resulting substructure driven by the quasi-thermal-mass planet with $M_p/M_\star=10^{-4}$. Opacity feedback causes nonaxisymmetric features to become more compact in azimuth, whereas the drag-induced backreaction tends to dissolve nonaxisymmetries. For our fiducial model, this results in multiple concentric rings of dust rather than the expected vortices and corotating dust clumps found in models without dust feedback. A higher coagulation fraction disproportionately enhances the effect of dust opacity feedback, favoring the formation of crescents rather than rings. Our results suggest that turbulent diffusion is not always necessary to explain the rarity of observed nonaxisymmetric features, and that incorporating dust dynamics is vital for interpreting the observed substructure in protoplanetary disks. We also describe and test the implementation of the publicly-available dust fluid module in the PLUTO code.</description>

      <title>Radio Signatures of Star-Planet Interactions, Exoplanets, and Space Weather</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio detections of stellar systems provide a window onto stellar magnetic activity and the space weather conditions of extrasolar planets, information that is difficult to attain at other wavelengths. There have been recent advances observing auroral emissions from radio-bright low-mass stars and exoplanets largely due to the maturation of low-frequency radio instruments and the plethora of wide-field radio surveys. To guide us in placing these recent results in context, we introduce the foremost local analogues for the field: Solar bursts and the aurorae found on Jupiter. We detail how radio bursts associated with stellar flares are foundational to the study of stellar coronae, and time-resolved radio dynamic spectra offers one of the best prospects of detecting and characterising coronal mass ejections from other stars. We highlight the prospects of directly detecting coherent radio emission from exoplanetary magnetospheres, and early tentative results. We bridge this discussion to the field of brown dwarf radio emission, in which their larger and stronger magnetospheres are amenable to detailed study with current instruments. Bright, coherent radio emission is also predicted from magnetic interactions between stars and close-in planets. We discuss the underlying physics of these interactions and implications of recent provisional detections for exoplanet characterisation. We conclude with an overview of outstanding questions in theory of stellar, star-planet interaction, and exoplanet radio emission, and the prospects of future facilities in answering them.</description>

      <title>Secrets in the shadow: High precision stellar abundances of fast-rotating A-type exoplanet host stars through transit spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The spectra of fast-rotating A-type stars have strongly broadened absorption lines. This effect causes blending of the absorption lines, hindering the measurement of the abundances of the elements that are in the stellar photosphere. Aims. As the exoplanet transits across its host star, it obscures the stellar spectrum that is emitted from directly behind the planet. We aim to extract this obscured spectrum because it is less affected by rotational broadening, resolving the blending of weak lines of elements that would otherwise remain inaccessible. This allows us to more precisely measure the metal abundances in ultra-hot Jupiter systems, many of which have fast rotating host stars. Methods. We develop a novel method that isolates the stellar spectra behind the planet during a spectral time-series, and reconstructs the disc-integrated non-broadened spectrum of the host star. We have systematically tested this method with model-generated spectra of the transit of WASP-189 b across its fast-rotating A-type host star, assessing the effects of limb darkening, choice of absorption lines, signal to noise regime; and demonstrating the sensitivity to photospheric parameters ($T_{\text{eff}}$, $\log g$) and elemental abundances. We apply the method to observations by the HARPS high-resolution spectrograph. Results. For WASP-189, we obtain the metallicity and photospheric abundances for several species previously not reported in literature, Mg, Ca and Ti, with significantly improved accuracy compared to the ordinary broadened stellar spectrum. This method can be generally applied to other transiting systems in which abundance determinations via spectral synthesis are imprecise due to severe line blending. It is important to accurately determine the photospheric properties of exoplanet host stars, as it can provide further insight into the formation and evolution of the planets.</description>

      <title>Radial velocity analysis of stars with debris discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to identify potential exoplanet signals from nearby stars with resolved debris discs. However, the high activity of many stars with debris discs limits the detection of periodic signals. Our study is constrained to a sample of 29 stars that have appropriate radial velocity data and debris disc measurements sufficient to resolve their inclination. Our results confirm and update previous findings for exoplanets around HD 10647, HD 115617, HD 69830, GJ 581, HD 22049, and HD 142091, and we identify long-term activity signals around HD 207129 and HD 202628. We utilize the inclination angles of the debris discs, assuming co-planarity between debris disc and exoplanet orbit, to determine the "disc-aligned" masses of radial velocity exoplanets in this study. The "disc-aligned" masses of HD 69830 b, HD 69830 c, and 61 Vir b suggest that they may be classified as 'hot' or 'warm' Jupiters and so might be nearby examples of planets that have undergone recent type-II disc migration.</description>

      <title>Star-Planet Interactions in the Radio Domain: Prospect for Their Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All types of interaction of a magnetized plasma flow with an obstacle (magnetized or not) are considered, and those susceptible to produce a radio signature are identified. The role of the sub-Alfv\'enic or super-Alfv\'enic character of the flow is discussed. Known examples in the solar system are given, as well as extrapolations to star-planet plasma interactions. The dissipated power and the fraction that goes into radio waves are evaluated in the frame of the radio-magnetic scaling law, the theoretical bases and validity of which are discussed in the light of recent works. Then it is shown how radio signatures can be interpreted in the frame of the cyclotron-maser theory (developed for explaining the generation of solar system planetary auroral and satellite-induced radio emissions) for deducing many physical parameters of the system studied, including the planetary or stellar magnetic field. Recent detections of such radio signatures with new generation low-frequency radiotelescopes and future prospects are then outlined.</description>

      <title>PEWDD: A database of white dwarfs enriched by exo-planetary material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Planetary Enriched White Dwarf Database (PEWDD), a collection of published photospheric abundances of white dwarfs accreting planetary debris alongside additional information relevant to metal-enrichment and the presence of infrared excesses, emission lines, and binary companions. PEWDD contains at the time of publishing information on 1739 white dwarfs and will be kept up-to-date with information from new publications. A total of 24 photospheric metals are recorded and are linked to accretion of exo-planetary material. The overall properties of metal-enriched white dwarfs are severely affected by observational selection effects; in particular we find that what metals are detectable strongly correlates with the effective temperature. By considering metal-enriched white dwarfs which have abundances measured by different methods, we find a spread that is comparable with the often quoted ad-hoc estimated abundance uncertainties, i.e. ~0.1-0.2dex. We draw attention to a dichotomy in the median accretion rates for metal-enriched H- and He-dominated white dwarfs, with M_{acc, H} = 7.7e7g/s and M_{acc, He} = 8.7e8g/s when extrapolating bulk compositions from bulk Earth Ca abundance. We identify 40 metal-enriched white dwarfs in binary systems and find evidence that enrichment is suppressed by binary companions within 200au.</description>

      <title>Material Transport in Protoplanetary Discs with Massive Embedded Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertical gas and dust flows in protoplanetary discs waft material above the midplane region in the presence of a protoplanet. This motion may alter the delivery of dust to the planet and its circumplanetary disc, as well as through a planetary-induced gap region and hence the inner disc chemistry. Here, we investigate the impact of a massive embedded planet on this material transport through the gap region. We use 3D global hydrodynamic simulations run using FARGO3D with gas and dust species to investigate the dust filtration and the origin of material that can make it through the gap. We find small dust particles can pass through the gap as expected from results in 2D, and that this can be considered in two parts - filtering due to the planetary-induced pressure maximum, and filtering due to accretion onto the planet. When gas accretion onto the planet is included, we find that the larger dust grains that cross the gap (i.e. those with $\mathrm{St} \sim 10^{-4}$) originate from regions near the mid-plane. We also find that dust and gas that enter the planet-carved gap region pass through the Hill sphere of the planet, where the temperature is likely to be strongly enhanced compared with the mid-plane regions from which this material originated. Considering the application of our simulations to a Jupiter-mass planet at $\sim 100\ \mathrm{AU}$, this suggests that CO ice is very likely to desorb from grains in the close proximity of the planet, without requiring any fine-tuning of the planet's location with respect to the CO snowline.</description>

      <title>Water in protoplanetary disks with JWST-MIRI: spectral excitation atlas, diagnostic diagrams for temperature and column density, and detection of disk-rotation line broadening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims at providing some general tools for the analysis of water spectra as observed in protoplanetary disks with JWST-MIRI. We use 25 high-quality spectra from the JDISC Survey reduced with asteroid calibrators as presented in Pontoppidan et al. (2024). First, we present a spectral atlas to illustrate the clustering of water transitions from different upper level energies ($E_u$) and identify single (un-blended) lines that provide the most reliable measurements. With the atlas, we demonstrate two important excitation effects: one related to the opacity saturation of ortho-para line pairs that overlap, and the other to the sub-thermal excitation of $v=1-1$ lines scattered across the $v=0-0$ rotational band. Second, from this larger line selection we define a list of fundamental lines spanning $E_u$ from 1500 to 6000 K to develop simple line-ratio diagrams as diagnostics of temperature components and column density. Third, we report the detection of disk-rotation Doppler broadening of molecular lines, which demonstrates the radial distribution of water emission at different $E_u$ and confirms from gas kinematics a radially-extended $\approx$ 170-190 K reservoir recently suggested from the analysis of line fluxes. We also report the detection of narrow blue-shifted absorption from an inner disk wind in ro-vibrational H$_2$O and CO lines, which may be observed in disks at inclinations $&gt; 50$ deg. We summarize these findings and tools into a general recipe that should be beneficial to community efforts to study water in planet-forming regions.</description>

      <title>The CHEOPS view on the climate of WASP-3 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot Jupiters are giant planets subject to intense stellar radiation. The physical and chemical properties of their atmosphere makes them the most amenable targets for the atmospheric characterization.
  In this paper we analyze the photometry collected during the secondary eclipses of the hot Jupiter WASP-3 b by CHEOPS, TESS and Spitzer. Our aim is to characterize the atmosphere of the planet by measuring the secondary eclipse depth in several passbands and constrain the planetary dayside spectrum.
  Our update of the stellar and planetary properties is consistent with previous works. The analysis of the occultations returns an eclipse depth of 92+-21 ppm in the CHEOPS passband, 83+-27 ppm for TESS and &gt;2000 ppm in the IRAC 1-2-4 Spitzer passbands. Using the eclipse depths in the Spitzer bands we propose a set of likely emission spectra which constrain the emission contribution in the \cheops and TESS passbands to approximately a few dozens of parts per million. This allowed us to measure a geometric albedo of 0.21+-0.07 in the CHEOPS passband, while the TESS data lead to a 95\% upper limit of $\sim$0.2.
  WASP-3 b belongs to the group of ultra-hot Jupiters which are characterized by low Bond albedo (&lt;0.3+-0.1), as predicted by different atmospheric models. On the other hand, it unexpectedly seems to efficiently recirculate the absorbed stellar energy, unlike similar highly irradiated planets. To explain this inconsistency, we propose that other energy recirculation mechanisms may be at play other than advection (for example, dissociation and recombination of H_2). Another possibility is that the observations in different bandpasses probe different atmospheric layers, making the atmospheric analysis difficult without an appropriate modeling of the thermal emission spectrum of WASP-3 b, which is not feasible with the limited spectroscopic data available to date.</description>

      <title>Extreme Weather Variability on Hot Rocky Exoplanet 55 Cancri e Explained by Magma Temperature-Cloud Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of the ultra-short period rocky exoplanet 55 Cancri e (55 Cnc e) indicate that the planet's dayside infrared radiation fluctuates by a factor of at least six on sub-weekly timescales, for unknown reasons. We propose a feedback mechanism where increased reflective clouds cool surface magma, subsequently reducing cloud formation, which may offer a potential explanation for these phenomena. In this mechanism, under less cloudy conditions, stellar radiation heats the surface magma, causing it to release more silicate vapor, which then condenses to form reflective clouds. Once formed, these clouds reduce stellar insolation at the surface, leading to surface cooling, which in turn reduces vapor supply, decreasing cloudiness. A time lag between the temperature increase of surface magma and the subsequent increase in cloudiness (likely due to lagged atmospheric transport of cloud-forming vapor) enables self-sustained oscillations in surface temperature and cloud reflectivity. These oscillations manifest as variations in both the emitted thermal radiation and the reflected stellar radiation, causing variability in secondary eclipse depths across different wavelengths without significantly affecting the transit depth. Using a simple model, we find that diverse planetary parameters can reproduce the observations. Additionally, we demonstrate that secondary eclipse depths at different wavelengths can oscillate out of phase, consistent with recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope. Finally, we discuss observational strategies to test this proposed mechanism on 55 Cancri e. If confirmed, observable ocean-atmosphere dynamics on exoplanets would open a new window into the composition, evolution, and fate of rocky planet volatiles.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Observations of the Galex Nearby Young Star Survey Sample. 1. Nearby Moving Group Candidates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The GALEX Nearby Young Star Search (GALNYSS) yielded the identification of more than 2000 late-type stars that, based on their ultraviolet and infrared colors and pre-Gaia proper motions, are potentially of age &lt; 200 Myr and lie within ~120 pc of Earth. We present the results of a campaign of medium- and high-resolution optical spectroscopy of 471 GALNYSS stars aimed at confirming their youth and their potential membership in nearby young stellar moving groups. We present radial velocity (RV), Li absorption, and H-$\alpha$ emission measurements for these spectroscopically observed GALNYSS stars, and assess their Li absorption and optical emission-line properties and infrared excesses. Our RV measurements are combined with literature and Gaia DR3 RV measurements and Gaia DR3 astrometry and photometry to obtain the spatiokinematics and color-magnitude positions of GALNYSS stars. We use these results to assess membership in the TW Hya, Tuc-Hor, Carina, Columba, and Argus Associations and the $\beta$-PMG and AB Dor moving groups. We have identified 132 stars as candidate members of these seven groups; roughly half of these candidates are newly identified on the basis of data presented here. At least one-third of the 132 candidates are spectroscopic and/or photometric binaries and/or have comoving (visual) binary companions in Gaia DR3. The contingent of young, low-mass stars in the solar vicinity we identify here should provide excellent subjects for future direct imaging exoplanet surveys and studies of the early evolution of low-mass stars and their planetary progeny.</description>

      <title>Chromospheric modeling of the active M3V star G 80-21 with RH1.5D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the active regions of the M3.0V star G 80-21 using the observed data from the CARMENES project with synthetic spectra generated by the RH1.5D radiative transfer code. The CARMENES project aims to search for exoplanets around M dwarfs using high-resolution near-infrared and optical echelle spectrographs. By comparing the observed data and models for the chromospheric lines of H$_\alpha$ and the bluest Ca II infrared triplet line, we obtain the best-fit models for this star. The optimal fitting for the observed spectrum of G 80-21 is achieved by employing two active areas in conjunction with an inactive regions, with a calcium abundance of [Ca/H] = $-$0.4. This combination successfully fits all the observed data across varying ratios. The minor active component consistently comprises approximately 18\% of the total (ranging from 14\% to 20\%), which suggests that the minor active component is likely located in the polar regions. Meanwhile, the major active component occupies a variable proportion, ranging from 51\% to 82\%. Our method allows for the determination of the structure and size of stellar chromospheric active regions by analyzing high-resolution observed spectra.</description>

      <title>JIRAM Observations of Volcanic Flux on Io: Distribution and Comparison to Tidal Heat Flow Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Juno has allowed clear, high-resolution imaging of Io's polar volcanoes using the Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) instrument. We have used data from JIRAM's M-band (4.78 um) imager from eleven Juno orbits to construct a global map of volcanic flux. This map provides short-term insight into the spatial distribution of volcanoes and the ways in which high- and low-latitude volcanoes differ. Using spherical harmonic analysis, we quantitatively compare our volcanic flux map to the surface heat flow distribution expected from models of Io's tidal heat deposition (summarized in de Kleer et al. 2019). Our observations confirm previously detected systems of bright volcanoes at high latitudes. Our study finds that both poles are comparably active and that the observed flux distribution is inconsistent with an asthenospheric heating model, although the south pole is viewed too infrequently to establish reliable trends.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation Mechanism of Quasi-Halo Orbit from Lissajous Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14697v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a general analytical method to describe the center manifolds of collinear libration points in the Restricted Three-body Problem (RTBP). It is well-known that these center manifolds include Lissajous orbits, halo orbits, and quasihalo orbits. Previous studies have traditionally treated these orbits separately by iteratively constructing high-order series solutions using the Lindstedt-Poincar\'e method. Instead of relying on resonance between their frequencies, this study identifies that halo and quasihalo orbits arise due to intricate coupling interactions between in-plane and out-of-plane motions. To characterize this coupling effect, a novel concept, coupling coefficient $\eta$, is introduced in the RTBP, incorporating the coupling term $\eta \Delta x$ in the $z$-direction dynamics equation, where $\Delta$ represents a formal power series concerning the amplitudes. Subsequently, a uniform series solution for these orbits is constructed up to a specified order using the Lindstedt-Poincar\'e method. For any given paired in-plane and out-of-plane amplitudes, the coupling coefficient $\eta$ is determined by the bifurcation equation $\Delta = 0$. When $\eta$ = 0, the proposed solution describes Lissajous orbits around libration points. As $\eta$ transitions from zero to non-zero values, the solution describes quasihalo orbits, which bifurcate from Lissajous orbits. Particularly, halo orbits bifurcate from planar Lyapunov orbits if the out-of-plane amplitude is zero. The proposed method provides a unified framework for understanding these intricate orbital behaviors in the RTBP.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes in the Solar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If primordial black holes (PBHs) of asteroidal mass make up the entire dark matter they could be detectable through their gravitational influence in the solar system. In this work, we study the perturbations that PBHs induce on the orbits of planets. Detailed numerical simulations of the solar system, embedded in a halo of PBHs, are performed. Using the Earth-Mars distance as an observational probe, we show that the perturbations are below the current detection limits and thus PBHs are not directly constrained by solar system ephemerides. We estimate that an improvement in the measurement accuracy by more than an order of magnitude or the extraction of signals well below the noise level are required to detect the gravitational influence of PBHs in the solar system in the foreseeable future.</description>

      <title>On the importance of separators as sites of 3D magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For 3D magnetic reconnection to occur there must exist a volume within which the electric field component parallel to the magnetic field is non-zero. In numerical experiments, locations of non-zero parallel electric field indicate sites of 3D magnetic reconnection. If these experiments contain all types of topological feature (null points, separatrix surfaces, spines and separators) then comparing topological features with the reconnection sites reveals that all the reconnection sites are threaded by separators with the local maxima/minima of the integrated parallel electric along fieldlines coinciding with these separators. However, not all separators thread a reconnection site. Furthermore, there are different types of separator. Cluster separators are short arising within an individual weak magnetic field region and have negligible parallel electric field along them so are not associated with much reconnection. Intercluster separators connect a positive null point lying in one weak-field region to a negative null point that lies in a different weak-field region. Intercluster separators often thread enhanced regions of parallel electric field and are long. Since separators form the boundary between 4 globally-significant topologically-distinct domains, they are important sites of reconnection which can results in the global restructuring of the magnetic field. By considering the kinematic bifurcation models in which separators form it is possible to understand the formation of cluster and intercluster separators and explain their key properties.</description>
