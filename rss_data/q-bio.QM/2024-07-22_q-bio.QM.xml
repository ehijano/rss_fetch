      <title>A review of handcrafted and deep radiomics in neurological diseases: transitioning from oncology to clinical neuroimaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13813</link>

Abstract: Medical imaging technologies have undergone extensive development, enabling non-invasive visualization of clinical information. The traditional review of medical images by clinicians remains subjective, time-consuming, and prone to human error. With the recent availability of medical imaging data, quantification have become important goals in the field. Radiomics, a methodology aimed at extracting quantitative information from imaging data, has emerged as a promising approach to uncover hidden biological information and support decision-making in clinical practice. This paper presents a review of the radiomic pipeline from the clinical neuroimaging perspective, providing a detailed overview of each step with practical advice. It discusses the application of handcrafted and deep radiomics in neuroimaging, stratified by neurological diagnosis. Although radiomics shows great potential for increasing diagnostic precision and improving treatment quality in neurology, several limitations hinder its clinical implementation. Addressing these challenges requires collaborative efforts, advancements in image harmonization methods, and the establishment of reproducible and standardized pipelines with transparent reporting. By overcoming these obstacles, radiomics can significantly impact clinical neurology and enhance patient care.</description>

      <title>Hair cells in the cochlea must tune resonant modes to the edge of instability without destabilizing collective modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sound produces surface waves along the cochlea's basilar membrane. To achieve the ear's astonishing frequency resolution and sensitivity to faint sounds, dissipation in the cochlea must be canceled via active processes in hair cells, effectively bringing the cochlea to the edge of instability. But how can the cochlea be globally tuned to the edge of instability with only local feedback? To address this question, we use a discretized version of a standard model of basilar membrane dynamics, but with an explicit contribution from active processes in hair cells. Surprisingly, we find the basilar membrane supports two qualitatively distinct sets of modes: a continuum of localized modes and a small number of collective extended modes. Localized modes sharply peak at their resonant position and are largely uncoupled. As a result, they can be amplified almost independently from each other by local hair cells via feedback reminiscent of self-organized criticality. However, this amplification can destabilize the collective extended modes; avoiding such instabilities places limits on possible molecular mechanisms for active feedback in hair cells. Our work illuminates how and under what conditions individual hair cells can collectively create a critical cochlea.</description>

      <title>Improved motif-scaffolding with SE(3) flow matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protein design often begins with the knowledge of a desired function from a motif which motif-scaffolding aims to construct a functional protein around. Recently, generative models have achieved breakthrough success in designing scaffolds for a range of motifs. However, generated scaffolds tend to lack structural diversity, which can hinder success in wet-lab validation. In this work, we extend FrameFlow, an SE(3) flow matching model for protein backbone generation, to perform motif-scaffolding with two complementary approaches. The first is motif amortization, in which FrameFlow is trained with the motif as input using a data augmentation strategy. The second is motif guidance, which performs scaffolding using an estimate of the conditional score from FrameFlow without additional training. On a benchmark of 24 biologically meaningful motifs, we show our method achieves 2.5 times more designable and unique motif-scaffolds compared to state-of-the-art.

      <title>Flock2: A model for orientation-based social flocking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aerial flocking of birds, or murmurations, has fascinated observers while presenting many challenges to behavioral study and simulation. We examine how the periphery of murmurations remain well bounded and cohesive. We also investigate agitation waves, which occur when a flock is disturbed, developing a plausible model for how they might emerge spontaneously. To understand these behaviors a new model is presented for orientation-based social flocking. Previous methods model inter-bird dynamics by considering the neighborhood around each bird, and introducing forces for avoidance, alignment, and cohesion as three dimensional vectors that alter acceleration. Our method introduces orientation-based social flocking that treats social influences from neighbors more realistically as a desire to turn, indirectly controlling the heading in an aerodynamic model. While our model can be applied to any flocking social bird we simulate flocks of starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, and demonstrate the possibility of orientation waves in the absence of predators. Our model exhibits spherical and ovoidal flock shapes matching observation. Comparisons of our model to Reynolds' on energy consumption and frequency analysis demonstrates more realistic motions, significantly less energy use in turning, and a plausible mechanism for emergent orientation waves.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Adaptive Cellular Recognition Under Domain Shifts: A Contextual Correspondence View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cellular nuclei recognition serves as a fundamental and essential step in the workflow of digital pathology. However, with disparate source organs and staining procedures among histology image clusters, the scanned tiles inherently conform to a non-uniform data distribution, which induces deteriorated promises for general cross-cohort usages. Despite the latest efforts leveraging domain adaptation to mitigate distributional discrepancy, those methods are subjected to modeling the morphological characteristics of each cell individually, disregarding the hierarchical latent structure and intrinsic contextual correspondences across the tumor micro-environment. In this work, we identify the importance of implicit correspondences across biological contexts for exploiting domain-invariant pathological composition and thereby propose to exploit the dependence over various biological structures for domain adaptive cellular recognition. We discover those high-level correspondences via unsupervised contextual modeling and use them as bridges to facilitate adaptation over diverse organs and stains. In addition, to further exploit the rich spatial contexts embedded amongst nuclear communities, we propose self-adaptive dynamic distillation to secure instance-aware trade-offs across different model constituents. The proposed method is extensively evaluated on a broad spectrum of cross-domain settings under miscellaneous data distribution shifts and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a substantial margin.

      <title>AI-predicted protein deformation encodes energy landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI algorithms have proven to be excellent predictors of protein structure, but whether and how much these algorithms can capture the underlying physics remains an open question. Here, we aim to test this question using the Alphafold2 (AF) algorithm: We use AF to predict the subtle structural deformation induced by single mutations, quantified by strain, and compare with experimental datasets of corresponding perturbations in folding free energy $\Delta\Delta G$. Unexpectedly, we find that physical strain alone -- without any additional data or computation -- correlates almost as well with $\Delta\Delta G$ as state-of-the-art energy-based and machine-learning predictors. This indicates that the AF-predicted structures alone encode fine details about the energy landscape. In particular, the structures encode significant information on stability, enough to estimate (de-)stabilizing effects of mutations, thus paving the way for the development of novel, structure-based stability predictors for protein design and evolution.</description>

      <title>Sequential Model for Predicting Patient Adherence in Subcutaneous Immunotherapy for Allergic Rhinitis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11447v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective: Subcutaneous Immunotherapy (SCIT) is the long-lasting causal treatment of allergic rhinitis (AR). How to enhance the adherence of patients to maximize the benefit of allergen immunotherapy (AIT) plays a crucial role in the management of AIT. This study aims to leverage novel machine learning models to precisely predict the risk of non-adherence of AR patients and related local symptom scores in three years SCIT.
  Methods: The research develops and analyzes two models, sequential latent-variable model (SLVM) of Stochastic Latent Actor-Critic (SLAC) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) evaluating them based on scoring and adherence prediction capabilities.
  Results: Excluding the biased samples at the first time step, the predictive adherence accuracy of the SLAC models is from 60\% to 72\%, and for LSTM models, it is 66\% to 84\%, varying according to the time steps. The range of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for SLAC models is between 0.93 and 2.22, while for LSTM models it is between 1.09 and 1.77. Notably, these RMSEs are significantly lower than the random prediction error of 4.55.
  Conclusion: We creatively apply sequential models in the long-term management of SCIT with promising accuracy in the prediction of SCIT nonadherence in AR patients. While LSTM outperforms SLAC in adherence prediction, SLAC excels in score prediction for patients undergoing SCIT for AR. The state-action-based SLAC adds flexibility, presenting a novel and effective approach for managing long-term AIT.</description>

      <title>Data-driven quasiconformal morphodynamic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal imaging of biological epithelial structures yields shape data at discrete time points, leading to a natural question: how can we reconstruct the most likely path of growth patterns consistent with these discrete observations? We present a physically plausible framework to solve this inverse problem by creating a framework that generalises quasiconformal maps to quasiconformal flows. By allowing for the spatio-temporal variation of the shear and dilatation fields during the growth process, subject to regulatory mechanisms, we are led to a type of generalised Ricci flow. When guided by observational data associated with surface shape as a function of time, this leads to a constrained optimization problem. Deploying our data-driven algorithmic approach to the shape of insect wings, leaves and even sculpted faces, we show how optimal quasiconformal flows allow us to characterise the morphogenesis of a range of surfaces.</description>
