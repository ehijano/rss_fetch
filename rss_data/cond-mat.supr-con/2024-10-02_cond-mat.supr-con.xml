      <title>High-temperature Superconducting Oxide without Copper at Ambient Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in the Ba-La-Cu-O system (the cuprate) at the 30 K range in 1986 marked a significant breakthrough, as it far exceeded the highest known critical temperature ($T_c$) at the time and surpassed the predicted 30 K limit, which was thought to be the maximum before phonon-mediated electron pairing would break down due to thermal excitation. Despite recent successful observations of superconductivity in nickel-oxide-based compounds (the nickelate), superconductivity above 30 K at ambient pressure in a system that is isostructural and isoelectronic to the cuprate but without copper has remained elusive. Here, we report a superconducting $T_c$ above 35 K under ambient pressure in hole-doped, late rare-earth infinite-layer nickel oxide (Sm-Eu-Ca-Sr)NiO$_2$ thin films. Electron microscopy reveals a small thickness of ~2 nm of infinite-layer phase stabilised at present, which indicates a higher temperature superconductivity should be observable in clean bulk crystals.</description>

      <title>Direct writing of high temperature superconducting Josephson junctions using a thermal scanning probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we demonstrate for the first time the creation of Josephson-like superconducting nanojunctions using a thermal scanning probe to directly inscribe weak links into microstrips of YBa2Cu3O7-x (YBCO). Our method effectively reduces the critical current (Ic) over an order of magnitude. The resulting nanobridges exhibit clear evidence of Josephson effects, of SNS-type junctions, as shown by both the DC and AC Josephson effects. This approach provides a novel and flexible method for scaling up quantum mechanical circuits that operate at liquid nitrogen temperatures. Additionally, it offers a promising pathway for modifying properties of the junctions in-situ and post fabrication.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Josephson junction characteristics of Nd2-xCexCuO4/SrTiO3 epitaxial films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current-voltage (I-V) properties along the c axis on Nd2-xCexCuO4 /SrTiO3 epitaxial films with x = 0.145, 0.15 were investigated. For all the samples it has been established that the I-V characteristics exhibit several resistive branches, which correspond to the resistive states of individual Josephson junctions. The results confirm the idea of a tunneling mechanism between the CuO2 layers (superconductor - insulator - superconductor junction) for the investigated Nd2-xCexCuO4 compound. The I-V dependence of this compound with x = 0.15 points out on the nonmonotonic nature of the d-wave or anisotropic s-wave symmetry order parameter associated with the coexistence of superconductivity and antiferromagnetic fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Pairing type symmetry in cuprate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a brief overview ofa number of results on a type of pairing state symmetry in cuprates HTSC from a current literature. The results of recent high-precision measurements of near-nodal d-type gap functions by a modern laser-based ARPES method or by a c-axis twisted Josephson junction for hole-doped Bi-2212 system are presented. Recent experimental evidence in favor of d-type pairing symmetry, with a special nonmonotonic functional form, for electron-doped cuprate NdCeCuO is discussed. A new essential results on the identification of dx^2-y^2 symmetry of superconducting order parameter for parent high-Tc cuprate structure, electron-doped infinite layer SrLaCuO system, by the phase sensitive tests is described. A complex of the data presented indicates a vital role of d-wave pairing symmetry, in the special dx^2-y^2 form for high-temperature conductivity in cuprate systems.</description>

      <title>Layer-dependent magnetic property in a superconducting quintuple-layer nickelate La6Ni5O12</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To investigate the detailed magnetic properties of a recently discovered superconducting nickelate Nd6Ni5O12, we performed the first-principles electronic structure calculation based on density functional theory. The band dispersion, electronic charge distribution and the magnetic moment are computed with La substituted for Nd, and compared with another structural type of nickel-based superconducting material, namely, RNiO2 (R: rare-earth elements). In particular, we estimated the magnetic exchange interaction strength based on magnetic force theory. Our results show that the inter-atomic magnetic couplings are notably reduced by intrinsic hole doping from the blocking fluorite slab which validates the conventional view of regarding Nd6Ni5O12 as a doped case of its infinite-layer counterpart. At the same time, however, the interactions are markedly layer-dependent. The outer most NiO2 layer adjacent to the blocking fluorite roughly corresponds to the 20% chemical doping in the infinite-layer material whereas the inner layers have stronger couplings. The long-range nature and the out-of-plane interactions are also presented. Our results provide useful information to understand this new superconducting nickelate whose intrinsic layer structure is obviously distinctive.</description>

      <title>High-performance conditional-driving gate for Kerr parametric oscillator qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs), two-photon driven Kerr-nonlinear resonators, can stably hold coherent states with opposite-sign amplitudes and are promising devices for quantum computing. Recently, we have theoretically proposed a two-qubit gate $R_{zz}$ for highly detuned KPOs and called it a conditional-driving gate [Chono $\textit{et al}$., Phys. Rev. Res. $\textbf{4}$, 043054 (2022)]. In this study, analyzing its superconducting-circuit model and deriving a corresponding static model, we find that an AC-Zeeman shift due to the flux pulse for the gate operation largely affects the gate performance. This effect becomes a more aggravating factor with shorter gate times, leading to an increase in the error rate. We thus propose a method to cancel this undesirable effect. Furthermore, through the use of shortcuts to adiabaticity and the optimization of flux pulses, we numerically demonstrate a conditional-driving gate with average fidelity exceeding 99.9$\%$ twice faster than that without the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Edge and bulk states in a three-site Kitaev chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A chain of quantum dots (QDs) coupled via semiconductor-superconductor hybrid regions can form an artificial Kitaev chain hosting Majorana bound states (MBSs). These zero-energy states are expected to be localised on the edges of the chain, at the outermost QDs. The remaining QDs, comprising the bulk, are predicted to host an excitation gap that protects the MBSs at the edges from local on-site perturbations. In this work, we demonstrate this connection between the bulk and edges in a minimal system, by engineering a three-site Kitaev chain in a two-dimensional electron gas. Through direct tunneling spectroscopy on each site, we show that the appearance of stable zero-bias conductance peaks at the outer QDs is correlated with the presence of an excitation gap in the middle QD. Furthermore, we show that this gap can be controlled by applying a superconducting phase difference between the two hybrid segments, and that the MBSs are robust only when the excitation gap is present. We find a close agreement between experiments and the original Kitaev model, thus confirming key predictions for MBSs in a three-site chain.</description>

      <title>Slow electron-phonon relaxation controls the dynamics of the superconducting resistive transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.06309v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the temporal and spatial scales of resistance fluctuations ($R$-fluctuations) at the superconducting resistive transition accessed through voltage fluctuations measurements in thin epitaxial TiN films. This material is characterized by a slow electron-phonon relaxation, which puts it far beyond the applicability range of the textbook scenario of superconducting fluctuations. The measured Lorentzian spectrum of the $R$-fluctuations identifies their correlation time, which is nearly constant across the transition region and has no relation to the conventional Ginzburg-Landau time scale. Instead, the correlation time coincides with the energy relaxation time determined by a combination of the electron-phonon relaxation and the relaxation via diffusion into reservoirs. Our data is quantitatively consistent with the model of spontaneous temperature fluctuations and highlight the lack of understanding of the resistive transition in materials with slow electron-phonon relaxation.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic constraint on $T_c$ for unconventional superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can room temperature superconductivity be achieved in correlated materials under ambient pressure? Our answer to this billion-dollar question is probably no, at least for realistic models within the current theoretical framework. This is shown by our systematic simulations on the pairing instability of some effective models for two-dimensional superconductivity. For a square lattice model with nearest-neighbour pairing, we find a plaquette state formed of weakly-connected $2\times2$ blocks for sufficiently large pairing interaction. The superconductivity is suppressed on both sides away from its melting quantum critical point. Thus, the plaquette state constrains the magnitude of $T_c$ for large pairing interactions and may be viewed as a strong-coupling parent state of $d$-wave superconductivity, in resemblance of other competing orders. We then extend our simulations to a variety of effective models covering nearest-neighbour or onsite pairings, single layer or two-layer structures, intralayer or interlayer pairings, and find an intrinsic maximum of the ratio $T_c/J\approx 0.04-0.07$, where $J$ is the onsite or nearest-neighbour pairing interaction. Comparison with existing experiments supports this constraint in cuprate, iron-based, nickelate, and heavy fermion superconductors, despite that these compounds are so complicated well beyond our simplified models. As a result, the known families of unconventional superconductivity, possibly except the infinite-layer nickelates, seem to almost exhaust their potentials in reaching the maximal $T_c$ allowed by their spin exchange interaction, while achieving room temperature superconductor would require a much larger $J$ beyond 400-700 meV, which seems unrealistic and hence demands novel pairing mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Constrained Hamiltonian dynamics for electrons in magnetic field and additional forces besides the Lorentz force acting on electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the forces acting on electrons in magnetic field including the constraints and a condition arising from quantum mechanics. The force is calculated as the electron mass, $m_e$, multiplied by the total time-derivative of the velocity field evaluated using the quantum mechanical many-electron wave function. The velocity field includes a term of the Berry connection from the many-body wave function; thereby, quantum mechanical effects are included. It is shown that additional important forces besides the Lorentz force exist; they include the gradient of the electron velocity field kinetic energy, the gradient of the chemical potential, and the `force' for producing topologically protected loop currents. These additional forces are shown to be important in superconductivity, electric current in metallic wires, and charging of capacitors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17712v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermoelectric transport has been widely used to study Abrikosov vortex dynamics in unconventional superconductors. However, only a few thermoelectric studies have been conducted near the dimensional crossover that occurs when the vortex-vortex interaction length scale becomes comparable to the sample size. Here we report the effects of finite size on the dissipation mechanisms of the Nernst effect in the optimally doped $\text{Bi}_{2}\text{Sr}_{2}\text{CaCu}_{2}\text{O}_{8+x}$ high-temperature superconductor, down to the atomic length limit. To access this regime, we develop a new generation of thermoelectric chips based on silicon nitride microprinted circuit boards. These chips ensure optimized signals while preventing sample deterioration. Our results demonstrate that lateral confinement at the nanoscale can effectively reduce vortex dissipation. Investigating vortex dissipation at the micro- and nano-scale is essential for creating stable, miniaturized superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in the pressurized nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ in the vicinity of a BEC-BCS crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ever since the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates, gaining microscopic insights into the nature of pairing in strongly correlated, repulsively interacting fermionic systems has remained one of the greatest challenges in modern condensed matter physics. Following recent experiments reporting superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO) with remarkably high critical temperatures of $T_c = 80$ K, it has been argued that the low-energy physics of LNO can be described by the strongly correlated, mixed-dimensional bilayer $t-J$ model. Here we investigate this bilayer system and utilize density matrix renormalization group techniques to establish a thorough understanding of the model and the magnetically induced pairing through comparison to the perturbative limit of dominating inter-layer spin couplings. In particular, this allows us to explain appearing finite-size effects, firmly establishing the existence of long-range superconducting order in the thermodynamic limit that is described by the XXZ universality class of hard-core bosons constituted by $s$-wave singlet pairs. As the effective model in the perturbative limit is known to show linear resistivity above the superconducting transition temperature, we propose a pair-based interpretation of the extended strange metal phase observed in LNO. By analyzing binding energies, we predict a BEC-BCS crossover as a function of the Hamiltonian parameters, whereas LNO is anticipated to lie on the BCS side in vicinity of the transition. We find large binding energies of the order of the inter-layer coupling that suggest strikingly high critical temperatures of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, raising the question whether (mixD) bilayer superconductors possibly facilitate critical temperatures above room temperature.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Kondo-Majorana interplay in ac response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze dynamical transport properties of a hybrid nanostructure, comprising a correlated quantum dot embedded between the source and drain electrodes, which are subject to an ac voltage, focusing on signatures imprinted on the charge transport by the side-attached Majorana zero-energy mode. The considerations are based on the Kubo formula, for which the relevant correlation functions are determined by using the numerical renormalization group approach, which allows us to consider the correlation effects due to the Coulomb repulsion and their interplay with the Majorana mode in a non-perturbative manner. We point out universal features of the dynamical conductance, showing up in the Kondo-Majorana regime, and differentiate them against the conventional Kondo and Majorana systems. In particular, we predict that the Majorana quasiparticles give rise to universal fractional values of the ac conductance in the well-defined frequency range below the peak at the Kondo scale. We also show this Kondo scale to actually increase with strengthening the coupling to the topological superconducting wire.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the equilibrium Josephson current through a disordered interacting quantum dot described by a Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model fully contacted by two BCS superconductors, such that all modes of the dot contribute to the coupling, which encodes hopping and spin-flip processes. We show that, at zero temperature and at the conformal limit, i.e. in the strong interacting limit, the Josephson current is suppressed by $U$, the strength of the interaction, as $\ln(U)/U$ and becomes universal, namely it gets independent on the superconducting gap. At finite temperature, instead, it depends on the ratio between the gap and the temperature. A proximity effect exists but the self-energy corrections induced by the coupling with the superconducting leads seem subleading as compared to the interaction self-energy and the tunneling matrix for large number of particles. Finally we compare the results of the original four-fermion model with those obtained considering zero interaction, two-fermions and a generalized q-fermion model.</description>

      <title>What is the dual Ginzburg-Landau theory for holographic superconductors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Holographic superconductors are holographic duals of superconductors. Macroscopically, a superconductor should be described by the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory. There is ample evidence that the holographic superconductors are described by the standard GL theory, but the exact form of the dual GL theory is little known. We identify the dual GL theory for a class of bulk 5-dimensional holographic superconductors, where numerical coefficients are obtained exactly.</description>

      <title>Low-characteristic-impedance superconducting tadpole resonators in the sub-gigahertz regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a simple and versatile resonator design based on a short strip of a typical coplanar waveguide shorted at one end to the ground and shunted at the other end with a large parallel-plate capacitor. Due to the shape of the structure, we coin it the tadpole resonator. The design allows tailoring the characteristic impedance of the resonator to especially suit applications requiring low values. We demonstrate characteristic impedances ranging from $Z_c = 2\,{\Omega}$ to $10\,{\Omega}$ and a frequency range from $f_0 = 290\,\mathrm{MHz}$ to $1.1\,\mathrm{GHz}$ while reaching internal quality factors of order $Q_{\mathrm{int}} = 8.5\times 10^3$ translating into a loss tangent of $\tan({\delta}) = 1.2\times 10^{-4}$ for the aluminium oxide used as the dielectric in the parallel plate capacitor. We conclude that these tadpole resonators are well suited for applications requiring low frequency and low charactersitic impedance while maintaining a small footprint on chip. The low characteristic impedance of the tadpole resonator renders it a promising candidate for achieving strong inductive coupling to other microwave components.</description>

      <title>Natural anomalous cyclotron response in a hydrodynamic local quantum critical metal in a periodic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study DC magnetotransport in a quantum critical metal in the presence of a lattice. In the regime where the transport is hydrodynamical the interplay of the Lorentz force and the lattice gives rise to a natural anomalous contribution to the cyclotron frequency that changes it from its canonical charge-to-mass ratio. The size of this effect is universal as it is determined only by thermodynamic quantities. Remarkably the Drude weight changes in such a way that to first subleading order in the lattice strength the Hall resistivity and Hall coefficient do not change, though the Hall angle does change. We confirm our results with numerical simulations in a holographic model of a strange metal. For weak lattice strength these hydrodynamic effects are shown to be present. The numerical simulations also suggest that strong lattice effects beyond a hydrodynamic regime may provide a resolution to the experimentally observed anomalous Hall response of cuprate strange metals.</description>
