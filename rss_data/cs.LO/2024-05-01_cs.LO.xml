      <title>Kuroda's Translation for Higher-Order Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1951, Kuroda defined an embedding of classical first-order logic into intuitionistic logic, such that a formula and its translation are equivalent in classical logic. Recently, Brown and Rizkallah extended this translation to higher-order logic, but did not prove the classical equivalence, and showed that the embedding fails in the presence of functional extensionality. We prove that functional extensionality and propositional extensionality are sufficient to derive the classical equivalence between a higher-order formula and its translation. We emphasize a condition under which Kuroda's translation works with functional extensionality.</description>

      <title>TRAC: a tool for data-aware coordination (with an application to smart contracts)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose TRAC, a tool for the specification and verification of coordinated multiparty distributed systems. Relying on finite-state machines (FSMs) where transition labels look like Hoare triples, \thetool can specify the coordination of the participants of a distributed protocol for instance an execution model akin blockchain smart contracts (SCs). In fact, the transitions of our FSMs yield guards, and assignments over data variables, and with participants binders. The latter allow us to model scenarios with an unbounded number of participants which can vary at run-time. We introduce a notion of well-formedness to rule out meaningless or problematic specifications. This notion is verified with TRAC and demonstrated on several case studies borrowed from the smart contracts domain. Then, we evaluate the performance of TRAC using a set of randomised examples, studying the correlations between the features supported and the time taken to decide well-formedness.</description>

      <title>Behavioural Metrics: Compositionality of the Kantorovich Lifting and an Application to Up-To Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Behavioural distances of transition systems modelled as coalgebras for endofunctors generalize the traditional notions of behavioural equivalence to a quantitative setting, in which states are equipped with a measure of how (dis)similar they are. Endowing transition systems with such distances essentially relies on the ability to lift functors describing the one-step behavior of the transition systems to the category of pseudometric spaces. We consider the Kantorovich lifting of a functor on quantale-valued relations, which subsumes equivalences, preorders and (directed) metrics. We use tools from fibred category theory, which allow one to see the Kantorovich lifting as arising from an appropriate fibred adjunction. Our main contributions are compositionality results for the Kantorovich lifting, where we show that that the lifting of a composed functor coincides with the composition of the liftings. In addition we describe how to lift distributive laws in the case where one of the two functors is polynomial. These results are essential ingredients for adopting up-to-techniques to the case of quantale-valued behavioural distances. Up-to techniques are a well-known coinductive technique for efficiently showing lower bounds for behavioural distances. We conclude by illustrating the results of our paper in two case studies.</description>

      <title>Sound and Complete Proof Rules for Probabilistic Termination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Termination is a fundamental question in the analysis of probabilistic imperative programs. We consider the qualitative and quantitative probabilistic termination problems for an imperative programming model with discrete probabilistic choice and demonic bounded nondeterminism. The qualitative question asks if the program terminates almost surely, no matter how nondeterminism is resolved; the quantitative question asks for a bound on the probability of termination. Despite a long and rich literature on the topic, no sound and relatively complete proof systems were known for this problem. We provide the first sound and relatively complete proof rules for proving qualitative and quantitative termination in the assertion language of arithmetic. Our proof rules use supermartingales as estimates of likelihood of the prgroam's evolution - the key insight is to use appropriately defined finite-state sub-instances. Our completeness result shows how to construct a suitable supermartingales from an almost-surely terminating program. We also show that proofs of termination in many existing proof systems can be transformed to proofs in our system, pointing to its applicability in practice. As an application of our proof rule, we show a proof of almost sure termination for the two-dimensional random walker.</description>

      <title>COTS: Connected OpenAPI Test Synthesis for RESTful Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel model-driven approach for testing RESTful applications. We introduce a (i) domain-specific language for OpenAPI specifications and (ii) a tool to support our methodology. Our DSL is inspired by session types and enables the modelling of communication protocols between a REST client and server. Our tool, dubbed COTS, generates (randomised) model-based test executions and reports software defects. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to test several open source applications. Our findings indicate that our methodology can identify nuanced defects in REST APIs and achieve comparable or superior code coverage when compared to much larger handcrafted test suites.</description>

      <title>Behavioural pseudometrics for continuous-time diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bisimulation is a concept that captures behavioural equivalence of states in a variety of types of transition systems. It has been widely studied in a discrete-time setting where the notion of a step is fundamental. In our setting we are considering "flow"-processes emphasizing that they evolve in continuous time. In such continuous-time settings, the concepts are not straightforward adaptations of their discrete-time analogues and we restrict our study to diffusions that do not lose mass over time and with additional regularity constraints.
  In previous work we proposed different definitions of behavioural equivalences for continuous-time stochastic processes where the evolution is a flow through time. That work only addressed equivalences. In this work, we aim at quantifying how differently processes behave. We present two pseudometrics for diffusion-like processes. These pseudometrics are fixpoints of two different functionals on the space of 1-bounded pseudometrics on the state space. We also characterize these pseudometrics in terms of real-valued modal logics; this is a quantitative analogue of the notion of logical characterization of bisimulation. These real-valued modal logics indicate that the two pseudometrics are different and thus yield different notions of behavioural equivalence.</description>

      <title>Decidability of Graph Neural Networks via Logical Characterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results concerning the expressiveness and decidability of a popular graph learning formalism, graph neural networks (GNNs), exploiting connections with logic. We use a family of recently-discovered decidable logics involving "Presburger quantifiers". We show how to use these logics to measure the expressiveness of classes of GNNs, in some cases getting exact correspondences between the expressiveness of logics and GNNs. We also employ the logics, and the techniques used to analyze them, to obtain decision procedures for verification problems over GNNs. We complement this with undecidability results for static analysis problems involving the logics, as well as for GNN verification problems.</description>

      <title>Formalising and Computing the Fourth Homotopy Group of the $3$-Sphere in Cubical Agda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00151v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brunerie's 2016 PhD thesis contains the first synthetic proof in Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) of the classical result that the fourth homotopy group of the 3-sphere is $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$. The proof is one of the most impressive pieces of synthetic homotopy theory to date and uses a lot of advanced classical algebraic topology rephrased synthetically. Furthermore, the proof is fully constructive and the main result can be reduced to the question of whether a particular "Brunerie number" $\beta$ can be normalised to $\pm 2$. The question of whether Brunerie's proof could be formalised in a proof assistant, either by computing this number or by formalising the pen-and-paper proof, has since remained open. In this paper, we present a complete formalisation in Cubical Agda. We do this by modifying Brunerie's proof so that a key technical result, whose proof Brunerie only sketched in his thesis, can be avoided. We also present a formalisation of a new and much simpler proof that $\beta$ is $\pm 2$. This formalisation provides us with a sequence of simpler Brunerie numbers, one of which normalises very quickly to $-2$ in Cubical Agda, resulting in a fully formalised computer-assisted proof that $\pi_4(\mathbb{S}^3) \cong \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <title>Rule-Based Error Detection and Correction to Operationalize Movement Trajectory Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classification of movement trajectories has many applications in transportation. Supervised neural models represent the current state-of-the-art. Recent security applications require this task to be rapidly employed in environments that may differ from the data used to train such models for which there is little training data. We provide a neuro-symbolic rule-based framework to conduct error correction and detection of these models to support eventual deployment in security applications. We provide a suite of experiments on several recent and state-of-the-art models and show an accuracy improvement of 1.7% over the SOTA model in the case where all classes are present in training and when 40% of classes are omitted from training, we obtain a 5.2% improvement (zero-shot) and 23.9% (few-shot) improvement over the SOTA model without resorting to retraining of the base model.</description>

      <title>Layered and Staged Monte Carlo Tree Search for SMT Strategy Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern SMT solvers, such as Z3, offer user-controllable strategies, enabling users to tailor solving strategies for their unique set of instances, thus dramatically enhancing solver performance for their use case. However, this approach of strategy customization presents a significant challenge: handcrafting an optimized strategy for a class of SMT instances remains a complex and demanding task for both solver developers and users alike.
  In this paper, we address this problem of automatic SMT strategy synthesis via a novel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) based method. Our method treats strategy synthesis as a sequential decision-making process, whose search tree corresponds to the strategy space, and employs MCTS to navigate this vast search space. The key innovations that enable our method to identify effective strategies, while keeping costs low, are the ideas of layered and staged MCTS search. These novel heuristics allow for a deeper and more efficient exploration of the strategy space, enabling us to synthesize more effective strategies than the default ones in state-of-the-art (SOTA) SMT solvers. We implement our method, dubbed Z3alpha, as part of the Z3 SMT solver. Through extensive evaluations across six important SMT logics, Z3alpha demonstrates superior performance compared to the SOTA synthesis tool FastSMT, the default Z3 solver, and the CVC5 solver on most benchmarks. Remarkably, on a challenging QF_BV benchmark set, Z3alpha solves 42.7% more instances than the default strategy in the Z3 SMT solver.</description>

      <title>Risk-Aware MPC for Stochastic Systems with Runtime Temporal Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03165v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns the risk-aware control of stochastic systems with temporal logic specifications dynamically assigned during runtime. Conventional risk-aware control typically assumes that all specifications are predefined and remain unchanged during runtime. In this paper, we propose a novel, provably correct model predictive control scheme for linear systems with additive unbounded stochastic disturbances that dynamically evaluates the feasibility of runtime signal temporal logic specifications and automatically reschedules the control inputs accordingly. The control method guarantees the probabilistic satisfaction of newly accepted specifications without sacrificing the satisfaction of the previously accepted ones. The proposed control method is validated by a robotic motion planning case study.</description>

      <title>Predictable Verification using Intrinsic Definitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism of defining data structures using intrinsic definitions that avoids recursion and instead utilizes monadic maps satisfying local conditions. We show that intrinsic definitions are a powerful mechanism that can capture a variety of data structures naturally. We show that they also enable a predictable verification methodology that allows engineers to write ghost code to update monadic maps and perform verification using reduction to decidable logics. We evaluate our methodology using Boogie and prove a suite of data structure manipulating programs correct.</description>
