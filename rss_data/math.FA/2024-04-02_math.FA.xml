      <title>On the weak-fragmentability index of some Lipschitz-free spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the existence of Lipschitz-free spaces verifying the Point of Continuity Property with arbitrarily high weak-fragmentability index. For this purpose, we use a generalized construction of the countably branching diamond graphs. As a consequence, we deduce that to be Lipschitz-universal for countable complete metric spaces, a separable complete metric space cannot be purely 1-unrectifiable. Another corollary is the existence of an uncountable family of pairwise non-isomorphic Lipschitz-free spaces over purely 1-unrectifiable metric spaces. Some results on compact reduction are also obtained.</description>

      <title>Arens regularity and irregularity of ideals in Fourier and group algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a weakly sequentially complete Banach algebra containing a bounded approximate identity that is an ideal in its second dual $\mathcal{A}^{\ast\ast}$, we call such an algebra a Wesebai algebra. In the present paper we examine the Arens regularity properties of closed ideals of algebras in the Wesebai class. We observe that, although Wesebai algebras are always strongly Arens irregular, a variety of Arens regularity properties can be observed within their closed ideals.
  After characterizing Arens regular ideals and strongly Arens irregular ideals, we proceed to particularize to the main examples of Wesebai algebras, the convolution group algebras $L^1(G)$, $G$ compact, and the Fourier algebras $A(\Gamma)$, $\Gamma$ discrete and amenable. We find examples of Arens regular ideals in $L^1(G)$ and $A(\Gamma)$, both reflexive and nonreflexive and examples of strongly Arens irregular ideals that are not in the Wesebai class. In finding these examples, we prove that every infinite Abelian group contains a Rosenthal set that is not $\Lambda(p)$, for any $p&gt;0$, a result that could be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the following text we compute the adjoint of weighted generalized shift operators over Hilbert spaces. We show for a conjugate invariant subset $A$ of $\mathbb C$, the additive semigroup generated by $A\cup\{0\}-$weighted generalized shifts over Hilbert space $\mathcal H$ is adjoint invariant if and only if $\mathcal H$ is a finite dimensional Hilbert space or $0$ is not a limit point of $A$.</description>

      <title>The algebra of hyperinterpolation-class on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the so-called concept of hyperinterpolation-class, i.e., the set of all operators derived from the hyperinterpolation operator on the unit sphere. Concretely, we select four different elements in the hyperinterpolation-class, namely filtered hyperinterpolation, Lasso hyperinterpolation, hard thresholding hyperinterpolation and generalized hyperinterpolation introduced by Dai [10], to explore their algebraic properties on the sphere. Based on the idea of a discrete (semi) inner product, we propose the concepts of hyper self-adjoint operator, hyper projection operator and hyper algebra. Next, we prove generalized hyperinterpolation is hyper self-adjoint and commutative with hyperinterpolation. Then we establish corresponding results of the product, sum and difference of hyper projection operators. Last but not least, we present the results of ideals between hard thresholding hyperinterpolation and hyperinterpolation. We also give a preliminary result of involutions, and also introduce the concepts of hyper $C^{\ast}$-algebra and hyper homomorphism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for the functions of the form $g(x) = h(x) + \frac{C}{x+i}$, where $h$ belongs to the continuous Wiener algebra $W_0$, the intersection of the frame set $\mathcal{F}_g$ with every hyperbola $\{\alpha, \beta &gt; 0 \mid \alpha\beta = c\}$ is open in the relative topology. In particular, this applies to all rational functions $g$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores some important aspects of the theory of rearrangement-invariant quasi-Banach function spaces. We focus on two main topics. Firstly, we prove an analogue of the Luxemburg representation theorem for rearrangement-invariant quasi-Banach function spaces over resonant measure spaces. Secondly, we develop the theory of fundamental functions and endpoint spaces.</description>

      <title>Unexpected Uncertainty Principle for Disc Banach Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(\{f_n\}_{n=1}^\infty, \{\tau_n\}_{n=1}^\infty)$ and $(\{g_n\}_{n=1}^\infty, \{\omega_n\}_{n=1}^\infty)$ be unbounded continuous p-Schauder frames ($0&lt;p&lt;1$) for a disc Banach space $\mathcal{X}$. Then for every $x \in ( \mathcal{D}(\theta_f) \cap\mathcal{D}(\theta_g))\setminus\{0\}$, we show that \begin{align}\label{UB} (1) \quad \quad \quad \quad \|\theta_f x\|_0\|\theta_g x\|_0 \geq \frac{1}{\left(\displaystyle\sup_{n,m \in \mathbb{N} }|f_n(\omega_m)|\right)^p\left(\displaystyle\sup_{n, m \in \mathbb{N}}|g_m(\tau_n)|\right)^p}, \end{align} where \begin{align*} &amp; \theta_f: \mathcal{D}(\theta_f) \ni x \mapsto \theta_fx := \{f_n(x)\}_{n=1}^\infty\in \ell^p(\mathbb{N}), \quad \theta_g: \mathcal{D}(\theta_g) \ni x \mapsto \theta_gx := \{g_n(x)\}_{n=1}^\infty\in \ell^p(\mathbb{N}). \end{align*} Inequality (1) is unexpectedly different from both bounded uncertainty principle \textit{[arXiv:2308.00312v1]} and unbounded uncertainty principle \textit{[arXiv:2312.00366v1]} for Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>Method of similar operators in harmonious Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider similarity transformations of a perturbed linear operator $A-B$ in a complex Banach space $\mathcal{X}$, where the unperturbed operator $A$ is a generator of a Banach $L_1(\mathbb{R})$-module and the perturbation operator $B$ is a bounded linear operator. The result of the transformation is a simpler operator $A-B_0$. For example, if $A$ is a differentiation operator and $B$ is an operator of multiplication by an operator-valued function, then $B_0$ is an operator of multiplication by a function that is a restriction of an entire function of exponential type and could be $0$ in some cases. As a consequence, we derive the spectral invariance of the operator $A-B$ in a large class of spaces. The study is based on a widely applicable modification of the method of similar operators that is also presented in the paper. This non-traditional modification is rooted in the spectral theory of Banach $L_1(\mathbb{R})$-modules.</description>

      <title>Limit-case admissibility for positive infinite-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of positive infinite-dimensional linear systems, we systematically study $L^p$-admissible control and observation operators with respect to the limit-cases $p=\infty$ and $p=1$, respectively. This requires an in-depth understanding of the order structure on the extrapolation space $X_{-1}$, which we provide. These properties of $X_{-1}$ also enable us to discuss when zero-class admissibility is automatic. While those limit-cases are the weakest form of admissibility on the $L^p$-scale, it is remarkable that they sometimes follow from order theoretic and geometric assumptions. Our assumptions on the geometries of the involved spaces are minimal.</description>

      <title>Geometric mean for T-positive definite tensors and associated Riemannian geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the geometric mean of two positive definite matrices to that of third-order tensors using the notion of T-product. Specifically, we define the geometric mean of two T-positive definite tensors and verify several properties that "mean" should satisfy including the idempotence and the commutative property, and so on. Moreover, it is shown that the geometric mean is a unique T-positive definite solution of an algebraic Riccati tensor equation and can be expressed as solutions of algebraic Riccati matrix equations. In addition, we investigate the Riemannian manifold associated with the geometric mean for T-positive definite tensors, considering it as a totally geodesic embedded submanifold of the Riemannian manifold associated with the case of matrices. It is particularly shown that the geometric mean of two T-positive definite tensors is the midpoint of a unique geodesic joining the tensors, and the manifold is a Cartan-Hadamard-Riemannian manifold.</description>

Abstract: We continue the $U$-bound program initiated in [J. Funct. Anal. 258, 814-851 (2010)] and prove super-Poincar\'e inequalities for a class of probability measures defined on stratified Lie groups and in terms of their homogeneous norms with explicit estimates, the main ingredient in the proof being a Hardy-type inequality. In doing so, we recover and extend some previous results from the probabilistic viewpoint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Property $\mathrm{(TTT)}$ is an obstruction to weak amenability with Cowling--Haagerup constant $1$. More precisely, if $G$ is a countable group and $H$ is an infinite subgroup of $G$ such that the pair $(G,H)$ has relative Property $\mathrm{(TTT)}$, then the weak Haagerup constant $\boldsymbol\Lambda_{\mathrm{WH}}(G)$ is strictly greater than $1$. We apply this result to some semidirect products and lattices in higher rank algebraic groups.</description>

      <title>The biharmonic optimal support problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a $\Gamma$-convergence result for $h\to 0$ of a thin nonlinearly elastic 3D-plate of thickness $h&gt;0$ which is assumed to be glued to a support region in the 2D-plane $x_3=0$ over the $h$-2D-neighborhood of a given closed set $K$. In the regime of very small vertical forces we identify the $\Gamma$-limit as being the bi-harmonic energy, with Dirichlet condition on the gluing region $K$, following a general strategy by Friesecke, James, and M\"uller that we have to adapt in presence of the glued region. Then we introduce a shape optimization problem that we call "optimal support problem" and which aims to find the best glued plate. In this problem the bi-harmonic energy is optimized among all possible glued regions $K$ that we assume to be connected and for which we penalize the length. By relating the dual problem with Griffith almost-minimizers, we are able to prove that any minimizer is $C^{1,\alpha}$ regular outside a set of Hausdorff dimension strictly less then one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the monotonic and symmetric properties of convex solutions Monge-Amp\`ere systems for instance, considering
  \begin{equation*}
  \det(D^2u^i)=f^i(x,{\bf u},\nabla u^i), \ 1\leq i\leq m,
  \end{equation*} over unbounded domains of various cases, including the whole spaces $\mathbb{R}^n$, the half spaces $\mathbb{R}^n_+$ and the unbounded tube shape domains in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We obtain monotonic and symmetric properties of the solutions to the problem with respect to the geometry of domains and the monotonic and symmetric properties of right-hand side terms. The proof is based on carefully using the moving plane method together with various maximum principles and Hopf's lemmas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the following fully nonlinear elliptic equations \begin{equation*} \left\{\begin{array}{rl} \left(S_{k}(D^{2}u)\right)^{\frac1k}=\lambda f(-u) &amp; in\quad\Omega \\ u=0 &amp; on\quad \partial\Omega\\ \end{array} \right. \end{equation*} and coupled systems \begin{equation*} \left\{\begin{array}{rl} (S_{k}(D^{2}u))^\frac1k=\lambda g(-u,-v) &amp; in\quad\Omega \\ (S_{k}(D^{2}v))^\frac1k=\lambda h(-u,-v) &amp; in\quad\Omega \\ u=v=0 &amp; on\quad \partial\Omega\\ \end{array} \right. \end{equation*} dominated by $k$-Hessian operators, where $\Omega$ is a $(k$-$1)$-convex bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^{N}$, $\lambda$ is a non-negative parameter, $f:\left[0,+\infty\right)\rightarrow\left[0,+\infty\right)$ is a continuous function with zeros only at $0$ and $g,h:\left[0,+\infty\right)\times \left[0,+\infty\right)\rightarrow \left[0,+\infty\right)$ are continuous functions with zeros only at $(\cdot,0)$ and $(0,\cdot)$. We determine the interval of $\lambda$ about the existence, non-existence, uniqueness and multiplicity of $k$-convex solutions to the above problems according to various cases of $f,g,h$, which is a complete supplement to the known results in previous literature. In particular, the above results are also new for Laplacian and Monge-Amp\`ere operators. We mainly use bifurcation theory, a-priori estimates, various maximum principles and technical strategies in the proof.</description>

      <title>Continual Lie algebras determined by chain complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.07431v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continual Lie algebras are infinite dimensional generalizations of ordinary Lie with continuous set of roots. In this paper we establish a general relation between chain complexes and continual Lie algebras. First, by defining and appropriate product among a chain complex spaces we endow it with the structure of an exterior differential graded algebra $\mathcal C$. The natural orthogonality condition with respect to a product bring about to $\mathcal C$ the structure of a graded algebra with differential relations and compatibility conditions for elements of chain complex spaces. By considering the union of all relations for independent elements in the tree graph structure of the system, we prove the main result of this paper: a chain complex brings about the structure of a continual Lie algebra with the root space determined by parameters for the complex. This provides a new source of examples of continual Lie algebras. Finally, as an example, we consider the case of \v{C}ech-de Rham complex associated to a foliation on a smooth manifold. In a particular case of this chain complex, we derive explicitly the commutation relations for corresponding continual Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>Spectral multipliers for maximally subelliptic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a non-negative, self-adjoint, maximally subelliptic operator on a compact manifold. We show that the spectral multiplier is a singular integral operator under an appropriate Mihlin-H\"ormander type condition. We establish the equivalence between non-isotropic Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces adapted to the operator and those adapted to a Carnot-Carath\'eodory geometry on the manifold. We also give a Mihlin-H\"ormander type condition for the boundedness of the spectral multiplier on non-isotropic $L^p$ Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>A Rogers--Brascamp--Lieb--Luttinger inequality in the space of matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider convex bodies in $M_{n,m}(\mathbb R)$, the space of matrices of $n$-rows and $m$-columns. A special case of fiber-symmetrization in $M_{n,m}(\mathbb R)$ was recently introduced in [5,6]. We prove a Rogers--Brascamp--Lieb--Luttinger type inequality with respect to this symmetrization, for quasi-concave functions and provide some applications.</description>

      <title>Toeplitz Operators Defined between K\"othe Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to define Toeplitz operators between K\"{o}the spaces, especially power series spaces. We determine the conditions for continuity and compactness of these operators. We define the concept of S-tameness of a family of continuous operators. We construct some conditions on S-tameness for the families consisting from Toeplitz operators.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic order of the quantization error for a class of self-similar measures with overlaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01103v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\{f_i\}_{i=1}^N$ be a set of equi-contractive similitudes on $\mathbb{R}^1$ satisfying the finite-type condition. We study the asymptotic quantization error for self-similar measures $\mu$ associated with $\{f_i\}_{i=1}^N$ and a positive probability vector. With a verifiable assumption, we prove that the upper and lower quantization coefficient for $\mu$ are both bounded away from zero and infinity. This can be regarded as an extension of Graf and Luschgy's result on self-similar measures with the open set condition. Our result is applicable to a significant class of self-similar measures with overlaps, including Erd\"{o}s measure, the $3$-fold convolution of the classical Cantor measure and the self-similar measures on some $\lambda$-Cantor sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the geometrically doubling condition of a metric space in terms of the uniform $L^1$-boundedness of superaveraging operators, where uniform refers to the existence of bounds independent of the measure being considered.</description>

      <title>On the continuity of intertwining operators over generalized convolution algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let ${\sf G}$ be a locally compact group, $\mathscr C\overset{q}{\to}{\sf G}$ a Fell bundle and $\mathfrak B=L^1({\sf G}\,\vert\,\mathscr C)$ the algebra of integrable cross-sections associated to the bundle. We give conditions that guarantee the automatic continuity of an intertwining operator $\theta:\mathcal X_1\to\mathcal X_2$, where $\mathcal X_1$ is a Banach $\mathfrak B$-bimodule and $\mathcal X_2$ is a weak Banach $\mathfrak B$-bimodule, in terms of the continuity ideal of $\theta$. We provide examples of algebras where this conditions are met, both in the case of derivations and algebra morphisms. In particular, we show that, if ${\sf G}$ is infinite, finitely-generated, has polynomial growth and $\alpha$ is a free (partial) action of ${\sf G}$ on the compact space $X$, then every homomorphism of $\ell^1_\alpha({\sf G},C(X))$ into a Banach algebra is automatically continuous.</description>

      <title>A Koopman-Takens theorem: Linear least squares prediction of nonlinear time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02175v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The least squares linear filter, also called the Wiener filter, is a popular tool to predict the next element(s) of time series by linear combination of time-delayed observations. We consider observation sequences of deterministic dynamics, and ask: Which pairs of observation function and dynamics are predictable? If one allows for nonlinear mappings of time-delayed observations, then Takens' well-known theorem implies that a set of pairs, large in a specific topological sense, exists for which an exact prediction is possible. We show that a similar statement applies for the linear least squares filter in the infinite-delay limit, by considering the forecast problem for invertible measure-preserving maps and the Koopman operator on square-integrable functions.</description>

      <title>Small values and forbidden values for the Fourier antidiagonal constant of a finite group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13998v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a finite group $G$, let ${\rm AD}(G)$ denote the Fourier norm of the antidiagonal in $G\times G$. It was shown recently by the author (IMRN, 2023) that ${\rm AD}(G)$ coincides with the amenability constant of the Fourier algebra of $G$, and is equal to the normalized sum of the cubes of character degrees of $G$. Motivated by a gap result for amenability constants due to Johnson (JLMS, 1994), we determine exactly which numbers in the interval $[1,2]$ arise as values of ${\rm AD}(G)$.
  As a by-product, we show that the set of values of ${\rm AD}(G)$ does not contain all its limit points. Some other calculations or bounds for ${\rm AD}(G)$ are given for familiar classes of finite groups. We also indicate a connection between ${\rm AD}(G)$ and the commuting probability of $G$, and use this to show that every finite group $G$ satisfying ${\rm AD}(G)&lt; \frac{61}{15}$ must be solvable; here the value $\frac{61}{15}$ is best possible.</description>

      <title>Accumulated spectrograms for hyperuniform determinantal point processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the accumulated spectrogram associated to a locally trace class orthogonal projection operator and to a bounded set using the polar decomposition of its restriction on that set and prove a convergence theorem for accumulated spectrograms along an exhaustion in the case when the corresponding determinantal point process is hyperuniform. We prove that a radial determinantal point process on Rd is always hyperuniform along the exhaustion formed by the dilations of a bounded open set, and as a consequence, we obtain that dilations of the corresponding accumulated spectrogram converge to the indicator function of the considered set, establishing thus a universal phenomenon. Our result is a generalisation of a theorem by Abreu-Gr\"ochenig-Romero in [1] concerning time-frequency localization operators.</description>
