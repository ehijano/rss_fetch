      <title>Kepler's Platonic Model and Its Application to Exoplanetary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Johannes Kepler's attempt to explain the arrangement of the six innermost planets of the Solar System using his Platonic Solid Model-which postulates that planetary orbits are nested within the five Platonic solids-was ultimately unsuccessful. However, while his model failed to describe our own planetary system, Kepler was remarkably prescient in hypothesizing the existence of exoplanetary systems that might conform to this geometric framework. In this study, we analyze all known multiple exoplanet systems containing three to six planets and identify those that best match the Keplerian Platonic model. Using a semi-major-axis (SMA) ratio metric defined as the sum of squared differences between observed and theoretical semi-major-axis ratios, we find that the most well-matched three-, four-, five-, and six-planet exoplanetary systems exhibit significantly lower discrepancy values $(4.38 \times 10^{-6}, 1.05 \times 10^{-2}, 8.21 \times 10^{-2}$, and $2.43 \times 10^{-1}$, respectively) compared to the inner six planets of the Solar System at 12.68. These results demonstrate that Kepler's Platonic Model is applicable to certain exoplanetary systems, suggesting that while the Solar System does not adhere to this idealized structure, other planetary systems may be governed by underlying geometric and mathematical principles akin to Kepler's vision. This study highlights the special nature of these exoplanetary systems and their potential alignment with the Platonic five-element framework.</description>

      <title>A semi-analytical model of the outer structure of protoplanetary discs formed by the collapse of a rotating molecular cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Protoplanetary discs are formed due to the fragmentation and collapse of giant molecular cloud cores. The physical properties and structure of a formed disc are of great importance when studying the onset of planet formation processes. Aims. Starting from the isothermal collapse of a rotating Bonnor-Ebert sphere, and assuming the conservation of angular momentum, we look for the structure equations of the newly formed protoplanetary disc. We take into account the possible role of pressure gradient in forming the initial disc structure, and compare our results with those obtained from a Keplerian infall model. Our aim is to obtain initial conditions to numerically study the evolution of the gaseous and solid components of protoplanetary discs. Methods. The structure equations developed for protoplanetary discs have been derived analytically, while these equations have been solved numerically. Results. The surface density profiles of the newly formed protoplanetary discs strongly depend on the initial rotation state of the Bonnor-Ebert sphere. According to our results, for slow rotators, gravitational instabilities can develop in the early phases of disc formation, while for relatively fast rotators, the outermost regions of the resulting discs are gravitationally stable, quite massive and highly sub-Keplerian, allowing rapid dust transport to the inner disc and subsequent planet formation.</description>

      <title>The Laplace Surface of a Circumplanetary Disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Laplace surface defines the location of circular particle orbits that do not undergo nodal precession around a planet with some obliquity. Close to the planet the surface coincides with the equator of the planet, while far from the planet it coincides with the orbital plane of the planet. We determine the shape of the Laplace surface of a circumplanetary disc that results from accretion of circumstellar gas and experiences the effects of gas pressure, self-gravity, and viscosity, as well as the gravitational effects due to the planetary spin and the star. We apply the linear theory of warped discs in the wavelike regime for a small-obliquity planet such as Jupiter. As a result of dissipation, a disc that begins slightly away from its Laplace surface will evolve to it. Because of pressure effects in typically warm circumplanetary discs, the disc is highly flattened compared with the classical Laplace surface, meaning that it is much less warped but still significantly tilted. For the case of Jupiter, the disc does not align anywhere with the equator of the planet. For such discs, the effects of self-gravity and viscosity on warping are typically small. The disc tilt is intermediate between the planet's equatorial and orbital planes. Circumplanetary discs that are much cooler than expected can undergo warping and alignment with the planet's equator at small radii. The results have implications for the orbital evolution of satellites in the solar system that are observed to be somewhat aligned with their classical Laplace surface.</description>

      <title>Habitability and Biosignatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for life beyond the solar system is a central goal in exoplanetary science. Exoplanet surveys are increasingly detecting potentially habitable exoplanets and large telescopes in space and on ground are aiming to detect possible biosignatures in their atmospheres. At the same time, theoretical studies are expanding the range of habitable environments beyond the conventional focus on Earth-like rocky planets and biosignatures beyond the dominant biogenic gases in the Earth's atmosphere. The present work provides an introductory compendium of key aspects of habitability and biosignatures of importance to the search for life in exoplanetary environments. Basic concepts of planetary habitability are introduced along with essential requirements for life as we know it and the various factors that affect habitability. These include the requirement for liquid water, energy sources, bioessential elements, and geophysical environmental conditions conducive for life. The factors affecting habitability include both astrophysical conditions, such as those due to the host star, as well as planetary processes, such as atmospheric escape, magnetic interactions, and geological activity. A survey of different types of habitable environments possible in exoplanetary systems is presented. The notion of a biosignature is presented along with examples of biosignatures on Earth and their applicability to habitable environments in exoplanetary systems. The desired properties of an ideal biosignature are discussed, along with considerations of the environmental context and chemical disequilibria in the assessment of biosignatures in diverse environments. A discussion of current state-of-the-art and future prospects in the search for habitable conditions and biosignatures on exoplanets is presented.</description>

      <title>Engineering Microbial Symbiosis for Mars Habitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The colonization of Mars presents extraordinary challenges, including radiation exposure, low atmospheric pressure, and toxic regolith. Recent advancements in synthetic biology and genetic engineering offer unprecedented opportunities to address these obstacles by utilizing terrestrial extremophiles and engineered organisms. This paper examines the potential for creating symbiotic relationships between terrestrial microbes and hypothetical Martian life forms, should they exist, to support a sustainable human presence on Mars. Inspired by natural examples of endosymbiosis, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts, we propose methods to engineer life forms capable of enduring Martian conditions. Key components include experimental designs, laboratory simulations, and bioengineering approaches essential to this endeavor. The ethical, political, and technological challenges of introducing engineered life to Mars are critically evaluated, with an emphasis on international collaboration and robust planetary protection policies. This research underscores engineered symbiosis as a transformative strategy for enabling life to adapt and thrive on Mars while advancing humanity's aspirations for interplanetary habitation and exploration. By addressing these challenges, this work highlights a path toward sustainable life on Mars, reflecting both scientific ingenuity and ethical stewardship.</description>

      <title>Water-Cooled (sub)-Neptunes Get Better Gas Mileage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demographics of sub-Jovian planets around low-mass stars is dominated by populations of ``sub-Neptunes" and ``super-Earths", distinguished by the presence or absence of envelopes of low-molecular weight volatiles, i.e., H2, He, and H2O. The current paradigm is that sub-Neptunes on close-in orbits evolve into super-Earths via atmospheric escape driven by high-energy stellar irradiation. We use an integrated hydrodynamic-radiation-chemical network model of outflow to demonstrate that this escape is modulated by the abundance of H2O, an efficient infrared coolant. Increasing H2O/H2 at the base of the flow induces an order-of-magnitude decline in escape rate, with definitive consequences for retention of envelopes over Gyr. We show that saturation limits on H2O in the upper atmospheres of temperate sub-Neptunes could explain the paradoxical observations that these objects disappear more rapidly than their counterparts closer to their host stars. We also propose that the scarcity of sub-Neptunes around very low mass stars could be related to the water-poor chemistry of their antecedent protoplanetary disks. Observations of atmospheric H2O by JWST as well as searches for atmospheric escape from younger planets using H and He lines could test these predictions.</description>

      <title>Class I/II Jets with JWST: Mass loss rates, Asymmetries, and Binary induced Wigglings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST NIRSpec spectro-imaging observations of jets from four edge-on protoplanetary disks that exhibit clear signatures of MHD disk winds. Bipolar jets are detected and spatially resolved in over 30 shock-excited forbidden lines, multiple Paschen and Brackett series lines of atomic hydrogen, and the high-energy excitation line of atomic helium (1.083 um). This helium line is the brightest jet-tracer towards HH 30 and FS TauB, which also exhibit asymmetric intensity between their red- and blue-shifted lobes in all tracers, including the [Fe II] and [He I] lines. Extinction maps reveal no significant differences across the lobes, suggesting an asymmetric jet-launching mechanism rather than environmental effects. Diagnostic line ratios yield consistent shock speeds of 50-60 km/s, jet ionization fractions of 0.1-0.2, and pre-shock electron densities of 1000 /cm^3. Combined with pixel-by-pixel electron density maps and [Fe II] line luminosities, we estimate jet mass-loss rates using three independent methods, averaging around a few 10^(-9) solar masses/yr. We estimate the accretion rates for these sources as 10 times the jet mass loss rates and find them to match well with the independently derived accretion estimates of other Class II sources in the Taurus star-forming region. Owing to JWST's high precision, we also investigate jet wiggling and find Tau 042021 to showcase the perfect case of mirror-symmetric wiggling, which can only be explained by the motion of the jet source around a stellar companion. Modeling this wiggling suggests Tau 042021 to host 0.33 and 0.07 solar masses binary at the center with binary separation of 1.35 au and an orbital period of 2.5 years.</description>

      <title>The Two-component Model of the 'spokes' in Saturn's Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23418v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spokes observed in Saturn's rings have been a subject of scientific debate since their discovery by Stephen J. O'Meara in the 1970s and their confirmation by the Voyager flybys in the early 1980s (Smith et al., 1982). While the Cassini spacecraft confirmed that the spokes are linked to Saturn's magnetosphere, their exact formation mechanism remains uncertain. This paper proposes that the spokes in Saturn's rings consist of two distinct components: (1) carbonaceous materials, namely pyrolytic carbon with diamagnetic properties and potentially other various forms of carbon-bearing compounds, which persist over longer timescales, and (2) rapidly forming and dissipating diamagnetic ice grains, which interact with Saturn's magnetosphere on much shorter timescales. We suggest that the spokes consist of diamagnetic pyrolytic carbon that has coated silicates through the process of high-temperature Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) during the formation of Saturn's protoplanetary disk. Additionally, the spokes consist of diamagnetic ice particles that can disappear within minutes to hours due to sublimation. The photoelectric effect causes the pyrolytic carbon grains to lose electrons, thus becoming paramagnetic, which results in their attraction back to the main B ring structure. We suggest that Saturn's rings are charged by the solar wind, generating a magnetic field that emanates orthogonally above and below the B ring plane due to the movement of charged particles in the rings. Statistical analysis of Cassini data reveals significant correlations between spoke activity and both Saturn's magnetospheric rotation and solar elevation angle, providing strong support for an electromagnetic mechanism in spoke formation. This hypothesis suggests that the visibility of the spokes is dictated by illumination conditions and electromagnetic effects.</description>

      <title>Detection of an extraterrestrial technical civilisation on the extrasolar planet GJ 1132b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of whisky in the atmosphere of the extrasolar super-Earth planet GJ 1132b from transmission spectroscopic data. It is seen both in atmospheric absorption as well as in chromospheric emission, the latter probably due to the intense heating of the co-rotating planet's day-side surface. This detection cannot be explained using natural sources of alcohol, implying that there must be a technically advanced civilisation -- possibly originating from the neighboring habitable planet GJ 1132c -- that is engaged in massive distilling operations accompanied by high levels of industrial pollution. The reason for the necessarily vast scale of production is either to produce rocket fuel for an interplanetary economy or, more likely, for an unusually high level of personal consumption. The latter hypothesis suggests a novel explanation for the Fermi Paradox (the lack of indirect or direct contact with extraterrestrials): a technically versed civilisation would be incapable of achieving the higher technical levels necessary for the development of a detectable radio signature -- much less interstellar travel -- at the suggested rates of consumption.</description>

      <title>On the origin of Jupiter's fuzzy core: constraints from N-body, impact and evolution simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been suggested that Jupiter's fuzzy core could be a result of a giant impact. Here, we investigate the expected impact conditions from N-body simulations. We then use state-of-the-art SPH simulations to investigate the results of impacts with different conditions including various impactor masses and composition, different formation stages in Jupiter's growth, and different resolutions. We next simulate the long-term thermal evolution of Jupiter post-impact. We find that N-body simulations predict rather oblique impacts, and that head-on collisions are rare. Moreover, our results show that even under a head-on collision, Jupiter's fuzzy core cannot be formed. We next simulated Jupiter's thermal evolution and showed that unless post-impact temperatures are extremely low, a giant impact would not lead to an extended dilute core as inferred by interior models. We conclude that Jupiter's fuzzy core is not caused by an impact and is likely to be an outcome of its formation process.</description>

      <title>Systematic Search for FFPs in KMTNet Full-Frame Images. I. Photometry Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To exhume the buried signatures of free-floating planets (FFPs) with small angular Einstein radius $\theta_\mathrm{E}$, we build a new full-frame difference image for the Korean Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) survey based on the newly optimized pySIS package. We introduce the detailed processes of the new pipeline, including frame registration, difference image analysis, and light curve extraction. To test this pipeline, we extract the light curves for 483,068 stars with $I \lesssim 17$ and conduct a model-independent search for microlensing events. The search finds 36 microlensing events, including five new events and six events discovered by other collaborations but missed by previous KMTNet searches. We find that the light curves from the new pipeline are precise enough to be sensitive to FFPs with $\theta_\mathrm{E} \sim 1~\mu$as. Using the new pipeline, a complete FFP search on the eight-year KMTNet images can be finished within six months and then yield the FFP mass function. The new pipeline can be used for a new KMTNet AlertFinder system, with significantly reduced false positives.</description>

      <title>Dust Concentration Via Coupled Vertical Settling and Radial Migration in Substructured Non-Ideal MHD Discs and Early Planet Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of dust concentration in actively accreting, substructured, non-ideal MHD wind-launching disks using 2D and 3D simulations incorporating pressureless dust fluids of various grain sizes and their aerodynamic feedback on gas dynamics. Our results reveal that mm/cm-sized grains are preferentially concentrated within the inner 5-10 au of the disk, where the dust-to-gas surface density ratio (local metalicity Z) significantly exceeds the canonical 0.01, reaching values up to 0.25. This enhancement arises from the interplay of dust settling and complex gas flows in the meridional plane, including midplane accretion streams at early times, midplane expansion driven by magnetically braked surface accretion at later times, and vigorous meridional circulation in spontaneously formed gas rings. The resulting size-dependent dust distribution has a strong spatial variation, with large grains preferentially accumulating in dense rings, particularly in the inner disk, while being depleted in low-density gas gaps. In 3D, these rings and gaps are unstable to Rossby wave instability (RWI), generating arc-shaped vortices that stand out more prominently than their gas counterparts in the inner disk because of preferential dust concentration at small radii. The substantial local enhancement of the dust relative to the gas could promote planetesimal formation via streaming instability, potentially aided by the "azimuthal drift" streaming instability (AdSI) that operates efficiently in accreting disks and a lower Toomre Q expected in younger disks. Our findings suggest that actively accreting young disks may provide favorable conditions for early planetesimal formation, which warrants further investigation.</description>

      <title>Orlando's flask: detection of a lost-and-found valley on the Moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High angular resolution holds the key to extending our knowledge in several domains of astronomical research. In addition to the development of new instruments, advancements in post-processing algorithms can enhance the performances attainable in an observation, turning archival observations into a treasure. We developed a machine-learning tool, named zoom-in, that is able to improve the angular resolution of an astronomical image by a factor of $\sim 100$ by optimally recombining short-cadence sequences of images. After training our model on real-life photographs, we tested our method on archival images of the Moon taken through ESO instruments. We were able to achieve a remarkable spatial resolution of $\sim 1$ m of the lunar surface. While analyzing one of the fields from the sample, we discovered structures of clear anthropic origin inside the Aristarchus crater. The features appear to be consistent with ancient ruins of cities and castles. A thorough analysis of the relevant literature allowed us to conclude that this valley corresponds to the one described in Ludovico Ariosto's "Orlando Furioso": a place where all the items lost by humans gather and pile up. Analyses of the surface brightness from our images, indicating an abnormally high albedo of $\sim 0.25$, further corroborate this idea suggesting a conspicuous presence of glass. We infer the presence of &gt;1 billion flasks of human wits on the lunar surface, whose origin we investigate in detail. We urge for a dedicated mission, astolfo, to be carried out by Artemis astronauts in order to recover human wits and bring them back to the Earth.</description>

      <title>BOWIE-ALIGN: Sub-stellar metallicity and carbon depletion in the aligned TrES-4b with JWST NIRSpec transmission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation and migration history of a planet is expected to be imprinted in its atmosphere, in particular its carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio and metallicity. The BOWIE-ALIGN programme is performing a comparative study of JWST spectra of four aligned and four misaligned hot Jupiters, with the aim of characterising their atmospheres and corroborating the link between the observables and the formation history. In this work, we present the $2.8-5.2$ micron transmission spectrum of TrES-4b, a hot Jupiter with an orbit aligned with the rotation axis of its F-type host star. Using free chemistry atmospheric retrievals, we report a confident detection of H$_2$O at an abundance of $\log X_\mathrm{H_2O}=-2.98^{+0.68}_{-0.73}$ at a significance of $8.4\sigma$. We also find evidence for CO and small amounts of CO$_2$, retrieving abundances $\log X_\mathrm{CO}= -3.76^{+0.89}_{-1.01}$ and $\log X_\mathrm{CO_2}= -6.86^{+0.62}_{-0.65}$ ($3.1\sigma$ and $4.0\sigma$ respectively). The observations are consistent with the the atmosphere being in chemical equilibrium; our retrievals yield $\mathrm{C/O}$ between $0.30-0.42$ and constrain the atmospheric metallicity to the range $0.4-0.7\times$ solar. The inferred sub-stellar properties (C/O and metallicity) challenge traditional models, and could have arisen from an oxygen-rich gas accretion scenario, or a combination of low-metallicity gas and carbon-poor solid accretion.</description>

      <title>The edge-on disk Tau042021: icy grains at high altitudes and a wind containing astronomical PAHs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectra of the nearly edge-on protoplanetary disks observed with the JWST have shown ice absorption bands of varying optical depths and peculiar profiles, challenging radiative transfer modelling and our understanding of dust and ice in disks. We build models including dust grain size, shape, and composition to reproduce JWST IFU spectroscopy of the large edge-on disk Tau042021. We explore radiative transfer models using different dust grain size distributions, including grains of effective radii a_eff = 0.005-3000 microns. Scattering properties of distributions of triaxial ellipsoidal grains are calculated. We consider compositions with silicates, amorphous carbon, and mixtures of H2O, CO2, and CO. We use RADMC-3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer models of Tau042021 to simulate the spectral cubes observed with JWST-NIRSpec and MIRI. We compare the results to observations, including H2O at 3.05 microns, CO at 4.67 microns, and CO2 at 4.27 microns and to archival JWST-NIRCam and ALMA continuum images. The observed near- to mid-infrared imply dust distributions with grain sizes up to several tens of microns. The intensity distribution perpendicular to the disk exhibits emission profile wings extending into the upper disk atmosphere at altitudes exceeding the classical scale height expected in the isothermal hydrostatic limit. We produce ice map images demonstrating the presence of icy dust grains up to altitudes high above the disk midplane, more than three hydrostatic equilibrium scale heights. We demonstrate the presence of a wind containing the carriers of astronomical PAH bands. The wind appears as an X-shaped emission at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7 and 11.3 microns, characteristic wavelengths of the infrared astronomical PAH bands. We associate the spatial distribution of this component with carriers of astronomical PAH bands that form a layer of emission at the interface with the H2 wind.</description>

Abstract: Cookies are enjoyed best when they are both crispy and soft. I investigate in which proportion the cookies are crispy and soft, and disentangle whether it makes them biscuits, cakes, or none of the above. I baked cookies for colleagues at KTH, Stockholm, and University of Geneva, Switzerland, adopting my mum's mum's mum's etc. recipe. I created a dedicated survey for my colleagues with three well-selected questions to answer while eating one cookie. The weighted-average mean of the crispiness and softness, weighted by the respective enjoyment of the cookie, over the whole population amount to 7.0 +/- 1.1 and 5.3 +/- 1.4, respectively. The enjoyment of the cookies amounts to 9.1 +/- 2.3. People like (my) cookies, and cookies are neither cakes, nor biscuits, they are just... cookies!</description>

      <title>Exploring Young Stellar Variability with Gaia DR3 light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Photometric variability is a defining characteristic of young stellar objects (YSO), which can be traced back to a range of physical processes taking place at different stages of young stars' formation and early evolution. Gaia's third Data Release (GDR3) has provided an unprecedented dataset of photometric time series, including 79375 light curves for YSO candidates. With its all-sky coverage, Gaia provides a unique opportunity for large-scale studies of YSO variability. Aims: Our goal was to characterise the GDR3 sample of YSO variables further and verify the recurrence of YSO variability modes due to accretion, extinction, rotation modulation, etc. By adapting the Q&amp;M methodology for Gaia's sparse and long-term light curves, we seek to bridge the gap between low and high-cadence surveys' insights on YSO variability. Methods: We piloted the application of the asymmetry (M) and periodicity (Q) variability metrics to characterise YSO variability with Gaia light curves. Through refined sample selection, we identified sources with appropriate sampling for the Q&amp;M methodology. We used the Generalised Lomb Scargle periodogram and structure functions to infer variability timescales. Results: We successfully derived Q&amp;M indices for ~23000 sources in the GDR3 YSO sample. These variables were then classified into eight variability morphological classes. We linked morphological classes with physical mechanisms by using H$\alpha$ as a proxy of accretion and $\alpha_\mathrm{IR}$-indices to gauge circumstellar material's presence. Conclusions: We demonstrate that the Q&amp;M metrics can be successfully applied to Gaia's sparse time-series. We applied them to distinguish between the several variability modes. While our results are generally consistent with previous high-cadence, short-term studies, we find that GDR3's long timespan yields an enhanced variety of variability mechanisms.</description>

      <title>SPHERE/ZIMPOL insights into discs around evolved stars: arcs, asymmetries and porous dust aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Second-generation circumbinary discs around evolved binary stars, such as post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (post-AGB) stars, provide insights into poorly understood mechanisms of dust processing and disc evolution across diverse stellar environments. We present a multi-wavelength polarimetric survey of five evolved binary systems - AR Pup, HR 4049, HR 4226, U Mon, and V709 Car - using the SPHERE/ZIMPOL instrument. Post-AGB discs show significant polarimetric brightness at optical and near-IR wavelengths, often exceeding 1% of the system's total intensity. We also measured a maximum fractional polarization of the scattered light for AR Pup of ~0.7 in the V-band and ~0.55 in the I-band. To investigate wavelength-dependent polarization, we combine the SPHERE/ZIMPOL dataset with results from previous SPHERE/IRDIS studies. This analysis reveals that post-AGB discs exhibit a grey to blue polarimetric colour in the optical and near-IR. Along with high fractional polarization and polarized intensity distribution, these findings indicate that porous dust aggregates dominate the surface dust composition. We also find evidence of diverse disc geometries within the post-AGB sample, including arcs, asymmetries and variations in disc size across optical and near-IR wavelengths for some systems. Combining our findings with existing multi-technique studies, we question the classification of two systems in our sample, HR 4226 and V709 Car, which were originally identified as post-AGB binaries based on their near-IR excess. On comparing post-AGB discs to circumstellar environments around AGB stars and YSOs, we found that post-AGB systems exhibit a higher degree of polarization than single AGB stars and are comparable to the brightest protoplanetary discs around YSOs. Overall, our results reinforce the importance of polarimetric observations in probing dust properties and complex circumbinary structures.</description>

      <title>Written in the Stars: How your (pens and) papers decide the fate of the arXiverse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We all love the ecstasy that comes with submitting papers to journals or arXiv. Some have described it as yeeting their back-breaking products of labor into the void, wishing they could never deal with them ever again. The very act of yeeting papers onto arXiv contributes to the expansion of the arXiverse; however, we have yet to quantify our contribution to the cause. In this work, I investigate the expansion of the arXiverse using the arXiv astro-ph submission data from 1992 to date. I coin the term "the arXiverse constant", $a_0$, to quantify the rate of expansion of the arXiverse. I find that astro-ph as a whole has a positive $a_0$, but this does not always hold true for the six subcategories of astro-ph. I then investigate the temporal changes in $a_0$ for the astro-ph subcategories and astro-ph as a whole, from which I infer the fate of the arXiverse.</description>

      <title>Dust in the wind of outbursting young stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) are observed to undergo powerful accretion events known as FU Orionis outbursts (FUors). Such events of episodic accretion are now considered to be common during low mass star formation, wherein the accretion onto the protostar occurs through a surrounding centrifugal disk. Increasing evidence suggests that the magnetic disk winds are crucial for driving disk accretion, as they carry both mass and momentum away from the disk. Aims. We aim to investigate the phenomenon of the ejection of magnetic disk winds during episodic accretion, with a focus on the dust contained within these winds. Methods. We conduct magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of formation and evolution of protoplanetary disk (PPD) in the thin-disk limit. We include evolution of dust with two populations and a realistic prescription for viscosity during outbursts, which depends on the local thermal ionization fraction. The disk evolves with the concurrent action of viscosity, self-gravity and magnetic disk winds. Results. The simulated disk displays outbursting behavior in the early stages, with the duration and frequency of the bursts, their rise times, and brightness amplitudes resembling the observations of FUors. We find that during the outbursts, the winds are over an order of magnitude more dusty, as compared to in quiescence. However, despite this increased dust content, the winds are still dust-depleted as the dust-to-gas ratio is about an order of magnitude lower than the canonical interstellar value of 0.01. The results of our numerical experiments are in general agreement with the available observational findings and they shed a light on the mechanism behind production of dusty winds during outbursting events in YSOs.</description>

      <title>Implicit Electric Field Conjugation with the Photonic Lantern Nuller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Photonic Lantern Nuller (PLN) is an instrument concept designed to characterize exoplanets within a single beam-width from its host star. The PLN leverages the spatial symmetry of a mode-selective photonic lantern (MSPL) to create nulled ports, which cancel out on-axis starlight but allow off-axis exoplanet light to couple. The null-depths are limited by wavefront aberrations in the system as well as by imperfections in the lantern. We show that the implicit electric field conjugation algorithm can be used to reduce the stellar coupling through the PLN by orders of magnitude while maintaining the majority of the off-axis light, leading to deeper null depths (~10^{-4}) and thus higher sensitivity to potential planet signals. We discuss a theory for the tradeoff we observed between the different ports, where iEFC improves the nulls of some ports at the expense of others, and show that targeting one port alone can lead to deeper starlight rejection through that port than when targeting all ports at once. We also observe different levels of stability depending on the port and discuss the implications for practically implementing this technique for science observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01472v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wind dynamics play a pivotal role in governing transport processes within planetary atmospheres, influencing atmospheric chemistry, cloud formation, and the overall energy budget. Understanding the strength and patterns of winds is crucial for comprehensive insights into the physics of ultra-hot Jupiter atmospheres. This study focuses on unraveling the wind dynamics and the chemical composition in the atmosphere of the ultra-hot Jupiter TOI-1518 b. Two transit observations using the high-resolution (R{\lambda} = 85 000), optical (spectral coverage between 490 and 920 nm) spectrograph MAROON-X were obtained and analyzed to explore the chemical composition and wind dynamics using the cross-correlation techniques, global circulating models, and atmospheric retrieval. We report the detection of 14 species in the atmosphere of TOI-1518 b through cross-correlation analysis. Additionally, we measure the time-varying cross-correlation trails for 6 different species, compare them with predictions from General Circulation Models (GCM) and conclude that a strong drag is present in TOI-1518b's atmosphere. We find that the trails are species-dependent. Fe+ favors a stronger drag than Fe, which we interpret as a sign of magnetic effects being responsible for the observed strong drag. Furthermore, we show that Ca+ probes layers above the Roche lobe, leading to a qualitatively different trail than the other species. Finally, we use a retrieval analysis to characterize the abundance of the different species detected. That analysis is refined thanks to the updated planetary mass we derived from the radial-velocity detection using SOPHIE data. We measure an abundance of iron corresponding to 0.07 to 1.62 solar enrichment. The retrievals appear to be biased for the other elements, probably due to the different Kp/Vsys shifts between iron and the other elements, which we demonstrate in the case of VO.</description>

      <title>On the diversification and dissipation of protoplanetary disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disk evolution exhibits trends with stellar mass, but also diversity of structure, and lifetime, with implications for planet formation and demographics. We show how varied outcomes can result from evolving structures in the inner disk that attenuate stellar soft X-rays that otherwise drive photoevaporation in the outer disk. The magnetic truncation of the disk around a rapidly rotating T Tauri star is initially exterior to the corotation radius and ``propeller" accretion is accompanied by an inner magnetized wind, shielding the disk from X-rays. Because rotation varies little due to angular momentum exchange with the disk, stellar contraction causes the truncation radius to migrate inside the corotation radius, the inner wind to disappear, and photoevaporation to erode a gap in the disk, accelerating its dissipation. This X-ray attenuation scenario explains the trend of the longer lifetime, reduced structure, and compact size of disks around lower-mass stars. It also explains an observed lower bound and scatter in the distribution of disk accretion rates. Disks that experience early photoevaporation and form gaps can efficiently trap solids at a pressure bump at 1--10 au, triggering giant planet formation, while those with later-forming gaps or indeed no gaps form multiple smaller planets on close-in orbits, a pattern that is consistent with observed exoplanet demographics.</description>

      <title>Unveiling What Makes Saturn Ring: Quantifying the Amplitudes of Saturn's Planetary Normal-Mode Oscillations and Trends in C-Ring Properties Using Kronoseismology (VII)</title>

Abstract: Certain spiral density waves in Saturn's rings are generated through resonances with planetary normal modes, making them valuable probes of Saturn's internal structure. Previous research has primarily focused on the rotation rates of these waves. However, other characteristics of these waves also contain valuable information about the planet's interior. In this work, we investigate the amplitudes of the waves across the C-ring by analyzing high signal-to-noise profiles derived from phase-corrected averages of occultation profiles obtained by Cassini's Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS). By fitting these wave profiles to linear density wave models, we estimate the ring's surface mass density, mass extinction coefficient and effective kinematic viscosity at 34 locations in the C-ring, as well as the amplitude of the gravitational potential perturbations associated with 6 satellite resonances and 28 planetary normal mode resonances. Our estimates of the C-ring's mass extinction coefficient, indicate that the typical particle mass density is around 0.3 g/cm^3 interior to 84,000 km, but can get as low as 0.03 g/cm^3 exterior to 84,000 km. We also find the ring's viscosity is reduced in the outer C-ring, which is consistent with the exceptionally high porosity of the particles in this region. Meanwhile, we find the amplitudes of Saturn's normal modes are complex functions of frequency, l and m, implying that multiple factors influence how efficiently these modes are excited. This analysis identified two primary sources of these normal-mode oscillations: a deep source located close to Saturn's core, and a shallow source residing near the surface.</description>

Abstract: Observational data provided by JWST instruments continue to challenge theories and models of cloud formation in sub-stellar atmospheres, requiring more sophisticated approaches in an effort to understand their spatial complexity. However, to date, most cloud microphysical models using the moment method for sub-stellar atmospheres have assumed a monodisperse size distribution, neglecting polydisperse properties. We aim to extend beyond the common assumption of a monodisperse size distribution and analyse cloud microphysical processes assuming an exponential distribution. We derive expressions for the zeroth and first moments of condensation/evaporation and collisional growth processes under the assumption of an exponential size distribution. We then compare the differences between monodisperse and exponential distribution microphysics using a simple one-dimensional (1D) column model applied to a Y-dwarf KCl cloud scenario. We find that adopting an exponential distribution modifies condensation/evaporation rates by a factor of $\approx$0.9 and collisional growth rates by factors of $\approx$1.1 (Kn $\ll$ 1) and $\approx$0.92 (Kn $\gg$ 1) for Brownian coagulation and $\approx$0.85 for gravitational coalescence, compared to the monodisperse case. In our specific test cases, we find relative differences of a maximum 10-12% in total number density and 2-3% in mean radius of the cloud particles between the monodisperse and exponential distributions. Our results offer a simple way to take into account an assumed exponential size distribution for sub-stellar atmospheric cloud microphysics using the two-moment method. In follow up studies, we will examine more complex distributions, such as the log-normal and gamma distributions, that require more than two moments to characterise self-consistently.</description>
