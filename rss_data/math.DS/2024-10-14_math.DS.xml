      <title>Equidistribution of common perpendiculars in negative curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A^-$ and $A^+$ be properly immersed closed locally convex subsets of a Riemannian manifold $M$ with pinched negative sectional curvature. When the Bowen-Margulis measure on $T^1M$ is finite and mixing for the geodesic flow, we prove that the Lebesgue measures along the common perpendiculars of length at most $t$ from $A^-$ to $A^+$, counted with multiplicities and lifted to $T^1M$, equidistribute to the Bowen-Margulis measure as $t\to+\infty$. When $M$ is locally symmetric with finite volume and the geodesic flow is exponentially mixing, we give an error term for the asymptotic. When $T^1M$ is endowed with a bounded H\"older-continuous potential, and when the associated equilibrium state is finite and mixing for the geodesic flow, we prove the equidistribution of these Lebesgue measures weighted by the amplitudes of the potential to the equilibrium state.</description>

      <title>Crossing limit cycles in piecewise smooth Kolmogorov systems: an application to Palomba's model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the number of isolated crossing periodic orbits, so-called crossing limit cycles, for a class of piecewise smooth Kolmogorov systems defined in two zones separated by a straight line. In particular, we study the number of crossing limit cycles of small amplitude. They are all nested and surround one equilibrium point or a sliding segment. We denote by $\mathcal M_{K}^{p}(n)$ the maximum number of crossing limit cycles bifurcating from the equilibrium point via a degenerate Hopf bifurcation for a piecewise smooth Kolmogorov systems of degree $n=m+1$. We make a progress towards the determination of the lower bounds $M_K^p(n)$ of crossing limit cycles bifurcating from the equilibrium point via a degenerate Hopf bifurcation for a piecewise smooth Kolmogorov system of degree $n$. Specifically, we shot that $M_{K}^{p}(2)\geq 1$, $M_{K}^{p}(3)\geq 12$, and $M_{K}^{p}(4)\geq 18$. In particular, we show at least one crossing limit cycle in Palomba's economics model, considering it from a piecewise smooth point of view. To our knowledge, these are the best quotes of limit cycles for piecewise smooth polynomial Kolmogorov systems in the literature.</description>

      <title>On the Mittag-Leffler stability of mixed-order fractional homogeneous cooperative delay systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of multi-order fractional nonlinear delay systems. Our main contribution is to show the (local or global) Mittag-Leffler stability of systems when some structural assumptions are imposed on the "vector fields": cooperativeness, homogeneity, and order-preserving on the positive orthant of the phase space. In particular, our method is applicable to the case where the degrees of homogeneity of the non-lag and lag components of the vector field are different. In addition, we also investigate in detail the convergence rate of the solutions to the equilibrium point. Two specific examples are also provided to illustrate the validity of the proposed theoretical result.</description>

      <title>The oscillatory solutions of multi-order fractional differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper systematically treats the asymptotic behavior of many (linear/nonlinear) classes of higher-order fractional differential equations with multiple terms. To do this, we utilize the characteristics of Caputo fractional differentiable functions, the comparison principle, counterfactual reasoning, and the spectral analysis method (concerning the integral presentations of basic solutions). Some numerical examples are also provided to demonstrate the validity of the proposed results.</description>

      <title>A generalized fractional Halanay inequality and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a generalized Halanay inequality and its applications to fractional-order delay linear systems. First, based on a sub-semigroup property of Mittag-Leffler functions, a generalized Halanay inequality is established. Then, applying this result to fractional-order delay systems with an order-preserving structure, an optimal estimate for the solutions is given. Next, inspired by the obtained Halanay inequality, a linear matrix inequality is designed to derive the Mittag-Leffler stability of general fractional-order delay linear systems. Finally, numerical examples are provided to illustrate the proposed theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Finite-time stability of nonlinear conformable fractional-order delayed impulsive systems: Impulsive control and perturbation perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the finite-time stability (FTS) of nonlinear conformable fractional-order delayed impulsive systems (CFODISs). Using the conformable fractional-order (CFO) derivative framework, we derive a novel FTS result by extending the existing works on continuous integer-order (IO) systems. This result highlights that the settling time of continuous CFO systems depends on the system order and plays a crucial role in discussing FTS scenarios subject to delayed impulses. We establish Lyapunov-based FTS criteria for CFODISs, considering both impulsive control and impulsive perturbation. Additionally, we estimate the settling time for both cases, revealing distinct forms compared to the IO case. We apply the theoretical results to delayed impulsive conformable fractional-order memristive neural networks (CFOMNNs) under an elaborately designed controller. We present several simulations to illustrate the validity and applicability of our results.</description>

      <title>$C^1$-Diffeomorphism Class of some Circle Maps with a Flat Interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a certain class circle maps which are constant on one interval (called flat piece), and such that the degrees of the singularities at the boundary of the flat piece are different.
  In this paper, we show that if the topological conjugacy between two maps of my class is a bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism, then it is a $C^1$ diffeomorphism; that is, the bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism class and $C^1$ diffeomorphism class of a map in our class are equivalent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of random billiards in a tube, where reflection angles at collisions with the boundary of the tube are random variables rather than deterministic (and elastic) quantities. We obtain a (non-standard) Central Limit Theorem for the horizontal displacement of a particle, which marginally fails to have a second moment w.r.t.\ the invariant measure of the random billiard.</description>

      <title>Linear response for sequential and random intermittent maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work establishes a linear response formula for sequential intermittent dynamical systems, consisting of Liverani-Saussol-Vaienti maps with varying parameters. As a consequence, we establish quenched (trajectory-wise) linear response for random compositions of these maps, complementing recent annealed (averaged) results in this setting. As an intermediate step, we show existence, uniqueness and statistical stability of the sequential equivariant densities for such non-uniformly expanding systems. Our arguments rely on the cone technique introduced by Baladi and Todd and further developed by Lepp{\"a}nen.</description>

      <title>On the Hausdorff dimension of Weighted Singular Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a sharp upper bound on the Hausdorff dimension of weighted singular vectors in $\mathbb{R}^m$ using dynamics on homogeneous spaces, specifically the method of integral inequalities. Together with the lower bound proved recently by Kim and Park \cite{KimPark2024}, this determines the Hausdorff dimension of weighted singular vectors, thereby generalizing to arbitrary dimension, the work of Liao, Shi, Solan, and Tamam \cite{LSST}, who determined the Hausdorff dimension of weighted singular vectors in two dimensions. We also provide the first known bounds for the Hausdorff dimension of weighted singular vectors restricted to fractal subsets.</description>

      <title>Ergodic averages along sequences of slow growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider pointwise convergence of weighted ergodic averages along the sequence $\Omega(n)$, where $\Omega(n)$ denotes the number of prime factors of $n$ counted with multiplicities. It was previously shown that $\Omega(n)$ satisfies the strong sweeping out property, implying that a pointwise ergodic theorem does not hold for $\Omega(n)$. We further classify the strength of non-convergence exhibited by $\Omega(n)$ by verifying a double-logarithmic pointwise ergodic theorem along $\Omega(n)$. In particular, this demonstrates that $\Omega(n)$ is not inherently strong sweeping out. We also show that the strong sweeping out property for slow growing sequences persists under certain perturbations, yielding natural new examples of sequences with the strong sweeping out property.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Modeling of the Role of Imitation in Crime Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crime remains one of the significant problems that countries are grappling with globally. With shrinking economies and increasing poverty, crime has been on the rise in many countries. In this paper, we propose a system of non-linear ordinary differential equations to model crime dynamics in the presence of imitation. The model consists of four independent compartments: individuals who are not at risk of committing a crime, individuals at risk of committing a crime, individuals committing a crime, and individuals convicted and jailed for a crime. The model is analyzed using the basic reproduction number. The analysis shows the system has a locally asymptotically stable crime-free equilibrium when the basic reproduction number is less than unity. The model exhibits a backward bifurcation in which two endemic equilibria coexist with the crime-free equilibrium. When the basic reproduction number exceeds unity, the system has a locally asymptotically stable endemic equilibrium, and the crime-free becomes unstable. Numerical simulations are carried out to verify the analytical results. The sensitivity analysis shows that the relapse rate highly influences the basic reproduction number of our model. This indicates that the proportion of individuals leaving prisons and becoming criminals should be minimized to minimize crime.</description>

      <title>Inducing recurrent flows by twisting on infinite surfaces with unbounded cuffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Riemann surface $X$ is parabolic if and only if the geodesic flow (for the hyperbolic metric) on the unit tangent bundle of $X$ is ergodic. Consider a Riemann surface $X$ with a single topological end and a sequence $\alpha_n$ of pairwise disjoint, simple closed geodesics converging to the end, called {\it cuffs}. Basmajian, the first and the third author, proved that when the lengths $\ell (\alpha_n)$ of cuffs are at most $2\log n$, the surface $X$ is parabolic. One could expect that having arbitrary large cuff lengths $\ell (\alpha_n)$ (think of $\ell (\alpha_n)=n!^{n!}$) would allow the geodesic flow to escape to infinity, thus making $X$ not parabolic.
  Contrary to this and motivated by their proof of the Surface Subgroup Theorem, Kahn and Markovi\'c conjectured that for every choice of lengths $\ell (\alpha_n)$, there is a choice of twists that would make $X$ parabolic. We show that their conjecture is essentially true. Namely, for any sequence of positive numbers $\{ a_n\}$, there is a choice of lengths $\ell (\alpha_n)\geq a_n$ such that the (relative) twists by $1/2$ make $X$ parabolic. This result extends to the surfaces with countably many ends while it does not hold for uncountably many ends.</description>

      <title>Topological and dimensional properties of univoque bases in double-base expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two real numbers $q_0,q_1$ with $q_0, q_1 &gt; 1$ satisfying $q_0+q_1 \ge q_0q_1$, we call a sequence $(d_i)$ with $d_i\in \{0,1\}$ a $(q_0,q_1)$-expansion or a double-base expansion of a real number $x$ if
  \[
  x=\mathop{\sum}\limits_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{d_{i}}{q_{d_1}q_{d_2}\cdots q_{d_i}}.
  \]
  When $q_0=q_1=q$, the set of univoque bases is given by the set of $q$'s such that $x = 1$ has exactly one $(q, q)$-expansion. The topological, dimensional and symbolic properties of such sets and their corresponding sequences have been intensively investigated. In our research, we study the topological and dimensional properties of the set of univoque bases for double-base expansions. This problem is more complicated, requiring new research strategies. Several new properties are uncovered. In particular, we show that the set of univoque bases in the double base setting is a meagre set with full Hausdorff dimension.</description>

      <title>Causal Discovery in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems using Koopman Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theory of causality in dynamical systems using Koopman operators. Our theory is grounded on a rigorous definition of causal mechanism in dynamical systems given in terms of flow maps. In the Koopman framework, we prove that causal mechanisms manifest as particular flows of observables between function subspaces. While the flow map definition is a clear generalization of the standard definition of causal mechanism given in the structural causal model framework, the flow maps are complicated objects that are not tractable to work with in practice. By contrast, the equivalent Koopman definition lends itself to a straightforward data-driven algorithm that can quantify multivariate causal relations in high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems. The coupled Rossler system provides examples and demonstrations throughout our exposition. We also demonstrate the utility of our data-driven Koopman causality measure by identifying causal flow in the Lorenz 96 system. We show that the causal flow identified by our data-driven algorithm agrees with the information flow identified through a perturbation propagation experiment. Our work provides new theoretical insights into causality for nonlinear dynamical systems, as well as a new toolkit for data-driven causal analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We deal with a Leslie-Gower predator-prey model with a generalist or alternating food for predator and linear functional response. Using a topological equivalent polynomial system we prove that the system is not Liouvillian (hence also not Darboux) integrable. In order to study the global dynamics of this model, we use the Poincar\'e compactification of $\mathbb{R}^2$ to characterize all phase portraits in the Poincar\'e disc, obtaining two different topological phase portraits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ ([0,1]^d,T,\mu) $ be a measure-preserving dynamical system so that the correlations decay exponentially for H\"older continuous functions. Suppose that $ \mu $ is absolutely continuous with a density function $ h\in L^q(\mathcal L^d) $ for some $ q&gt;1 $, where $ \mathcal L^d $ is the $ d $-dimensional Lebesgue measure. Under mild conditions on the underlying dynamical system, we obtain a strong dynamical Borel-Cantelli lemma for recurrence: For any sequence $ \{R_n\} $ of hyperrectangles with sides parallel to the axes and centered at the origin,
  \[\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\mathcal L^d(R_n)=\infty\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{n}\chi_{R_k+\mathbf{x}}(T^k\mathbf{x})}{\sum_{k=1}^{n}\mathcal L^d(R_k)}=h(\mathbf{x})\quad\text{for $ \mu $-a.e.$\textbf{x}$},\]
  where $ \textbf{x}\in[0,1]^d $ and $ R_k+\textbf{x} $ is the translation of $ R_k $. The result applies to Gauss map, $\beta$-transformation and expanding toral endomorphisms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of our main goals in this paper is to understand the behavior of limit sets of a diverging sequence of Schottky groups in the group of isometries of the N-dimensional hyperbolic space. This leads us to a generalization of a classical theorem of Bowen on variations of Hausdorff dimension of limit sets; and to a method of transforming a diverging sequence of Schottky groups into an almost converging sequence in the group of isometries of the infinite dimensional hyperbolic space. Our results apply in particular to an example of McMullen and generalize a previous work by Mehmeti and Dang.</description>

      <title>Genericity of distributional chaos in non-autonomous dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we solve two open problems concerning distributional chaos in non-autonomous discrete dynamical systems stated in [4] and [17]. In the first problem it is wondered if the limit function of pointwise convergent non-autonomous system with positive topological entropy is DC2. We show that the answer to this problem depends on the given metric and can be both, positive or negative. In the second open problem it is wondered if to be DC1 is a generic property of pointwise convergent non-autonomous systems. We prove that the answer is negative for convergent systems on the Cantor set. Concerning interval systems, we show that DC1 chaotic systems form dense, but not open (nor closed) set in the space of non-autonomous convergent systems on the interval, independently of the metric we use.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra of rank $N$ over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$. Associated to $\mathcal{L}$ is a family of polynomial folding maps $$\textsf{F}_{n}:\mathbb{A}^N\to\mathbb{A}^N\quad\text{for}\quad n\ge1$$ having the property that $\textsf{F}_{n}$ has topological degree $n^N$ and $$\textsf{F}_{m}\circ\textsf{F}_{n}=\textsf{F}_{n}\circ\textsf{F}_{m}\quad\text{for all}\quad m,n\ge1.$$ We derive formulas for the leading terms of the folding maps on $\mathbb{A}^2$ associated to the Lie algebras $\mathcal{A}_2$, $\mathcal{B}_2$, and $\mathcal{G}_2$, and we use these formulas to compute the affine automorphism group of each folding map.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new quantity known as the network heterogeneity index, denoted by $\mathcal{H}$, which facilitates the investigation of disease propagation and population persistence in heterogeneous environments. Our mathematical analysis reveals that this index embodies the structure of such networks, the disease or population dynamics of patches, and the dispersal between patches. We present multiple representations of the network heterogeneity index and demonstrate that $\mathcal{H}\geq 0$. Moreover, we explore the applications of $\mathcal{H}$ in epidemiology and ecology across various heterogeneous environments, highlighting its effectiveness in determining disease invasibility and population persistence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given function values on a domain $D_0$, possibly with noise, we examine the possibility of extending the function to a larger domain $D$, $D_0\subset D$. In addition to smoothness at the boundary of $D_0$, the extension on $D\setminus D_0$ should also inherit behavioral trends of the function on $D_0$, such as growth and decay or even oscillations. The approach chosen here is based upon the framework of linear models, univariate or bivariate, with constant or varying coefficients.</description>

      <title>On the Oscillations in Cournot Games with Best Response Strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the dynamic oscillation in the Cournot oligopoly model, which involves multiple firms producing homogeneous products. To explore the oscillation under the updates of best response strategies, we focus on the linear price functions. In this setting, we establish the existence of oscillations. In particular, we show that for the scenario of different costs among firms, the best response converges to either a unique equilibrium or a two-period oscillation. We further characterize the oscillations and propose linear-time algorithms for finding all types of two-period oscillations. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first step toward fully analyzing the periodic oscillation in the Cournot oligopoly model.</description>

      <title>The onset of filamentation on vorticity interfaces in two-dimensional Euler flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional Euler flows, in the plane or on simple surfaces, possess a material invariant, namely the scalar vorticity normal to the surface. Consequently, flows with piecewise-uniform vorticity remain that way, and moreover evolve in a way which is entirely determined by the instantaneous shapes of the contours (interfaces) separating different regions of vorticity -- this is known as `Contour Dynamics'. Unsteady vorticity contours or interfaces often grow in complexity (lengthen and fold), either as a result of vortex interactions (like merger) or `filamentation'. In the latter, wave disturbances riding on a background, equilibrium contour shape appear to inevitably steepen and break, forming filaments, repeatedly -- and perhaps endlessly. Here, we revisit the onset of filamentation. Building upon previous work and using a weakly-nonlinear expansion to third order in wave amplitude, we derive a universal, parameter-free amplitude equation which applies (with a minor change) both to a straight interface and a circular patch in the plane, as well as circular vortex patches on the surface of a sphere. We show that this equation possesses a local, self-similar form describing the finite-time blow up of the wave slope (in a rescaled long time proportional to the inverse square of the initial wave amplitude). We present numerical evidence for this self-similar blow-up solution, and for the conjecture that almost all initial conditions lead to finite-time blow up. In the full Contour Dynamics equations, this corresponds to the onset of filamentation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss global tensor invariants of a rigid body motion in the cases of Euler, Lagrange and Kovalevskaya. These invariants are obtained by substituting tensor fields with cubic on variable components into the invariance equation and solving the resulting algebraic equations using computer algebra systems. According to the Poincar\'{e}-Cartan theory of invariants, the existence of invariant geometric structures raises the question of using them to study the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Ergodic and foliated kernel-differentiation method for linear responses of random systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the kernel-differentiation method (or likelihood-ratio method) for the linear response of random dynamical systems, after revisit its derivation in a microscopic view via transfer operators. First, for the linear response of physical measures, we extend the method to an ergodic version, which is sampled by one infinitely-long sample path; moreover, the magnitude of the integrand is bounded by a finite decorrelation step number. Second, when the noise and perturbation are along a given foliation, we show that the method is still valid for both finite and infinite time. We numerically demonstrate the ergodic version on a tent map, whose linear response of the physical measure does not exist; but we can add some noise and compute an approximate linear response. We also demonstrate on a chaotic neural network with 51 layers $\times$ 9 neurons, whose perturbation is along a given foliation; we show that adding foliated noise incurs a smaller error than noise in all directions. We give a rough error analysis of the method and show that it can be expensive for small-noise. We propose a potential future program unifying the three popular linear response methods.</description>

      <title>Examining the Link Between Peroxiredoxin Proteins and Mutually Exclusive Transcription Factor Activation With a Mathematical Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oxidative stress is a fundamental stimulus to which eukaryotic cells respond via many channels. Among these channels are both protein systems that process oxidative stress, such as the 2-Cys peroxiredoxin-thioredoxin system (PTRS), as well as changes in transcriptional activity that target outcomes such as growth, damage control and repair, or cell death. Recent work has revealed connections between the PTRS and temporal phases of transcriptional activity involving famous transcription factors like p53 and FOXO1. To examine potential mechanisms for these connections, we implement an existing dynamical systems mathematical model for the PTRS. We hypothesize that dose-dependent hyperoxidation events enact ultrasensitive switches by which the PTRS can categorize stress severity and activate appropriate transcriptional responses. Using numerical simulations of the PTRS in human cells, we provide a proof of principle for staggered, switchlike hyperoxidation of peroxiredoxins (Prx) as well as an underlying mechanism requiring simultaneous signaling by Prx I and II. Then, we use our model to make testable predictions about individual Prx knockouts as well as the affinity for hydrogen peroxide of Prx across oxidation states. This study provides direction for future experimental work and sheds light into the mechanisms underlying oxidative stress response in human cells.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory spacelike singularities: The Bianchi type $\mathrm{VI}_{-1/9}$ vacuum models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bianchi type $\mathrm{VI}_{-1/9}$, $\mathrm{VIII}$ and $\mathrm{IX}$ vacuum models all have 4-dimensional Hubble-normalized state spaces and are expected to have a generic initial oscillatory singularity, but the invariant boundary sets responsible for the oscillations are much more complicated for type $\mathrm{VI}_{-1/9}$ than those of type $\mathrm{VIII}$ and $\mathrm{IX}$. For the first time, we explicitly solve the equations on these type $\mathrm{VI}_{-1/9}$ boundary sets and also introduce a new graphic representation of the associated network of heteroclinic chains (i.e. sequences of solutions describing the oscillations). In particular, we give examples of networks of entangled cyclic heteroclinic chains and show that only some of these cyclic heteroclinic chains are asymptotically relevant.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium States for Open Zooming Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.08143v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we construct Markov structures for zooming systems adapted to holes of a special type. Our construction is based on backward contractions provided by zooming times. These Markov structures may be used to code the open zooming systems.
  In the context of open zooming systems, possibly with the presence of a critical/singular set, we prove the existence of finitely many ergodic zooming equilibrium states for zooming potentials whose induced potential is locally H\"older. For example, the zooming H\"older continuous. Among the zooming ones are the so-called hyperbolic potentials and also what we call bounded distortion potentials, having as a particular case the pseudo-geometric potentials $\phi_{t} = -t \log J_{\mu}f $, where $J_{\mu}f$ is a Jacobian of the reference zooming measure. Moreover, for this last class of potentials, we show the existence of what we call pseudo-conformal measures. Afterwards, we prove uniqueness of equilibrium state with no requirement of transitivity.
  The technique consists in using an inducing scheme in a finite Markov structure with infinitely many symbols to code the dynamics to obtain an equilibrium state for the associated symbolic dynamics and then projecting it to obtain an equilibrium state for the original map. To obtain a pseudo-conformal measure, we "spread" the conformal one which exists for the symbolic dynamics. The uniqueness is obtained by showing that the equilibrium states are liftable to the same inducing scheme.
  Finally, we show that the class of hyperbolic potentials is equivalent to the class of continuous zooming potentials. Also, we give a class of examples of hyperbolic potentials (including the null one). It implies the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium state (in particular, of maximal entropy measure). Among the maps considered is the important class known as Viana maps.</description>

      <title>Sinai factors of nonsingular systems: Bernoulli shifts and Anosov flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.14497v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a totally dissipative system has all nonsingular systems as factors, but that this is no longer true when the factor maps are required to be finitary. In particular, if a nonsingular Bernoulli shift satisfies the Doeblin condition, and has a limiting marginal distribution p, then it cannot have, as a finitary factor, an independent and identically distributed (iid) system of entropy larger than H(p); on the other hand, we show that iid systems with entropy strictly lower than H(p) can be obtained as finitary factors of these Bernoulli shifts, extending Keane and Smorodinsky's finitary version of Sinai's factor theorem to the nonsingular setting. As a consequence of our results we also obtain that every transitive twice continuously differentiable Anosov diffeomorphism on a compact manifold, endowed with volume measure, has iid factors, and if the factor is required to be finitary, then the iid factor cannot have Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy greater than the measure-theoretic entropy of a Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen measure associated with the Anosov diffeomorphism.</description>

Abstract: The notion of expansivity and its generalizations (measure expansive, measure positively expansive, continuum-wise expansive, countably-expansive) are well known for deterministic systems and can be a useful property for studying significant type of behavior, such as chaotic one. This study aims to extend these notions into a random context and prove a relationship between relative positive entropy and random expansive measures and apply it to show that if a random dynamical system has positive relative topological entropy then the $w$-stable classes have zero measure for the conditional measures. We also prove that there exists a probability measure that is both invariant and expansive. Moreover, we obtain a relation between the notions of random expansive measures and random countably-expansive systems.</description>

Abstract: We present a characterisation of a blender based on the topological alignment of certain sets in phase space in combination with cone conditions. Importantly, the required conditions can be verified by checking properties of a single iterate of the diffeomorphism, which is achieved by finding finite series of sets that form suitable sequences of alignments. This characterisation is applicable in arbitrary dimension. Moreover, the approach naturally extends to establishing C1-persistent heterodimensional cycles. Our setup is flexible and allows for a rigorous, computer-assisted validation based on interval arithmetic.</description>

      <title>Shrinking parallelepiped targets in beta-dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $ \beta&gt;1 $ let $ T_\beta $ be the $\beta$-transformation on $ [0,1) $. Let $ \beta_1,\dots,\beta_d&gt;1 $ and let $ \mathcal P=\{P_n\}_{n\ge 1} $ be a sequence of parallelepipeds in $ [0,1)^d $. Define
  \[W(\mathcal P)=\{\textbf{x}\in[0,1)^d:(T_{\beta_1}\times\cdots \times T_{\beta_2})^n(\textbf{x})\in P_n\text{ infinitely often}\}.\]
  When each $ P_n $ is a hyperrectangle with sides parallel to the axes, the 'rectangle to rectangle' mass transference principle by Wang and Wu [Math. Ann. 381 (2021)] is usually employed to derive the lower bound for $\mathrm{dim_H} W(\mathcal P)$, where $\mathrm{dim_H}$ denotes the Hausdorff dimension. However, in the case where $ P_n $ is still a hyperrectangle but with rotation, this principle, while still applicable, often fails to yield the desired lower bound. In this paper, we determine the optimal cover of parallelepipeds, thereby obtaining $\mathrm{dim_H} W(\mathcal P)$. We also provide several examples to illustrate how the rotations of hyperrectangles affect $\mathrm{dim_H} W(\mathcal P)$.</description>

      <title>Shadowing in the hyperspace of continua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss whether classical examples of dynamical systems satisfying the shadowing property also satisfy the shadowing property for the induced map on the hyperspace of continua, obtaining both positive and negative results. We prove that transitive Anosov diffeomorphisms, or more generally continuum-wise hyperbolic homeomorphisms, do not satisfy the shadowing property for the induced map on the hyperspace of continua. We prove that dendrite monotone maps satisfy the shadowing property if, and only if, their induced map on the hyperspace of continua also satisfies it. We give some algorithms that show that there are abundant dynamical systems satisfying the shadowing property with dendrites (compact metric trees) as the underlying space. As a consequence, we show that the universal dendrite of order n admits a homeomorphism with the shadowing property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13965v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a smooth Morse-Smale vector field with Lyapunov constraints (Lyapunov function) one shows how and why the non-triviality of the cohomology, as concluded from its additive structure, detects rest points and the multiplicative structure of the cohomology detects instantons (trajectories between rest points). The same remains true for Lyapunov closed one form, a more general Lyapunov constraint, but in this presentation this fact is discussed only informally. These observations are based on the smooth " manifold with corner structures" of the stable/unstable sets and of the set of trajectories of such vector fields.

      <title>Left regular representations of Garside categories II. Finiteness properties of topological full groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.04505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study topological full groups attached to groupoid models for left regular representations of Garside categories. Groups arising in this way include Thompson's group $V$ and many of its variations such as R\"over-Nekrashevych groups. Our key observation is that a Garside structure for the underlying small category induces a new Garside structure for a new small category of bisections, and that our topological full group coincides with the fundamental group of the enveloping groupoid of the new category. As a consequence, we solve the word problem and identify general criteria for establishing finiteness properties of our topological full groups. In particular, we show that topological full groups arising from products of shifts of finite type are of type ${\rm F}_{\infty}$, answering a natural question left open by Matui.</description>

      <title>Quantum networks theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.10587v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formalism of quantum theory over discrete systems is extended in two significant ways. First, quantum evolutions are generalized to act over entire network configurations, so that nodes may find themselves in a quantum superposition of being connected or not, and be allowed to merge, split and reconnect coherently in a superposition. Second, tensors and traceouts are generalized, so that systems can be partitioned according to almost arbitrary logical predicates in a robust manner. The hereby presented mathematical framework is anchored on solid grounds through numerous lemmas. Indeed, one might have feared that the familiar interrelations between the notions of unitarity, complete positivity, trace-preservation, non-signalling causality, locality and localizability that are standard in quantum theory be jeopardized as the neighbourhood and partitioning between systems become both quantum, dynamical, and logical. Such interrelations in fact carry through, albeit two new notions become instrumental: consistency and comprehension.</description>

      <title>Geometric analysis of fast-slow PDEs with fold singularities via Galerkin discretisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.06134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a singularly perturbed fast-slow system of two partial differential equations (PDEs) of reaction-diffusion type on a bounded domain via Galerkin discretisation. We assume that the reaction kinetics in the fast variable realise a generic fold singularity, whereas the slow variable takes the role of a dynamic bifurcation parameter, thus extending the classical analysis of the singularly perturbed fold. Our approach combines a spectral Galerkin discretisation with techniques from geometric singular perturbation theory which are applied to the resulting high-dimensional systems of ordinary differential equations. In particular, we show the existence of invariant slow manifolds in the phase space of the original system of PDEs away from the fold singularity, while the passage past the singularity of the Galerkin manifolds obtained after discretisation is described by geometric desingularisation, or blow-up. Finally, we discuss the relation between these Galerkin manifolds and the underlying slow manifolds.</description>

      <title>Magnetic flatness and E. Hopf's theorem for magnetic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17726v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the notion of magnetic curvature recently introduced by the first author, we extend E. Hopf's theorem to the setting of magnetic systems. Namely, we prove that if the magnetic flow on the s-sphere bundle is without conjugate points, then the total magnetic curvature is non-positive, and vanishes if and only if the magnetic system is magnetically flat. We then prove that magnetic flatness is a rigid condition, in the sense that it only occurs when either the magnetic form is trivial and the metric is flat, or when the magnetic system is K\"ahler, the metric has constant negative sectional holomorphic curvature, and s equals the Ma\~n\'e critical value.</description>

      <title>Deformation of invariant tori under perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study extends the functional perturbation theory~(FPT) of dynamical systems, initially developed for investigating the shifts of invariant (un)stable manifolds within chaotic regions when subjected to global perturbations. In contrast, invariant tori reside in the ordered regions of the phase space, where periodic orbits are parabolic in conservative systems. For example, in magnetic confinement fusion (MCF) devices, invariant tori appear as closed flux surfaces, whose nested structure dominates radial transport and, consequently, the overall confinement performance. This Letter provides formulae characterizing the deformation of invariant tori under perturbation.</description>

      <title>Enumerating Finite Braid Group Orbits on $SL_2(\C)$-Character Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze finite orbits of the natural braid group action on the character variety of the $n$ times punctured sphere. Building on recent results relating middle convolution and finite complex reflection groups, our work implements Katz's middle convolution to explicitly classify finite orbits in the $SL_2(\C)$-character variety of the punctured sphere. We provide theoretical results on the existence of finite orbits arising from the imprimitive finite complex reflection groups and formulas for constructing such examples when they exist. In the primitive finite complex reflection groups, we perform an exhaustive search and provide computational results. Our contributions also include Magma computer code for middle convolution and for computing the orbit under this action when it is known to be finite.</description>
