      <title>The Hydra Map and Numen Formalisms for Collatz-Type Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper details a generalization of the formalism presented in the author's 2024 paper, "The Collatz Conjecture and Non-Archimedean Spectral Theory - Part I - Arithmetic Dynamical Systems and Non-Archimedean Value Distribution Theory", to the case of Hydra maps on the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_{K}$ of a global field $K$. In addition to recounting these definitions, background material is presented for the necessary standard material in algebraic number theory and integration and Fourier analysis with respect to the $p$-adic Haar measure. This paper is meant to serve as a technical manual for use of Hydra maps and numens in future research.</description>

      <title>Smooth Fractal Trees: Analytic Generators and Discrete Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for constructing fractal trees via analytic generator fields, replacing discrete affine transformations and symbolic rewriting rules by the integration of smooth vector fields in an internal state space. In this setting, geometric curves are obtained as projections of generator trajectories, and branching is implemented as a primitive operation through exact inheritance of generator state.
  At every finite depth, the resulting structure is a finite union of analytic curve segments that is smooth across branch events. Two structural results relate this generator-driven construction to classical discrete models of tree-based fractals. First, a combinatorial universality theorem shows that any discrete tree specification, including those arising from iterated function systems and L-systems, can be compiled into an analytic generator tree whose induced discrete scaffold is isomorphic at every finite depth. Second, under standard contractive assumptions, a canopy set equivalence theorem establishes that the accumulation set of analytic branch endpoints coincides with the attractor of the corresponding discrete construction.
  These results separate local geometric regularity from global fractal complexity, showing that fractality is determined by recursive branching and scaling rather than by local non-smoothness. The framework provides a smooth representation of tree-based fractals that preserves both their finite combinatorial structure and their asymptotic limit geometry.</description>

      <title>On a family of non-Volterra quadratic operators acting on a simplex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we consider a convex combination of non-Volterra quadratic stochastic operators defined on a finite-dimensional simplex depending on a parameter $\alpha$ and study their trajectory behaviors. We showed that for any $\alpha\in [0,1)$ the trajectories of such operator converge to a fixed point. For $\alpha=1$ any trajectory of the operator converges to a periodic trajectory.</description>

      <title>Bernoullicity of some skew products with hyperbolic base and Kochergin flow in the fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Bernoulli property for skew products with hyperbolic diffeomorphisms equipped with a Gibbs measure in the base and Kochergin flows in the fiber, when the cocycle is aperiodic and of zero mean. The flow in the fiber can be represented as a special flow over an irrational rotation and a roof function with power singularity. We show that if the growth near the singularity is given by an exponent smaller than $\frac{1}{2}$, then for almost every rotation the resulting skew product is Bernoulli.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov Stability for nonautonomous systems on Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the uniformly asymptotic stability of nonautonomous systems on Riemannian manifolds. We establish corresponding Lyapunov-type theorems (Theorems 2.1 and 2.2), extending classical Euclidean results (e.g., [9, Theorems 4.9 and 4.10]) to curved spaces. Our main contributions are: (i) an estimate for the domain of attraction linked to the equilibrium point's injectivity radius, where, under suitable conditions, this radius can be bounded using the sectional curvature (Proposition 2.1); (ii) a demonstration that this estimate depends on the choice of the Riemannian metric (Examples 2.1 and 2.2 and Remark 2.4); and (iii) a refined estimate compared to the Euclidean case, as detailed in item (6) of Remark 2.1 and in Remark 2.3.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the set of complex irrationals whose partial quotients in their Hurwitz continued fraction expansion are naturally regarded as subsets of $\mathbb Z^2$ and contain infinitely many homothetic copies of any finite subset of $\mathbb Z^2$ is of Hausdorff dimension $1$. Our result provides a clear and concrete example of multidimensional pattern emergence in number-theoretic expansions.</description>

      <title>Quasiregular maps of Sierpinski carpet Julia sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if $f$ and $g$ are postcritically finite rational maps whose Julia sets $\mathcal{J}(f), \mathcal{J}(g)$, respectively, are Sierpi\'nski carpets, and if $\xi$ is a quasiregular map of the Riemann sphere $\widehat{\mathbb{C}}$ with $\xi^{-1}(\mathcal{J}(g))=\mathcal{J}(f)$, then $\xi$ is the restriction of a rational map to the Julia set $\mathcal{J}(f)$. Moreover, when $g=f$ we prove that, for some positive integers $k$ and $l$, $f^k\circ \xi^l=f^{2k}$. These conclusions extend the main results of M. Bonk, M. Lyubich, S. Merenkov, Quasisymmetries of Sierpi\'nski carpet Julia sets, Adv. Math, 301 (2016), 383-422. Finally, we demonstrate that when Julia sets of postcritically finite rational maps are not Sierpi\'nski carpets, say they are tree-like or gaskets, the above conclusions no longer hold.</description>

      <title>Improved stability estimates at elliptic equilibria of Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with an improvement of the "a-priori stability bounds" on the variation of the action variables and on the stability time obtained from a given Birkhoff normal form around the elliptic equilibrium point of an Hamiltonian system satisfying a non-resonance condition of finite order N. In particular, we improve the standard a-priori lower bound on the stability time from a purely linear dependence on the inverse of the polynomial norm of the remainder of the normal form to the sum of a linear term (which is still present but with a different constant coefficient) and a quadratic one. The prevalence between the linear and the quadratic term depends on the resonance properties of all the monomials in the remainder of the normal form with degree from N to a finite order M. We also provide a comparative example of the new estimates and the traditional a priori ones in the framework of computer-assisted proofs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Cone technique of Baladi and Todd, we show some form of weak differentiability of the SRB measure for the intermittent circle maps, demonstrating linear response in the process. Subsequently, as an application, we lift the regularity from the base dynamics of the solenoid map with intermittency, showing that this family is statistically stable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study obstructions preventing a three-dimensional Anosov flow from serving as the base of a fiberwise Anosov flow. We prove a non-existence result if the base flow admits infinitely many periodic orbits in the same free homotopy class. We get as a corollary that any R-covered Anosov flow serving as the base of a fiberwise Anosov flow is orbit equivalent to a suspension or a geodesic flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an iterated function system $ \mathcal{F} = \{ f_1, \dots, f_k \} $ of homeomorphisms on a compact metric space $(X, d)$,
  write $ \mathcal{F}_-= \{ f_1^{-1}, \dots, f_k^{-1} \} $. The objective of this paper is to illustrate an iterated function system $\mathcal{F}$ of homeomorphisms on the circle that the Hutchinson operator of $\mathcal{F}$ is equicontinuous, but the Hutchinson operator of $\mathcal{F}_-$ is sensitive.</description>

Abstract: This paper characterizes polynomials within molecules. We show that a geometrically finite polynomial of degree $d\geq2$ lies in a molecule if and only if all its critical points belong to maximal Fatou chains, and show that distinct molecules are mutually disjoint. We also establish a necessary and sufficient condition for subhyperbolic polynomials to be on the closures of bounded hyperbolic components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Prisoner's Dilemma is used as a model in processes involving reciprocity; however, its classical setup can be insufficient in settings where the symmetry of the simultaneous decision making is broken -- for example, in donor and recipient processes. In the alternating Prisoner's Dilemma model the two players take turns choosing their strategy. Assuming a finite memory setup, we establish the mathematical aspects of the adaptive dynamics of the alternating Prisoner's Dilemma, paying particular attention to the case of memory 1.</description>

      <title>Generalizations of the Squircle-Lemniscate Relation and Keplerian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a generalized relationship between the arc length of sinusoidal spirals \(r^n=\cos(n\theta)\) and the area of generalized Lam\'e curves defined by \(x^{2n}+y^{2n}=1\). Building on our previous work connecting the lemniscate to the squircle, we prove an integral identity relating these two curves for any positive integer $n$, which we further generalize to arbitrary positive real exponents and general superellipses. We further extend this correspondence to a geometric relationship between radial sectors of the Lam\'e curve and arc lengths of the spiral, providing a physical interpretation where keplerian motion on the Lam\'e curve corresponds to uniform motion on the spiral. Additionally, we derive an explicit central force law for keplerian motion along the Lam\'e curve. Finally, we introduce policles--a new class of curves generalizing the squircle--and demonstrate a direct geometric mapping between their sectors and the arc lengths of sinusoidal spirals.</description>

      <title>Travelling Waves in Wolbachia Spread Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wolbachia, a maternally transmitted endosymbiont, offers a powerful biological control strategy for mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue, Zika, and malaria. We develop an integro-difference equation (IDE) model that integrates Wolbachia's nonlinear growth with spatially explicit mosquito dispersal kernels to study invasion dynamics in heterogeneous landscapes. Analytical results establish the existence and uniqueness of monotone traveling waves and provide explicit estimates of invasion speeds as functions of dispersal and growth parameters. Four kernels: Gaussian, Laplace, exponential square-root, and Cauchy, represent a continuum from short- to long-range movement. Fat-tailed kernels generate faster, broader wavefronts, while compact ones limit spread. We also identify a critical bubble, the minimal localized profile required for sustained invasion. Numerical simulations in one- and two-dimensional domains confirm theoretical predictions and reveal parameter regimes governing invasion success. This framework quantifies how dispersal mechanisms shape Wolbachia's spread, thus informing targeted and efficient vector-control strategies.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity and weak mixing for group-indexed infinitely divisible stationary processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for an arbitrary indexing group, every ergodic infinitely divisible stationary process that is separable in probability is weakly mixing. This shows that, as in the well-known case of Gaussian stationary processes, ergodicity implies weak mixing is intrinsic to infinite divisibility, removing all structural assumptions on the group from prior results. The main ingredient is a general construction of stochastically continuous extensions for separable in probability stationary processes, reducing the problem to stochastically continuous processes indexed by Polish groups and then to countable groups, where we combine the Maruyama representation with an ergodicity criterion for Poisson suspensions.</description>

      <title>The global attractor of the Toner-Tu-Swift-Hohenberg equations of active turbulence and its properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Toner-Tu-Swift-Hohenberg (TTSH) equations are one of the basic equations that are used to model turbulent behaviour in active matter, specifically the swarming of bacteria in suspension. They combine features of the incompressible Navier-Stokes, the Toner-Tu and Swift-Hohenberg equations, together with the important properties that they are linearly driven, and that the Laplacian diffusion is taken to be negative in combination with hyper-dissipation. We prove that the TTSH equations possess a finite-dimensional compact global attractor on the periodic domain $\mathbb{T}^d$ ($d=2,3$) and we establish explicit estimates for its Lyapunov dimension which agree with the heuristic prediction based on the Swift-Hohenberg length scale. The predominance of this length scale (as a vortex length scale) has been observed in both numerical and experimental studies of bacterial turbulence, so our methods and results provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for this phenomenon. We also carry out pseudospectral direct numerical simulations of these PDEs in dimension $d=2$ through which we obtain Lyapunov spectra for representative parameter values. We show that our numerical results are consistent with the analytically derived rigorous bounds.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the conditions under which the space of bounded harmonic functions of a probability measure $\mu$ on a group $G$ is contained in that of another measure $\theta$. We establish that asymptotic commutativity, defined by the condition $\|\mu^{*t}*\theta - \theta*\mu^{*t}\|_{TV} \to 0$ as $t \to \infty$, is sufficient to guarantee the inclusion $H^\infty(G, \mu) \subseteq H^\infty(G, \theta)$, provided $\theta$ is absolutely continuous with respect to a convex combination of convolution powers of $\mu$. By employing martingale convergence techniques rather than ergodic-theoretic arguments, we demonstrate that this result holds without topological assumptions on $G$ (such as local compactness) and extends to general Markov chains. Furthermore, utilizing hitting models for the Poisson boundary, we characterise the inclusion $H^\infty(G, \mu) \subseteq H^\infty(G, \theta)$ as equivalent to the asymptotic invariance of $\theta$ under $\mu$ in the weak* topology. We apply these results to provide a probabilistic proof of the Choquet-Deny theorem for nilpotent groups, among other applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a rotation number for almost periodic Sturm-Liouville operators in the spirit of Johnson and Moser. We then prove the gap labelling theorem in terms of rotation numbers for the operator in question. To do this, we rigorously prove the almost periodicity of Green's functions.</description>

      <title>Spectral comparison of compound cocycles generated by delay equations in Hilbert spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02537v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study linear cocycles generated by nonautonomous delay equations in a suitable Hilbert space and their extensions, called compound cocycles, to exterior powers. Using a recent version of the frequency theorem, we develop analytical techniques for comparing spectral properties, such as uniform exponential dichotomies, between such cocycles and semigroups generated by stationary equations. These methods are based on properties related to regularity and structure in PDEs associated with delay equations. In particular, the developed machinery leads to effective robust criteria that guarantee the absence of closed invariant contours on global attractors arising in nonlinear problems and are expected to ensure global stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01798v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a continuous linear cocycle A over a homeomorphism f of a compact metric space X, we investigate its set R of Lyapunov-Perron regular points, that is, the collection of trajectories of f that obey the conclusions of the Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem. We obtain results roughly saying that the set R is of first Baire category (i.e., meager) in X, unless some rigid structure is present. In some settings, this rigid structure forces the Lyapunov exponents to be defined everywhere and to be independent of the point; that is what we call complete regularity.</description>

      <title>Meromorphic functions whose action on their Julia sets is Non-Ergodic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12127v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nevanlinna functions are meromorphic functions with a finite number of asymptotic values and no critical values. In [KK2] it was proved that if the orbits of all the asymptotic values accumulate on a compact set on which the function acts as a repeller, then the function acts ergodically on its Julia set. In [CJK4] we proved the action of the function on its Julia set is still ergodic if some, but not all of the asymptotic values land on infinity, and the remaining ones land on a compact repeller. In this paper, we complete the characterization of ergodicity for Nevanlinna functions by proving that if all the asymptotic values land on infinity, then the Julia set is the whole sphere and the action of the map there is non-ergodic.</description>

Abstract: We prove a rigidity property in non-Archimedean dynamics, reminiscent of Zdunik theorem in complex dynamics: every rational map whose equilibrium measure charges an interval in the Berkovich projective line is affine Bernoulli. Our proof is inspired by the construction of the affine model of multimodal maps by Parry and by Milnor and Thurston. This rigidity result allows us to show that the topological entropy of any tame rational map is the logarithm of an integer. To that end we analyze the properties of the multiplicative (sub)coboundary given by the spherical derivative and we establish a link between the sign of the Lyapunov exponent and the locus of wild ramification.</description>

      <title>Finite and infinite invariant measures for adic transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13071v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify the invariant Borel measures for adic transformations, where the alphabets have bounded size and the measure is finite on the path space of some sub-Bratteli diagram.
  We develop a nonstationary version of the Frobenius normal form for a reducible matrix, present an appropriate nonstationary notion of distinguished eigenvector, and prove a nonstationary Frobenius--Victory theorem. This parallels the approach to the stationary case developed by Bezuglyi, Kwiatkowski, Medynets and Solomyak in arXiv:0812.1088 where they classify the locally finite invariant measures. In later work, they also address the nonstationary case. We extend this in two ways. Firstly, in both the stationary and nonstationary settings, we allow for measures which are locally infinite, motivating this extension with examples. Secondly we give a complete classification, presenting a necessary and sufficient condition for a measure which is finite on some subdiagram to be infinite for the original diagram. As part of our program, we introduce a related object called an adic tower and a construction called the canonical cover of the subdiagram: if the measure is finite on the subdiagram but locally infinite on the original space it will be locally finite on the cover space, though the path spaces for the original diagram and the cover are measure-theoretically isomorphic. Our examples include two new models for the Integer Cantor Set transformation of [Fisher1992], one locally finite and one locally infinite, which lead to a new class of examples related to fractal sets of integers: nested circle rotations, where one rotation is embedded in another. The resulting tower measure inside the original rotation can have finite or infinite total mass as determined by our general criterion.</description>

      <title>Fractal transference principles for subsets of $\mathbb{N}^d$ of positive density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a multidimensional fractal transference principle for digit-restricted sets associated with subsets of $\mathbb{N}^d$, extending the one-dimensional framework of Nakajima--Takahasi, Adv. Math. (2025). We develop general Hausdorff-dimension tools via the singular value potential $\phi^s(\mathbf a)$ and the multivariate Dirichlet series $\zeta_S(\boldsymbol{\sigma}) =\sum_{\mathbf a\in S}\prod_{j=1}^d a_j^{-\sigma_j}$. Let $s_\ast:=\inf\{s&gt;0:\sum_{\mathbf a\in S}\phi^s(\mathbf a)&lt;\infty\}$ and $\Lambda_S:=\inf\{\sigma_1+\cdots+\sigma_d:\zeta_S(\boldsymbol{\sigma})&lt;\infty\}$. We obtain $\dim_H(\mathcal E_S)\le s_\ast$, where $\mathcal E_S\subset(0,1)^d$ denotes the set of points whose continued-fraction digit vectors lie in $S$ and whose coordinates escape (i.e.\ $a_n(x_j)\to\infty$ for each $j$), and $s_\ast=\tfrac12\Lambda_S$ for uniformly $K$--balanced $S$. In particular, if $S\subset\mathbb{N}^d$ has positive upper (or upper Banach) density then $\dim_H(\mathcal E_S)=d/2$. On the combinatorial side, the transference principle ensures that translation-invariant configurations forced at positive density, including multidimensional Szemer\'edi patterns, persist inside the induced fractal digit sets.</description>

      <title>On the escape rate for intermittent maps with holes shrinking around the indifferent fixed point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study non-uniformly expanding maps of the unit interval with a parabolic fixed point at the origin that admit an ergodic absolutely continuous invariant measure, which may be finite or infinite. By introducing a hole defined by an interval containing the parabolic fixed point, we analyze the escape rate of the resulting open system and its asymptotic behavior as the hole shrinks. Our approach relies on the transfer operator associated with the dynamical system and on the relationship between the transfer operators of the original system and its induced version. The results extend to this general framework previous investigations which considered special cases.</description>

      <title>Contact de Rham cohomology and Hodge structures transversal to the Reeb foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\beta$ be a contact form on a compact smooth manifold $X$ and $v_\beta$ its Reeb vector field. The paper applies general results of different authors about Hodge structures that are transversal to a given foliation to the special case of $1$-dimensional foliation generated by the Reeb flow $v_\beta$.
  The de Rham differential complex $\Omega_{\mathsf{basic}}^\ast(X, v_\beta)$ of, so called, {\sf basic} relative to $v_\beta$-flow differential forms is in the focus of this investigation. By definition, the basic forms vanish when being contracted with $v_\beta$, and so do their differentials.
  We prove that under the change $\beta \leadsto \beta_1 = \beta +df$, where a function $f:X \to \mathbf R$ such that $df(v_\beta) &gt; -1$, the differential complexes $\Omega_{\mathsf {basic}}^\ast(X, v_{\beta_1})$ and $\Omega_{\mathsf{basic}}^\ast(X, v_\beta)$ are canonically isomorphic.
  We investigate when the $2$-form $d\beta$ and its powers deliver nontrivial elements in the basic de Rham cohomology $H^\ast_{\mathsf{basic}\,d\mathcal{R}}(X, v_\beta)$ of the differential complex $\Omega_{\mathsf{basic}}^\ast(X, v_\beta)$. Answers to these questions contrast sharply in the cases of a closed $X$ and a $X$ with boundary.
  On the other hand, building on work of Ra\'{z}ny \cite{Raz}, we show that on a closed manifold $X$, equipped with a transversal to the Reeb flow Hodge structure that satisfies the {\it Basic Hard Lefschetz Property}, the basic de Rham cohomology $H^\ast_{\mathsf{basic}\,d\mathcal{R}}(X, v_\beta)$ are topological invariants of $X$.</description>

      <title>On Piecewise Affine Reachability with Bellman Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19923v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the following reachability problem for piecewise affine maps: Given two vectors $\mathbf{s}, \mathbf{t} \in \mathbb{Q}^d$ and a piecewise affine map $f \colon \mathbb{Q}^d\rightarrow \mathbb{Q}^d$, does there exist $n\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $f^{n}(\mathbf{s}) = \mathbf{t}$? In this work, we focus on this reachability problem for a subclass of piecewise affine maps -- Bellman operators arising from Markov decision processes. We prove that the reachability problem for $\max$- and $\min$-Bellman operators is decidable in any dimension under either of the following conditions: (i) the target vector $\mathbf{t}$ is not the fixed point of the operator $f$; or (ii) the initial and target vectors $\mathbf{s}$ and $\mathbf{t}$ are comparable with respect to the componentwise order. Furthermore, we show that in the two-dimensional case, the reachability problem for Bellman operators is decidable for arbitrary $\mathbf{s}, \mathbf{t} \in \mathbb{Q}^2$. This stands in sharp contrast to the known undecidability of reachability for general piecewise affine maps in dimension $d = 2$.</description>
