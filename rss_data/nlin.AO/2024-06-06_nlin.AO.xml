      <title>Software in the natural world: A computational approach to hierarchical emergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the functional architecture of complex systems is crucial to illuminate their inner workings and enable effective methods for their prediction and control. Recent advances have introduced tools to characterise emergent macroscopic levels; however, while these approaches are successful in identifying when emergence takes place, they are limited in the extent they can determine how it does. Here we address this limitation by developing a computational approach to emergence, which characterises macroscopic processes in terms of their computational capabilities. Concretely, we articulate a view on emergence based on how software works, which is rooted on a mathematical formalism that articulates how macroscopic processes can express self-contained informational, interventional, and computational properties. This framework establishes a hierarchy of nested self-contained processes that determines what computations take place at what level, which in turn delineates the functional architecture of a complex system. This approach is illustrated on paradigmatic models from the statistical physics and computational neuroscience literature, which are shown to exhibit macroscopic processes that are akin to software in human-engineered systems. Overall, this framework enables a deeper understanding of the multi-level structure of complex systems, revealing specific ways in which they can be efficiently simulated, predicted, and controlled.</description>

      <title>Mitigating an epidemic on a geographic network using vaccination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06370v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a mathematical model describing the propagation of an epidemic on a geographical network. The size of the outbreak is governed by the initial growth rate of the disease given by the maximal eigenvalue of the epidemic matrix formed by the susceptibles and the graph Laplacian representing the mobility. We use matrix perturbation theory to analyze the epidemic matrix and define a vaccination strategy, assuming the vaccination reduces the susceptibles. When mobility and local disease dynamics have similar time scales, it is most efficient to vaccinate the whole network because the disease grows uniformly. However, if only a few vertices can be vaccinated then which ones do we choose? We answer this question, and show that it is most efficient to vaccinate along an eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the Laplacian. We illustrate these general results on a 7 vertex graph and a realistic example of the french rail network. When mobility is slower than local disease dynamics, the epidemic grows on the vertex with largest susceptibles. The epidemic growth rate is more reduced when vaccinating a larger degree vertex; it also depends on the neighboring vertices. This study and its conclusions provides guidelines for the planning of vaccination on a network at the onset of an epidemic.</description>
