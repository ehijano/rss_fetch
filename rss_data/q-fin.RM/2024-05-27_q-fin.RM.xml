      <title>Risk measurement of joint risk of portfolios: a liquidity shortfall aspect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.04848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel axiomatic framework of measuring the joint risk of a portfolio consisting of several financial positions. From the liquidity shortfall aspect, we construct a distortion-type risk measure to measure the joint risk of portfolios, which we referred to as multivariate distortion joint risk measure, representing the liquidity shortfall caused by the joint risk of portfolios. After its fundamental properties have been studied, we axiomatically characterize it by proposing a novel set of axioms. Furthermore, based on the representations for multivariate distortion joint risk measures, we also propose a new class of vector-valued multivariate distortion joint risk measures, as well as with sensible financial interpretation. Their fundamental properties are also investigated. It turns out that this new class is large enough, as it can not only induce new vector-valued multivariate risk measures, but also recover some popular vector-valued multivariate risk measures known in the literature with alternative financial interpretation. Examples are given to illustrate the proposed multivariate distortion joint risk measures. This paper mainly gives some theoretical results, helping one to have an insight look at the measurement of joint risk of portfolios.</description>

      <title>Dispensing with optimal control: a new approach for the pricing and management of share buyback contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel methodology for the pricing and management of share buyback contracts, overcoming the limitations of traditional optimal control methods, which frequently encounter difficulties with high-dimensional state spaces and the intricacies of selecting appropriate risk penalty or risk aversion parameter. Our methodology applies optimized heuristic strategies to maximize the contract's value. The computation of this value utilizes classical methods typically used for pricing path-dependent Bermudan options. Additionally, our approach naturally leads to the formulation of a hedging strategy.</description>
