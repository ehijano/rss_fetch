      <title>Does there exist a quantum fingerprinting protocol without coherent measurements?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Buhrman, Cleve, Watrous, and de Wolf (PRL 2001) discovered the quantum fingerprinting protocol, which is the quantum SMP protocol with $O(\log n)$ qubits communication for the equality problem. In the protocol, Alice and Bob create some quantum fingerprints of their inputs, and the referee conducts the SWAP tests for the quantum fingerprints. Since $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ bits communication is required with the classical SMP scheme for the equality problem first shown by Newman and Szegedy (STOC 1996), there exists an exponential quantum advantage in the amount of communication.
  In this paper, we consider a setting in which the referee can do only incoherent measurements rather than coherent measurements including the SWAP tests. We first show that, in the case of one-way LOCC measurements, $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ qubits communication is required. To prove the result, we derive a new method to replace quantum messages by classical messages and consider a reduction to the optimal lower bound in the hybrid SMP model where one message is quantum and the other is classical, which was first shown by Klauck and Podder (MFCS 2014). Our method uses the result of Oszmaniec, Guerini, Wittek, and Ac\'in (PRL 2017), who showed that general POVM measurements can be simulated by randomized projective measurements with small ancilla qubits, and Newman's theorem.
  We further investigate the setting of quantum SMP protocols with two-way LOCC measurements, and derive a lower bound against some restricted two-way LOCC measurements. To prove it, we revisit the technique to replace quantum messages by classical deterministic messages introduced by Aaronson (ToC 2005) and generalized by Gavinsky, Regev, and de Wolf (CJTCS 2008), and show that, using the deterministic message, the referee can simulate the two-way LOCC measurements.</description>

      <title>EHOP: A Dataset of Everyday NP-Hard Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the dataset of Everyday Hard Optimization Problems (EHOP), a collection of NP-hard optimization problems expressed in natural language. EHOP includes problem formulations that could be found in computer science textbooks, versions that are dressed up as problems that could arise in real life, and variants of well-known problems with inverted rules. We find that state-of-the-art LLMs, across multiple prompting strategies, systematically solve textbook problems more accurately than their real-life and inverted counterparts. We argue that this constitutes evidence that LLMs adapt solutions seen during training, rather than leveraging reasoning abilities that would enable them to generalize to novel problems.</description>
