      <title>Exoplanets Across Galactic Stellar Populations with PLATO: Estimating Exoplanet Yields Around FGK Stars for the Thin Disk, Thick Disk and Stellar Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to assess the potential of the upcoming PLATO mission to investigate exoplanet populations around stars in diverse Galactic environments, specifically focusing on the Milky Way thin disk, thick disk, and stellar halo. We aim to quantify PLATOs ability to detect planets in each environment and determine how these observations could constrain planet formation models. Beginning from the all-sky PLATO Input Catalog, we kinematically classify the 2.4 million FGK stars into their respective Galactic components. For the sub-sample of stars in the long-observation LOPS2 and LOPN1 PLATO fields, we estimate planet occurrence rates using the New Generation Planet Population Synthesis (NGPPS) dataset. Combining these estimates with a PLATO detection efficiency model, we predicted the expected planet yields for each Galactic environment during a nominal 2+2 year mission. Based on our analysis, PLATO is likely to detect at least 400 exoplanets around the alpha-enriched thick disk stars. The majority of those planets are expected to be Super-Earths and Sub-Neptunes with radii between 2 and 10 Earth radii and orbital periods between 2 and 50 days, ideal for studying the link between the radius valley and stellar chemistry. For the metal-poor halo, PLATO is likely to detect between 1 and 80 planets with periods between 10 and 50 days, depending on the potential existence of a metallicity threshold for planet formation. The PLATO fields contain more than 3,400 potential target stars with [Fe/H] &lt; -0.6, which will help to improve our understanding of planets around metal-poor stars. We identify a specific target list of 47 (kinematically classified) halo stars in the high-priority, high-SNR PLATO P1 sample, offering prime opportunities in the search for planets in metal-poor environments.</description>

      <title>Analyzing JWST/NIRSpec Hydrogen Line Detections at TWA 27B: Constraining Accretion Properties and Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15922v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen lines from forming planets are crucial for understanding planet formation. However, the number of planetary hydrogen line detections is still limited. Recent JWST/NIRSpec observations have detected Paschen and Brackett hydrogen lines at TWA 27 B (2M1207b). TWA 27 B is classified as a planetary-mass companison (PMC) rather than a planet due to its large mass ratio to the central object ($\approx 5 M_\mathrm{J}$ compared to $25 M_\mathrm{J}$). Nevertheless, TWA 27 B's hydrogen line emission is expected to be same as for planets, given its small mass. We aim to constrain the accretion properties and accretion geometry of TWA 27 B, contributing to our understanding of hydrogen line emission mechanism common to both PMCs and planets. We conduct spectral fitting of four bright hydrogen lines (Pa-$\alpha$, Pa-$\beta$, Pa-$\gamma$, Pa-$\delta$) with an accretion-shock emission model tailored for forming planets. We estimate the mass accretion rate at $\dot{M} \approx 3 \times 10^{-9}\, M_\mathrm{J}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ with our fiducial parameters, though this is subject to an uncertainty of up to factor of ten. Our analysis also indicates a dense accretion flow, $n\gtrsim 10^{13}\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ just before the shock, implying a small accretion-shock filling factor $f_\mathrm{f}$ on the planetary surface ($f_\mathrm{f} \lesssim 5\times10^{-4}$). This finding suggests that magnetospheric accretion is occurring at TWA 27 B. Additionally, we carry out a comparative analysis of hydrogen-line emission color to identify the emission mechanism, but the associated uncertainties proved too large for definitive conclusions. This underscores the need for further high-precision observational studies to elucidate these emission mechanisms fully.</description>

      <title>Origin of Mars's moons by disruptive partial capture of an asteroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of Phobos and Deimos remains unknown. They are typically thought either to be captured asteroids or to have accreted from a debris disk produced by a giant impact. Here, we present an alternative scenario wherein fragments of a tidally disrupted asteroid are captured and evolve into a collisional proto-satellite disk. We simulate the initial disruption and the fragments' subsequent orbital evolution. We find that tens of percent of an unbound asteroid's mass can be captured and survive beyond collisional timescales, across a broad range of periapsis distances, speeds, masses, spins, and orientations in the Sun--Mars frame. Furthermore, more than one percent of the asteroid's mass could evolve to circularise in the moons' accretion region. The resulting lower mass requirement for the parent body than that for a giant impact could increase the likelihood of this route to forming a proto-satellite disk that, unlike direct capture, could also naturally explain the moons' orbits. These formation scenarios imply different properties of Mars's moons to be tested by upcoming spacecraft missions.</description>

      <title>Toward Exoplanet Transit Spectroscopy Using JWST/MIRI's Medium Resolution Spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI)'s Medium Resolution Spectrometer (the MRS) on JWST has potentially important advantages for transit and eclipse spectroscopy of exoplanets, including lack of saturation for bright host stars, wavelength span to longward of 20 microns, and JWST's highest spectral resolving power. We here test the performance of the MRS for time series spectroscopy by observing the secondary eclipse of the bright stellar eclipsing binary R Canis Majoris. Our observations push the MRS into saturation at the shortest wavelength, more than for any currently known exoplanet system. We find strong charge migration between pixels that we mitigate using a custom data analysis pipeline. Our data analysis recovers much of the spatial charge migration by combining detector pixels at the group level, via weighting by the point spread function. We achieve nearly photon-limited performance in time series data at wavelengths longward of 5.2 microns. In 2017, Snellen et al. suggested that the MRS could be used to detect carbon dioxide absorption from the atmosphere of the temperate planet orbiting Proxima Centauri. We infer that the relative spectral response of the MRS versus wavelength is sufficiently stable to make that detection feasible. As regards the secondary eclipse of this Algol-type binary, we measure the eclipse depth by summing our spectra over the wavelengths in four channels, and also measuring the eclipse depth as observed by TESS. Those eclipse depths require a temperature for the secondary star that is significantly hotter than previous observations in the optical to near-IR, probably due to irradiation by the primary star. At full spectral resolution of the MRS, we find atomic hydrogen recombination emission lines in the secondary star, from principal quantum levels n = 7, 8, 10, and 14.</description>

      <title>A Tale of Two Molecules: The Underprediction of CO$_2$ and Overprediction of PH$_3$ in Late T and Y Dwarf Atmospheric Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sensitivity and spectral coverage of JWST is enabling us to test our assumptions of ultracool dwarf atmospheric chemistry, especially with regards to the abundances of phosphine (PH$_3$) and carbon dioxide (CO$_2$). In this paper, we use NIRSpec PRISM spectra ($\sim$0.8$-$5.5 $\mu$m, $R\sim$100) of four late T and Y dwarfs to show that standard substellar atmosphere models have difficulty replicating the 4.1$-$4.4 $\mu$m wavelength range as they predict an overabundance of phosphine and an underabundance of carbon dioxide. To help quantify this discrepancy, we generate a grid of models using PICASO based on the Elf Owl chemical and temperature profiles where we include the abundances of these two molecules as parameters. The fits to these PICASO models show a consistent preference for orders of magnitude higher CO$_2$ abundances and a reduction in PH$_3$ abundance as compared to the nominal models. This tendency means that the claimed phosphine detection in UNCOVER$-$BD$-$3 could instead be explained by a CO$_2$ abundance in excess of standard atmospheric model predictions; however the signal-to-noise of the spectrum is not high enough to discriminate between these cases. We discuss atmospheric mechanisms that could explain the observed underabundance of PH$_3$ and overabundance of CO$_2$, including a vertical eddy diffusion coefficient ($K_{\mathrm{zz}}$) that varies with altitude, incorrect chemical pathways, or elements condensing out in forms such as NH$_4$H$_2$PO$_4$. However, our favored explanation for the required CO$_2$ enhancement is that the quench approximation does not accurately predict the CO$_2$ abundance, as CO$_2$ remains in chemical equilibrium with CO after CO quenches.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Venus Cloud Structure Simulated by a General Circulation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The clouds have a great impact on Venus's energy budget and climate evolution, but its three-dimensional structure is still not well understood. Here we incorporate a simple Venus cloud physics scheme into a flexible GCM to investigate the three-dimensional cloud spatial variability. Our simulations show good agreement with observations in terms of the vertical profiles of clouds and H2SO4 vapor. H2O vapor is overestimated above the clouds due to efficient transport in the cloud region. The cloud top decreases as latitude increases, qualitatively consistent with Venus Express observations. The underlying mechanism is the combination of H2SO4 chemical production and meridional circulation. The mixing ratios of H2SO4 at 50-60 km and H2O vapors in the main cloud deck basically exhibit maxima around the equator, due to the effect of temperature's control on the saturation vapor mixing ratios of the two species. The cloud mass distribution is subject to both H2SO4 chemical production and dynamical transport and shows a pattern that peaks around the equator in the upper cloud while peaks at mid-high latitudes in the middle cloud. At low latitudes, H2SO4 and H2O vapors, cloud mass loading and acidity show semidiurnal variations at different altitude ranges, which can be validated against future missions. Our model emphasizes the complexity of the Venus climate system and the great need for more observations and simulations to unravel its spatial variability and underlying atmospheric and/or geological processes.</description>

      <title>Modeling Multiple Radius Valley Emergence Mechanisms With Multi-Transiting Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Close-in planets smaller than Neptune form two distinct populations composed of rocky super-Earths and sub-Neptunes that may host primordial H/He envelopes. The origin of the radius valley separating these two planet populations remains an open question and has been posited to emerge either directly from the planet formation process or via subsequent atmospheric escape. Multi-transiting systems that span the radius valley are known to be useful diagnostics of XUV-driven mass loss. Here, we extend this framework to test XUV-driven photoevaporation, core-powered mass loss, and an accretion-limited primordial radius valley model. Focusing on multi-transiting systems allows us to eliminate unobservable quantities that are shared within individual systems such as stellar XUV luminosity histories and the properties of the protoplanetary disk. We test each proposed radius valley emergence mechanism on all 221 known multi-transiting systems and calculate the minimum masses of the systems' enveloped planets to be consistent with the models. We compare our model predictions to 75 systems with measured masses and find that the majority of systems can be explained by any of the three proposed mechanisms. We also examine model consistency as a function of stellar mass and stellar metallicity but find no significant trends. More multi-transiting systems with mass characterizations are required before multi-transiting systems can serve as a viable diagnostic of radius valley emergence models. Our software for the model evaluations presented herein is available on GitHub and may be applied to future multi-transiting system discoveries.</description>

      <title>Gemini Planet Imager Observations of a Resolved Low-Inclination Debris Disk Around HD 156623</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 16 Myr-old A0V star HD 156623 in the Scorpius--Centaurus association hosts a high-fractional-luminosity debris disk, recently resolved in scattered light for the first time by the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) in polarized intensity. We present new analysis of the GPI H-band polarimetric detection of the HD 156623 debris disk, with particular interest in its unique morphology. This debris disk lacks a visible inner clearing, unlike the majority of low-inclination disks in the GPI sample and in Sco-Cen, and it is known to contain CO gas, positioning it as a candidate ``hybrid'' or ``shielded'' disk. We use radiative transfer models to constrain the geometric parameters of the disk based on scattered light data and thermal models to constrain the unresolved inner radius based on the system's spectral energy distribution (SED). We also compute a measurement of the polarized scattering phase function, adding to the existing sample of empirical phase function measurements. We find that HD 156623's debris disk inner radius is constrained to less than 26.6 AU from scattered light imagery and less than 13.4 AU from SED modeling at a 99.7% confidence interval, and suggest that gas drag may play a role in retaining sub-blowout size dust grains so close to the star.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the dynamical masses of the transiting planets in the young AU Mic system: Potential AU Mic b inflation at $\sim$20 Myr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding planet formation is important in the context of the origin of planetary systems in general and of the Solar System in particular, as well as to predict the likelihood of finding Jupiter, Neptune, and Earth analogues around other stars. We aim to precisely determine the radii and dynamical masses of transiting planets orbiting the young M star AU Mic using public photometric and spectroscopic datasets. We characterise the stellar activity and physical properties (radius, mass, density) of the transiting planets in the young AU Mic system through joint transit and radial velocity fits with Gaussian processes. We determine a radius of $R^{b}$= 4.79 +/- 0.29 R$_\oplus$, a mass of $M^{b}$= 9.0 +/- 2.7 M$_\oplus$, and a bulk density of $\rho^{b}$ = 0.49 +/- 0.16 g cm$^{-3}$ for the innermost transiting planet AU Mic b. For the second known transiting planet, AU Mic c, we infer a radius of $R^{c}$= 2.79 +/- 0.18 R$_\oplus$, a mass of $M^{c}$= 14.5 +/- 3.4 M$_\oplus$, and a bulk density of $\rho^{c}$ = 3.90 +/- 1.17 g cm$^{-3}$. According to theoretical models, AU Mic b may harbour an H2 envelope larger than 5\% by mass, with a fraction of rock and a fraction of water. AU Mic c could be made of rock and/or water and may have an H2 atmosphere comprising at most 5\% of its mass. AU Mic b has retained most of its atmosphere but might lose it over tens of millions of years due to the strong stellar radiation, while AU Mic c likely suffers much less photo-evaporation because it lies at a larger separation from its host. Using all the datasets in hand, we determine a 3$\sigma$ upper mass limit of $M^{[d]}\sin{i}$ = 8.6 M$_{\oplus}$ for the AU Mic 'd' TTV-candidate. In addition, we do not confirm the recently proposed existence of the planet candidate AU Mic 'e' with an orbital period of 33.4 days.</description>

      <title>Dust rings trap protoplanets on eccentric orbits and get consumed by them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the orbital evolution and mass growth of protoplanets with masses $M \in [0.1-8]$~M$_\oplus$ in the vicinity of a dusty ring, using three-dimensional numerical simulations with a two-fluid model and nested-meshes. We find two stable, eccentric orbits that lock the planet in the ring vicinity, thereby inhibiting its migration and allowing it to accrete dust from the ring. One of these orbits has an eccentricity comparable to the aspect ratio of the gaseous disc and has its periastron within the ring, enabling intermittent accretion during each pass. The other orbit has a smaller eccentricity and an apoastron slightly inside the ring. A planet locked at the outer orbit efficiently accretes from the ring and can reach the critical mass for runaway gas accretion on timescales $\gtrsim 10^5$ yr (for a 10~M$_\oplus$ dust ring at 10~au) while a planet locked at the inner orbit has a slower growth and might not supersede the super-Earth stage over the disc lifetime. While in our runs a low-mass embryo forming within the ring eventually joins the outer orbit, it is likely that the path taken depends on the specific details of the ring. The trapping on the outer orbit arises from an intermittent, strong thermal force at each passage through the ring, where the accretion rate spikes. It is insensitive to uncertainties that plague models considering planets trapped on circular orbits in rings. It is highly robust and could allow a growing planet to follow an expanding ring over large distances.</description>

      <title>Impact of the transport of magnetospheric electrons on the composition of the Triton atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to its inclined orbit and the complex geometry of the magnetic field of Neptune, Triton experiences a highly variable magnetic environment. As precipitation of magnetospheric electrons is thought to have a large impact on the Triton atmosphere, a better understanding of the interaction between its atmosphere and the magnetosphere of Neptune is important. We aim to couple a model of the Triton atmosphere with an electron transport model to compute the impact of a varying electron precipitation on the atmospheric composition. We coupled a recent photochemical model of the Triton atmosphere with the electron transport model TRANSPlanets. The inputs of this code were determined from Voyager 2 observations and previous studies. The main inputs were the electron precipitation flux, the orbital scaling factor, and the magnetic field strength. The electron-impact ionization and electron-impact dissociation rates computed by TRANSPlanets were then used in the photochemical model. We also analyzed the model uncertainties. The coupling of the two models enabled us to find an electron density profile, as well as N$_2$ and N number densities, that are consistent with the Voyager 2 observations. We found that photoionization and electron-impact ionization are of the same order, in contrast to the results of previous photochemical models. However, we emphasize that this result depends on the hypotheses we used to determine the input variables of TRANSPlanets. Our model would greatly benefit from new measurements of the magnetic environment of Triton, as well as of the electron fluxes in the Neptune magnetosphere.</description>

      <title>Hints of planet formation signatures in a large-cavity disk studied in the AGE-PRO ALMA Large Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting planet signatures in protoplanetary disks is fundamental to understanding how and where planets form. In this work, we report dust and gas observational hints of planet formation in the disk around 2MASS-J16120668-301027, as part of the ALMA Large Program ``AGE-PRO: ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in Protoplanetary disks''. The disk was imaged with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at Band 6 (1.3 mm) in dust continuum emission and four molecular lines: $^{12}$CO(J=2-1), $^{13}$CO(J=2-1), C$^{18}$O(J=2-1), and H$_2$CO(J=3$_{(3,0)}$-2$_{(2,0)}$). Resolved observations of the dust continuum emission (angular resolution of $\sim 150$ mas, 20 au) show a ring-like structure with a peak at $0.57 ^{\prime \prime}$ (75 au), a deep gap with a minimum at 0.24$^{\prime \prime}$ (31 au), an inner disk, a bridge connecting the inner disk and the outer ring, along with a spiral arm structure, and a tentative detection (to $3\sigma$) of a compact emission at the center of the disk gap, with an estimated dust mass of $\sim 2.7-12.9$ Lunar masses. We also detected a kinematic kink (not coincident with any dust substructure) through several $^{12}$CO channel maps (angular resolution $\sim$ 200 mas, 30 au), located at a radius of $\sim 0.875^{\prime \prime}$ (115.6 au). After modeling the $^{12}$CO velocity rotation around the protostar, we identified a purple tentative rotating-like structure at the kink location with a geometry similar to that of the disk. We discuss potential explanations for the dust and gas substructures observed in the disk, and their potential connection to signatures of planet formation.</description>

      <title>Toward Robust Corrections for Stellar Contamination in JWST Exoplanet Transmission Spectra</title>

Abstract: Transmission spectroscopy is still the preferred characterization technique for exoplanet atmospheres, although it presents unique challenges that translate into characterization bottlenecks when robust mitigation strategies are missing. Stellar contamination is one such challenge that can overpower the planetary signal by up to an order of magnitude, and thus not accounting for it can lead to significant biases in the derived atmospheric properties. Yet this accounting may not be straightforward, as important discrepancies exist between state-of-the-art stellar models and measured spectra and between models themselves. Here we explore the extent to which stellar models can be used to reliably correct for stellar contamination and yield a planet's uncontaminated transmission spectrum. We find that discrepancies between stellar models can significantly contribute to the noise budget of JWST transmission spectra of planets around stars with heterogeneous photospheres, the true number of unique photospheric spectral components and their properties can only be accurately retrieved when the stellar models have sufficient fidelity, and under such optimistic circumstances the contribution of stellar contamination to the noise budget of a transmission spectrum is considerably below that of the photon noise for the standard transit observation setup. Therefore, we advocate for further development of model spectra of stars and their active regions in a data-driven manner, empirical approaches for deriving spectra of photospheric components using the observatories with which the atmospheric explorations are carried out, and analysis techniques accounting for multimodal posterior distributions for photospheric parameters of interest, which will be increasingly revealed by precise JWST measurements.</description>

      <title>A roadmap for the atmospheric characterization of terrestrial exoplanets with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15895v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-cool dwarf stars are abundant, long-lived, and uniquely suited to enable the atmospheric study of transiting terrestrial companions with JWST. Amongst them, the most prominent is the M8.5V star TRAPPIST-1 and its seven planets. While JWST Cycle 1 observations have started to yield preliminary insights into the planets, they have also revealed that their atmospheric exploration requires a better understanding of their host star. Here, we propose a roadmap to characterize the TRAPPIST-1 system -- and others like it -- in an efficient and robust manner. We notably recommend that -- although more challenging to schedule -- multi-transit windows be prioritized to mitigate the effects of stellar activity and gather up to twice more transits per JWST hour spent. We conclude that, for such systems, planets cannot be studied in isolation by small programs, but rather need large-scale, jointly space- and ground-based initiatives to fully exploit the capabilities of JWST for the exploration of terrestrial planets.</description>

      <title>Exploring the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-178b. Constraints on atmospheric chemistry and dynamics from a joint retrieval of VLT/CRIRES$^+$ and space photometric data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08166</link>

Abstract: Despite recent progress in the spectroscopic characterization of individual exoplanets, the atmospheres of key ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) still lack comprehensive investigations. These include WASP-178b, one of the most irradiated UHJs known to date. We observed the dayside emission signal of this planet with CRIRES$^+$ in the spectral K-band. By applying the cross-correlation technique and a Bayesian retrieval framework to the high-resolution spectra, we identified the emission signature of $^{12}$CO (S/N = 8.9) and H$_2$O (S/N = 4.9), and a strong atmospheric thermal inversion. A joint retrieval with space-based secondary eclipse measurements from TESS and CHEOPS allows us to refine our results on the thermal profile and thus to constrain the atmospheric chemistry, yielding a solar to super-solar metallicity (1.4$\pm$1.6 dex) and a solar C/O ratio (0.6$\pm$0.2). We infer a significant excess of spectral line broadening and identify a slight Doppler-shift between the $^{12}$CO and H$_2$O signals. These findings provide strong evidence for a super-rotating atmospheric flow pattern and suggest the possible existence of chemical inhomogeneities across the planetary dayside hemisphere. In addition, the inclusion of photometric data in our retrieval allows us to account for stellar light reflected by the planetary atmosphere, resulting in an upper limit on the geometric albedo (0.23). The successful characterization of WASP-178b's atmosphere through a joint analysis of CRIRES$^+$, TESS, and CHEOPS observations highlights the potential of combined studies with space- and ground-based instruments and represents a promising avenue for advancing our understanding of exoplanet atmospheres.</description>
