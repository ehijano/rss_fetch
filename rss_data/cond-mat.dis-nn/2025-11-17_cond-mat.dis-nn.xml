      <title>Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics of Associative Memory Continuous-Time Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-Time Recurrent Neural Networks (CTRNNs) have been widely used for their capacity to model complex temporal behaviour. However, their internal dynamics often remain difficult to interpret. In this paper, we propose a new class of CTRNNs based on Hopfield-like associative memories with asymmetric couplings. This model combines the expressive power of associative memories with a tractable mathematical formalism to characterize fluctuations in nonequilibrium dynamics. We show that this mathematical description allows us to directly compute the evolution of its macroscopic observables (the encoded features), as well as the instantaneous entropy and entropy dissipation of the system, thereby offering a bridge between dynamical systems descriptions of low-dimensional observables and the statistical mechanics of large nonequilibrium networks. Our results suggest that these nonequilibrium associative CTRNNs can serve as more interpretable models for complex sequence-encoding networks.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic structure of relaxor ferroelectrics from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We hybridize swap Monte Carlo and geometric relaxation to determine the intrinsic compositional structure (CS) of lead magnesium niobate (PMN) relaxor. We verify the stability of a Nb-rich sublattice in PMN, as prescribed by the prevailing random-site model. But ions in the complementary sublattice are not randomly mixed. The majority of Nb ions collapse into a dominant Nb cluster which percolates the lattice with a mesh-like geometry that prevents large space charges. Subsequent molecular dynamics simulations predict a pair distribution function agreeing with neutron scattering experiments. Analysis of dipolar structures in the Nb cluster sheds light on the unique dielectric property of PMN.</description>

      <title>The maximum-average subtensor problem: equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15400v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study the Maximum-Average Subtensor ($p$-MAS) problem, in which one wants to find a subtensor of size $k$ of a given random tensor of size $N$, both of order $p$, with maximum sum of entries. We are motivated by recent work on the matrix case of the problem in which several equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties have been characterized analytically in the asymptotic regime $1 \ll k \ll N$, and a puzzling phenomenon was observed involving the coexistence of a clustered equilibrium phase and an efficient algorithm which produces submatrices in this phase. Here we extend previous results on equilibrium and algorithmic properties for the matrix case to the tensor case. We show that the tensor case has a similar equilibrium phase diagram as the matrix case, and an overall similar phenomenology for the considered algorithms. Additionally, we consider out-of-equilibrium landscape properties using Overlap Gap Properties and Franz-Parisi analysis, and discuss the implications or lack-thereof for average-case algorithmic hardness.</description>

      <title>The Anderson transition -- a view from Krylov space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Krylov subspace expansion is a workhorse method for sparse numerics that has been increasingly explored as source of physical insight into many-body dynamics in recent years. In this work we revisit the venerable Anderson model of localization in dimensions $d=1, 2, 3, 4$ to construct local integrals of motion (LIOM) in Krylov space. These appear as zero eigenvalue edge states of an effective hopping problem in the Krylov superoperator subspace and can be analytically constructed given the Lanczos coefficients. We exploit this idea, focusing on $d=3$, to study the manifestation of the disorder driven Anderson transition in the anatomy of LIOMs. We find that the increasing complexity of the Krylov operators results in a suppression of the fluctuations of the Lanczos coefficients. As such, one can study the phenomenology of the integrals of motion in the disorder averaged Krylov chain. We find edge states localized on vanishing fraction of Krylov space (of dimension $D_K=V^2$ for cubes of volume $V$), both in localized and extended phases. Importantly, in the localized phase, disorder induces powerlaw decaying dimerization in the (Krylov) hopping problem, producing stretched exponential decay of the LIOMs in Krylov space with a stretching exponent $1/2d$. Metallic LIOMs are completely delocalized albeit across only $\propto \sqrt{D_K}$ states. Critical LIOMs exhibit powerlaw decay with an exponent matching the expected value of $0.29$.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition of Topological Index driven by Dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study topological insulators under dephasing noise. With examples of both a $2d$ Chern insulator and a $3d$ topological insulator protected by time-reversal symmetry, we demonstrate that there is a phase transition at finite dephasing strength between phases with nontrivial and trivial topological indices. Here the topological index is defined through the correlation matrix. The transition can be diagnosed through the spectrum of the whole correlation matrix or of a local subsystem. Interestingly, even if the topological insulator is very close to the topological-trivial critical point in its Hamiltonian, it still takes finite strength of dephasing to change the topological index, suggesting the robustness of topological insulators under dephasing. We further consider Chern insulators in the presence of real-space disorder, which exhibit a ground-state transition between topological and Anderson insulating phases. We find that even strongly-disordered Chern insulators, close to the critical disorder strength, exhibit robustness with respect to dephasing.</description>

      <title>Self-organization, Memory and Learning: From Driven Disordered Systems to Living Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disordered systems subject to a fluctuating environment can self-organize into a complex history-dependent response, retaining a memory of the driving. In sheared amorphous solids, self-organization is established by the emergence of a persistent system of mechanical instabilities that can repeatedly be triggered by the driving, leading to a state of high mechanical reversibility. As a result of self-organization, the response of the system becomes correlated with the dynamics of its environment, which can be viewed as a sensing mechanism of the system's environment. Such phenomena emerge across a wide variety of soft matter systems, suggesting that they are generic and hence may depend very little on the underlying specifics. We review self-organization in driven amorphous solids, concluding with a discussion of what self-organization in driven disordered systems can teach us about how simple organisms sense and adapt to their changing environments.</description>
