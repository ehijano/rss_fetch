      <title>An open problem: Why are motif-avoidant attractors so rare in asynchronous Boolean networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asynchronous Boolean networks are a type of discrete dynamical system in which each variable can take one of two states, and a single variable state is updated in each time step according to pre-selected rules. Boolean networks are popular in systems biology due to their ability to model long-term biological phenotypes within a qualitative, predictive framework. Boolean networks model phenotypes as attractors, which are closely linked to minimal trap spaces (inescapable hypercubes in the system's state space). In biological applications, attractors and minimal trap spaces are typically in one-to-one correspondence. However, this correspondence is not guaranteed: motif-avoidant attractors (MAAs) that lie outside minimal trap spaces are possible.
  MAAs are rare and (despite recent efforts) poorly understood. Here we summarize the current state of knowledge regarding MAAs and present several novel observations regarding their response to node deletion reductions and linear extensions of edges. We conduct large-scale computational studies on an ensemble of 14,000 models derived from published Boolean models of biological systems, and more than 100 million Random Boolean Networks. Our findings quantify the rarity of MAAs (in particular, we found no MAAs in the biological models), but highlight the role of network reduction in introducing MAAs into the dynamics. We also show that MAAs are fragile to linear extensions: in sparse networks, even a single linear node can disrupt virtually all MAAs. Motivated by this observation, we improve the upper bound on the number of delays needed to disrupt a motif-avoidant attractor.</description>

      <title>Numerical modeling of hydrogel scaffold anisotropy during extrusion-based 3D printing for tissue engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02734v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extrusion-based 3D printing is a recent and widely used tissue engineering tool that provides precise 3D control of bioinks to create organ-size biomaterial-based objects composed of hierarchically organized cellularized scaffolds. The internal organization of scaffold constituents should mimic the structural anisotropy of targeted tissue to stimulate proliferative cellular behavior during 3D cell culture. Both the choice of polymers constituting the bioink and the topological properties during the extrusion process greatly influence the structural anisotropy and cellular response of tissue engineering constructs. The bioink used in our study was a hydrogel made of three constituents: fibrinogen, alginate and gelatin. These components provide biocompatibility, printability and conservation of 3D shape after printing. The topological properties in flowing polymers are dictated by macromolecule conformation i.e. their orientation and degree of stretch. In this study, we used the micro-macro approach to describe the orientation state of hydrogel macromolecules during the extrusion process, offering a two-scale description of fluid behavior. The goal of our study was to use the Fokker-Planck equation, which describes the evolution of probability distribution function over time, to represent the real state of the constituent population in the representative elementary volume within a hydrogel during extrusion-based 3D printing. Our data suggest that for a tubular nozzle syringe, constituent orientation is driven by a high shear rate, which overcomes the fluid rheological behavior. Also, the interaction coefficient, which represents the microscopic interaction between fluid particles overcomes hydrogel behavior for constituent orientation in the prediction model.</description>

      <title>Modelling and calibration of pair-rule protein patterns in Drosophila embryo: From Even-skipped and Fushi-tarazu to Wingless expression networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03036v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We modelled and calibrated the distributions of the seven-stripe patterns of Even-skipped (\textit{Eve}) and Fushi-tarazu (\textit{Ftz}) pair-rule proteins along the anteroposterior axis of the \textit{Drosphila} embryo, established during early development. We have identified the putative repressive combinations for five \textit{Eve} enhancers, and we have explored the relationship between \textit{Eve} and \textit{Ftz} for complementary patterns. The regulators of \textit{Eve} and \textit{Ftz} are stripe-specific DNA enhancers with embryo position-dependent activation rates and are regulated by the gap family of proteins. We achieved remarkable data matching of the \textit{Eve} stripe pattern, and the calibrated model reproduces gap gene mutation experiments. Extended work inferring the Wingless (\textit{Wg}) fourteen stripe pattern from \textit{Eve} and \textit{Ftz} enhancers have been proposed, clarifying the hierarchical structure of \textit{Drosphila}'s genetic expression network during early development.</description>
