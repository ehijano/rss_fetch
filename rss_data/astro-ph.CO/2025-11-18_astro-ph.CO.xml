      <title>Non-Parametric Reconstruction of the Hubble Parameter from the Fourth Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog and DESI Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The release of the fourth Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-4.0) by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration includes more than 200 compact binary coalescence (CBC) candidates that can be used to probe the cosmic expansion. The population of merging binary black holes has been used so far to provide a constraint on the Hubble constant and dark matter fraction under the hypothesis of a flat-$\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter Universe.
  In this work, we provide the first non-parametric constrain on the Hubble parameter from 137 dark sirens reported in GWTC-4.0. We employ the relation between detector and source frame masses for detected GW signals, to obtain a statistical redshift evaluation for the population of binary black holes (BBHs). We model the Hubble parameter as a non-parametric autoregressive process in terms of the scale factor, using splines. In addition, we introduce two novel features: the use of \textit{anchor} points for $H(z)$ derived from an external probe - here, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) - and a constraining power coefficient that quantifies where the inference is most data-driven by GW detections.
  We highlight three key findings: (i) using GWs alone, the Hubble parameter determination is the most GW-data-driven around redshift $z = 0.44$, yielding to $H(0.44) = 92.3_{-36.6}^{+29.9}\rm\, km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}$. Its value at $z = 0$, the Hubble constant, is therefore less constrained by the GW data. (ii) The Hubble parameter inferred from analyses assuming a flat-$\Lambda$CDM cosmological model is strongly affected by the cosmological model assumption. (iii) Introducing an anchor point for $H(z)$ enhances the inferred constraints and provides a clear visualization of the redshift range where GWs contribute most to the constraining power.</description>

      <title>Inflation without an Inflaton II: observational predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete computation of the scalar power spectrum in the \emph{inflation without inflaton} (IWI) framework, where the inflationary expansion is driven solely by a de~Sitter (dS) background and scalar fluctuations arise as second-order effects sourced by tensor perturbations. By explicitly deriving and numerically integrating the full second-order kernel of the Einstein equations, we obtain a scale-invariant scalar spectrum without invoking a fundamental scalar field. In this framework, the amplitude of the scalar fluctuations is directly linked to the scale of inflation. More precisely, we show that matching the observed level of scalar fluctuations, $\Delta_{\phi}^2(k_\ast)\approx 10^{-9}$ at Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) scales, fixes the inflationary energy scale $H_{\rm inf}$ as a function of the number of observed e-folds $N_{\rm obs}$. For $N_{\rm obs}\simeq 30 - 60$, we find $H_{\rm inf} \simeq 5\times 10^{13}\,\mathrm{GeV} - 2\times 10^{10}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, corresponding to a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \simeq 0.01 - 5\times 10^{-9}$. In particular, requiring consistency with instantaneous reheating, we predict a number of e-folds of order~$\mathcal{O}(50)$ and an inflationary scale $H_{\rm inf} \simeq 10^{11}\,\mathrm{GeV}$. We also incorporate in our framework the quantum break-time of the dS state and show that it imposes an upper bound on the number of particle species. Specifically, using laboratory constraints on the number of species limits the duration of inflation to $N_{\rm obs}\lesssim 126$ e-folds. These results establish the IWI scenario as a predictive and falsifiable alternative to standard inflaton-driven models, linking the observed amplitude of primordial fluctuations directly to the quantum nature and finite lifetime of dS space.</description>

      <title>SourceREACH (Source REconstruction of Arcs behind Cluster Halos): A New Source Reconstruction Algorithm Optimized for Giant Arcs and Galaxy Cluster Lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new algorithm designed for use with extended lensed images, specifically giant arcs lensed by galaxy clusters. These highly magnified images contain important information about both the mass distribution of the cluster and the properties of the background source, but modeling them requires significant computational effort. Our new source reconstruction methodology is designed to be accurate and efficient for high-resolution observations in which point spread function effects are not significant. The overall process deconvolves the observed image by the point spread function, de-lenses the image pixels, and uses interpolation or regression with smoothing to determine the model source. By working with de-lensed points, the method accounts for varying resolution across the source plane. We evaluate the speed and accuracy of different interpolation and regression methods using both mock data and real data for the giant arc in Abell 370. We find that utilizing K Nearest Neighbor Regression results in the best balance of noise smoothing and preservation of compact detail in the source.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave standard sirens from GWTC-3 combined with DESI DR2 and DESY5: A late-universe probe of the Hubble constant and dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the combination of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2) baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data and the Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements has shown a $\sim$3$\sigma$ preference for a dynamical dark energy model with a phantom-crossing behavior. However, such a phantom-crossing dark energy evolution further exacerbates the already severe Hubble tension in the $\Lambda$CDM model. Moreover, there exists a $\sim2\sigma$ tension between the DESI DR2 BAO and CMB datasets. Therefore, it is essential to measure the Hubble constant and dark-energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameters using only late-universe observations. In this work, we investigate a novel late-universe data combination: gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens, BAO, and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). This combination provides a fully distance-ladder- and CMB-independent determination of the Hubble constant and the dark-energy EoS. Using 47 GW standard sirens from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog, the DESI DR2 BAO data, and DESY5 SNe Ia data, in the $w_0w_a$CDM model, we obtain $H_0=74.8^{+6.3}_{-8.9}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.320^{+0.015}_{-0.012}$, $w_0=-0.775^{+0.072}_{-0.074}$, and $w_a=-0.80\pm0.47$, indicating a mild phantom-crossing behavior within the $1\sigma$ credible interval with an $H_0$ value consistent with the distance ladder measurements. Our analysis demonstrates the power of GW standard sirens in breaking parameter degeneracies, and this novel data combination provides joint constraints on the Hubble constant and the dark-energy EoS parameters.</description>

      <title>Clustering effects on the Dark Siren determination of $H_0$: A simulation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) offer an alternative way to measure the Hubble parameter. The optimal technique, the ``bright siren'' approach, requires the identification of an electromagnetic counterpart. However, a significant fraction of gravitational waves signals will not have counterparts. Such events can still constrain the Hubble parameter $H_0$ via statistical methods, exploiting galaxy information from the GWs sky localisation volume. In this work, we investigate the power of this method using high-resolution, cosmological simulations that include realistic clustering. We find that clustering leads to increased convergence of the $H_0$ posteriors, with clear recovery of the input value as early as $N_{\rm gw}=40$ events, compared to uniform catalogues, where the posterior remains largely unconstrained, even with $N_{\rm gw}=100$ events. In addition, we quantify the role of catalogue incompleteness. We show that catalogues with completeness levels as low as $f=25\%$ can be competitive with fully complete catalogues, confirming the impact of clustering. Completeness levels of $f=50\%$ perform statistically similar to complete catalogues with as few as $N_{\rm gw}=40$ events. This indicates the need to focus on improving gravitational waves detection capabilities, rather than obtaining more complete galaxy catalogues. Finally, we investigate additional properties of the method by taking into consideration physical weights, different observational errors, potential biases from the $H_0$ priors, a variety of detectors' horizon distances, and different methods of catalogue completion and statistical analysis.</description>

      <title>The first AKRA mass map reconstruction from HSC Y1 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak lensing mass-mapping from shear catalogs faces systematic challenges from survey masks and spatially varying noise. To overcome these issues and reconstruct unbiased convergence $\kappa$ maps, we have constructed the AKRA (Accurate Kappa Reconstruction Algorithm), a prior-free and maximum-likelihood based analytical method. It has been validated for mock shear catalogs with a variety of survey masks. In this work, we present the first real-data application of the AKRA on the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Year 1 (HSC Y1) data. We first validate AKRA using mock shear catalogs from the \texttt{Kun} simulation suite, with masks corresponding to the six HSC Y1 regions (\texttt{GAMA09H}, \texttt{GAMA15H}, \texttt{HECTOMAP}, \texttt{VVDS}, \texttt{WIDE12H}, and \texttt{XMMLSS}). The investigated statistics, including the lensing power spectrum, $\langle \kappa^2\rangle$, $\langle \kappa^3\rangle$, and the one-point probability distribution function of $\kappa$, are all unbiased. We then apply AKRA to the HSC Y1 shear catalog and provide reconstructed $\kappa$ maps ready for subsequent scientific analyses.</description>

      <title>The homogeneity scale in the Local Universe: model-independent estimate from S-PLUS DR4 blue galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model-independent estimate of the angular homogeneity scale in the Local Universe by analysing data from the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS). Two complementary estimators are employed: (i) a parametric approach fitting the power-law of the two-point angular correlation function, which yields the homogeneity scale $\theta_H = 9.01_{-3.61}^{+8.43}\;{\rm deg}$; and (ii) a non-parametric fractal correlation dimension method, computing $\mathcal{D}_2(\theta)$ directly from the correlation function, which results in $\theta_H = 6.28_{-4.43}^{+8.72}\;{\rm deg}$. From the mock catalogues generated with the GLASS algorithm, we find that the estimates from both methods are within $1 \sigma$ of the median values obtained by applying both methodologies to the mocks. The transition scale to homogeneity, according to the $\Lambda$CDM model, is defined for matter, i.e. $b = 1$. Measurements of this scale with observational data clearly depends on the cosmic tracer analysed, and a calibration is necessary. Our study with blue galaxies, with bias $b \simeq 1$, provides a suitable estimate for comparison. Indeed, the results obtained in both approaches are compared with the value expected in the $\Lambda$CDM model, obtaining a good concordance.</description>

      <title>The Chandra Strong Lens Sample: Measuring the Dynamical States and Relaxation Fraction of a Sample of 28 Strong Lensing Selected Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of our dynamical state proxy measurements performed on 28 strong lensing galaxy clusters from the Sloan Giant Arcs Survey (SGAS). Using Chandra ACIS-I/S X-ray data supplemented with HST WFC3 imaging, we measure four morphological parameters: the concentration parameter (c), asymmetry parameter (A), centroid shift (log(w)), and the X-ray-BCG centroid separation (D [kpc]). Our goals are to (A) provide a robust classification of the dynamical state of the clusters in this strong lensing selected sample to enable studies that test various problems in cluster astrophysics and observational cosmology; (B) identify correlations, biases, or disagreements between different measurement proxies and cluster properties; and (C) measure the relaxation fraction (the fraction of clusters classified as relaxed based on X-ray morphology) and compare it to relaxation fractions from cluster samples selected using other methods.
  We combine the four morphological parameters into a single metric, the combined parameter M, which effectively separates the cluster sample into four dynamical state categories: relaxed; moderately relaxed; moderately disturbed; and disturbed. We find no significant trend in a cluster's dynamical state with its size, and only a weak, statistically limited dependence on mass and redshift. Based on our classification system, we find that $43\%^{+9}_{-9}$ of the clusters are relaxed, which is consistent with relaxation fractions measured for other cluster samples selected on mass-observables. This implies a strong lensing selected sample of clusters is on average dynamically similar to clusters selected via different methods.</description>

      <title>Reheating and Inflationary dynamics driven by an inverse tangent potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the early universe inflation and the post-inflation reheating era employing an inverse tangent potential of the form $V=V_0 \cdot[tan^{-1}(\frac{\kappa \phi}{m_p})]^2$, where $\kappa$ is a free parameter of the potential and $m_p$ is the reduced Planck mass. We derive the slow roll parameters, the number of e-folds(N), the scalar spectral index $n_s$, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and the tensor spectral index $n_T$ for the inverse tangent potential. We examine the inflationary observables using the data of the Planck-2018 and recent ACT collaboration and obtain constraints on the potential parameter $\kappa$. We also employ a reheating analysis by invoking the conservation of entropy between today and the time when reheating starts. We obtain bounds on the reheating temperature $T_{re}$ and the number of e-folds of the reheating $N_{re}$ using the spectral-index $n_s$ constraints from Planck 2018 and the ACT results. We show that this inverse-tangent potential can act as an alternative to the standard inflationary potentials like Starobinsky which are excluded at $2\sigma$ level by the recent sixth data release (DR6) of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) collaboration.</description>

      <title>Topological Signatures of Heating and Dark Matter in the 21 cm Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the topology of the 21 cm forest carries cosmological information that is inaccessible to traditional amplitude- or correlation-based statistics. Applying topological data analysis to simulated spectra spanning a range of X-ray heating efficiencies and dark-matter free-streaming scales, we compute persistence diagrams and Betti-0 curves that describe the formation and merger hierarchy of absorption troughs. A small set of interpretable descriptors (trough-line density, lifetime variance, and lifetime skewness) respond in nearly orthogonal directions across the (f_X, m_WDM) parameter space, enabling a substantial reduction of the degeneracy between heating and dark-matter suppression. These topological signatures remain detectable under SKA1-Low-like thermal noise, demonstrating that topology provides a stable and non-Gaussian probe of small-scale physics during Cosmic Dawn.</description>

      <title>Probing the Nature of Dark Matter Self-Interactions Through Observations of Massive Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though the nature of dark matter remains elusive, two models have come to prominence with testable predictions: cold dark matter (CDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). While CDM remains the widely accepted model, SIDM was introduced to potentially help resolve the discrepancies between the predictions of the CDM model and observational data, in particular the predicted central density profiles. Previous work involving simulations of small numbers of Milky Way-mass galaxies shows that SIDM delays massive black hole mergers as compared to CDM when the host halo has a flattened central density profile. It is, however, unclear how well massive black hole observations are able to differentiate between CDM and SIDM. In this work, we use mock gravitational wave observations of massive black hole mergers from LISA, a space-based gravitational wave observatory set to launch in the 2030s, to test LISA's capability to indirectly probe dark matter physics. As a proof of concept, we show that LISA may be able to distinguish between CDM and SIDM with a short-range interaction and a constant cross section of 1 $\rm{cm^2~ g^{-1}}$ at the $\sim2\sigma$ level or greater, provided at least $\sim80$ massive black hole mergers are observed with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 10. Our exploratory work shows that LISA may provide a pathway to probe dark matter self-interactions, motivating future work with more realistic, currently-favored models and larger simulation suites.</description>

      <title>Foreground removal in HI 21 cm intensity mapping under frequency-dependent beam distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral hydrogen (HI) intensity mapping with single-dish experiments is a powerful approach for probing cosmology in the post-reionization epoch. However, the presence of bright foregrounds over four orders of magnitude stronger than the HI signal makes its extraction highly challenging. While all methods perform well when assuming a Gaussian beam degraded to the worst resolution, most of them degrade significantly in the presence of a more realistic beam model. In this work, we investigate the performance of SDecGMCA. This method extends DecGMCA to spherical data, combining sparse component separation with beam deconvolution. Our goal is to evaluate this method in comparison with established foreground removal techniques, assessing its ability to recover the cosmological HI signal from single-dish intensity mapping observations under varying beam conditions. We use simulated HI signal and foregrounds, covering the frequency ranges relevant to MeerKAT and SKA-Mid. The foreground removal techniques tested fall into two main categories: model-fitting methods (polynomial and parametric) and blind source separation methods (PCA, ICA, GMCA, and SDecGMCA). Their effectiveness is evaluated based on the recovery of the HI angular and frequency power spectra under progressively more realistic beam conditions. While all methods perform adequately under a uniform degraded beam, SDecGMCA remains robust when frequency-dependent beam distortions are introduced. In the oscillating beam case, SDecGMCA suppresses the spurious spectral peak at $k_\nu \sim 0.3$ and achieves $\lesssim 5\%$ accuracy at intermediate angular scales ($10 &lt; \ell &lt; 200$), outperforming other methods. Beam inversion, however, remains intrinsically unstable beyond $\ell \sim 200$, setting a practical limit on the method.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is a unique phase in cosmic history, marked by the ionization of neutral hydrogen by the first luminous sources. The global neutral hydrogen fraction (x_HI) is a key observable for probing this era. This paper presents a novel, statistically robust method to extract the evolution of x_HI from the challenging noise-dominated data from the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) Data Challenge 3b. Our approach is based on a key physical insight: the pixel value distribution in SKA intensity maps is a mixture of signals from ionized and neutral regions. We model this distribution as a superposition of two Gaussian components-one fixed at zero representing noise and ionized bubbles, and a second, offset Gaussian tracing the neutral hydrogen signal. We perform this decomposition on data grouped into three redshift bins. The double-Gaussian model provides an excellent fit to the pixel histogram data. The derived x_HI values show a clear decreasing trend across the three redshift bins, consistent with a progressing reionization process. And the results are consistent with the provided simulation data. This method offers a powerful, model-independent, and fully interpretable way for measuring x_HI from 21 cm data, demonstrating significant potential for application to future SKA observations.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Expansion Driven by Gravitational Particle Production: Toward a Complete Cosmological Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dark-energy-free cosmological model ($\Omega_{DE} \equiv 0$) based on gravitationally induced adiabatic particle creation is proposed. The thermodynamics of particle production yields an effective negative pressure that drives both primordial inflation and late-time cosmic acceleration. The model, characterized by four components and two free parameters ($\alpha$, $\beta$), reproduces a $\Lambda$CDM-like expansion for suitable $\alpha$, while $\beta$ introduces small but testable deviations from the cosmic concordance model. Constraints from type Ia Supernovae (Pantheon+SH0ES) and H(z) data indicate $\beta \simeq 0.13$, suggesting a mild departure from standard cosmology and possible relief of the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions. The resulting classical cosmology evolves smoothly between two extreme de Sitter phases, offering a singularity-free, unified scenario that beyond solving old cosmological puzzles opens a new perspective to handle the tensions plaguing the current cosmic concordance model.</description>

      <title>Learning Cosmology from Nearest Neighbour Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting cosmological parameters from galaxy/halo catalogues with sub-percent level accuracy is an important aspect of modern cosmology, especially in view of ongoing and upcoming surveys such as Euclid, DESI, and LSST. While traditional two-point statistics have been known to be suboptimal for this task, recently proposed k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) based summary statistics have demonstrated tighter constraining power. Building on the kNN statistics, we introduce a new field-level representation of discrete halo catalogues - NN distance maps. We employ this technique on the halo catalogues obtained from Quijote N-body simulation suites. By combining these maps with kNN-based summary statistics, we train a hybrid neural network to infer cosmological parameters, showing that the resulting constraints achieve state-of-the-art, if not the best, accuracy. In addition, our hybrid framework is 5-10 times more computationally efficient than some of the existing point-cloud-based ML methods.</description>

      <title>A model-independent assessment of the late-time dark energy density evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combined measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey (DESI), the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Type Ia Supernovae (SN Ia), have recently challenged the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm, indicating potential evidence for a dynamical dark energy component. These results are usually obtained in the context of the dark energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameterizations, generally implying in phantom-crossing at intermediate redshifts. However, a general mapping between these parameterizations that yields approximately the same background observables clouds the inference of the true nature of dark energy in the context of these parametric methods. In this work, we propose a model-independent reconstruction of the dark energy density, which is more directly constrained than its EoS, based on the Gaussian Process (GP) regression method with the use of DESI DR2 BAO data and the Pantheon+, Union3 and DESY5 SN Ia samples. In addition, we perform a statistical comparison between the energy densities of $\Lambda$, a non-phantom thawing quintessence-type dark energy, and the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameterization with the reconstructed function. We find that all models agree with the GP reconstruction at 95\% C.L., with the largest discrepancy coming from $\Lambda$CDM with DESY5 at low redshifts. Even in this case, our findings suggest that it may be premature to claim statistically significant evidence for evolving or phantom dark energy with current DESI and SN Ia measurements.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Dark Energy Constraint from Strongly Lensed AGN at LSST-Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly lensed Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) with an observable time delay can be used to constrain the expansion history of the Universe through time-delay cosmography (TDC). As the sample of time-delay lenses grows to statistical size, with $\mathcal{O}$(1000) lensed AGN forecast to be observed by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), there is an emerging opportunity to use TDC as an independent probe of dark energy. To take advantage of this statistical sample, we implement a scalable hierarchical inference tool which computes the cosmological likelihood for hundreds of strong lenses simultaneously. With this new technique, we investigate the cosmological constraining power from a simulation of the full LSST sample. We start from individual lenses, and emulate the full joint hierarchical TDC analysis, including image-based modeling, time-delay measurement, velocity dispersion measurement, and external convergence prediction. We fully account for the mass-sheet and mass-anisotropy degeneracies. We assume a sample of 800 lenses, with varying levels of follow-up fidelity based on existing campaigns. With our baseline assumptions, within a flexible $w_0w_a$CDM cosmology, we simultaneously forecast a $\sim$2.5% constraint on H0 and a dark energy figure of merit (DE FOM) of 6.7. We show that by expanding the sample from 50 lenses to include an additional 750 lenses with plausible LSST time-delay measurements, we improve the forecasted DE FOM by nearly a factor of 3, demonstrating the value of incorporating this portion of the sample. We also investigate different follow-up campaign strategies, and find significant improvements in the DE FOM with additional stellar kinematics measurements and higher-precision time-delay measurements. We also demonstrate how the redshift configuration of time-delay lenses impacts constraining power in $w_0w_a$CDM.</description>

      <title>Testing general relativity with amplitudes of subdominant gravitational-wave modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an improved subdominant-mode amplitude (SMA) test of general relativity (GR), which probes amplitude-level deviations in the higher-order modes of gravitational-wave (GW) signals from binary black hole mergers while keeping the dominant quadrupole mode fixed. Using a comprehensive parameter-estimation campaign, we benchmark the test against Gaussian noise fluctuations, waveform modeling systematics, and physical effects such as spin precession and orbital eccentricity. When applied to numerical-relativity simulations, the SMA test performs reliably for aligned-spin and mildly precessing systems but exhibits measurable biases for strongly precessing or eccentric binaries. Although designed to detect amplitude deviations, the test also responds coherently to phase perturbations, yielding apparent GR violations when applied to phase-modified waveforms. Applied to recent GW detections, we report the strongest constraint on the hexadecapolar (4,4) mode amplitude deviation, $\delta A_{44} = -0.30^{+1.16}_{-3.45}$, consistent with GR. With these results, this work establishes the SMA test as a robust and broadly sensitive framework for probing strong-field gravity and demonstrates a systematic approach for assessing the robustness of GW tests of GR.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Bimetric Cosmology: A Minimal Extension of {\Lambda}CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct and analyze a symmetric bimetric cosmological model connecting Anti-de Sitter (AdS) and de Sitter (dS) regimes through a coupled scalar field. Starting from a Lagrangian with Einstein-Hilbert terms for two FLRW metrics and an inter-metric potential, we derive modified Friedmann and Klein-Gordon equations governing their evolution. In the symmetric effective-fluid limit, the model reproduces the main phenomenology of the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with a small dynamical correction proportional to $(1+z)^{-3}$, and naturally satisfies local-gravity constraints through Vainshtein screening. This article outlines the theoretical structure and calibration of the model within a dual-geometry cosmological setting.</description>

      <title>Upper Bound on the Cosmic Baryon Chemical Potential from Lepton-Flavor Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the early Universe trajectory around the QCD transition in lepton-flavor-asymmetric cases with small total lepton asymmetry ($|\ell|\lesssim 10^{-2}$), while allowing large individual lepton asymmetries. For each temperature, we find an upper bound on the baryon chemical potential $\mu_{\mathrm B}(T)$: $\tau$--$\mu$ asymmetric cases exhibit a local maximum, whereas $\mu$--$e$ cases approach a limiting curve. Thus, even extreme lepton-flavor asymmetry alone cannot reach a first-order region, unless the critical point is moved to a substantially lower $\mu_\mathrm{B}/T$ because of the nonzero $\mu_\mathrm{Q}$. Therefore, we constrain the QCD-era relic to the standard scenario of a chiral crossover transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arguably one can use a canonical scalar field $\varphi$, minimally coupled to gravity, with quadratic potentials $V = \Lambda \pm \frac12 m^2\varphi^2$ to explore some general features of slow-roll and hilltop thawing quintessence, respectively. For each of these two potentials, and pressure-free matter, we introduce a regular unconstrained dynamical system on a compact state space, where the formulation for the hilltop case is new. Together with a derivation of monotonic functions in the two global state space settings, this enables us to obtain global results and to introduce figures that illustrate the global solution spaces of these models, in which we situate the observationally viable quintessence solutions.</description>

      <title>Chiral Magnetic Effect induced Spectator Process for Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional Leptogenesis mechanism, which provides compelling explanation to the origin of the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU), assumes the absence of hypermagnetic field in the early universe, thereby disregard the implications of hyper gauge field helicity, that have been thoroughly studied in the magnetogenesis mechanism. In this paper, we address impacts of a general U(1) gauge field on Leptogenesis by deriving equation of motions for the helicity and the energy density of a general magnetic field, to which the chiral magnetic effect (CME) is identified as essential, and studying their effects on the evolution chiral asymmetries. Notably, CME in the $U(1)_{\mathbf{L}_i-\mathbf{L}_j}$ framework, where $\mathbf{L}_{i,j}$ means specific lepton flavor, explicitly breaks the total lepton number and provides an efficient spectator process, that can wash out pre-existing lepton asymmetries. This establishes a natural connection to the wash-in Leptogenesis paradigm. We demonstrate that this spectator effect enables the generation of the BAU, eliminating the need for both an initial $\mathbf{B}-\mathbf{L}$ charge and primordial helicity.</description>

      <title>Sub-Solar Mass Intermediate Mass Ratio Inspirals: Waveform Systematics and Detection Prospects with Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the detectability and waveform systematics of sub-solar mass intermediate mass-ratio inspirals (SSM-IMRIs), characterized by mass ratios $q \sim 10^2-10^4$. Using the black hole perturbation theory surrogate model \textsc{BHPTNRSur1dq1e4} as a reference, we assess the performance of the \textsc{IMRPhenomX} phenomenological family in the high-mass-ratio regime. We find that the inclusion of higher-order gravitational wave modes is critical; their exclusion may degrade the signal-to-noise ratio by factors of $\sim3-5$ relative to quadrupole-only templates. With optimal mode inclusion, SSM-IMRIs are observable out to luminosity distances of $\sim575$ Mpc ($z\sim0.12$) with Advanced LIGO and $\sim10.5$ Gpc ($z\sim1.4$) with the Einstein Telescope. However, we identify substantial systematic uncertainties in current phenomenological approximants. Matches between \textsc{IMRPhenomX} and the reference surrogate model \textsc{BHPTNRSur1dq1e4} degrade to values as low as 0.2 for edge-on inclinations, and fitting factors consistently fall below 0.9, indicating a significant loss of effectualness in template-bank searches. Bayesian parameter estimation reveals that these modeling discrepancies induce systematic biases that exceed statistical errors by multiple standard deviations, underscoring the necessity for waveform models calibrated to perturbation theory in the intermediate mass-ratio regime for robust detection and inference.</description>

      <title>Bimodular Gravity: Unimodularising Bimetric Scalar-Tensor Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is the object of the present paper to unimodularise a disformal bimetric scalar-tensor theory, thereby defining what we call bimodular gravity. We impose one unimodular constraint per metric via multipliers $\lambda_{1,2}$ and show that two natural implementations-a dual fixed-determinant (BUG) and a dual diffeomorphism-invariant (BHT/BDUG) formulation-are classically inequivalent. In BUG the relative volume element $\nu=\sqrt{1-2BX}$ is fixed, enforcing a kinematic constraint on the biscalar and we derive the "bimodular cosmological constant" $\Lambda=\lambda_1+\nu\lambda_2$. In BHT/BDUG, $\lambda_{1,2}$ are individually constant but $\nu$ (hence $BX$) remains dynamical. Recasting the theory in an Einstein-frame form, we derive the biscalar sound speed and identify a subluminal domain $1+B(V+\lambda_2)&gt;0$. At the background level, BUG admits constant-roll solutions governed by first-order flow, whereas BHT supports solutions with time-dependent roll. These structural differences yield distinct, in-principle testable predictions for the expansion history, the dark-energy equation of state, and the propagation of biscalar perturbations. Finally, we present a diffeomorphism-invariant completion that correlates the two HT volume forms, reproducing the $\Lambda$ of BUG on shell whilst maintaining full covariance.</description>

      <title>The Scatter of the Many Outweighs the Scatter of the Few: Systematic Error Asymmetry in Steeply-Falling Mass Functions for High-Redshift JWST Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of massive, high redshift galaxies with JWST has been argued to challenge $\Lambda$CDM: such systems would require extremely rare halos and baryon-to-stellar-mass conversion efficiencies unphysically approaching--or exceeding--100%. If confirmed at galaxy formation forbidden efficiencies, these galaxies could signal new physics beyond standard cosmological structure formation. We develop a galaxy model framework that ties the linear power spectrum to the inferred efficiencies of galaxy growth in order to test the structure formation models. In addition, we incorporate multiple sources of error, including (i) observational sample variance, (ii) asymmetric scatter induced by the steepness of the high-mass halo tail, and (iii) systematic uncertainties in stellar mass estimates. We find that the inferred efficiency of star formation is dominated by systematic uncertainties on the spectral energy distribution inferred stellar mass of the JWST detected galaxies. The systematic uncertainty augments the asymmetry in scatter that largely brings the inferred efficiencies to be in line with that expected from early galaxy formation models. Our framework can be used to test $\Lambda$CDM as errors are reduced and further detections are made.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurements of the redshift drift -- the real time variation of the redshift of distance sources -- are expected in the next couple of decades using next generation facilities such as the ANDES spectrograph at the ELT and the SKAO survey. The unprecedented precision of such observations will demand precise theoretical and numerical modeling of the effect in the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In this work, we use the \texttt{Gadget4} $N$-body code to simulate the redshift drift and its fluctuations in $\Lambda$CDM cosmologies, deriving the corresponding power spectra from a simulation with $1024^3$ particles in a $1\textrm{Gpc}\,h^{-1}$ box. Our results represent an initial step toward deriving the redshift drift fluctuation power spectra from $N$-body simulations and establishing a methodology for the statistical analysis of the redshift drift effect using data from future large-scale surveys. However, further work is required to refine the approach and achieve an accurate modeling of the redshift drift fluctuation power spectra.</description>

      <title>The Velocity Field Olympics: Assessing velocity field reconstructions with direct distance tracers</title>

Abstract: The peculiar velocity field of the local Universe provides direct insights into its matter distribution and the underlying theory of gravity, and is essential in cosmological analyses for modelling deviations from the Hubble flow. Numerous methods have been developed to reconstruct the density and velocity fields at $z \lesssim 0.05$, typically constrained by redshift-space galaxy positions or by direct distance tracers such as the Tully-Fisher relation, the fundamental plane, or Type Ia supernovae. We introduce a validation framework to evaluate the accuracy of these reconstructions against catalogues of direct distance tracers. Our framework assesses the goodness-of-fit of each reconstruction using Bayesian evidence, residual redshift discrepancies, velocity scaling, and the need for external bulk flows. Applying this framework to a suite of reconstructions -- including those derived from the Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies (BORG) algorithm and from linear theory -- we find that the non-linear BORG reconstruction consistently outperforms others. We highlight the utility of such a comparative approach for supernova or gravitational wave cosmological studies, where selecting an optimal peculiar velocity model is essential. Additionally, we present calibrated bulk flow curves predicted by the reconstructions and perform a density--velocity cross-correlation using a linear theory reconstruction to constrain the growth factor, yielding $S_8 = 0.793 \pm 0.035$. The result is in good agreement with both weak lensing and Planck, but is in strong disagreement with some peculiar velocity studies.</description>

      <title>Complementary signatures of $\alpha-$attractor inflation in CMB and cosmic string Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When cosmic strings are formed during inflation, they regrow to reach a scaling regime, leaving distinct imprints on the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). Such signatures, associated with specific primordial features, can be detected by upcoming gravitational wave observatories, such as the LISA and Einstein Telescope (ET). Our analysis explores scenarios in which cosmic strings form either before or during inflation. We examine how the number of e-folds experienced by cosmic strings during inflation correlates with the predictions of inflationary models observable in cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements. This correlation provides a testable link between inflationary physics and the associated gravitational wave signals in a complementary manner. Focusing on $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation, with the Polynomial $\alpha$-attractor serving as an illustrative example, we find constraints, for instance, on the spectral index $n_s$ to $0.962 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.972$ for polynomial exponent $n=1$, $0.956 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.968$ for $n=2$, $0.954 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.965$ for $n=3$, and $0.963 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.964$ for $n=4$, which along with the GW signals from LISA, are capable of detecting local cosmic strings that have experienced $\sim 34 - 47$ e-folds of inflation consistent with current Planck data and are also testable in upcoming CMB experiments such as LiteBIRD and CMB-S4.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian estimator for peculiar velocity correction in cosmological inference from supernovae data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09258v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The peculiar motion of the host galaxies introduces bias in estimating cosmological parameters from supernova data. The coherent component of the peculiar motion is usually corrected for using velocity field reconstruction based on the observed galaxy distribution, while the random component is treated statistically by inflating the magnitude uncertainty in the quadrature derived using the standard error propagation. The method of velocity field reconstruction requires assuming an underlying cosmology, which can introduce its own bias in the final inference. On the other hand, the statistical treatment of the random component assumes a locally linear approximation for the magnitude-redshift relation and a Gaussian distribution for the peculiar velocities, which can have extended tails in the non-linear regime. In this work, we present a Bayesian estimator for simultaneously correcting for peculiar motion while fitting a cosmological model to the supernova data, relaxing the assumption of linearity of the model and Gaussianity of the random peculiar motion. Our approach is based on considering the problem of fitting the magnitude-redshift relation as a non-linear model with errors in both dependent and independent variables. To this end, we develop a general method for fitting such non-linear errors-in-variables models. We then specialize it to the case of fitting the magnitude-redshift relation, validating it with simulated datasets at the precision of current and upcoming surveys, and testing it on the Pantheon sample. Our method provides an alternative approach for accounting for the peculiar velocity effects, which is a complementary method for the coherent component, as it does not require independent velocity measurements, and generalizes the treatment of the random component. Moreover, our general method is applicable to various other problems in cosmology and astronomy.</description>

      <title>A possible correction of the Saha curve for non-equilibrium states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is widely known that the Saha equation is not suitable for describing plasmas out of thermodynamic equilibrium. The primordial hydrogen recombination plasma is an example of this. In this work, we propose a theoretical modification to the standard Saha curve motivated by Tsallis statistics. In particular, we explore the possibility that a time-dependent $q$-parameter may serve as an effective proxy for the evolving thermodynamic conditions during recombination, especially considering that hydrogen recombination occurs from excited states. Within this framework, the $q$-parameter could be interpreted as encoding departures from equilibrium and could play the role of effective time-dependent temperature. This indicates that the time evolution of the $q$-parameter could provide a phenomenological mechanism for incorporating non-equilibrium effects into the recombination history. Our findings suggest that the Tsallis parameterization provides an alternative path to fit the distribution of free electrons by using an effective temperature. The implications of this approach might go beyond its immediate applications, as the Saha equation is widely used in various scientific fields like astrophysics, cosmology, plasma physics, and condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Self-Interacting Dark-Matter Spikes and the Final-Parsec Problem: Bayesian constraints from the NANOGrav 15-Year Gravitational-Wave Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18153v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A self-interacting dark-matter (SIDM) density spike around merging supermassive black holes (SMBHs) may be able to supply the dynamical friction needed to shrink binaries from $\sim 1\, \mathrm{pc}$ to $\sim 10^{-2} \,\mathrm{pc}$, thereby resolving the long-standing ''final-parsec problem''. Embedding the binary-halo system in a cosmological population model, we evolve the inspiral under the combined influence of gravitational-wave (GW) emission and SIDM drag, compute the resulting nanohertz GW background, and confront it with the NANOGrav 15-year pulsar-timing data. A six-parameter Bayesian analysis, performed with a Gaussian-process-accelerated Markov chain Monte Carlo, yields posterior constraints on the cross-section per unit mass and maximum circular velocity values that were consistent with independent galaxy-rotation and cluster-lensing limits. Within this parameter space, the SIDM spike remains intact, supplies sufficient friction to overcome the stellar depletion barrier, and produces a characteristic-strain spectrum that matches the NANOGrav signal as well as phenomenological astrophysical models.</description>

      <title>The fate of Quasi-Exponential inflation in the light of ACT-DR6</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have revisited quasi-exponential model of inflation in the light of recent ACT-DR6 and Planck data along with latest constraint on the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves. For our analysis we have followed Mukhanov approach for inflationary equation-of-state employing Hamilton-Jacobi formulation. We find that the model is capable of mimicking latest Planck results by providing excellent fit to scalar spectral index and its running. Not only that, amount of primordial gravitational waves is also within the present observational bound, $r&lt;0.032$. In addition to that, when the combination of ACT-DR6 and Planck joint with BICEP/Keck 2018 data is taken into account inflationary predictions from quasi-exponential model are in excellent agreement. The model also yields sublime fit to the result of joint analysis of ACT-DR6, Planck joint with BICEP/Keck 2018 and DESI-Y1 data. The futuristic CMB missions LiteBIRD, Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 are promising to detect primordial gravitational waves if $r\geq0.003$. We have also forecasted inflationary predictions from quasi-exponential model of inflation assuming the sensitivities of LiteBIRD, Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 along with combination of LiteBIRD and CMB-S4. We found that in each case quasi-exponential inflation may render excellent fit provided $r\geq10^{-2}$. However, non-detection of primordial gravitational waves by LiteBIRD, Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 will potentially rule out quasi-exponential model.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing dark energy with model independent methods after DESI DR2 BAO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ two model-independent approaches, including redshift binning method and polynomial interpolation method, to reconstruct dark energy (DE) equation of state (EoS) $w(z)$ and DE density function $f(z)$. Our analysis incorporates data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) data release 2, Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distance priors from Planck 2018 and Atacama Cosmology Telescope data release 6, and three Type Ia supernovae (SN) compilations (PantheonPlus, Union3, and DESY5). To ensure model independence, we adopt three redshift binning schemes (n=3, 4, 5) and three polynomial interpolation schemes with the same number of nodes (n=3, 4, 5). Our main conclusions are as follows: 1) After taking into account DESI data, there is a trend that DE should evolve with redshift (with deviations from the cosmological constant reaching at least a $2.13\sigma$ confidence level), indicating that current observations favor a dynamical DE. 2) In the redshift range $0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.5$, the DE EoS w(z) exhibits a decreasing trend and crosses the phantom divide $w=-1$, suggesting quintom-like behavior. 3) The DE density f(z) first increases at low redshift, reaching a hump around $z\approx 0.5$, and then decreases at $0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.5$, with a rapid decrease at $z&gt;1.0$. 4) For $z &gt; 1.5$, current data are insufficient to place strong constraints on the evolution of DE, resulting in large uncertainties in the DE reconstruction. It must be emphasized that, these four main conclusions are independent of specific reconstruction models, and are insensitive to the choice of SN compilations.</description>

      <title>Ruling Out Dark Energy Model induced by de-Sitter Regions of Non-Singular Black Holes with Planck2018, DESI BAO, and Union3 Supernovae</title>

Abstract: Dark energy(DE) remains one of the most important subjects in modern cosmology, and its physical origin is still under intensive discussion. While an astrophysical origin of DE is a highly challenging scenario, black holes stand out the most promising candidates as the astrophysical origin. In this paper, we explore a new model of DE induced by black holes, in which cosmic accelerated expansion caused by de-Sitter like space-time regions around the non-singular black holes. It is difficult to examine such a phenomena by measuring black hole mass because the energy density of the cosmological constant is much smaller than the mass density of a black hole near a black hole. On the other hand, this modification becomes dominant on the cosmological scale. Therefore, we focus on the cosmological probes and perform the MCMC analysis using Planck2018+DESI DR2+Supernovae. Since the total amount of DE density depends on the contributions of all black holes, we use the simulated results for the evolution of the number of black holes. As a result, we obtain the best-fitted total chi-squared value, $\chi_\mathrm{total}^2 = 2871.13$ compared to $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ case $\chi_\mathrm{total, \, \Lambda CDM}^2 = 2819.00$, and $\Delta \chi^2 \sim 50$. We conclude that this $\Delta \chi^2$ is enough large to rule out this model, because the number of parameters is same between this model and $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare an autoencoder convolutional neural network (AE-CNN) with a conventional maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) for inferring cluster virial masses, $M_v$, directly from the galaxy distribution around clusters, without identifying members or interlopers. The AE-CNN is trained on mock galaxy catalogues, whereas the MLE assumes that clusters of similar mass share the same phase-space galaxy profile. Conceptually, the MLE returns an unbiased estimate of $\log M_v$ at fixed true mass, whereas the AE-CNN approximates the posterior mean, so the true $\log M_v$ is unbiased at fixed estimate. Using MDPL2 mock clusters with redshift space number density as input, the AE-CNN attains an rms scatter of $0.10\,\textrm{dex}$ between predicted and true $\log M_v$, compared with $0.16\,\textrm{dex}$ for the MLE. With inputs based on mean peculiar velocities, binned in redshift space or observed distance, the AE-CNN achieves scatters of $0.12\,\textrm{dex}$ and $0.16\,\textrm{dex}$, respectively, despite strong inhomogeneous Malmquist bias.</description>

      <title>The Dark Energy Camera All Data Everywhere cosmic shear project V: Constraints on cosmology and astrophysics from 270 million galaxies across 13,000 deg$^2$ of the sky</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present constraints on models of cosmology and astrophysics using cosmic shear data vectors from three datasets: the northern and southern Galactic cap of the Dark Energy Camera All Data Everywhere (DECADE) project, and the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3. These data vectors combined consist of 270 million galaxies spread across 13,000 ${\rm deg}^2$ of the sky. We first extract constraints for $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and find $S_8= 0.805^{+0.019}_{-0.019}$ and $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.262^{+0.023}_{-0.036}$, which is consistent within $1.9 \sigma$ of constraints from the Planck satellite. Extending our analysis to dynamical dark energy models shows that lensing provides some (but still minor) improvements to existing constraints from supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations. Finally, we study six different models for the impact of baryons on the matter power spectrum. We show the different models provide consistent constraints on baryon suppression, and associated cosmology, once the astrophysical priors are sufficiently wide. Current scale-cut approaches for mitigating baryon contamination result in a residual bias of $\approx 0.3\sigma$ in the $S_8, \Omega_{\rm m}$ posterior. Using all scales with dedicated baryon modeling leads to negligible improvement as the new information is used solely to self-calibrate the baryon model on small scales. Additional non-lensing datasets, and/or calibrations of the baryon model, will be required to access the full statistical power of the lensing measurements. The combined dataset in this work represents the largest lensing dataset to date (most galaxies, largest area) and provides an apt testing ground for analyses of upcoming datasets from Stage IV surveys. The DECADE shear catalogs, data vectors, and likelihoods are made publicly available.</description>

      <title>No evidence for local $H_0$ anisotropy from Tully--Fisher or supernova distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Claims of local ($z \lesssim 0.05$) anisotropy in the Hubble constant have been made based on direct distance tracers such as Tully-Fisher galaxies and Type Ia supernovae. We revisit these using the CosmicFlows-4 Tully-Fisher W1 subsample, 2MTF and SFI++ Tully-Fisher catalogues, and the Pantheon+ supernova compilation (all restricted to $z &lt; 0.05$), including a dipole in either the Tully-Fisher zero-point or the standardised supernova absolute magnitude. Our forward-modelling framework jointly calibrates the distance relation, marginalises over distances, and accounts for peculiar velocities using a linear-theory reconstruction. We compare the anisotropic and isotropic model using the Bayesian evidence. In the CosmicFlows-4 sample, we infer a zero-point dipole of amplitude $0.087 \pm 0.019$ mag, or $4.1\pm0.9$ per cent when expressed as a dipole in the Hubble parameter. This is consistent with previous estimates but at higher significance: model comparison yields odds of $877:1$ in favour of including the zero-point dipole. In Pantheon+ we infer zero-point dipole amplitude of $0.049 \pm 0.013$ mag, or $2.3\pm 0.6$ per cent when expressed as a dipole in the Hubble parameter. However, by allowing for a radially varying velocity dipole, we show that the anisotropic zero-point model captures local flow features (or possibly systematics) in the data rather than an actual linearly growing effective bulk flow caused by anisotropy in the zero-point or expansion rate. Crucially, inferring a more general bulk flow curve we find results fully consistent with expectations from the standard cosmological model.</description>

Abstract: We examine, from first principles, the angular power spectrum between the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (kSZ) and the reconstructed galaxy momentum - the basis of existing and future "kSZ stacking" analyses. We present a comprehensive evaluation of all terms contributing to this cross-correlation, including both the transverse and longitudinal modes of the density-weighted velocity field, as well as all irreducible correlators that contribute to the momentum power spectrum. This includes the dominant component, involving the convolution of the electron-galaxy and velocity-velocity power spectra, an additional disconnected cross-term, and a connected non-Gaussian trispectrum term. Using this framework, we examine the impact of other commonly neglected contributions, such as the two-halo component of the dominant term, and the impact of satellite galaxies. Finally, we assess the sensitivity of upcoming CMB experiments to these effects and determine that they will be sensitive to the cross-term, the connected non-Gaussian trispectrum term, the two-halo contribution and impact of satellite galaxies, at a significance level of $\sim 4-6 \sigma$. On the other hand, the contribution from longitudinal modes is negligible in all cases. These results identify the astrophysical observables that must be accurately modelled to obtain unbiased constraints on cosmology and astrophysics from near-future kSZ measurements.</description>

      <title>JWST lensed quasar dark matter survey IV: Stringent warm dark matter constraints from the joint reconstruction of extended lensed arcs and quasar flux ratios</title>

Abstract: We present a measurement of the free-streaming length of dark matter (DM) and subhalo abundance around 28 quadruple image strong lenses using observations from JWST MIRI presented in Paper III of this series. We improve on previous inferences on DM properties from lensed quasars by simultaneously reconstructing extended lensed arcs with image positions and relative magnifications (flux ratios). Our forward modeling framework generates full populations of subhalos, line-of-sight halos, and globular clusters, uses an accurate model for subhalo tidal evolution, and accounts for free-streaming effects on halo abundance and concentration. Modeling lensed arcs leads to more-precise model-predicted flux ratios, breaking covariance between subhalo abundance and the free-streaming scale parameterized by the half-mode mass $m_{\rm{hm}}$. Assuming subhalo abundance predicted by the semi-analytic model {\tt{galacticus}} ($N$-body simulations), we infer (Bayes factor of 10:1) $m_{\rm{hm}} &lt; 10^{7.4} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ ($m_{\rm{hm}} &lt; 10^{7.2} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), a 0.4 dex (0.3 dex) improvement relative to omitting lensed arcs. These bounds correspond to lower limits on thermal relic DM particle masses of $7.4$ and $8.4$ keV, respectively. Conversely, assuming DM is cold, we infer a projected mass in subhalos ($10^6 &lt; m/M_{\odot}&lt;10^{10.7}$) of $1.6_{-1.1}^{+2.4} \times 10^7 \ \mathrm{M}_{\odot} \ \rm{kpc^{-2}}$ at $95 \%$ confidence. This is consistent with {\tt{galacticus}} predictions ($0.6 \times 10^7 \mathrm{M}_{\odot} \ \rm{kpc^{-2}}$), but in mild tension with recent $N$-body simulations ($0.3 \times 10^7 \mathrm{M}_{\odot} \ \rm{kpc^{-2}}$). Our results are among the strongest bounds on WDM, and the most precise measurement of subhalo abundance around strong lenses. Further improvements will follow from the large sample of lenses to be discovered by Euclid, Rubin, and Roman.</description>

      <title>Probing Time-Dependent Physics with Phase-Folding CMB Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-resolved observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) offer a powerful probe of time-dependent cosmological signals, such as a stochastic gravitational wave background passing through Earth, which imprints a time-varying deflection on the CMB, and time-dependent cosmic birefringence, which induces an oscillating polarization rotation. However, analyses based on time-division CMB maps are fundamentally limited by the mapmaking cadence, restricting sensitivity to frequencies below $\sim 10^{-5}$ Hz. In this paper we develop a phase-folding mapmaking framework to enable targeted searches of such periodic cosmological signals with frequencies up to the detector sampling rate of $O(100)$ Hz. We demonstrate the power of this framework with two cosmological applications: (1) constraining a stochastic gravitational wave background via its time-dependent lensing signature, and (2) the search for an oscillating polarization rotation from axion-like particles. We show that this technique transforms CMB experiments into broadband probes of the oscillating sky, extending their constraining power from the microhertz regime up to $O(100)$ Hz-an expansion of over seven orders of magnitude in frequency. This provides a new observational window, complementary to other approaches by probing under-explored frequency ranges for gravitational waves and axion-like particles.</description>

      <title>A new multiprobe analysis of modified gravity and evolving dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $(w_0, \, w_a)$ parametrization of the dark energy (DE) equation of state, with and without the effective field theory of dark energy (EFTofDE) framework to describe the DE perturbations, parametrized here by the braiding parameter $\alpha_B$ and the running of the Planck mass $\alpha_M$. We combine the EFTofLSS full-shape analysis of the power spectrum and bispectrum of BOSS data with the tomographic angular power spectra $C_\ell^{gg}$, $C_\ell^{\kappa g}$, $C_\ell^{Tg}$ and $C_\ell^{T\kappa}$, where $g$, $\kappa$ and $T$ stand for the DESI luminous red galaxy map, Planck PR4 lensing map and Planck PR4 temperature map, respectively. To analyze these angular power spectra, we go beyond the Limber approximation, allowing us to include large-scales data in $C_\ell^{gg}$. The combination of all these probes with Planck PR4, DESI DR2 BAO and DES Y5 improves the constraint on the 2D posterior distribution of $\{w_0, \, w_a\}$ by $\sim 50 \%$ and increases the preference for evolving dark energy over $\Lambda$ from $3.8 \sigma$ to $4.6 \sigma$. When we remove BAO and supernovae data, we obtain a hint for evolving dark energy at $2.3 \sigma$. Regarding the EFTofDE parameters, we improve the constraints on $\alpha_B$ and $\alpha_M$ by $\sim 40 \%$ and $50 \%$ respectively, finding results compatible with general relativity at $\sim 2 \sigma$. We show that these constraints do not depend on the choice of the BAO and supernovae likelihoods.</description>

      <title>The need for a nonlocal expansion in general relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11990v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by known facts about effective field theory and non-Abelian gauge theory, we argue that the post-Newtonian approximation might fail even in the limit of weak fields and small velocities for wide-extended rotating bodies, where angular momentum spans significant spacetime curvature. We construct a novel dimensionless quantity that samples this breakdown, and we evaluate it by means of existing analytical solutions of rotating extended bodies and observational data. We give estimates for galaxies and binary systems, as well as our home in the Cosmos, Laniakea. We thus propose that a novel effective field theory of general relativity might be needed to account for the onset of nonlocal angular momentum effects.</description>

      <title>Complementarity between Cosmic String Gravitational Waves and long-lived particle searches in a laboratory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic strings are powerful witnesses to cosmic events including any period of early matter domination. If such a period of matter domination was catalysed by metastable, long-lived particles, then there will be complementary signals to ascertain the nature of dark sector in experiments detecting primordial features in the gravitational wave (GW) power spectrum and laboratory searches for long-lived particles. We give explicit examples of global and local U(1) gauge extended dark sectors to demonstrate such a complementarity as the union of the two experiments reveals more information about the dark sector than either experiment. Demanding that Higgs-portal long-lived scalar be looked for, in various experiments such as DUNE, FASER, FASER-II, MATHUSLA, SHiP, we identify the parameter space which leads to complementary observables for GW detectors such as LISA and ET.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the $z\sim6-13$ intergalactic medium from JWST spectroscopy of Lyman-alpha damping wings in galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: JWST provides a unique dataset to study reionization's earliest stages, promising insights into the first galaxies. Many JWST/NIRSpec prism spectra reveal smooth Lyman-alpha breaks in z&gt;5 galaxies, implying damping wing scattering by neutral hydrogen. We investigate what current prism spectra imply about the intergalactic medium (IGM), and how best to use NIRSpec spectra to recover IGM properties. We use a sample of 99 z~5.5-13 galaxies with high S/N prism spectra in the public archive, including 12 at z&gt;10. We analyse these spectra using damping wing sightlines from inhomogeneous reionizing IGM simulations, mapping between the distance of a source from neutral IGM and the mean IGM neutral fraction. We marginalise over absorption by local HI around galaxies, and Lyman-alpha emission. We observe a decline in the median and variance of flux around the Lyman-alpha break with increasing redshift, consistent with an increasingly neutral IGM, as ionized regions become smaller and rarer. At $z\gtrsim9$ the spectra become consistent with an almost fully neutral IGM. We find S/N&gt;15 per pixel is required to robustly estimate IGM properties from prism spectra. We fit a sub-sample of high S/N spectra and infer mean neutral fractions $\overline{x}_\mathrm{HI}=0.33^{+0.18}_{-0.27}, 0.64^{+0.17}_{-0.23}$ ($&gt;0.70$ excluding GNz11) at $z \approx 6.5, 9.3$. We also investigate local HI absorption, finding median column density $\log_{10}N_\mathrm{HI}\approx10^{20.8}$ cm$^{-2}$, comparable to $z\sim3$ Lyman-break galaxies, with no significant redshift evolution. We find galaxies showing the strongest absorption are more likely to be in close associations (&lt;500 pkpc), implying enhanced absorption in massive dark matter halos. Future deep prism and grating spectroscopy of z&gt;9 sources will provide tighter constraints on the earliest stages of reionization, key for understanding the onset of star formation.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Solution to the Eta Problem in Spectator Field Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of spectator field models that addresses the eta problem while providing a natural explanation for the observed slight deviation of the spectrum of curvature perturbations from scale-invariance. In particular, we analyze the effects of quantum corrections on the quadratic potential of the spectator field given by its gravitational coupling to the Ricci scalar and the inflaton energy, so-called the Hubble-induced mass term. These quantum corrections create a minimum around which the potential is flatter and to which the spectator field is attracted. We demonstrate that this attractor dynamics can naturally generate the observed slightly red-tilted spectrum of curvature perturbations. Furthermore, focusing on a curvaton model with a quadratic vacuum potential, we compute the primordial non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{\text{NL}}$ and derive a predictive relationship between $f_{\text{NL}}$ and the running of the scalar spectral index. This relationship serves as a testable signature of the model. Finally, we extend the idea to a broader class of models where the spectator field is an angular component of a complex scalar field.</description>

      <title>Non-interacting holographic dark energy with Torsion via Hubble Radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reconstruct a holographic dark energy model within a Friedmann cosmology incorporating torsion scalar, assuming no interaction between dark energy and dark matter. Setting the Hubble radius as an infrared (IR) cut-off, we focus on a system dominated by contribution of a time-dependent torsion scalar induced by the spin of matter. In this regime, our results show that even very weak torsion causes cosmic acceleration. Specifically, we find that minima of the current equation of state for holographic dark energy, $(\omega_X^{0})_{min}$, lies in the range $-1 &lt; (\omega_X^{0})_{min} &lt; -0.778$ as a free parameter $d$ varies from $1$ to $0.654$. Focusing on the free parameter $d \approx 1$, we find that $(\omega_X^{0})_{min}$ exhibits slightly different behavior from the cosmological constant. Introducing torsion allows the Hubble radius to serve as a viable IR cut-off even without assuming the interaction between them. Moreover, this approach provides a non-interacting limit not found in earlier interacting models that use the Hubble radius as the IR cut-off.</description>

Abstract: Palatini $F(R,X)$ gravity, with $X$ the inflaton kinetic term, proved to be a powerful framework for generating asymptotically flat inflaton potentials. Here we show that a quadratic Palatini $F(R,X)$ restores compatibility with the observational data of the Peebles-Vilenkin quintessential inflation model. Moreover, the same can be achieved with an exponential version of the Peebles-Vilenkin potential if embedded in a Palatini $F(R,X)$ of order higher than two.</description>

Abstract: Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) presents a significant challenge for carrying out precision measurements in radio astronomy. In particular, RFI can be a showstopper when looking for faint cosmological signals such as the red-shifted 21-cm line from cosmic dawn (CD) and epoch of reionization (EoR). As wireless communications, satellite transmissions, and other RF technologies proliferate globally, understanding the RFI landscape has become essential for site selection and data integrity. We present findings from RFI surveys conducted at four distinct locations: three locations in India, the Gauribidanur Radio Observatory in Karnataka, Twin Lakes in Ladakh, Kalpong Dam in the Andaman Islands, and the Gruvebadet Atmosphere Laboratory in Ny-{\AA}lesund, Svalbard, Norway. These sites, selected based on their geographical diversity and varying levels of human activity, were studied to assess RFI presence in 30-300 MHz bands, critical for low-frequency observations and experiments targeting the 21-cm CD/EoR signal. Using an automated RFI detection approach via the Hampel filter and singular value decomposition, the surveys identified both persistent and transient interference, which varies with location and time. The results provide a comprehensive view of the RFI environment at each site, informing the feasibility of long-term cosmological observations and aiding in the mitigation of RFI in radio astronomical data. The methods developed to characterize RFI can be easily generalized to any location and experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenology of a model in which the proton is rendered absolutely stable by an IR mechanism that remains robust against unknown quantum gravity effects. A linear combination of baryon number and lepton flavors is gauged and spontaneously broken to a residual $\mathbb{Z}_9$ discrete gauge symmetry enforcing a strict selection rule: $\Delta B = 0\,(\mathrm{mod}\,3)$. Despite its minimal field content, the model successfully accounts for established empirical evidence of physics beyond the SM. High-scale symmetry breaking simultaneously provides a seesaw mechanism explaining the smallness of neutrino masses, minimal thermal leptogenesis, and a viable phenomenology of the majoron as dark matter. Any cosmic string-wall network remaining after inflation is unstable for numerous charge assignments. Lepton flavor non-universality, central to the construction, leads to predictive neutrino textures testable via oscillation experiments, neutrinoless double beta decay, and cosmology. The model motivates searches in $X$- and $\gamma$-ray lines, neutrino telescopes, and predicts CMB imprints.</description>

Abstract: We present strong evidence for dynamical dark energy that challenges the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Several dark energy scenarios are explored, including $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, logarithmic, exponential, JBP, and BA parameterizations, along with non-flat cosmologies allowing for spatial curvature ($\Omega_k \neq 0$). Our analysis supports a flat Universe with $\Omega_k \approx 0$. Using MCMC techniques, we constrain these models with observational data from DESI~DR2 baryon acoustic oscillations, Type~Ia supernovae, and compressed CMB likelihoods. The results provide strong statistical evidence that $\omega \neq -1$, favoring dynamical dark-energy behavior consistent with a Quintom-B scenario ($\omega_0 &gt; -1$, $\omega_a &lt; 0$, and $\omega_0 + \omega_a &lt; -1$). We also derive upper bounds on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu$, using CMB + DESI~DR2 data: $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.066~\mathrm{eV}$ for $\Lambda$CDM and $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.075~\mathrm{eV}$ for $\omega$CDM. In the non-flat extensions, o$\Lambda$CDM and o$\omega$CDM, the limits relax to $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.263~\mathrm{eV}$ and $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.520~\mathrm{eV}$, respectively. For the other models $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, logarithmic, exponential, JBP, BA, and GEDE the constraints range between $&lt;0.043$ and $&lt;0.127~\mathrm{eV}$. The effective number of relativistic species remains consistent with the standard value, $N_{\mathrm{eff}} = 3.044$, across all models. Bayesian evidence further shows that combining DES-SN5Y or Union3 supernova samples with CMB + DESI~DR2 produces measurable deviations from $\Lambda$CDM. Although no model reaches the $5\sigma$ significance threshold, several exhibit tensions exceeding $3\sigma$, suggesting emerging cracks in the cosmological constant paradigm.</description>

      <title>Importance of being nonminimally coupled: Scalar Hawking radiation from regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12257v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In curved space-time, a scalar field $\phi$ is generically expected to couple to curvature, via a coupling of the form $\xi\phi^2R$. Yet in the study of Hawking emission from regular black holes (RBHs), where scalar fields are often introduced as simple probes of the geometry, and the Ricci scalar is generically non-zero, this non-minimal coupling is almost always ignored. We revisit this assumption by studying scalar Hawking emission from four representative RBHs (the Bardeen, Hayward, Simpson-Visser, and D'Ambrosio-Rovelli space-times), within two benchmark cases: the conformal case $\xi=1/6$, and a large negative value $\xi=-10^4$ motivated by Higgs inflation. We compute the graybody factors and emission spectra, showing that the latter can be either enhanced or suppressed, even by several orders of magnitude. A crucial role is played by the sign of the term $\xi fR$, with $f(r)=-g_{tt}$ in Schwarzschild-like coordinates, as it determines whether the non-minimal coupling suppresses or enhances the geometric potential barrier. For the D'Ambrosio-Rovelli case with large negative $\xi$, the low-energy emission spectrum is enhanced by up to five orders of magnitude, since $\xi fR&lt;0$ throughout the space-time, leading to a deep potential well which broadens the transmissive window. The deviations we find can be particularly relevant in the case where primordial RBHs are dark matter candidates, given the impact of the non-minimal coupling on their evaporation history.</description>

      <title>Conserved Quantities in Expanding G\"odel Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00238v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At linear order we study perturbations to a G\"odel background spacetime which includes expansion in addition to rotation. We investigate the transformation behaviour of these perturbations under gauge transformations and construct gauge invariant quantities. Using the perturbed energy conservation equation we find that there are conserved quantities in Expanding G\"odel (EG) Cosmology, in particular a spatial metric trace perturbation, {\zeta} SMTP , which is conserved on large scales for pressureless dust. We finally extend our discussion to a perfect fluid matter content to also obtain conserved quantities in this context.</description>

      <title>Ginnungagap -- a massively parallel cosmological initial conditions generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ginnungagap is a fully parallel (MPI+OpenMP) code designed to generate cosmological initial conditions for simulations involving very large numbers of particles. It operates in several modes, including the creation of initial conditions with either uniform or spatially varying resolution (for "zoom-in" simulations). The initial conditions can be fully random or derived by extending the resolution of existing ones while preserving the large-scale structures. Ginnungagap is open source and modular, consisting of a collection of independent tools that can be used for a variety of tasks. In this paper, we describe the main features of Ginnungagap and present test results for different types of simulations prepared with it.</description>
