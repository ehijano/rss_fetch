      <title>Assessment of the Earth orientation parameter accuracy from concurrent VLBI observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have assessed accuracy of estimates of Earth orientation parameters (EOP) determined from several very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observing programs that ran concurrently at different networks. We consider that the root mean square of differences in EOP estimates derived from concurrent observations is a reliable measure of accuracy. We confirmed that formal errors based on the assumption that the noise in observables is uncorrelated are close to useless. We found no evidence that advanced scheduling strategies with special considerations regarding the ability to better solve for atmospheric path in zenith direction applied for 1-hr single-baseline sessions have any measurable impact on the accuracy of EOP estimates. From this, we conclude that there is a certain limit in our ability to solve for the atmospheric path delay using microwave observations themselves and a scheduling strategy is not the factor that impairs accuracy of EOP determination. We determined that EOP errors vary with season, being smaller in winter and greater in summer. We found that the EOP errors are scaled with an increase in duration of an observing session as a broken power law with the power of -0.3 at durations longer than 2-4 hours, which we explain as manifestation of the presence of correlations in the atmospheric noise.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the influence of fault geometry via mesh morphing with applications to earthquake dynamic rupture and thermal models of subduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subsurface geometries are often poorly constrained, yet they exert first-order control on key geophysical processes, including subduction zone thermal structure and earthquake rupture dynamics. Quantifying model sensitivity to geometric variability remains challenging due to the manual effort of mesh generation and the computational cost of exploring high-dimensional parameter spaces in high-fidelity simulations. We present a mesh morphing approach that deforms a reference mesh into geometrically varying configurations while preserving mesh connectivity. This enables the automated generation of large ensembles of geometrically variable meshes with minimal user input. Importantly, the preserved connectivity allows for the application of data-driven, non-intrusive reduced-order models (ROMs) to perform robust sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate mesh morphing in two geophysical applications: (i) 3D dynamic rupture simulations with fault dip angles varying across a 40{\deg} range, and (ii) 2D thermal models of subduction zones incorporating realistic slab interface curvature and depth uncertainties informed by the Slab2 geometry dataset. In both cases, morphed meshes retain high quality and lead to accurate simulation results that closely match those obtained using exactly generated meshes. For the dynamic rupture case, we further construct ROMs that efficiently predict surface displacement and velocity time series as functions of fault geometry, achieving speedups of up to $10^9 \times$ relative to full simulations. Our results show that mesh morphing can be a powerful and generalizable tool for incorporating geometric uncertainty into physics-based modeling. The method supports efficient ensemble modeling for rigorous sensitivity studies applicable across a range of problems in computational geophysics.</description>

      <title>Impact of gas/liquid phase change of CO$_2$ during injection for sequestration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CO$_2$ sequestration in deep saline formations is an effective and important process to control the rapid rise in CO$_2$ emissions. The process of injecting CO$_2$ requires reliable predictions of the stress in the formation and the fluid pressure distributions -- particularly since monitoring of the CO$_2$ migration is difficult -- to mitigate leakage, prevent induced seismicity, and analyze wellbore stability. A key aspect of CO$_2$ is the gas-liquid phase transition at the temperatures and pressures of relevance to leakage and sequestration, which has been recognized as being critical for accurate predictions but has been challenging to model without \textit{ad hoc} empiricisms.
  This paper presents a robust multiphase thermodynamics-based poromechanics model to capture the complex phase transition behavior of CO$_2$ and predict the stress and pressure distribution under super- and sub- critical conditions during the injection process. A finite element implementation of the model is applied to analyze the behavior of a multiphase porous system with CO$_2$ as it displaces the fluid brine phase. We find that if CO$_2$ undergoes a phase transition in the geologic reservoir, the spatial variation of the density is significantly affected, and the migration mobility of CO$_2$ decreases in the reservoir. A key feature of our approach is that we do not \textit{a priori} assume the location of the CO$_2$ gas/liquid interface -- or even if it occurs at all -- but rather, this is a prediction of the model, along with the spatial variation of the phase of CO$_2$ and the change of the saturation profile due to the phase change.</description>

      <title>An equation of motion for unsteady frictional slip pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frictional sliding, e.g., earthquakes along geological faults, are mediated either by frictional crack-like ruptures, where interfacial (fault) slip is accumulated during the entire sliding event, or by frictional pulse-like ruptures, featuring a finite length over which slip is accumulated. Our basic understanding of slip pulses, which are believed to dominate most crustal earthquakes, is still incomplete. Here, building on recent progress, we present an analytic equation of motion for rate-and-state frictional slip pulses, which are intrinsically unstable spatiotemporal objects, in terms of a single degree of freedom. The predictions of the equation are supported by large-scale simulations of growing pulses and reveal the origin of the slow development of their instability, which explains the dynamic relevance of pulses in a broad range of natural and manmade frictional systems.</description>

      <title>A new 1D $V_p$ and $V_s$ velocity model of the western Rift of Corinth, Greece, using a fully non-linear tomography algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this study is to propose a new updated accurate 1-D $V_p$ and $V_s$ velocity model of the western Rift of Corinth for precise absolute earthquake locations. The methodology used to obtain this new model associates two fully non-linear algorithms, a complete exploration of the $V_p$ and $V_s$ model space combined with a grid search method for earthquake locations to minimize the P and S arrival time residuals. We calculated the misfit function for approximately 2.10 6 velocity models. For the best model (minimum misfit) we observed a global decrease of 30 % for both the P and S residuals with respect to the commonly used velocity model. The main features of this new model compared to other studies is a significant decrease of $V_p$ and $V_s$ velocities from surface down to a depth of approximately 3 km and a variable $V_p/V_s$ ratio decreasing from 1.86 at the surface to 1.78 at a depth of 8 km. The major influence on the locations of events is a global decrease of focal depths that range from a few hundred metres for deep events to more than one kilometre for shallow earthquakes.</description>

      <title>Frequency Differences between Clocks on the Earth and the Moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on general relativity, clock comparisons enable the determination of the gravity potential relative to a stable reference. Lunar surface clocks, owing to the Moon's low-noise conditions, high orbital stability, and broad Earth visibility, are promising reference clocks for global-scale comparisons between terrestrial clocks. Meanwhile, the need for an independent lunar time system-driven by future lunar navigation-requires maintaining links to terrestrial standards. This Letter simulates fractional frequency differences between Earth (E) and Moon (L) clocks by modeling three key time transformations: proper-to-coordinate time for E-clocks and for L-clocks (both linked to the local gravity potential), and the coordinate time relation between Earth and Moon. Signal propagation effects are not addressed. Gravity potential differences impact observations at the 10^-10 level, and the coordinate time ratio at 10^-11. Contributions from static, tidal, and non-tidal potentials, body self-rotation, and different celestial bodies are evaluated.</description>

      <title>Unifying the Gutenberg-Richter Law with Probabilistic Catalog Completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a probabilistic approach to modeling catalog incompleteness through four candidate augmented Gutenberg-Richter (GR) laws, which incorporates incompleteness into the frequency-magnitude distribution (FMD) using two parameters, mc, the transition magnitude, and {\sigma}c, which defines the transition range from incompleteness to completeness. The four GR models are tested on synthetic and empirical catalogs, using multiple performance evaluation metrics. The GR-AEReLU model, which allows for an asymmetry in the convergence to the pure linear GR law for m &gt; mc relative to the censorship of earthquakes of sizes smaller than mc, is found to consistently outperform, providing more robust estimates of seismological parameters (e.g., b-value) that better reflect realistic physical conditions and observational characteristics. This augmented framework offers three main advantages: (1) unified modeling of incompleteness into the FMD, (2) parameters with clear physical and statistical meaning, and (3) the ability to capture nonlinear and asymmetric detection behaviors. Finally, our analysis reveals systematic regional variations in earthquake b-values that deviate significantly from the assumed universal value of 1.0, challenging a fundamental paradigm in seismology and demonstrating the need for region-specific values that reflect local tectonic conditions in seismic hazard assessments.</description>

      <title>BLADE: An Automated Framework for Classifying Light Curves from the Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) Fireball Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fireballs (bolides) are high-energy luminous phenomena produced when meteoroids and small asteroids enter Earth's atmosphere at hypersonic speeds, often resulting in fragmentation or complete disintegration accompanied by significant energy release. The resulting bolide light curves capture temporal brightness variations as these objects traverse increasingly dense atmospheric layers, providing essential information on meteoroid entry dynamics, fragmentation behavior, and atmospheric energy deposition processes. The Center for Near-Earth Object Studies' (CNEOS) continuously expanding fireball database offers a globally comprehensive archive of bolide events, including light curves and associated metadata. Events associated with infrasound detections allow direct correlations between acoustic signatures and light-curve features, therefore enabling detailed analyses of fragmentation dynamics and energy deposition. Here, we introduce BLADE (Bolide Light-curve Analysis and Discrimination Explorer), a robust and high-fidelity framework specifically designed to analyze bolide light curves for objects detected from space. BLADE incorporates a processing pipeline integrating Savitzky-Golay filtering, prominence-based peak detection, and gradient analysis, enabling systematic identification and classification of fragmentation events and their associated energy release characteristics. Preliminary results demonstrate that BLADE reliably distinguishes distinct bolide behaviors, providing an objective, scalable methodology for characterization and analysis of large bolide light curve datasets. This foundational work establishes a novel pathway for advanced bolide research, with promising applications in planetary defense and global atmospheric monitoring.</description>

      <title>Dense 3D Displacement Estimation for Landslide Monitoring via Fusion of TLS Point Clouds and Embedded RGB Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Landslide monitoring is essential for understanding geohazards and mitigating associated risks. However, existing point cloud-based methods typically rely on either geometric or radiometric information and often yield sparse or non-3D displacement estimates. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical partition-based coarse-to-fine approach that fuses 3D point clouds and co-registered RGB images to estimate dense 3D displacement vector fields. We construct patch-level matches using both 3D geometry and 2D image features. These matches are refined via geometric consistency checks, followed by rigid transformation estimation per match. Experimental results on two real-world landslide datasets demonstrate that our method produces 3D displacement estimates with high spatial coverage (79% and 97%) and high accuracy. Deviations in displacement magnitude with respect to external measurements (total station or GNSS observations) are 0.15 m and 0.25 m on the two datasets, respectively, and only 0.07 m and 0.20 m compared to manually derived references. These values are below the average scan resolutions (0.08 m and 0.30 m). Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method F2S3 in spatial coverage while maintaining comparable accuracy. Our approach offers a practical and adaptable solution for TLS-based landslide monitoring and is extensible to other types of point clouds and monitoring tasks. Our example data and source code are publicly available at https://github.com/zhaoyiww/fusion4landslide.</description>

      <title>Supershear-subshear-supershear rupture sequence during the 2025 Mandalay Earthquake in Myanmar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the rupture dynamics of the Mw 7.7 Mandalay earthquake in Myanmar on March 28, 2025. The earthquake involved a near-vertical strike-slip rupture exceeding 400 km, with shallow slip up to 6 m. A previous inversion result revealed that the rupture initially propagated at supershear velocities ($\sim$6 km/s) near the hypocenter. A unique video recording of surface rupture, captured 124 km south of the epicenter, indicates a deceleration to subshear speeds ($\sim$3 km/s) before reaching the camera location. This deceleration is supported by observed fault-normal acceleration patterns. Satellite imagery also indicated a local minimum in slip (2--3 m) around 50 km south of the epicenter, suggesting a region of reduced stress drop, which likely caused the temporary deceleration. Beyond this point, the rupture appears to have re-established supershear propagation.</description>
