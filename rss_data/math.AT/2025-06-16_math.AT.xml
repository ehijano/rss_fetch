      <title>An isometry theorem induced by the Radon transform between the convolution and interleaving distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-parameter persistence modules are applied to various subjects as tools in data analysis. On the other hand, since the theoretical study of multi-parameter persistence modules is not enough and in progress, they have few applications. The sheaf theory is expected to elucidate detailed properties of persistence modules and give features of multi-parameter ones for applications. However, the categories of sheaves on two or more dimensional Euclidean spaces have more complicated structures than those on R. The Radon transform for sheaves is a useful dimension reduction technique and induces a categorical equivalence between the localized bounded derived categories of sheaves. We show We develop the convolution and the interleaving distances on these localized categories by improving original distances on the derived categories of sheaves. The convolution bifunctor defines these distances. We show that the Radon transform changes multi-directional movements given by the convolution bifunctor to one-directional movements and induce an isometry theorem between these distances.</description>

      <title>Trinitary algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A {\em trinitary algebra} is any subalgebra of the space of smooth functions $f: M \to {\mathbb R}$ that is distinguished in this space by finitely many linear conditions of the form $f(x_i) = f(\tilde x_i) = f(\hat x_i)$, where $x_i, \tilde x_i,$ and $ \hat x_i $ are distinct points in $ M$, $i=1, \dots, k$, or is approximated by such subalgebras. These algebras naturally arise in the study of discriminant varieties, i.e., the spaces of singular geometric objects, in theories where the property of being singular is formulated in terms of simultaneous behavior at three distinct points. Trinitary algebras are analogs of {\em equilevel algebras} of \cite{EA} which are defined by collections of conditions $f(x_i)=f(\tilde x_i)$ and play the same role in the study of discriminants defined by binary singularities. We describe the cell structures of the varieties of all equilevel algebras up to the codimension four in $C^\infty(S^1, {\mathbb R})$ and calculate the homology groups of these varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we use free iterated actions and the iterated discrete degree of symmetry to obtain rigidity results on aspherical manifolds. We also introduce the concept of the length of an iterated action and we study it for nilmanifolds, solvmanifolds and locally symmetric spaces.</description>

      <title>Nielsen numbers of $n$-valued maps on infra-solvmanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a formula for the Nielsen number $N(f)$ for every $n$-valued self-map $f$ of an infra-solvmanifold. To do this, we express $N(f)$ in terms of Nielsen coincidence numbers of single-valued maps on solvmanifolds, and derive a formula for Nielsen coincidence numbers in that setting.</description>

      <title>On a class of toric manifolds arising from simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an arbitrary abstract simplicial complex $K$ on $[m]:=\{1,2,\ldots,m\}$, different from the simplex $\Delta_{[m]}$ with $m$ vertices, we introduce and study a canonical $(2m-2)$-dimensional toric manifold $X_K$, associated to the canonical $(m-1)$-dimensional complete regular fan $\Sigma_K$. This construction yields an infinite family of toric manifolds that are not quasitoric and provides a topological proof of the Dehn-Sommerville relations for the associated Bier sphere $\mathrm{Bier}(K)$. Finally, we prove a criterion for orientability of canonical real toric manifolds.</description>

      <title>Large and iterated finite group actions on manifolds admitting non-zero degree maps to nilmanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let M be a closed connected oriented manifold admitting a non-zero degree map to a nilmanifold. In the first part of the paper we study effective finite group actions on M. In particular, we prove that Homeo(M) is Jordan, we bound the discrete degree of symmetry of M and we study the number and the size of stabilizers of an effective action of a finite group G on M. We also study the toral rank conjecture and Carlsson's conjecture for large primes for this class of manifolds. In the second part of the paper we introduce the concepts of free iterated action of groups and the iterated discrete degree of symmetry which we use to obtain cohomological rigidity results for manifolds admitting a non-zero degree map to a 2-step nilmanifold.</description>

      <title>Convexity in tensor triangular geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify the dualizable localizing ideals of rigidly-compactly generated tt-$\infty$-categories that are cohomologically stratified. By definition, these are the localizing ideals that are dualizable with respect to the Lurie tensor product. We prove that these ideals correspond to the convex subsets of the Balmer spectrum. More generally, we establish this classification for categories which are locally cohomologically stratified and whose Balmer spectrum is noetherian. The classification thus applies to many categories arising in algebra and topology, including derived categories of noetherian schemes. Our result generalizes, and is motivated by, a recent theorem of Efimov which establishes this classification for derived categories of commutative noetherian rings.</description>

      <title>Segal K-theory factors through Waldhausen categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Segal's K-theory of symmetric monoidal categorizes can be factored through Waldhausen categories. In particular, given a symmetric monoidal category $C$, we produce a Waldhausen category $\Gamma(C)$ whose K-theory is weakly equivalent to the Segal K-theory of $C$. As a consequence, we show that every connective spectrum may be obtained via Waldhausen K-theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under certain hypotheses, we prove a loop space decomposition for simply-connected Poincar\'e Duality complexes of dimension $n$ whose $(n-1)$-skeleton is a co-$H$-space. This unifies many known decompositions obtained in different contexts and establishes many new families of examples. As consequences, we show that such a looped Poincar\'{e} Duality complex retracts off the loops of its $(n-1)$-skeleton and describe its homology as a one-relator algebra.</description>

      <title>Plethysm for characters of relative operads and PROPs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between symmetric functions and the representation theory of operads, relative operads, and props. We extend the classical character map for symmetric sequences to relative bisymmetric sequences and symmetric bimodules. We introduce new operations on symmetric functions, the relative plethysm and the (connected) box product, which model via the character map the composition product of relative operads and the box product of prop(erad)s. As applications, we include the computation of characters for stable twisted cohomology of automorphism groups of free groups and the Albanese cohomology of the IA-automorphism group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This user's guide (updated version) consists of two parts. The first part is an extensive survey contributed to the Encyclopedia of Mathematical Physics, 2nd edition. It covers many of the main constructions, definitions, and applications of the classical configuration spaces of points. The second part delves into the geometry of chromatic configuration spaces, giving a detailed proof of the remarkable result that the Poincar\'e polynomial of the chromatic configuration spaces of $\mathbb R^N$, associated to a finite simple graph $\Gamma$, corresponds to the reciprocal of the chromatic polynomial of the graph (with signs). Further applications and a stable splitting are given.</description>

      <title>Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting: Leveraging Persistent Homology for Optimized Structural Integrity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16619v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a crucial technique for representing discrete volumetric radiance fields. It leverages unique parametrization to mitigate computational demands in scene optimization. This work introduces Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (Topology-GS), which addresses two key limitations in current approaches: compromised pixel-level structural integrity due to incomplete initial geometric coverage, and inadequate feature-level integrity from insufficient topological constraints during optimization. To overcome these limitations, Topology-GS incorporates a novel interpolation strategy, Local Persistent Voronoi Interpolation (LPVI), and a topology-focused regularization term based on persistent barcodes, named PersLoss. LPVI utilizes persistent homology to guide adaptive interpolation, enhancing point coverage in low-curvature areas while preserving topological structure. PersLoss aligns the visual perceptual similarity of rendered images with ground truth by constraining distances between their topological features. Comprehensive experiments on three novel-view synthesis benchmarks demonstrate that Topology-GS outperforms existing methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, while maintaining efficient memory usage. This study pioneers the integration of topology with 3D-GS, laying the groundwork for future research in this area.</description>

      <title>An Incremental Framework for Topological Dialogue Semantics: Efficient Reasoning in Discrete Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a tractable, incremental framework for topological dialogue semantics based on finite, discrete semantic spaces. Building on the intuition that utterances correspond to open sets and their combinatorial relations form a simplicial complex (the dialogue nerve), we give a rigorous foundation, a provably correct incremental algorithm for nerve updates, and a reference implementation in the Wolfram Language. The framework supports negative nerve computation (inconsistency tracking), consequence extraction, and a transparent, set-theoretic ranking of entailments. We clarify which combinatorial properties hold in the discrete case, provide motivating examples, and outline limitations and prospects for richer logical and categorical extensions.</description>
