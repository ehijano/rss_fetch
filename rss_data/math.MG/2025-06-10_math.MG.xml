      <title>A Generalization of a Classical Geometric Extremum Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\partial \,\mathcal{C}$ be the boundary of a compact convex body $\mathcal{C}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n,\, n\geq 2$, and $O$ be an interior point of $\mathcal C$. Every straight line $l$ containing $O$ cuts from $\mathcal{C}$ a segment $[AB]$ with end-points on $\partial \,\mathcal{C}$. It is shown that if $[AB]$ is the shortest such segment, then $\partial \,\mathcal{C}$ is smooth at the points $A$ and $ B$ (i.e. at both of them there is only one supporting hyperplane for $\mathcal{C}$) and, something more, the normals to the unique supporting hyperplanes at the points $A$ and $B$ intersect at a point belonging to the hiperplane through $O$ which is orthogonal to $[AB]$.
  If $\mathcal{C}$ is a smooth compact convex body in $\mathbb{R}^n,\, n\geq 2$, the above property holds also when $[AB]$ is the longest such segment. Similar results have place also when $O$ is outside the set $\mathcal{C}$. The ``local versions'' of these results (when the length $|AB|$ of the segment $[AB]$ is locally maximal or locally minimal) also have a place. More specific results are obtained in the particular case when $\mathcal{C}$ is a convex polytope.</description>

      <title>Infinity Search: Approximate Vector Search with Projections on q-Metric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of vector search applications, prevailing search algorithms overlook the metric structure of vector embeddings, treating it as a constraint rather than exploiting its underlying properties. In this paper, we demonstrate that in $q$-metric spaces, metric trees can leverage a stronger version of the triangle inequality to reduce comparisons for exact search. Notably, as $q$ approaches infinity, the search complexity becomes logarithmic. Therefore, we propose a novel projection method that embeds vector datasets with arbitrary dissimilarity measures into $q$-metric spaces while preserving the nearest neighbor. We propose to learn an approximation of this projection to efficiently transform query points to a space where euclidean distances satisfy the desired properties. Our experimental results with text and image vector embeddings show that learning $q$-metric approximations enables classic metric tree algorithms -- which typically underperform with high-dimensional data -- to achieve competitive performance against state-of-the-art search methods.</description>

      <title>Spectral convergence of graph Laplacians with Ricci curvature bounds and in non-collapsed Ricci limit spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes quantitative high-probability bounds on the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of $\epsilon$-neighborhood graph Laplacians constructed from i.i.d. random variables on $m$-dimensional closed Riemannian manifolds $(M,g)$ that satisfy a uniform lower Ricci curvature bound $\operatorname{Ric}_g\ge -(m-1)K$, a positive lower volume bound, and an upper diameter bound. These results extend to non-collapsed Ricci limit spaces that are measured Gromov-Hausdorff limits of such manifolds, and the bounds give a spectral approximation of weighted Laplacians on manifolds with non-smooth points.</description>

      <title>Shape optimization under width constraint: the Cheeger constant and the torsional rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article it is shown that the equilateral triangle maximizes the Cheeger constant and minimizes the torsional rigidity among shapes having a fixed minimal width. The proof techniques use direct comparisons with simpler shapes, consisting of disks with three disjoint caps. Comparison results for harmonic functions help establish that in non-equilateral configurations the shape derivative has an appropriate sign, contradicting optimality.</description>

      <title>Applications of the Painlev\'e-Kuratowski convergence: Lipschitz functions with converging Clarke subdifferentials and convergence of sets defined by converging equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we investigate some applications of the Painlev\'e-Kuratowski convergence of closed sets in analysis that are motivated also by questions from singularity theory. First, we generalise to Lipschitz functions the classical theorem stating that given a sequence of smooth functions with locally uniformly convergent derivatives, we obtain the local uniform convergence of the functions themselves (provided they were convergent at one point). We use Clarke subdifferentials instead of derivative and Painlev\'e-Kuratowski convergence of their graphs instead of local uniform convergence. Next we focus on reverse theorem. We show that Painlev\'e-Kuratowski convergence of closed nonempty sets implies convergence of distance functions and Clark subdifferentials of squared distance functions, but does not imply convergence of Clark subdifferentials of distance functions. Finally we turn to the study of the behaviour of the fibres of a given function. We prove some general real counterparts of the Hurwitz theorem from complex analysis stating that the local uniform convergence of holomorphic functions implies the convergence of their sets of zeros. From the point of view of singularity theory our two theorems concern the convergence of the sets when their descriptions are convergent. They are also of interest in approximation theory.</description>

      <title>Gradient flows of $(K,N)$-convex functions with negative $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss $(K,N)$-convexity and gradient flows for $(K,N)$-convex functionals on metric spaces, in the case of real $K$ and negative $N$. In this generality, it is necessary to consider functionals unbounded from below and/or above, possibly attaining as values both the positive and the negative infinity. We prove several properties of gradient flows of $(K,N)$-convex functionals characterized by Evolution Variational Inequalities, including contractivity, regularity, and uniqueness.</description>

      <title>A space of stability conditions that is not a length space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the space of Bridgeland stability conditions, when equipped with the canonical metric, is not a length space in general. This resolves a question posed by Kikuta in the negative. Furthermore, we introduce two modified metrics on the stability spaces, which may exhibit better metric properties.</description>

      <title>The rectifiable rectangular peg problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an affirmative answer to the rectangular peg problem for a large class of continuous Jordan curves that contains all rectifiable curves and Stromquist's locally monotone curves. Our proof is based on microlocal sheaf theory and inspired by recent work of Greene and Lobb.</description>
