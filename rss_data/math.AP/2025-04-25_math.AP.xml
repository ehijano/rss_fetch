      <title>Global stability for compressible isentropic Navier-Stokes equations in 3D bounded domains with Navier-slip boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the global stability of large solutions to the compressible isentropic Navier-Stokes equations in a three-dimensional (3D) bounded domain with Navier-slip boundary conditions. It is shown that the strong solutions converge to an equilibrium state exponentially in the $L^2$-norm provided the density is essentially uniform-in-time bounded from above. Moreover, we obtain that the density converges to its equilibrium state exponentially in the $L^\infty$-norm if additionally the initial density is bounded away from zero. Furthermore, we derive that the vacuum states will not vanish for any time provided vacuum appears (even at a point) initially. This is the first result concerning the global stability for large strong solutions of compressible Navier-Stokes equations with vacuum in 3D general bounded domains.</description>

      <title>A Diffuse Domain Approximation with Transmission-Type Boundary Conditions II: Gamma--Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffuse domain methods (DDMs) have gained significant attention for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on complex geometries. These methods approximate the domain by replacing sharp boundaries with a diffuse layer of thickness $\varepsilon$, which scales with the minimum grid size. This reformulation extends the problem to a regular domain, incorporating boundary conditions via singular source terms. In this work, we analyze the convergence of a DDM approximation problem with transmission-type Neumann boundary conditions. We prove that the energy functional of the diffuse domain problem $\Gamma$--converges to the energy functional of the original problem as $\varepsilon \to 0$. Additionally, we show that the solution of the diffuse domain problem strongly converges in $H^1(\Omega)$, up to a subsequence, to the solution of the original problem, as $\varepsilon \to 0$.</description>

      <title>The critical power of short pulse initial data on the global existence or blowup of smooth solutions to 3-D semilinear Klein-Gordon equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that there are global small data smooth solutions for the 3-D semilinear Klein-Gordon equations $\square u + u = F(u,{\partial u})$ with cubic nonlinearities. However, for the short pulse initial data $(u, \partial_tu)(0, x)=({\delta^{\nu+1}}{u_0}({\frac{x}{\delta}}),{\delta^\nu }{u_1}({\frac{x}{\delta}}))$ with $\nu\in\Bbb R$ and $(u_0, u_1)\in C_0^{\infty}(\Bbb R)$, which are a class of large initial data, we establish that when $\nu\le -\frac{1}{2}$, the solution $u$ can blow up in finite time for some suitable choices of $(u_0, u_1)$ and cubic nonlinearity $F(u,{\partial u})$; when $\nu&gt;-\frac{1}{2}$, the smooth solution $u$ exists globally. Therefore, $\nu=-\frac{1}{2}$ is just the critical power corresponding to the global existence or blowup of smooth
  short pulse solutions for the cubic semilinear Klein-Gordon equations.</description>

      <title>Horizontally periodic generalized surface quasigeostrophic patches and layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study solutions to the $\alpha$-SQG equations, which interpolate between the incompressible Euler and surface quasi-geostrophic equations. We extend prior results on existence of bounded patches, proving propagation of $H^k$-regularity of the patch boundary, $k \ge 3$, for finite time for patches that are periodic in one spatial dimension. Such periodic patches also encompass layers, or two-sided fronts. As the authors have treated the Euler case in prior work, we now primarily focus on the range of $\alpha$ for which $\alpha$-SQG lies strictly between the Euler and SQG equations.</description>

      <title>Incompressible and fast rotation limits for 3D compressible rotating Euler system with general initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the low Mach and Rossby number limits of $3$D compressible rotating Euler equations with ill-prepared initial data in the whole space. More precisely, the initial data is the sum of a $3$D part and a $2$D part. With the help of a suitable intermediate system, we perform this singular limit rigorously with the target system being a $2$D QG-type. This particularly gives an affirmative answer to the question raised by Ngo and Scrobogna [\emph{Discrete Contin. Dyn. Syst.}, 38 (2018), pp. 749-789]. As a by-product, our proof gives a rigorous justification from the $2$D inviscid rotating shallow water equations to the $2$D QG equations in whole space.</description>

      <title>Principal eigenvalues for the weighted p-Laplacian and antimaximum principle in $\mathbb{R}^N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of principal eigenvalues and principal eigenfunctions for weighted eigenvalue problems of the form: \begin{equation*} - \mbox{div} ( L (x) |\nabla u|^{p-2} \nabla u ) = \lambda K(x) |u|^{p-2} u \hspace{.1cm} \mbox { in } \hspace{.1cm} \mathbb{R}^N , \end{equation*} where $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, $p&gt;1$, $K : \mathbb{R}^N \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, $L : \mathbb{R}^N \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$ are locally integrable functions. The weight function $K$ is allowed to change sign, provided it remains positive on a set of nonzero measure. We establish the existence, regularity, and asymptotic behavior of the principal eigenfunctions. We also prove local and global antimaximum principles for a perturbed version of the problem.</description>

      <title>A Rellich-type theorem for the Helmholtz equation in a junction of stratified media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that there are no non-zero square-integrable solutions to a two-dimensional Helmholtz equation in some unbounded inhomogeneous domains which represent junctions of stratified media. More precisely, we consider domains that are unions of three half-planes, where each half-plane is stratified in the direction orthogonal to its boundary. As for the well-known Rellich uniqueness theorem for a homogeneous exterior domain, our result does not require any boundary condition. Our proof is based on half-plane representations of the solution which are derived through a generalization of the Fourier transform adapted to stratified media. A byproduct of our result is the absence of trapped modes at the junction of open waveguides as soon as the angles between branches are greater than $\pi$/2.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic continuity for the Nonlocal degenerate two-phase Stefan problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish certain oscillation estimates for weak solutions to nonlinear, anomalous phase transitions modeled on the nonlocal two-phase Stefan problem. The problem is singular in time, is scaling deficient and influenced by far-off effects. We study the the problem in a geometry adapted to the solution and obtain oscillation estimates in intrinsically scaled cylinders. Furthermore, via certain uniform estimates, we construct a continuous weak solution to the corresponding initial boundary value problem with a quantitative modulus of continuity.</description>

      <title>Periodic homogenization and harmonic measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the seminal work of Kenig and Pipher, the Dahlberg-Kenig-Pipher (DKP) condition on oscillations of the coefficient matrix became a standard threshold in the study of absolute continuity of the harmonic measure with respect to the Hausdorff measure on the boundary. It has been proved sufficient for absolute continuity in the domains with increasingly complex geometry, and known counterexamples show that in a certain sense it is necessary as well. In the present note, we introduce into the subject ideas from homogenization theory to exhibit a new class of operators for which the elliptic measure is well-behaved, featuring the coefficients violating the DKP condition, and on the contrary, oscillating so quickly, that the homogenization takes place.</description>

      <title>An Inverse Source Problem for Semilinear Stochastic Hyperbolic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates an inverse source problem for general semilinear stochastic hyperbolic equations. Motivated by the challenges arising from both randomness and nonlinearity, we develop a globally convergent iterative regularization method that combines Carleman estimate with fixed-point iteration. Our approach enables the reconstruction of the unknown source function from partial lateral Cauchy data, without requiring a good initial guess. We establish a new Carleman estimate for stochastic hyperbolic equations and prove the convergence of the proposed method in weighted spaces. Furthermore, we design an efficient numerical algorithm that avoids solving backward stochastic partial differential equations and is robust to randomness in both the model and the data. Numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.</description>

      <title>Stability of Stochastically Forced Solitons in the Korteweg-de Vries Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability and dynamics of solitons in the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation in the presence of noise and deterministic forcing. The noise is space-dependent and statistically translation-invariant. We show that, for small forcing, solitons remain close to the family of traveling waves in a weighted Sobolev norm, with high probability. We study the effective dynamics of the soliton amplitude and position via their variational phase, for which we derive explicit modulation equations. The stability result holds on a time scale where the deterministic forcing induces significant amplitude modulation.</description>

      <title>Boundary observation and control for fractional heat and wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish boundary observability and control for the fractional heat equation over arbitrary time horizons $T &gt; 0$, within the optimal range of fractional exponents $s \in (1/2, 1)$. Our approach introduces a novel synthesis of techniques from fractional partial differential equations and control theory, combining several key ingredients in an original and effective manner:
  1. Boundary observability for low-frequency solutions of the fractional wave equation. We begin by analyzing the associated fractional wave equation. Using a fractional analogue of Pohozaev's identity, we establish a partial boundary observability result for the low-frequency solutions. The corresponding observability time horizon increases with the eigenmode frequency, reflecting the inherently slower propagation speed of the fractional waves.
  2. Transmutation to the parabolic setting. Using transmutation techniques, we transfer the observability results from the wave setting to the parabolic one. This yields a frequency-dependent observability inequality for the fractional heat equation, which - via duality - enables control of its low-frequency components.
  3. Frequency-wise iteration. Leveraging the dissipative nature of the fractional heat equation, we develop an iterative procedure to successively control the entire frequency spectrum of solutions. The condition $s \in (1/2, 1)$ is crucial in this analysis, as it guarantees sufficient decay of high-frequency components, enabling the convergence of the iteration.
  4. Duality. By a duality argument, we derive boundary observability from the boundary controllability of the fractional heat equation. Remarkably, this type of boundary observability result is entirely new in the multi-dimensional setting and appears to be out of reach for existing methods. \end{itemize}</description>

      <title>On soliton resolution to Cauchy problem of the spin-1 Gross-Pitaevskii equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Cauchy problem for the spin-1 Gross-Pitaevskii(GP) equation, which is a model instrumental in characterizing the soliton dynamics within spinor Bose-Einstein condensates. Recently, Geng $etal.$ (Commun. Math. Phys. 382, 585-611 (2021)) reported the long-time asymptotic result with error $\mathcal{O}(\frac{\log t}t)$ for the spin-1 GP equation that only exists in the continuous spectrum. The main purpose of our work is to further generalize and improve Geng's work. Compared with the previous work, our asymptotic error accuracy has been improved from $\mathcal{O}(\frac{\log t}t)$ to $\mathcal{O}(t^{-3/4})$. More importantly, by establishing two matrix valued functions, we obtained effective asymptotic errors and successfully constructed asymptotic analysis of the spin-1 GP equation based on the characteristics of the spectral problem, including two cases: (i)coexistence of discrete and continuous spectrum; (ii)only continuous spectrum which considered by Geng's work with error $\mathcal{O}(\frac{\log t}t)$. For the case (i), the corresponding asymptotic approximations can be characterized with an $N$-soliton as well as an interaction term between soliton solutions and the dispersion term with diverse residual error order $\mathcal{O}(t^{-3/4})$. For the case (ii), the corresponding asymptotic approximations can be characterized with the leading term on the continuous spectrum and the residual error order $\mathcal{O}(t^{-3/4})$. Finally, our results confirm the soliton resolution conjecture for the spin-1 GP equation.</description>

      <title>Parabolic PDEs with Dynamic Data under a Bounded Slope Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the existence of Lipschitz continuous solutions to the Cauchy Dirichlet problem for a class of evolutionary partial differential equations of the form $$ \partial_tu-\text{div}_x \nabla_\xi f(\nabla u)=0 $$ in a space-time cylinder $\Omega_T=\Omega\times (0,T)$, subject to time-dependent boundary data $g\colon \partial_{\mathcal{P}}\Omega_T\to \mathbf{R}$ prescribed on the parabolic boundary. The main novelty in our analysis is a time-dependent version of the classical bounded slope condition, imposed on the boundary data $g$ along the lateral boundary $\partial\Omega\times (0,T)$. More precisely, we require that for each fixed $t\in [0,T)$, the graph of $g(\cdot ,t)$ over $\partial\Omega$ admits supporting hyperplanes with slopes that may vary in time but remain uniformly bounded. The key to handling time-dependent data lies in constructing more flexible upper and lower barriers.</description>

Our main objective is to establish approximate controllability by using the controllability of the inviscid Burgers system, linearized around a suitably constructed trajectory. In contrast to earlier approaches based on Lie algebraic techniques, our method offers a more concise proof and sheds new light on the structure of the control. Although the approach necessitates a higher-dimensional control space, both the structure and dimension of the control remain uniform with respect to the order of the dispersive equation and the control time.</description>

      <title>Well-posed Questions for Ill-posed Inverse Problems: a Note in Memory of Pierre Sabatier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Professor Pierre Sabatier contributed much to the study of inverse problems in theory and practice. Two of these contributions were a focus on theory that actually supports practice, and the identification of well-posed aspects of inverse problems that may quite ill-posed. This paper illustrates these two themes in the context of Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), which is both very ill-posed and very practical. We show that for a highly constrained version of this inverse problem, in which a small elliptical inclusion in a homogeneous background is to be identified, optimization of the experimental design (that is, electrode locations) vastly improves the stability of the solution.</description>

      <title>Sharp Material Interface Limit of the Darcy-Boussinesq System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the sharp material interface limit of the Darcy-Boussinesq model for convection in layered porous media with diffused material interfaces, which allow a gradual transition of material parameters between different layers. We demonstrate that as the thickness of these transition layers approaches zero, the conventional sharp interface model with interfacial boundary conditions, commonly adopted by the fluids community, is recovered under the assumption of constant porosity. Our results validate the widely used sharp interface model by bridging it with the more physically realistic case of diffused material interfaces. This limiting process is singular and involves a boundary layer in the velocity field. Our analysis requires del</description>

      <title>Asymptotic attraction with algebraic rates toward fronts of dispersive-diffusive Burgers equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Burgers equation is a classic model, which arises in numerous applications. At its very core it is a simple conservation law, which serves as a toy model for various dynamics phenomena. In particular, it supports explicit heteroclinic solutions, both fronts and backs. Their stability has been studied in details. There has been substantial interest in considering dispersive and/or diffusive modifications, which present novel dynamical paradigms in such simple setting. More specificaly, the KdV-Burgers model has been showed to support unique fronts (not all of them monotone!) with fixed values at $\pm \infty$. Many articles, among which \cite{Pego}, \cite{NS1}, \cite{NS2}, have studied the question of stability of monotone (or close to monotone) fronts.
  In a breakthrough paper, \cite{BBHY}, the authors have extended these results in several different directions. They have considered a wider range of models. The fronts do not need to be monotone, but are subject of a spectral condition instead. Most importantly the method allows for large perturbations, as long as the heteroclinic conditions at $\pm \infty$ are met. That is, there is asymptotic attraction to the said fronts or equivalently the limit set consist of one point.
  The purpose of this paper is to extend the results of \cite{BBHY} by providing explicit algebraic rates of convergence as $t\to \infty$. We bootstrap these results from the results in \cite{BBHY} using additional energy estimates for two important examples namely KdV-Burgers and the fractional Burgers problem. These rates are likely not optimal, but we conjecture that they are algebraic nonetheless.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a central limit theorem and large deviations principle that characterises small noise fluctuations of the generalised Dean--Kawasaki stochastic PDE. The fluctuations agree to first order with fluctuations of certain interacting particle systems, such as the zero range process, about their hydrodynamic limits. Our main contribution is that we are able to consider stochastic PDEs on general $C^2$ bounded domains with Dirichlet boundary conditions. On the level of particles, the boundary condition corresponds to absorption or injection of particles at the boundary.</description>

      <title>On the local stability of the elapsed-time model in terms of the transmission delay and interconnection strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The elapsed-time model describes the behavior of interconnected neurons through the time since their last spike. It is an age-structured non-linear equation in which age corresponds to the elapsed time since the last discharge, and models many interesting dynamics depending on the type of interactions between neurons. We investigate the linearized stability of this equation by considering a discrete delay, which accounts for the possibility of a synaptic delay due to the time needed to transmit a nerve impulse from one neuron to the rest of the ensemble. We state a stability criterion that allows to determine if a steady state is linearly stable or unstable depending on the delay and the interaction between neurons. Our approach relies on the study of the asymptotic behavior of related Volterra-type integral equations in terms of theirs Laplace transforms. The analysis is complemented with numerical simulations illustrating the change of stability of a steady state in terms of the delay and the intensity of interconnections.</description>

      <title>Microscopic derivation of the stationary Chern-Simons-Schr\"odinger equation for almost-bosonic anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider the $N$-body Hamiltonian describing the microscopic structure of a quantum gas of almost-bosonic anyons. This description includes both extended magnetic flux and spin-orbit/soft-disk interaction between the particles which are confined in a scalar trapping potential. We study a physically well-motivated ansatz for a sequence of trial states, consisting of Jastrow repulsive short-range correlations and a condensate, with sufficient variational freedom to approximate the ground state (and possibly also low-energy excited states) of the gas. In the limit $N \to \infty$, while taking the relative size of the anyons to zero and the total magnetic flux $2\pi\beta$ to remain finite, we rigorously derive the stationary Chern-Simons-Schr\"odinger/average-field-Pauli effective energy density functional for the condensate wave function. This includes a scalar self-interaction parameter $\gamma$ which depends both on $\beta$, the diluteness of the gas, and the spin-orbit coupling strength $g$, but becomes independent of these microscopic details for a particular value of the coupling $g=2$ in which supersymmetry is exhibited (on all scales, both microscopic and mesoscopic) with $\gamma=2\pi|\beta|$. Our findings confirm and clarify the predictions we have found in the physics literature.</description>

      <title>Long-time asymptotics of the Sawada-Kotera equation on the line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sawada-Kotera (SK) equation is an integrable system characterized by a third-order Lax operator and is related to the modified Sawada-Kotera (mSK) equation through a Miura transformation. This work formulates the Riemann-Hilbert problem associated with the SK and mSK equations by using direct and inverse scattering transforms. The long-time asymptotic behaviors of the solutions to these equations are then analyzed via the Deift-Zhou steepest descent method for Riemann-Hilbert problems. It is shown that the asymptotic solutions of the SK and mSK equations are categorized into four distinct regions: the decay region, the dispersive wave region, the Painlev\'{e} region, and the rapid decay region. Notably, the Painlev\'{e} region is governed by the F-XVIII equation in the Painlev\'{e} classification of fourth-order ordinary differential equations, a fourth-order analogue of the Painlev\'{e} transcendents. This connection is established through the Riemann-Hilbert formulation in this work. Similar to the KdV equation, the SK equation exhibits a transition region between the dispersive wave and Painlev\'{e} regions, arising from the special values of the reflection coefficients at the origin. Finally, numerical comparisons demonstrate that the asymptotic solutions agree excellently with results from direct numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07025v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly focus on the rigorous convergence analysis of two fully decoupled, unconditionally energy-stable methods for the diffuse interface two-phase magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model. The two methods consist of the semi-implicit stabilization method and the invariant energy quadratization (IEQ) method, which are both applied to the phase field system. In addition, the pressure correction method is used for the saddle point system, and appropriate implicit-explicit treatments are employed for the nonlinear coupled terms. We prove the unconditional energy stability of the two schemes. In addition, we mainly establish the error estimates based on the bounds of $\left\|\phi^{k}\right\|_{L^{\infty}}$ and $\left\|\textbf{b}^{k}\right\|_{L^{\infty}}$. Several numerical examples are presented to test the accuracy and stability of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Wave map null form estimates via Peter-Weyl theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13052v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study spacetime estimates for the wave map null form $Q_0$ on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$. By using the Lie group structure of $\mathbb{S}^3$ and Peter-Weyl theory, combined with the time-periodicity of the conformal wave equation on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$, we extend the classical ideas of Klainerman and Machedon to estimates on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$, allowing for a range of powers of natural (Laplacian and wave) Fourier multiplier operators. A key difference in these curved space estimates as compared to the flat case is a loss of an arbitrarily small amount of differentiability, attributable to a lack of dispersion of linear waves on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$. This arises in Fourier space from the product structure of irreducible representations of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$. We further show that our estimates imply weighted estimates for the null form on Minkowski space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish estimates for the Poisson kernel, the heat kernel, and Bochner--Riesz means defined in terms of $H=-\Delta+V$, where $V$ is a possibly large rough real-valued scalar potential and $H$ can have negative eigenvalues. All results are in three space dimensions.
  We eliminate several unnecessary conditions on $V$, leaving just $V \in \mathcal K_0$, meaning that $V$ is locally integrable and $(-\Delta)^{-1}|V|$ is bounded.
  For the spectral multiplier bounds, we assume that $H$ has no zero or positive energy bound states. For $V \in \mathcal K_0$, we prove that $H$ has at most a finite number of negative bound states. If in addition $V \in \dot W^{-1/4, 4/3}$, then by [GoSc] and [KoTa] there are no positive energy bound states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a modulated magnetic field, $B(t) = B_0 +\varepsilon f(\omega t)$, perpendicular to a fixed plane, where $B_0$ is constant, $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and $f$ a periodic function on the torus ${\mathbb T}^n$. Our aim is to study classical and quantum dynamics for the corresponding Landau Hamiltonian. It turns out that the results depend strongly on the chosen gauge. For the Landau gauge the position observable is unbounded for "almost all" non resonant frequencies $\omega$. On the contrary, for the symmetric gauge we obtain that, for "almost all" non resonant frequencies $\omega$, the Landau Hamiltonian is reducible to a two dimensional harmonic oscillator and thus gives rise to bounded dynamics. The proofs use KAM algorithms for the classical dynamics. Quantum applications are given. In particular, the Floquet spectrum is absolutely continuous in the Landau gauge while it is discrete, of finite multiplicity, in symmetric gauge.</description>

      <title>A Diffuse Domain Approximation with Transmission-Type Boundary Conditions I: Asymptotic Analysis and Numerics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffuse domain methods (DDMs) have garnered significant attention for approximating solutions to partial differential equations on complex geometries. These methods implicitly represent the geometry by replacing the sharp boundary interface with a diffuse layer of thickness $\varepsilon$, which scales with the minimum grid size. This approach reformulates the original equations on an extended regular domain, incorporating boundary conditions through singular source terms. In this work, we conduct a matched asymptotic analysis of a DDM for a two-sided problem with transmission-type Robin boundary conditions. Our results show that, in the one dimensional space, the solution of the diffuse domain approximation asymptotically converges to the solution of the original problem, with exactly first-order accuracy in $\varepsilon$. Furthermore, we provide numerical simulations that validate and illustrate the analytical result.</description>

Abstract: We study the Monopolist's problem with a focus on the free boundary separating bunched from unbunched consumers, especially in the plane, and give a full description of its solution for the family of square domains $\{(a,a+1)^2\}_{a \ge 0}$. The Monopolist's problem is fundamental in economics, yet widely considered analytically intractable when both consumers and products have more than one degree of heterogeneity. Mathematically, the problem is to minimize a smooth, uniformly convex Lagrangian over the space of nonnegative convex functions. What results is a free boundary problem between the regions of strict and nonstrict convexity. Our work is divided into three parts: a study of the structure of the free boundary problem on convex domains in $\mathbf{R}^n$ showing that the product allocation map remains Lipschitz up to most of the fixed boundary and that each bunch extends to this boundary; a proof in $\mathbf{R}^2$ that the interior free boundary can only fail to be smooth in one of four specific ways (cusp, high frequency oscillations, stray bunch, nontranversal bunch); and, finally, the first complete solution to Rochet and Chon\'e's example on the family of squares $\Omega = (a,a+1)^2$, where we discover bifurcations first to targeted and then to blunt bunching as the distance $a \ge 0$ to the origin is increased. We use techniques from the study of the Monge--Amp\'ere equation, the obstacle problem, and localization for measures in convex-order.</description>

      <title>Construction of $p$-energy measures associated with strongly local $p$-energy forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct canonical $p$-energy measures associated with strongly local $p$-energy forms without any assumptions of self-similarity, where $p$-energy forms are $L^p$-versions of Dirichlet forms, which have recently been studied mainly on fractals. Furthermore, we prove that the measures satisfy the chain and Leibniz rules, and that such a "good" energy measures are unique. As an application, we also prove the $p$-energy version of Mosco's domination principle. Moreover, we show a Korevaar--Schoen-type $p$-energies defined by Alonso-Ruiz and Baudoin coincide with our energy measures.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of Parisi measures for enriched convex vector spin glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the PDE approach to mean-field spin glasses, it has been observed that the free energy of convex spin glass models could be enriched by adding an extra parameter in its definition, and that the thermodynamic limit of the enriched free energy satisfies a partial differential equation. This parameter can be thought of as a matrix-valued path, and the usual free energy is recovered by setting this parameter to be the constant path taking only the value $0$. Furthermore, the enriched free energy can be expressed using a variational formula, which is a natural extension of the Parisi formula for the usual free energy. For models with scalar spins the Parisi formula can be expressed as an optimization problem over a convex set, and it was shown in [arXiv:1402.5132] that this problem has a unique optimizer thanks to a strict convexity property. For models with vector spins, the Parisi formula cannot easily be written as a convex optimization problem. In this paper, we generalize the uniqueness of Parisi measures proven in [arXiv:1402.5132] to the enriched free energy of models with vector spins when the extra parameter is a strictly increasing path. Our approach relies on a Gateaux differentiability property of the free energy and the envelope theorem.</description>
