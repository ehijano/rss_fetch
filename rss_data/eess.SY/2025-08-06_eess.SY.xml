      <title>Agentic-AI based Mathematical Framework for Commercialization of Energy Resilience in Electrical Distribution System Planning and Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing vulnerability of electrical distribution systems to extreme weather events and cyber threats necessitates the development of economically viable frameworks for resilience enhancement. While existing approaches focus primarily on technical resilience metrics and enhancement strategies, there remains a significant gap in establishing market-driven mechanisms that can effectively commercialize resilience features while optimizing their deployment through intelligent decision-making. Moreover, traditional optimization approaches for distribution network reconfiguration often fail to dynamically adapt to both normal and emergency conditions. This paper introduces a novel framework integrating dual-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with market-based mechanisms, achieving an average resilience score of 0.85 0.08 over 10 test episodes. The proposed architecture leverages a dual-agent PPO scheme, where a strategic agent selects optimal DER-driven switching configurations, while a tactical agent fine-tunes individual switch states and grid preferences under budget and weather constraints. These agents interact within a custom-built dynamic simulation environment that models stochastic calamity events, budget limits, and resilience-cost trade-offs. A comprehensive reward function is designed that balances resilience enhancement objectives with market profitability (with up to 200x reward incentives, resulting in 85% of actions during calamity steps selecting configurations with 4 DERs), incorporating factors such as load recovery speed, system robustness, and customer satisfaction. Over 10 test episodes, the framework achieved a benefit-cost ratio of 0.12 0.01, demonstrating sustainable market incentives for resilience investment. This framework creates sustainable market incentives</description>

      <title>Information Bulletin Strategy in Impatient Queuing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Sixth Generation (6G) networks, decentralized control in multi-tenant systems is a suggested enabler for autonomous network operations. However, autonomy requires independent rationale decisions be taken by tenants. This rationality can only be underpinned by timely and continuous access to status information. Despite its importance, the questions of what information should be shared, how much should be communicated, and how frequently updates should be dispatched remain open research challenges.
  This manuscript proposes an information bulletin strategy defined around two models of the system descriptor states to address these fundamental questions. The strategy is that queues periodically broadcast these information models to tenants at different time intervals, who may respond by reneging from the queue or jockeying to a more favorable one. The expectation is that over time, the queues adapt their processing rates based on what they learn from the tenant behavior. The objective is to minimize overall delay and the impatience. We formulate for this impatience as an optimization problem, whose analytical solution is intractable. We perform numerical experiments to evaluate the performance of the learned queue policy and to assess how closely it approaches optimal conditions.</description>

      <title>A virtual sensor fusion approach for state of charge estimation of lithium-ion cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the estimation of the State Of Charge (SOC) of lithium-ion cells via the combination of two widely used paradigms: Kalman Filters (KFs) equipped with Equivalent Circuit Models (ECMs) and machine-learning approaches. In particular, a recent Virtual Sensor (VS) synthesis technique is considered, which operates as follows: (i) learn an Affine Parameter-Varying (APV) model of the cell directly from data, (ii) derive a bank of linear observers from the APV model, (iii) train a machine-learning technique from features extracted from the observers together with input and output data to predict the SOC. The SOC predictions returned by the VS are supplied to an Extended KF (EKF) as output measurements along with the cell terminal voltage, combining the two paradigms. A data-driven calibration strategy for the noise covariance matrices of the EKF is proposed. Experimental results show that the designed approach is beneficial w.r.t. SOC estimation accuracy and smoothness.</description>

      <title>Design of Adaptive Hybrid Downlink NOMA-TDMA for Visible Light Communications Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptive hybrid non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-time division multiple access (TDMA) scheme for multi-user visible light communication (VLC) networks, aiming to enhance users' sum-rate performance while maintaining low complexity. In the proposed scheme, users are divided into groups where each group is served in a different time slot using TDMA. Within each group, up to two users can be served simultaneously using NOMA. A central challenge lies in determining which users should be paired together for NOMA, as the effectiveness of successive interference cancellation (SIC) employed by NOMA depends on the difference between users' channel gains. To address this, for a pair of users, we determine the range of their channel gain ratio within which the pair benefits more from NOMA or TDMA. Identifying the lower and upper bounds of this range is formulated as two optimization problems which are solved efficiently using the Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional hybrid NOMA-TDMA method under different numbers of users and transmit LED powers.</description>

      <title>Error Accumulation using Linearized Models for Aggregating Flexibility in Distribution Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates flexibility aggregation approaches based on linear models. We begin by examining the theoretical foundations of linear AC power flow, two variants of so-called DC power flow, and the LinDistFlow model, along with their underlying assumptions. The discussion covers key system details, including network topology, voltage constraints, and line losses. Simulations are conducted on the KIT Campus Nord network with real demand and solar data. Results show that, in the absence of negative losses, line losses are generally underestimated by linear models. Furthermore, line losses errors tend to accumulate both at the point of common coupling (PCC) and over extended time horizons.</description>

      <title>Case Studies of Generative Machine Learning Models for Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems like aircraft and spacecraft are expensive to operate in the real world. The design, validation, and testing for such systems therefore relies on a combination of mathematical modeling, abundant numerical simulations, and a relatively small set of real-world experiments. Due to modeling errors, simplifications, and uncertainties, the data synthesized by simulation models often does not match data from the system's real-world operation. We consider the broad research question of whether this model mismatch can be significantly reduced by generative artificial intelligence models (GAIMs). Unlike text- or image-processing, where generative models have attained recent successes, GAIM development for aerospace engineering applications must not only train with scarce operational data, but their outputs must also satisfy governing equations based on natural laws, e.g., conservation laws. The scope of this paper primarily focuses on two case studies of optimally controlled systems that are commonly understood and employed in aircraft guidance, namely: minimum-time navigation in a wind field and minimum-exposure navigation in a threat field. We report GAIMs that are trained with a relatively small set, of the order of a few hundred, of examples and with underlying governing equations. By focusing on optimally controlled systems, we formulate training loss functions based on invariance of the Hamiltonian function along system trajectories. We investigate three GAIM architectures, namely: the generative adversarial network (GAN) and two variants of the variational autoencoder (VAE). We provide architectural details and thorough performance analyses of these models. The main finding is that our new models, especially the VAE-based models, are able to synthesize data that satisfy the governing equations and are statistically similar to the training data despite small volumes of training data.</description>

      <title>TaxSolver: A methodology to design optimal income tax reform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Across the developed world, there are growing calls to streamline and improve ever more complex income tax codes. Executing reform has proven difficult. Even when the desired outcomes of a reform are clear, the tools to design fitting reforms are lacking. To remedy this, we developed \texttt{TaxSolver}: a methodology to help policymakers realize optimal income tax reform. \texttt{TaxSolver} allows policymakers to focus solely on what they aim to achieve with a reform -- like redistributing wealth, incentivizing labor market participation or reducing complexity -- and the guarantees within which reform is acceptable -- like limiting fluctuations in taxpayer incomes, protecting households from falling into poverty or shocks to overall tax revenue. Given these goals and fiscal guarantees, \texttt{TaxSolver} finds the optimal set of tax rules that satisfies all the criteria or shows that the set of demands are not mathematically feasible. We illustrate \texttt{TaxSolver} by reforming various simulated examples of tax codes, including some that reflect the complexity and size of a real-world tax system.</description>

      <title>Moveless: Minimizing Overhead on QCCDs via Versatile Execution and Low Excess Shuttling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most promising paths towards large scale fault tolerant quantum computation is the use of quantum error correcting stabilizer codes. Just like every other quantum circuit, these codes must be compiled to hardware in a way to minimize the total physical error introduced into the system, for example either due to high latency execution or excessive gates to meet connectivity limitations of the target hardware. However, unlike arbitrary quantum circuits, all syndrome extraction circuits have several common properties, for example they have a bipartite connectivity graph, consist only of commuting subcircuits, among other properties. For the most part, compilation methods have aimed at being generic, able to map any input circuit into executables on the hardware, and therefore cannot appropriately exploit these properties and result in executables which have higher physical error. In the case of modular trapped ion systems, specifically QCCDs, this corresponds to the insertion of excessive shuttling operations necessary to realize arbitrary qubit interactions. We propose a compilation scheme explicitly tailored for the structural regularity of QEC circuits based on several key observations: 1. only ancilla or data (but not both) should be shuttled, 2. stabilizers can be executed in any order meaning we can dynamically modify circuit execution on a per-cycle basis 3. ancilla are indistinguishable meaning any can be selected to begin a stabilizer measurement and retain a fixed-point mapping between cycles, and 4. QCCD hardware limits the number of parallel operations equal to the number traps in the system, meaning fewer ancilla are necessary and can be reused. Our resulting compiler, leads to QEC circuits which are on average 3.38x faster to execute, and lead to up to two orders of magnitude of improvement in logical error rates with realistic physical error rates.</description>

      <title>Control Closure Certificates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the notion of control closure certificates to synthesize controllers for discrete-time control systems against $\omega$-regular specifications. Typical functional approaches to synthesize controllers against $\omega$-regular specifications rely on combining inductive invariants (for example, via barrier certificates) with proofs of well-foundedness (for example, via ranking functions). Transition invariants, provide an alternative where instead of standard well-foundedness arguments one may instead search for disjunctive well-foundedness arguments that together ensure a well-foundedness argument. Closure certificates, functional analogs of transition invariants, provide an effective, automated approach to verify discrete-time dynamical systems against linear temporal logic and $\omega$-regular specifications. We build on this notion to synthesize controllers to ensure the satisfaction of $\omega$-regular specifications. To do so, we first illustrate how one may construct control closure certificates to visit a region infinitely often (or only finitely often) via disjunctive well-founded arguments. We then combine these arguments to provide an argument for parity specifications. Thus, finding an appropriate control closure certificate over the product of the system and a parity automaton specifying a desired $\omega$-regular specification ensures that there exists a controller $\kappa$ to enforce the $\omega$-regular specification. We propose a sum-of-squares optimization approach to synthesize such certificates and demonstrate their efficacy in designing controllers over some case studies.</description>

      <title>Optimization of sliding control parameters for a 3-dof robot arm using genetic algorithm (GA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for optimizing the sliding mode control (SMC) parameter for a robot manipulator applying a genetic algorithm (GA). The objective of the SMC is to achieve precise and consistent tracking of the trajectory of the robot manipulator under uncertain and disturbed conditions. However, the system effectiveness and robustness depend on the choice of the SMC parameters, which is a difficult and crucial task. To solve this problem, a genetic algorithm is used to locate the optimal values of these parameters that gratify the capability criteria. The proposed method is efficient compared with the conventional SMC and Fuzzy-SMC. The simulation results show that the genetic algorithm with SMC can achieve better tracking capability and reduce the chattering effect.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Microgrid Composition for Sustainable Data Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As computing energy demand continues to grow and electrical grid infrastructure struggles to keep pace, an increasing number of data centers are being planned with colocated microgrids that integrate on-site renewable generation and energy storage. However, while existing research has examined the tradeoffs between operational and embodied carbon emissions in the context of renewable energy certificates, there is a lack of tools to assess how the sizing and composition of microgrid components affects long-term sustainability and power reliability.
  In this paper, we present a novel optimization framework that extends the computing and energy system co-simulator Vessim with detailed renewable energy generation models from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) System Advisor Model (SAM). Our framework simulates the interaction between computing workloads, on-site renewable production, and energy storage, capturing both operational and embodied emissions. We use a multi-horizon black-box optimization to explore efficient microgrid compositions and enable operators to make more informed decisions when planning energy systems for data centers.</description>

      <title>Challenges in Applying Variational Quantum Algorithms to Dynamic Satellite Network Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Applying near-term variational quantum algorithms to the problem of dynamic satellite network routing represents a promising direction for quantum computing. In this work, we provide a critical evaluation of two major approaches: static quantum optimizers such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for offline route computation, and Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) methods for online decision-making. Using ideal, noise-free simulations, we find that these algorithms face significant challenges. Specifically, static optimizers are unable to solve even a classically easy 4-node shortest path problem due to the complexity of the optimization landscape. Likewise, a basic QRL agent based on policy gradient methods fails to learn a useful routing strategy in a dynamic 8-node environment and performs no better than random actions. These negative findings highlight key obstacles that must be addressed before quantum algorithms can offer real advantages in communication networks. We discuss the underlying causes of these limitations, including barren plateaus and learning instability, and suggest future research directions to overcome them.</description>

      <title>Reliable and Real-Time Highway Trajectory Planning via Hybrid Learning-Optimization Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous highway driving presents a high collision risk due to fast-changing environments and limited reaction time, necessitating reliable and efficient trajectory planning. This paper proposes a hybrid trajectory planning framework that integrates the adaptability of learning-based methods with the formal safety guarantees of optimization-based approaches. The framework features a two-layer architecture: an upper layer employing a graph neural network (GNN) trained on real-world highway data to predict human-like longitudinal velocity profiles, and a lower layer utilizing path optimization formulated as a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem. The primary contribution is the lower-layer path optimization model, which introduces a linear approximation of discretized vehicle geometry to substantially reduce computational complexity, while enforcing strict spatiotemporal non-overlapping constraints to formally guarantee collision avoidance throughout the planning horizon. Experimental results demonstrate that the planner generates highly smooth, collision-free trajectories in complex real-world emergency scenarios, achieving success rates exceeding 97% with average planning times of 54 ms, thereby confirming real-time capability.</description>

      <title>Layers of a City: Network-Based Insights into San Diego's Transportation Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing the structure and function of urban transportation networks is critical for enhancing mobility, equity, and resilience. This paper leverages network science to conduct a multi-modal analysis of San Diego's transportation system. We construct a multi-layer graph using data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS), representing driving, walking, and public transit layers. By integrating thousands of Points of Interest (POIs), we analyze network accessibility, structure, and resilience through centrality measures, community detection, and a proposed metric for walkability.
  Our analysis reveals a system defined by a stark core-periphery divide. We find that while the urban core is well-integrated, 30.3% of POIs are isolated from public transit within a walkable distance, indicating significant equity gaps in suburban and rural access. Centrality analysis highlights the driving network's over-reliance on critical freeways as bottlenecks, suggesting low network resilience, while confirming that San Diego is not a broadly walkable city. Furthermore, community detection demonstrates that transportation mode dictates the scale of mobility, producing compact, local clusters for walking and broad, regional clusters for driving. Collectively, this work provides a comprehensive framework for diagnosing urban mobility systems, offering quantitative insights that can inform targeted interventions to improve transportation equity and infrastructure resilience in San Diego.</description>

      <title>Improving Sequential Market Coordination via Value-oriented Renewable Energy Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Large penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs) brings huge uncertainty into the electricity markets. The current deterministic clearing approach in the day-ahead (DA) market, where RESs participate based on expected production, has been criticized for causing a lack of coordination between the DA and real-time (RT) markets, leading to high overall operating costs. Previous works indicate that improving day-ahead RES entering quantities can significantly mitigate the drawbacks of deterministic clearing. In this work, we propose using a trained forecasting model, referred to as value-oriented forecasting, to determine RES Improved Entering Quantities (RIEQ) more efficiently during the operational phase. Unlike traditional models that minimize statistical forecasting errors, our approach trains model parameters to minimize the expected overall operating costs across both DA and RT markets. We derive the exact form of the loss function used for training, which becomes piecewise linear when market clearing is modeled by linear programs. Additionally, we provide the analytical gradient of the loss function with respect to the forecast, enabling an efficient training strategy. Numerical studies demonstrate that our forecasts significantly reduce overall operating costs for deterministic market clearing compared to conventional forecasts based on expected RES production.</description>

      <title>CityLight: A Neighborhood-inclusive Universal Model for Coordinated City-scale Traffic Signal Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02126v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: City-scale traffic signal control (TSC) involves thousands of heterogeneous intersections with varying topologies, making cooperative decision-making across intersections particularly challenging. Given the prohibitive computational cost of learning individual policies for each intersection, some researchers explore learning a universal policy to control each intersection in a decentralized manner, where the key challenge is to construct a universal representation method for heterogeneous intersections. However, existing methods are limited to universally representing information of heterogeneous ego intersections, neglecting the essential representation of influence from their heterogeneous neighbors. Universally incorporating neighborhood information is nontrivial due to the intrinsic complexity of traffic flow interactions, as well as the challenge of modeling collective influences from neighbor intersections. To address these challenges, we propose CityLight, which learns a universal policy based on representations obtained with two major modules: a Neighbor Influence Encoder to explicitly model neighbor's influence with specified traffic flow relation and connectivity to the ego intersection; a Neighbor Influence Aggregator to attentively aggregate the influence of neighbors based on their mutual competitive relations. Extensive experiments on five city-scale datasets, ranging from 97 to 13,952 intersections, confirm the efficacy of CityLight, with an average throughput improvement of 11.68% and a lift of 22.59% for generalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11692v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Formal verification techniques play a pivotal role in ensuring the safety of complex cyber-physical systems. To transfer model-based verification results to the real world, we require that the measurements of the target system lie in the set of reachable outputs of the corresponding model, a property we refer to as reachset conformance. This paper is on automatically identifying those reachset-conformant models. While state-of-the-art reachset-conformant identification methods focus on linear state-space models, we generalize these methods to nonlinear state-space models and linear and nonlinear input-output models. Furthermore, our identification framework adapts to different levels of prior knowledge on the system dynamics. In particular, we identify the set of model uncertainties for white-box models, the parameters and the set of model uncertainties for gray-box models, and entire reachset-conformant black-box models from data. The robustness and efficacy of our framework are demonstrated in extensive numerical experiments using simulated and real-world data.</description>

      <title>SINDyG: Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems from Graph-Structured Data, with Applications to Stuart-Landau Oscillator Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04463v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The combination of machine learning (ML) and sparsity-promoting techniques is enabling direct extraction of governing equations from data, revolutionizing computational modeling in diverse fields of science and engineering. The discovered dynamical models could be used to address challenges in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, epidemiology, and beyond. However, most existing sparse identification methods for discovering dynamical systems treat the whole system as one without considering the interactions between subsystems. As a result, such models are not able to capture small changes in the emergent system behavior. To address this issue, we developed a new method called Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems from Graph-structured data (SINDyG), which incorporates the network structure into sparse regression to identify model parameters that explain the underlying network dynamics. We tested our proposed method using several case studies of neuronal dynamics, where we modeled the macroscopic oscillation of a population of neurons using the extended Stuart-Landau (SL) equation and utilize the SINDyG method to identify the underlying nonlinear dynamics. Our extensive computational experiments validate the improved accuracy and simplicity of discovered network dynamics when compared to the original SINDy approach. The proposed graph-informed penalty can be easily integrated with other symbolic regression algorithms, enhancing model interpretability and performance by incorporating network structure into the regression process.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Input Mapping Inversion to Eliminate Algebraic Loops in Hydraulic Actuator Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13389v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of nonlinear control schemes to electro-hydraulic actuators often requires several alterations in the design of the controllers during their implementation. This is to overcome challenges that frequently arise in such control algorithms owing to model nonlinearities. Moreover, advanced control solutions for this type of systems often introduce input algebraic loops that pose significant design and tuning difficulties. Conventional methods to avoid such loops introduce chatter, which considerably degrade tracking performance and has oil degradation and wear as side effects. This study presents a nonlinear control architecture for hydraulic actuators that comprises low-complexity modules that facilitate robust high performance in tracking and avoids the drawbacks of chatter. The salient feature is a dynamic input-mapping inversion module that avoids algebraic loops in the control input and is followed by dedicated position control. The stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed using arguments from Lyapunov theory for cascaded non-autonomous nonlinear systems. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is evaluated on a high-fidelity simulator of a wind turbine pitch system, and validated on a full-scale laboratory setup that includes a hydraulic pitch system and blade bearing. Appropriate quantitative metrics are used to evaluate the closed-loop system performance in comparison to a state-of-the-art nonlinear design.</description>

      <title>ALADIN-$\beta$: A Distributed Optimization Algorithm for Solving MPCC Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mathematical Programs with Complementarity Constraints (MPCC) are critical in various real-world applications but notoriously challenging due to non-smoothness and degeneracy from complementarity constraints. The $\ell_1$-Exact Penalty-Barrier enhanced \texttt{IPOPT} improves performance and robustness by introducing additional inequality constraints and decision variables. However, this comes at the cost of increased computational complexity due to the higher dimensionality and additional constraints introduced in the centralized formulation. To mitigate this, we propose a distributed structure-splitting reformulation that decomposes these inequality constraints and auxiliary variables into independent sub-problems. Furthermore, we introduce Augmented Lagrangian Alternating Direction Inexact Newton (ALADIN)-$\beta$, a novel approach that integrates the $\ell_1$-Exact Penalty-Barrier method with ALADIN to efficiently solve the distributed reformulation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that even without a globalization strategy, the proposed distributed approach achieves fast convergence while maintaining high precision.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Power Flow and Optimal Power Flow based on Combinatorial Reformulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces the Adiabatic Quantum Power Flow (AQPF) and Adiabatic Quantum Optimal Power Flow (AQOPF) algorithms to solve power flow (PF) and optimal power flow (OPF) problems, respectively. These algorithms utilize a novel combinatorial optimization reformulation of classical PF and OPF problems, and hence, enable their implementation on Ising machines, e.g., quantum and quantum-inspired hardware. The experiments are conducted on standard test cases ranging from 4-bus to 1354-bus systems, using D-Wave's Advantage system (QA), its hybrid quantum-classical solver (HA), as well as the third-generation Digital Annealer (DAv3) and Quantum-Inspired Integrated Optimization software (QIIO) developed by Fujitsu. The annealers are systematically evaluated based on: (i) full and partitioned formulations, (ii) ability to handle ill-conditioned cases, and (iii) scalability. The results are benchmarked against the Newton-Raphson numerical method (NR) and suggest that AQPF and AQOPF can serve as effective solvers or complementary tools to classical methods to address unsolved challenges in large-scale modern power systems.</description>

      <title>Advantages of Feedback in Distributed Data-Gathering for Accurate and Power-Efficient State-Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In distributed target-tracking sensor networks, efficient data gathering methods are necessary to save communication resources and assure information accuracy. This paper proposes a Feedback (FB) distributed data-gathering method which lets the central unit feed information back to the mobile sensors; each sensor then uses it to cancel redundant transmissions and reduce communication congestion. We rigorously compare its performance, in terms of mean-squared error (MSE) and cost of power per sensor, against more conventional Non-Feedback (NF) architectures by evaluating conditions of feasibility and advantage under different architecture specifications (e.g., communication delay rate, power cost rate, maximum back-off time, sampling period, observation noise). Here, we defined the advantage as the performance gain achieved by FB over NF, while FB is said to be feasible if the advantage region is nonempty. Our theoretical analyses show that the feasibility of FB depends more on the communication power cost, while the advantage depends on the sensors' propagation delay per transmission interval; we derive concrete conditions under which these outcomes hold. Using extensive numerical simulations under a variety of settings, we confirm the accuracy of the derived conditions, and show that our theoretical results hold even for more complex scenarios where the simplifying assumptions no longer hold.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Fusion for Multi-Sensor Systems Under Multiple Packet Dropouts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are critical components in modern cyber-physical systems, enabling efficient data collection and fusion through spatially distributed sensors. However, the inherent risks of eavesdropping and packet dropouts in such networks pose significant challenges to secure state estimation. In this paper, we address the privacy-preserving fusion estimation (PPFE) problem for multi-sensor systems under multiple packet dropouts and eavesdropping attacks. To mitigate these issues, we propose a distributed encoding-based privacy-preserving mechanism (PPM) within a control-theoretic framework, ensuring data privacy during transmission while maintaining the performance of legitimate state estimation. A centralized fusion filter is developed, accounting for the coupling effects of packet dropouts and the encoding-based PPM. Boundedness conditions for the legitimate user's estimation error covariance are derived via a modified algebraic Riccati equation. Additionally, by demonstrating the divergence of the eavesdropper's mean estimation error, the proposed PPFE algorithm's data confidentiality is rigorously analyzed. Simulation results for an Internet-based three-tank system validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, highlighting its potential to enhance privacy without compromising estimation accuracy.</description>

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance in various audio classification tasks. However, their real-time deployment remains a challenge on resource constrained devices such as embedded systems. In this paper, we analyze how the performance of large-scale pre-trained audio neural networks designed for audio pattern recognition changes when deployed on a hardware such as a Raspberry Pi. We empirically study the role of CPU temperature, microphone quality and audio signal volume on performance. Our experiments reveal that the continuous CPU usage results in an increased temperature that can trigger an automated slowdown mechanism in the Raspberry Pi, impacting inference latency. The quality of a microphone, specifically with affordable devices such as the Google AIY Voice Kit, and audio signal volume, all affect the system performance. In the course of our investigation, we encounter substantial complications linked to library compatibility and the unique processor architecture requirements of the Raspberry Pi, making the process less straightforward compared to conventional computers (PCs). Our observations, while presenting challenges, pave the way for future researchers to develop more compact machine learning models, design heat-dissipative hardware, and select appropriate microphones when AI models are deployed for real-time applications on edge devices.</description>

      <title>Coded Kalman Filtering over MIMO Gaussian Channels with Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of remotely stabilizing a dynamical system. A sensor (encoder) co-located with the system communicates with a controller (decoder), whose goal is to stabilize the system, over a noisy communication channel with feedback. To accomplish this, the controller must estimate the system state with finite mean squared error (MSE). The vector-valued dynamical system state follows a Gauss-Markov law with additive control. The channel is a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with feedback. For such a source, a linear encoder, and a MIMO AWGN channel, the minimal MSE decoder is a Kalman filter. The parameters of the Kalman filter and the linear encoder can be jointly optimized, under a power constraint at the channel input. We term the resulting encoder-decoder pair a coded Kalman filter. We establish sufficient and necessary conditions for the coded Kalman filter to achieve a finite MSE in the real-time estimation of the state. For sufficiency, we introduce a coding scheme where each unstable mode of the state is estimated using the channel outputs of a single sub-channel. We prove a coinciding necessity condition when either the source or channel is scalar and present a matrix-algebraic condition which implies the condition is necessary in general. Finally, we provide a new counter-example demonstrating that linear codes are generally sub-optimal for coding over MIMO channels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To solve the problem of lateral and logitudinal joint decision-making of multi-vehicle cooperative driving for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), this paper proposes a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) method with parallel update for multi-agent Markov game with limited horizon and time discounted setting. By analyzing the parallel actions in the multi-vehicle joint action space in the partial-steady-state traffic flow, the parallel update method can quickly exclude potential dangerous actions, thereby increasing the search depth without sacrificing the search breadth. The proposed method is tested in a large number of randomly generated traffic flow. The experiment results show that the algorithm has good robustness and better performance than the SOTA reinforcement learning algorithms and heuristic methods. The vehicle driving strategy using the proposed algorithm shows rationality beyond human drivers, and has advantages in traffic efficiency and safety in the coordinating zone.</description>

      <title>Split the Yield, Share the Risk: Pricing, Hedging and Fixed rates in DeFi</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first formal treatment of \emph{yield tokenization}, a mechanism that decomposes yield-bearing assets into principal and yield components to facilitate risk transfer and price discovery in decentralized finance (DeFi). We propose a model that characterizes yield token dynamics using stochastic differential equations. We derive a no-arbitrage pricing framework for yield tokens, enabling their use in hedging future yield volatility and managing interest rate risk in decentralized lending pools. Taking DeFi lending as our focus, we show how both borrowers and lenders can use yield tokens to achieve optimal hedging outcomes and mitigate exposure to adversarial interest rate manipulation. Furthermore, we design automated market makers (AMMs) that incorporate a menu of bonding curves to aggregate liquidity from participants with heterogeneous risk preferences. This leads to an efficient and incentive-compatible mechanism for trading yield tokens and yield futures. Building on these foundations, we propose a modular \textit{fixed-rate} lending protocol that synthesizes on-chain yield token markets and lending pools, enabling robust interest rate discovery and enhancing capital efficiency. Our work provides the theoretical underpinnings for risk management and fixed-income infrastructure in DeFi, offering practical mechanisms for stable and sustainable yield markets.</description>

      <title>Learning Pivoting Manipulation with Force and Vision Feedback Using Optimization-based Demonstrations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation is challenging due to complex contact interactions between objects, the environment, and robots. Model-based approaches can efficiently generate complex trajectories of robots and objects under contact constraints. However, they tend to be sensitive to model inaccuracies and require access to privileged information (e.g., object mass, size, pose), making them less suitable for novel objects. In contrast, learning-based approaches are typically more robust to modeling errors but require large amounts of data. In this paper, we bridge these two approaches to propose a framework for learning closed-loop pivoting manipulation. By leveraging computationally efficient Contact-Implicit Trajectory Optimization (CITO), we design demonstration-guided deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), leading to sample-efficient learning. We also present a sim-to-real transfer approach using a privileged training strategy, enabling the robot to perform pivoting manipulation using only proprioception, vision, and force sensing without access to privileged information.

      <title>Live Demonstration: Neuromorphic Radar for Gesture Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03324</link>

Abstract: We present a neuromorphic radar framework for real-time, low-power hand gesture recognition (HGR) using an event-driven architecture inspired by biological sensing. Our system comprises a 24 GHz Doppler radar front-end and a custom neuromorphic sampler that converts intermediate-frequency (IF) signals into sparse spike-based representations via asynchronous sigma-delta encoding. These events are directly processed by a lightweight neural network deployed on a Cortex-M0 microcontroller, enabling low-latency inference without requiring spectrogram reconstruction. Unlike conventional radar HGR pipelines that continuously sample and process data, our architecture activates only when meaningful motion is detected, significantly reducing memory, power, and computation overhead. Evaluated on a dataset of five gestures collected from seven users, our system achieves &gt; 85% real-time accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that employs bio-inspired asynchronous sigma-delta encoding and an event-driven processing framework for radar-based HGR.</description>

      <title>Streaming Generated Gaussian Process Experts for Online Learning and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs), as a nonparametric learning method, offer flexible modeling capabilities and calibrated uncertainty quantification for function approximations. Additionally, GPs support online learning by efficiently incorporating new data with polynomial-time computation, making them well-suited for safety-critical dynamical systems that require rapid adaptation. However, the inference and online updates of exact GPs, when processing streaming data, incur cubic computation time and quadratic storage memory complexity, limiting their scalability to large datasets in real-time settings. In this paper, we propose a streaming kernel-induced progressively generated expert framework of Gaussian processes (SkyGP) that addresses both computational and memory constraints by maintaining a bounded set of experts, while inheriting the learning performance guarantees from exact Gaussian processes. Furthermore, two SkyGP variants are introduced, each tailored to a specific objective, either maximizing prediction accuracy (SkyGP-Dense) or improving computational efficiency (SkyGP-Fast). The effectiveness of SkyGP is validated through extensive benchmarks and real-time control experiments demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</description>
