      <title>Monoidal Context Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We universally characterize the produoidal category of monoidal lenses over a monoidal category. In the same way that each category induces a cofree promonoidal category of spliced arrows, each monoidal category induces a cofree produoidal category of monoidal spliced arrows; monoidal lenses are the free normalization of the cofree produoidal category of monoidal spliced arrows. We apply the characterization of symmetric monoidal lenses to the analysis of multi-party message-passing protocols. We introduce a minimalistic axiomatization of message passing -- message theories -- and we construct combinatorially the free message theory over a set. Symmetric monoidal lenses are the derivations of the free message theory over a symmetric monoidal category.</description>

      <title>Module Categories As Spans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We realize module functors and module natural transforms as spans of monoidal categories. We also discuss the generalizations to algebras and modules within an arbitrary monoidal 2-category, including $\mathbf{2Vect}$, $\mathbf{2Rep}(G)$, $\mathbf{2Vect}^\pi_G$, $\mathbf{Mod}(\mathcal{B})$, $\mathbf{MCat}$ and $\mathbf{BrCat}$.</description>

      <title>Inverse Sets and Inverse Correspondences Over Inverse Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce notions called inverse set and inverse correspondence over inverse semigroups. These are analogies of Hilbert $C^*$-modules and \Ccorrs in the $C^*$-algebra theory. We show that inverse semigroups and inverse correspondences form a bicategory. In this bicategory, two inverse semigroups are equivalent if and only if they are Morita equivalent.</description>

      <title>The Rosick\'y Tangent Categories of Algebras over an Operad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05434v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tangent categories provide a categorical axiomatization of the tangent bundle. There are many interesting examples and applications of tangent categories in a variety of areas such as differential geometry, algebraic geometry, algebra, and even computer science. The purpose of this paper is to expand the theory of tangent categories in a new direction: the theory of operads. The main result of this paper is that both the category of algebras of an operad and its opposite category are tangent categories. The tangent bundle for the category of algebras is given by the semi-direct product, while the tangent bundle for the opposite category of algebras is constructed using the module of K\"ahler differentials, and these tangent bundles are in fact adjoints of one another. To prove these results, we first prove that the category of algebras of a coCartesian differential monad is a tangent category. We then show that the monad associated to any operad is a coCartesian differential monad. This also implies that we can construct Cartesian differential categories from operads. Therefore, operads provide a bountiful source of examples of tangent categories and Cartesian differential categories, which both recaptures previously known examples and also yield new interesting examples. We also discuss how certain basic tangent category notions recapture well-known concepts in the theory of operads.</description>

      <title>Homology and homotopy for arbitrary categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the prime motivation for topology was Homotopy theory, which captures the general idea of a continuous transformation between two entities, which may be spaces or maps. In later decades, an algebraic formulation of topology was discovered with the development of Homology theory. Some of the deepest results in topology are about the connections between Homotopy and Homology. These results are proved using intricate constructions. This paper takes an axiomatic approach that provides a common ground for homotopy and homology in arbitrary categories. The axioms have simple and natural motivations, and lead to the deeper connections between homotopy and homology.</description>

      <title>Functors on relational structures which admit both left and right adjoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13657v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper describes several cases of adjunction in the homomorphism preorder of relational structures. We say that two functors $\Lambda$ and $\Gamma$ between thin categories of relational structures are adjoint if for all structures $\mathbf A$ and $\mathbf B$, we have that $\Lambda(\mathbf A)$ maps homomorphically to $\mathbf B$ if and only if $\mathbf A$ maps homomorphically to $\Gamma(\mathbf B)$. If this is the case, $\Lambda$ is called the left adjoint to $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma$ the right adjoint to $\Lambda$. In 2015, Foniok and Tardif described some functors on the category of digraphs that allow both left and right adjoints. The main contribution of Foniok and Tardif is a construction of right adjoints to some of the functors identified as right adjoints by Pultr in 1970. We generalise results of Foniok and Tardif to arbitrary relational structures, and coincidently, we also provide more right adjoints on digraphs, and since these constructions are connected to finite duality, we also provide a new construction of duals to trees. Our results are inspired by an application in promise constraint satisfaction -- it has been shown that such functors can be used as efficient reductions between these problems.</description>

      <title>Philosophy of contraherent cosheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14179v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contraherent cosheaves are module objects over algebraic varieties defined by gluing using the colocalization functors. Contraherent cosheaves are designed to be used for globalizing contramodules and contraderived categories for the purposes of Koszul duality and semi-infinite algebraic geometry. One major technical problem associated with contraherent cosheaves is that the colocalization functors, unlike the localizations, are not exact. The reason is that, given a commutative ring homomorphism $R\rightarrow S$ arising in connection with a typical covering in algebraic geometry, the ring $S$ is usually a flat, but not a projective $R$-module. We argue that the relevant difference between projective and flat modules, from the standpoint of homological algebra, is not that big, as manifested by the flat/projective and cotorsion periodicity theorems. The difference becomes even smaller if one observes that the ring $S$ is often a very flat $R$-module.</description>

      <title>Sections of Fell Bundles over \'Etale Groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the reduced and essential C*-algebra of a Fell bundle over an \'etale groupoid (in full generality, without any second countability, local compactness or Hausdorff assumptions, even on the unit space) directly from sections under convolution. This eliminates the j-map commonly seen in the groupoid and Fell bundle C*-algebra literature. We further show how multiplier algebras and other Banach *-bimodules can again be constructed directly from sections. Finally, we extend Varela's morphisms from C*-bundles to Fell bundles, thus making the reduced C*-algebra construction functorial.</description>
