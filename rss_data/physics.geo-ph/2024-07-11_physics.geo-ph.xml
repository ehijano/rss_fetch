      <title>A Joint Inversion of Sources and Seismic Waveforms for Velocity Distribution: 1-D and 2-D Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Waveform inversion is theoretically a powerful tool to reconstruct subsurface structures, but a usually encountered problem is that accurate sources are very rare, causing the computation unstable and divergent. This challenging problem, although sometimes ignored and even imperceptible, can easily create discrepancies in calculated shot gathers, which will then lead to wrong residuals that must be migrated back to the gradients, hence jeopardizing the inverted tomograms. In practice, any shot gather may correspond to its own source even if some of them can be transformed alike after data processing. To resolve this problem, we propose a collocated inversion of sources and early arrival waveforms with the two submodules executing alternatively. Not only can this method produce a decent wavelet that approaches the true source or an equivalent source, but more importantly, it can also invert for credible background velocity models with the optimized sources. Part of the cycle skipping problems can also be mitigated because it avoids the trial and error experiments on various sources. Numerical tests upon a series of different conditions validate the effectiveness of this method. Restrictions on initial sources or starting velocity models will be relaxed with this method, and it can be extended to any other applications for engineering or exploration purposes.</description>

      <title>A rotational ellipsoid model for solid Earth tide with high precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid Earth tide represents the elastic response of solid Earth to the lunar (solar) gravitational force. The yielding solid Earth due to the force has been thought to be a prolate ellipsoid since the time of Lord Kelvin, yet the ellipsoid's geometry such as semi-major axis's length, semi-minor axis's length, and oblateness remains unresolved. Additionally, the tidal displacement of solid Earth is conventionally resolved through a combination of expanded potential equations and given Earth model. Here we present a geometric model in which both the ellipsoid's geometry and the tidal displacement of solid Earth can be resolved through a rotating ellipse with respect to the Moon (Sun). We test the geometric model using 23-year gravity data from 22 superconducting gravimeter (SG) stations and compare it with the current model recommended by the IERS (International Earth Rotation System) conventions (2010), the average Root Mean Square (RMS) deviation of the gravity change yielded by the geometric model against observation is 6.47 {\mu}Gal (equivalent to 2.07 cm), while that yielded by the current model is 30.77{\mu}Gal (equivalent to 9.85 cm). The geometric model represents a significant advance in understanding and predicting solid Earth tide, and will greatly contribute to many application fields such as geodesy, geophysics, astronomy, and oceanography.</description>

      <title>Alternative climatic steady states for the Permian-Triassic paleogeography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to spatial scarcity and uncertainties in sediment data, initial and boundary conditions in deep-time climate simulations are not well constrained. On the other hand, the climate is a nonlinear system with a multitude of feedback mechanisms that compete and balance differently depending on the initial and boundary conditions. This opens up the possibility to obtain multiple steady states under the same forcing in numerical experiments. Here, we use the MIT general circulation model with a coupled atmosphere-ocean-thermodynamic sea ice-land configuration to explore the existence of such alternative steady states around the Permian-Triassic Boundary (PTB). We construct the corresponding bifurcation diagram, taking into account processes on a timescale of thousands of years, in order to identify the stability range of the steady states and tipping points as the atmospheric CO$_2$ content is varied. We find three alternative steady states with a difference in global mean surface air temperature of about 10 $^\circ$C. We also examine how these climatic steady states are modified when feedbacks operating on comparable or longer time scales are included, in particular vegetation dynamics and air-sea carbon exchanges. Our findings on multistability provide a useful framework for explaining the climatic variations observed in the Early Triassic geological record, as well as some discrepancies between numerical simulations in the literature and geological data at PTB and its aftermath.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Solitary Electrostatic Structures in Collisionless Plasma: Phase-Space Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physics of isolated plasma potential structures sustained by a deficit of phase-space density on trapped orbits, commonly known as electron or ion holes, is reviewed. The principles of their equilibria are explained and illustrated, and contrasted with solitons. A literature review mostly prior to 2016 highlights the key historical developments of the field. Progress since, especially in hole acceleration, stability, and multi-dimensional effects, is summarized in more detail.</description>
