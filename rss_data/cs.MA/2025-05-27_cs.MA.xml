      <title>Implementing Agents in JavaScript</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter gives an introduction to agent-oriented programming in JavaScript. It provides an example-based walk-through of how to implement abstractions for reasoning loop agents in vanilla JavaScript. The initial example is used as a stepping stone for explaining how to implement slightly more advanced agents and multi-agent systems using JS-son, a JavaScript library for agent-oriented programming. In this context, the chapter also explains how to integrate reasoning loop agents with generative AI technologies--specifically, large language models. Finally, application scenarios in several technology ecosystems and future research directions are sketched.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Memory: Multi-User Memory Sharing in LLM Agents with Dynamic Access Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex tasks are increasingly delegated to ensembles of specialized LLM-based agents that reason, communicate, and coordinate actions-both among themselves and through interactions with external tools, APIs, and databases. While persistent memory has been shown to enhance single-agent performance, most approaches assume a monolithic, single-user context-overlooking the benefits and challenges of knowledge transfer across users under dynamic, asymmetric permissions. We introduce Collaborative Memory, a framework for multi-user, multi-agent environments with asymmetric, time-evolving access controls encoded as bipartite graphs linking users, agents, and resources. Our system maintains two memory tiers: (1) private memory-private fragments visible only to their originating user; and (2) shared memory-selectively shared fragments. Each fragment carries immutable provenance attributes (contributing agents, accessed resources, and timestamps) to support retrospective permission checks. Granular read policies enforce current user-agent-resource constraints and project existing memory fragments into filtered transformed views. Write policies determine fragment retention and sharing, applying context-aware transformations to update the memory. Both policies may be designed conditioned on system, agent, and user-level information. Our framework enables safe, efficient, and interpretable cross-user knowledge sharing, with provable adherence to asymmetric, time-varying policies and full auditability of memory operations.</description>

      <title>Single-agent or Multi-agent Systems? Why Not Both?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) decompose complex tasks and delegate subtasks to different large language model (LLM) agents and tools. Prior studies have reported the superior accuracy performance of MAS across diverse domains, enabled by long-horizon context tracking and error correction through role-specific agents. However, the design and deployment of MAS incur higher complexity and runtime cost compared to single-agent systems (SAS). Meanwhile, frontier LLMs, such as OpenAI-o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro, have rapidly advanced in long-context reasoning, memory retention, and tool usage, mitigating many limitations that originally motivated MAS designs. In this paper, we conduct an extensive empirical study comparing MAS and SAS across various popular agentic applications. We find that the benefits of MAS over SAS diminish as LLM capabilities improve, and we propose efficient mechanisms to pinpoint the error-prone agent in MAS. Furthermore, the performance discrepancy between MAS and SAS motivates our design of a hybrid agentic paradigm, request cascading between MAS and SAS, to improve both efficiency and capability. Our design improves accuracy by 1.1-12% while reducing deployment costs by up to 20% across various agentic applications.</description>

      <title>Persona Alchemy: Designing, Evaluating, and Implementing Psychologically-Grounded LLM Agents for Diverse Stakeholder Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite advances in designing personas for Large Language Models (LLM), challenges remain in aligning them with human cognitive processes and representing diverse stakeholder perspectives. We introduce a Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) agent design framework for designing, evaluating, and implementing psychologically grounded LLMs with consistent behavior. Our framework operationalizes SCT through four personal factors (cognitive, motivational, biological, and affective) for designing, six quantifiable constructs for evaluating, and a graph database-backed architecture for implementing stakeholder personas. Experiments tested agents' responses to contradicting information of varying reliability. In the highly polarized renewable energy transition discourse, we design five diverse agents with distinct ideologies, roles, and stakes to examine stakeholder representation. The evaluation of these agents in contradictory scenarios occurs through comprehensive processes that implement the SCT. Results show consistent response patterns ($R^2$ range: $0.58-0.61$) and systematic temporal development of SCT construct effects. Principal component analysis identifies two dimensions explaining $73$% of variance, validating the theoretical structure. Our framework offers improved explainability and reproducibility compared to black-box approaches. This work contributes to ongoing efforts to improve diverse stakeholder representation while maintaining psychological consistency in LLM personas.</description>

      <title>An Outlook on the Opportunities and Challenges of Multi-Agent AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent AI systems (MAS) offer a promising framework for distributed intelligence, enabling collaborative reasoning, planning, and decision-making across autonomous agents. This paper provides a systematic outlook on the current opportunities and challenges of MAS, drawing insights from recent advances in large language models (LLMs), federated optimization, and human-AI interaction. We formalize key concepts including agent topology, coordination protocols, and shared objectives, and identify major risks such as dependency, misalignment, and vulnerabilities arising from training data overlap. Through a biologically inspired simulation and comprehensive theoretical framing, we highlight critical pathways for developing robust, scalable, and secure MAS in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>MRGAgents: A Multi-Agent Framework for Improved Medical Report Generation with Med-LVLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) have been widely adopted for medical report generation. Despite Med-LVLMs producing state-of-the-art performance, they exhibit a bias toward predicting all findings as normal, leading to reports that overlook critical abnormalities. Furthermore, these models often fail to provide comprehensive descriptions of radiologically relevant regions necessary for accurate diagnosis. To address these challenges, we proposeMedical Report Generation Agents (MRGAgents), a novel multi-agent framework that fine-tunes specialized agents for different disease categories. By curating subsets of the IU X-ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets to train disease-specific agents, MRGAgents generates reports that more effectively balance normal and abnormal findings while ensuring a comprehensive description of clinically relevant regions. Our experiments demonstrate that MRGAgents outperformed the state-of-the-art, improving both report comprehensiveness and diagnostic utility.</description>

      <title>MASTER: Multi-Agent Security Through Exploration of Roles and Topological Structures -- A Comprehensive Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) exhibit remarkable problem-solving and task planning capabilities across diverse domains due to their specialized agentic roles and collaborative interactions. However, this also amplifies the severity of security risks under MAS attacks. To address this, we introduce MASTER, a novel security research framework for MAS, focusing on diverse Role configurations and Topological structures across various scenarios. MASTER offers an automated construction process for different MAS setups and an information-flow-based interaction paradigm. To tackle MAS security challenges in varied scenarios, we design a scenario-adaptive, extensible attack strategy utilizing role and topological information, which dynamically allocates targeted, domain-specific attack tasks for collaborative agent execution. Our experiments demonstrate that such an attack, leveraging role and topological information, exhibits significant destructive potential across most models. Additionally, we propose corresponding defense strategies, substantially enhancing MAS resilience across diverse scenarios. We anticipate that our framework and findings will provide valuable insights for future research into MAS security challenges.</description>

      <title>Making Teams and Influencing Agents: Efficiently Coordinating Decision Trees for Interpretable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poor interpretability hinders the practical applicability of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) policies. Deploying interpretable surrogates of uninterpretable policies enhances the safety and verifiability of MARL for real-world applications. However, if these surrogates are to interact directly with the environment within human supervisory frameworks, they must be both performant and computationally efficient. Prior work on interpretable MARL has either sacrificed performance for computational efficiency or computational efficiency for performance. To address this issue, we propose HYDRAVIPER, a decision tree-based interpretable MARL algorithm. HYDRAVIPER coordinates training between agents based on expected team performance, and adaptively allocates budgets for environment interaction to improve computational efficiency. Experiments on standard benchmark environments for multi-agent coordination and traffic signal control show that HYDRAVIPER matches the performance of state-of-the-art methods using a fraction of the runtime, and that it maintains a Pareto frontier of performance for different interaction budgets.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Episode Length Adjustment for Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In standard reinforcement learning, an episode is defined as a sequence of interactions between agents and the environment, which terminates upon reaching a terminal state or a pre-defined episode length. Setting a shorter episode length enables the generation of multiple episodes with the same number of data samples, thereby facilitating an exploration of diverse states. While shorter episodes may limit the collection of long-term interactions, they may offer significant advantages when properly managed. For example, trajectory truncation in single-agent reinforcement learning has shown how the benefits of shorter episodes can be leveraged despite the trade-off of reduced long-term interaction experiences. However, this approach remains underexplored in MARL. This paper proposes a novel MARL approach, Adaptive Episode Length Adjustment (AELA), where the episode length is initially limited and gradually increased based on an entropy-based assessment of learning progress. By starting with shorter episodes, agents can focus on learning effective strategies for initial states and minimize time spent in dead-end states. The use of entropy as an assessment metric prevents premature convergence to suboptimal policies and ensures balanced training over varying episode lengths. We validate our approach using the StarCraft Multi-agent Challenge (SMAC) and a modified predator-prey environment, demonstrating significant improvements in both convergence speed and overall performance compared to existing methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to adaptively adjust episode length in MARL based on learning progress.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Cybersecurity: From Fundamentals to Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown great potential as an adaptive solution for addressing modern cybersecurity challenges. MARL enables decentralized, adaptive, and collaborative defense strategies and provides an automated mechanism to combat dynamic, coordinated, and sophisticated threats. This survey investigates the current state of research in MARL applications for automated cyber defense (ACD), focusing on intruder detection and lateral movement containment. Additionally, it examines the role of Autonomous Intelligent Cyber-defense Agents (AICA) and Cyber Gyms in training and validating MARL agents. Finally, the paper outlines existing challenges, such as scalability and adversarial robustness, and proposes future research directions. This also discusses how MARL integrates in AICA to provide adaptive, scalable, and dynamic solutions to counter the increasingly sophisticated landscape of cyber threats. It highlights the transformative potential of MARL in areas like intrusion detection and lateral movement containment, and underscores the value of Cyber Gyms for training and validation of AICA.</description>

      <title>TAGS: A Test-Time Generalist-Specialist Framework with Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning and Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances such as Chain-of-Thought prompting have significantly improved large language models (LLMs) in zero-shot medical reasoning. However, prompting-based methods often remain shallow and unstable, while fine-tuned medical LLMs suffer from poor generalization under distribution shifts and limited adaptability to unseen clinical scenarios. To address these limitations, we present TAGS, a test-time framework that combines a broadly capable generalist with a domain-specific specialist to offer complementary perspectives without any model fine-tuning or parameter updates. To support this generalist-specialist reasoning process, we introduce two auxiliary modules: a hierarchical retrieval mechanism that provides multi-scale exemplars by selecting examples based on both semantic and rationale-level similarity, and a reliability scorer that evaluates reasoning consistency to guide final answer aggregation. TAGS achieves strong performance across nine MedQA benchmarks, boosting GPT-4o accuracy by 13.8%, DeepSeek-R1 by 16.8%, and improving a vanilla 7B model from 14.1% to 23.9%. These results surpass several fine-tuned medical LLMs, without any parameter updates. The code will be available at https://github.com/JianghaoWu/TAGS.</description>

      <title>Finite-Time Global Optimality Convergence in Deep Neural Actor-Critic Methods for Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Actor-critic methods for decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) facilitate collaborative optimal decision making without centralized coordination, thus enabling a wide range of applications in practice. To date, however, most theoretical convergence studies for existing actor-critic decentralized MARL methods are limited to the guarantee of a stationary solution under the linear function approximation. This leaves a significant gap between the highly successful use of deep neural actor-critic for decentralized MARL in practice and the current theoretical understanding. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we make the first attempt to develop a deep neural actor-critic method for decentralized MARL, where both the actor and critic components are inherently non-linear. We show that our proposed method enjoys a global optimality guarantee with a finite-time convergence rate of O(1/T), where T is the total iteration times. This marks the first global convergence result for deep neural actor-critic methods in the MARL literature. We also conduct extensive numerical experiments, which verify our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>MisoDICE: Multi-Agent Imitation from Unlabeled Mixed-Quality Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study offline imitation learning (IL) in cooperative multi-agent settings, where demonstrations have unlabeled mixed quality - containing both expert and suboptimal trajectories. Our proposed solution is structured in two stages: trajectory labeling and multi-agent imitation learning, designed jointly to enable effective learning from heterogeneous, unlabeled data. In the first stage, we combine advances in large language models and preference-based reinforcement learning to construct a progressive labeling pipeline that distinguishes expert-quality trajectories. In the second stage, we introduce MisoDICE, a novel multi-agent IL algorithm that leverages these labels to learn robust policies while addressing the computational complexity of large joint state-action spaces. By extending the popular single-agent DICE framework to multi-agent settings with a new value decomposition and mixing architecture, our method yields a convex policy optimization objective and ensures consistency between global and local policies. We evaluate MisoDICE on multiple standard multi-agent RL benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance, especially when expert data is scarce.</description>

      <title>DDO: Dual-Decision Optimization via Multi-Agent Collaboration for LLM-Based Medical Consultation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong generalization and reasoning abilities, making them well-suited for complex decision-making tasks such as medical consultation (MC). However, existing LLM-based methods often fail to capture the dual nature of MC, which entails two distinct sub-tasks: symptom inquiry, a sequential decision-making process, and disease diagnosis, a classification problem. This mismatch often results in ineffective symptom inquiry and unreliable disease diagnosis. To address this, we propose \textbf{DDO}, a novel LLM-based framework that performs \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{D}ecision \textbf{O}ptimization by decoupling and independently optimizing the the two sub-tasks through a collaborative multi-agent workflow.

      <title>Coordinated guidance and control for multiple parafoil system landing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple parafoil landing is an enabling technology for massive supply delivery missions. However, it is still an open question to design a collision-free, computation-efficient guidance and control method for unpowered parafoils. To address this issue, this paper proposes a coordinated guidance and control method for multiple parafoil landing. First, the multiple parafoil landing process is formulated as a trajectory optimization problem. Then, the landing point allocation algorithm is designed to assign the landing point to each parafoil. In order to guarantee flight safety, the collision-free trajectory replanning algorithm is designed. On this basis, the nonlinear model predictive control algorithm is adapted to leverage the nonlinear dynamics model for trajectory tracking. Finally, the parafoil kinematic model is utilized to reduce the computational burden of trajectory calculation, and kinematic model is updated by the moving horizon correction algorithm to improve the trajectory accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed coordinated guidance and control method for the multiple parafoil landing.</description>

      <title>SANNet: A Semantic-Aware Agentic AI Networking Framework for Multi-Agent Cross-Layer Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic AI networking (AgentNet) is a novel AI-native networking paradigm that relies on a large number of specialized AI agents to collaborate and coordinate for autonomous decision-making, dynamic environmental adaptation, and complex goal achievement. It has the potential to facilitate real-time network management alongside capabilities for self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-adaptation across diverse and complex networking environments, laying the foundation for fully autonomous networking systems in the future. Despite its promise, AgentNet is still in the early stage of development, and there still lacks an effective networking framework to support automatic goal discovery and multi-agent self-orchestration and task assignment. This paper proposes SANNet, a novel semantic-aware agentic AI networking architecture that can infer the semantic goal of the user and automatically assign agents associated with different layers of a mobile system to fulfill the inferred goal. Motivated by the fact that one of the major challenges in AgentNet is that different agents may have different and even conflicting objectives when collaborating for certain goals, we introduce a dynamic weighting-based conflict-resolving mechanism to address this issue. We prove that SANNet can provide theoretical guarantee in both conflict-resolving and model generalization performance for multi-agent collaboration in dynamic environment. We develop a hardware prototype of SANNet based on the open RAN and 5GS core platform. Our experimental results show that SANNet can significantly improve the performance of multi-agent networking systems, even when agents with conflicting objectives are selected to collaborate for the same goal.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Bandit over Bandits: Hierarchical Bandits for Online Configuration Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by dynamic parameter optimization in finite, but large action (configurations) spaces, this work studies the nonstochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem in metric action spaces with oblivious Lipschitz adversaries. We propose ABoB, a hierarchical Adversarial Bandit over Bandits algorithm that can use state-of-the-art existing "flat" algorithms, but additionally clusters similar configurations to exploit local structures and adapt to changing environments. We prove that in the worst-case scenario, such clustering approach cannot hurt too much and ABoB guarantees a standard worst-case regret bound of $O\left(k^{\frac{1}{2}}T^{\frac{1}{2}}\right)$, where $T$ is the number of rounds and $k$ is the number of arms, matching the traditional flat approach. However, under favorable conditions related to the algorithm properties, clusters properties, and certain Lipschitz conditions, the regret bound can be improved to $O\left(k^{\frac{1}{4}}T^{\frac{1}{2}}\right)$. Simulations and experiments on a real storage system demonstrate that ABoB, using standard algorithms like EXP3 and Tsallis-INF, achieves lower regret and faster convergence than the flat method, up to 50% improvement in known previous setups, nonstochastic and stochastic, as well as in our settings.</description>

      <title>OptiMindTune: A Multi-Agent Framework for Intelligent Hyperparameter Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is a critical yet challenging aspect of machine learning model development, significantly impacting model performance and generalization. Traditional HPO methods often struggle with high dimensionality, complex interdependencies, and computational expense. This paper introduces OptiMindTune, a novel multi-agent framework designed to intelligently and efficiently optimize hyperparameters. OptiMindTune leverages the collaborative intelligence of three specialized AI agents -- a Recommender Agent, an Evaluator Agent, and a Decision Agent -- each powered by Google's Gemini models. These agents address distinct facets of the HPO problem, from model selection and hyperparameter suggestion to robust evaluation and strategic decision-making. By fostering dynamic interactions and knowledge sharing, OptiMindTune aims to converge to optimal hyperparameter configurations more rapidly and robustly than existing single-agent or monolithic approaches. Our framework integrates principles from advanced large language models, and adaptive search to achieve scalable and intelligent AutoML. We posit that this multi-agent paradigm offers a promising avenue for tackling the increasing complexity of modern machine learning model tuning.</description>

      <title>Where Paths Collide: A Comprehensive Survey of Classic and Learning-Based Multi-Agent Pathfinding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence and robotics, requiring the computation of collision-free paths for multiple agents navigating from their start locations to designated goals. As autonomous systems become increasingly prevalent in warehouses, urban transportation, and other complex environments, MAPF has evolved from a theoretical challenge to a critical enabler of real-world multi-robot coordination. This comprehensive survey bridges the long-standing divide between classical algorithmic approaches and emerging learning-based methods in MAPF research. We present a unified framework that encompasses search-based methods (including Conflict-Based Search, Priority-Based Search, and Large Neighborhood Search), compilation-based approaches (SAT, SMT, CSP, ASP, and MIP formulations), and data-driven techniques (reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and hybrid strategies). Through systematic analysis of experimental practices across 200+ papers, we uncover significant disparities in evaluation methodologies, with classical methods typically tested on larger-scale instances (up to 200 by 200 grids with 1000+ agents) compared to learning-based approaches (predominantly 10-100 agents). We provide a comprehensive taxonomy of evaluation metrics, environment types, and baseline selections, highlighting the need for standardized benchmarking protocols. Finally, we outline promising future directions including mixed-motive MAPF with game-theoretic considerations, language-grounded planning with large language models, and neural solver architectures that combine the rigor of classical methods with the flexibility of deep learning. This survey serves as both a comprehensive reference for researchers and a practical guide for deploying MAPF solutions in increasingly complex real-world applications.</description>

      <title>GUARDIAN: Safeguarding LLM Multi-Agent Collaborations with Temporal Graph Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) enables the development of intelligent agents capable of engaging in complex and multi-turn dialogues. However, multi-agent collaboration face critical safety challenges, such as hallucination amplification and error injection and propagation. This paper presents GUARDIAN, a unified method for detecting and mitigating multiple safety concerns in GUARDing Intelligent Agent collaboratioNs. By modeling the multi-agent collaboration process as a discrete-time temporal attributed graph, GUARDIAN explicitly captures the propagation dynamics of hallucinations and errors. The unsupervised encoder-decoder architecture incorporating an incremental training paradigm, learns to reconstruct node attributes and graph structures from latent embeddings, enabling the identification of anomalous nodes and edges with unparalleled precision. Moreover, we introduce a graph abstraction mechanism based on the Information Bottleneck Theory, which compresses temporal interaction graphs while preserving essential patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate GUARDIAN's effectiveness in safeguarding LLM multi-agent collaborations against diverse safety vulnerabilities, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with efficient resource utilization.</description>

Abstract: We develop information theory for the temporal behavior of memoryful agents moving through complex -- structured, stochastic -- environments. We introduce information processes -- stochastic processes produced by cognitive agents in real-time as they interact with and interpret incoming stimuli. We provide basic results on the ergodicity and semantics of the resulting time series of Shannon information measures that monitor an agent's adapting view of uncertainty and structural correlation in its environment.</description>

      <title>A Novel Zero-Trust Identity Framework for Agentic AI: Decentralized Authentication and Fine-Grained Access Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems, primarily designed for human users or static machine identities via protocols such as OAuth, OpenID Connect (OIDC), and SAML, prove fundamentally inadequate for the dynamic, interdependent, and often ephemeral nature of AI agents operating at scale within Multi Agent Systems (MAS), a computational system composed of multiple interacting intelligent agents that work collectively.
  This paper posits the imperative for a novel Agentic AI IAM framework: We deconstruct the limitations of existing protocols when applied to MAS, illustrating with concrete examples why their coarse-grained controls, single-entity focus, and lack of context-awareness falter. We then propose a comprehensive framework built upon rich, verifiable Agent Identities (IDs), leveraging Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), that encapsulate an agents capabilities, provenance, behavioral scope, and security posture.
  Our framework includes an Agent Naming Service (ANS) for secure and capability-aware discovery, dynamic fine-grained access control mechanisms, and critically, a unified global session management and policy enforcement layer for real-time control and consistent revocation across heterogeneous agent communication protocols. We also explore how Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) enable privacy-preserving attribute disclosure and verifiable policy compliance.
  We outline the architecture, operational lifecycle, innovative contributions, and security considerations of this new IAM paradigm, aiming to establish the foundational trust, accountability, and security necessary for the burgeoning field of agentic AI and the complex ecosystems they will inhabit.</description>

      <title>Win Fast or Lose Slow: Balancing Speed and Accuracy in Latency-Sensitive Decisions of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across diverse reasoning and generation tasks, and are increasingly deployed as agents in dynamic environments such as code generation and recommendation systems. However, many real-world applications, such as high-frequency trading and real-time competitive gaming, require decisions under strict latency constraints, where faster responses directly translate into higher rewards. Despite the importance of this latency quality trade off, it remains underexplored in the context of LLM based agents. In this work, we present the first systematic study of this trade off in real time decision making tasks. To support our investigation, we introduce two new benchmarks: HFTBench, a high frequency trading simulation, and StreetFighter, a competitive gaming platform. Our analysis reveals that optimal latency quality balance varies by task, and that sacrificing quality for lower latency can significantly enhance downstream performance. To address this, we propose FPX, an adaptive framework that dynamically selects model size and quantization level based on real time demands. Our method achieves the best performance on both benchmarks, improving win rate by up to 80% in Street Fighter and boosting daily yield by up to 26.52% in trading, underscoring the need for latency aware evaluation and deployment strategies for LLM based agents. These results demonstrate the critical importance of latency aware evaluation and deployment strategies for real world LLM based agents. Our benchmarks are available at Latency Sensitive Benchmarks.</description>

      <title>VLMLight: Traffic Signal Control via Vision-Language Meta-Control and Dual-Branch Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic signal control (TSC) is a core challenge in urban mobility, where real-time decisions must balance efficiency and safety. Existing methods - ranging from rule-based heuristics to reinforcement learning (RL) - often struggle to generalize to complex, dynamic, and safety-critical scenarios. We introduce VLMLight, a novel TSC framework that integrates vision-language meta-control with dual-branch reasoning. At the core of VLMLight is the first image-based traffic simulator that enables multi-view visual perception at intersections, allowing policies to reason over rich cues such as vehicle type, motion, and spatial density. A large language model (LLM) serves as a safety-prioritized meta-controller, selecting between a fast RL policy for routine traffic and a structured reasoning branch for critical cases. In the latter, multiple LLM agents collaborate to assess traffic phases, prioritize emergency vehicles, and verify rule compliance. Experiments show that VLMLight reduces waiting times for emergency vehicles by up to 65% over RL-only systems, while preserving real-time performance in standard conditions with less than 1% degradation. VLMLight offers a scalable, interpretable, and safety-aware solution for next-generation traffic signal control.</description>

      <title>DoctorRAG: Medical RAG Fusing Knowledge with Patient Analogy through Textual Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing medical RAG systems mainly leverage knowledge from medical knowledge bases, neglecting the crucial role of experiential knowledge derived from similar patient cases -- a key component of human clinical reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose DoctorRAG, a RAG framework that emulates doctor-like reasoning by integrating both explicit clinical knowledge and implicit case-based experience. DoctorRAG enhances retrieval precision by first allocating conceptual tags for queries and knowledge sources, together with a hybrid retrieval mechanism from both relevant knowledge and patient. In addition, a Med-TextGrad module using multi-agent textual gradients is integrated to ensure that the final output adheres to the retrieved knowledge and patient query. Comprehensive experiments on multilingual, multitask datasets demonstrate that DoctorRAG significantly outperforms strong baseline RAG models and gains improvements from iterative refinements. Our approach generates more accurate, relevant, and comprehensive responses, taking a step towards more doctor-like medical reasoning systems.</description>

      <title>LLM-Agent-Controller: A Universal Multi-Agent Large Language Model System as a Control Engineer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents the LLM-Agent-Controller, a multi-agent large language model (LLM) system developed to address a wide range of problems in control engineering (Control Theory). The system integrates a central controller agent with multiple specialized auxiliary agents, responsible for tasks such as controller design, model representation, control analysis, time-domain response, and simulation. A supervisor oversees high-level decision-making and workflow coordination, enhancing the system's reliability and efficiency. The LLM-Agent-Controller incorporates advanced capabilities, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Chain-of-Thought reasoning, self-criticism and correction, efficient memory handling, and user-friendly natural language communication. It is designed to function without requiring users to have prior knowledge of Control Theory, enabling them to input problems in plain language and receive complete, real-time solutions. To evaluate the system, we propose new performance metrics assessing both individual agents and the system as a whole. We test five categories of Control Theory problems and benchmark performance across three advanced LLMs. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive qualitative conversational analysis covering all key services. Results show that the LLM-Agent-Controller successfully solved 83% of general tasks, with individual agents achieving an average success rate of 87%. Performance improved with more advanced LLMs. This research demonstrates the potential of multi-agent LLM architectures to solve complex, domain-specific problems. By integrating specialized agents, supervisory control, and advanced reasoning, the LLM-Agent-Controller offers a scalable, robust, and accessible solution framework that can be extended to various technical domains.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Collaboration via Evolving Orchestration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results across diverse downstream tasks, but their monolithic nature restricts scalability and efficiency in complex problem-solving. While recent research explores multi-agent collaboration among LLMs, most approaches rely on static organizational structures that struggle to adapt as task complexity and agent numbers grow, resulting in coordination overhead and inefficiencies. To this end, we propose a puppeteer-style paradigm for LLM-based multi-agent collaboration, where a centralized orchestrator ("puppeteer") dynamically directs agents ("puppets") in response to evolving task states. This orchestrator is trained via reinforcement learning to adaptively sequence and prioritize agents, enabling flexible and evolvable collective reasoning. Experiments on closed- and open-domain scenarios show that this method achieves superior performance with reduced computational costs. Analyses further reveal that the key improvements consistently stem from the emergence of more compact, cyclic reasoning structures under the orchestrator's evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the distributed set-membership filtering (SMFing) problem for a multi-agent system with absolute (taken from agents themselves) and relative (taken from neighbors) measurements. In the literature, the relative measurements are difficult to deal with, and the SMFs highly rely on specific set descriptions. As a result, establishing the general distributed SMFing framework having relative measurements is still an open problem. To solve this problem, first, we provide the set description based on uncertain variables determined by the relative measurements between two agents as the foundation. Surprisingly, the accurate description requires only a single calculation step rather than multiple iterations, which can effectively reduce computational complexity. Based on the derived set description, called the uncertain range, we propose two distributed SMFing frameworks: one calculates the joint uncertain range of the agent itself and its neighbors, while the other only computes the marginal uncertain range of each local system. Furthermore, we compare the performance of our proposed two distributed SMFing frameworks and the benchmark -- centralized SMFing framework. A rigorous set analysis reveals that the distributed SMF can be essentially considered as the process of computing the marginal uncertain range to outer bound the projection of the uncertain range obtained by the centralized SMF in the corresponding subspace. Simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of our proposed distributed frameworks and verify our theoretical analysis.</description>

Abstract: Social identities play an important role in the dynamics of human societies, and it can be argued that some sense of identification with a larger cause or idea plays a critical role in making humans act responsibly. Often social activists strive to get populations to identify with some cause or notion -- like green energy, diversity, etc. in order to bring about desired social changes. We explore the problem of designing computational models for social identities in the context of autonomous AI agents. For this, we propose an agent model that enables agents to identify with certain notions and show how this affects collective outcomes. We also contrast between associations of identity with rational preferences. The proposed model is simulated in an application context of urban mobility, where we show how changes in social identity affect mobility patterns and collective outcomes.</description>

Abstract: We propose a simple model of protesters scattered throughout a city who want to gather into large and mobile groups. This model relies on random walkers on a street network that follow tactics built from a set of basic rules. Our goal is to identify the most important rules for fast and robust flocking of walkers. We explore a wide set of tactics and show the central importance of a specific rule based on alignment. Other rules alone perform poorly, but our experiments show that combining alignment with them enhances flocking, and that obtained groups are then remarkably robust.</description>

      <title>Augmenting the action space with conventions to improve multi-agent cooperation in Hanabi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06333v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The card game Hanabi is considered a strong medium for the testing and development of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms, due to its cooperative nature, partial observability, limited communication and remarkable complexity. Previous research efforts have explored the capabilities of MARL algorithms within Hanabi, focusing largely on advanced architecture design and algorithmic manipulations to achieve state-of-the-art performance for various number of cooperators. However, this often leads to complex solution strategies with high computational cost and requiring large amounts of training data. For humans to solve the Hanabi game effectively, they require the use of conventions, which often allows for a means to implicitly convey ideas or knowledge based on a predefined, and mutually agreed upon, set of "rules" or principles. Multi-agent problems containing partial observability, especially when limited communication is present, can benefit greatly from the use of implicit knowledge sharing. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to augmenting an agent's action space using conventions, which act as a sequence of special cooperative actions that span over and include multiple time steps and multiple agents, requiring agents to actively opt in for it to reach fruition. These conventions are based on existing human conventions, and result in a significant improvement on the performance of existing techniques for self-play and cross-play for various number of cooperators within Hanabi.</description>

      <title>Group Trip Planning Query Problem with Multimodal Journey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Group Trip Planning (GTP) Query Problem, we are given a city road network where a number of Points of Interest (PoI) have been marked with their respective categories (e.g., Cafeteria, Park, Movie Theater, etc.). A group of agents want to visit one PoI from every category from their respective starting location and once finished, they want to reach their respective destinations. This problem asks which PoI from every category should be chosen so that the aggregated travel cost of the group is minimized. This problem has been studied extensively in the last decade, and several solution approaches have been proposed. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the existing studies have considered the different modalities of the journey, which makes the problem more practical. To bridge this gap, we introduce and study the GTP Query Problem with Multimodal Journey in this paper. Along with the other inputs of the GTP Query Problem, we are also given the different modalities of the journey that are available and their respective cost. Now, the problem is not only to select the PoIs from respective categories but also to select the modality of the journey. For this problem, we have proposed an efficient solution approach, which has been analyzed to understand their time and space requirements. A large number of experiments have been conducted using real-life datasets and the results have been reported. From the results, we observe that the PoIs and modality of journey recommended by the proposed solution approach lead to much less time and cost than the baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Agent-Based Simulation of UAV Battery Recharging for IoT Applications: Precision Agriculture, Disaster Recovery, and Dengue Vector Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The low battery autonomy of Unnamed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs or drones) can make smart farming (precision agriculture), disaster recovery, and the fighting against dengue vector applications difficult. This article considers two approaches, first enumerating the characteristics observed in these three IoT application types and then modeling an UAV's battery recharge coordination using the Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) approach. In this way, we propose that each drone inside the swarm does not communicate concerning this recharge coordination decision, reducing energy usage and permitting remote usage. A total of 6000 simulations were run to evaluate how two proposed policies, the BaseLine (BL) and ChargerThershold (CT) coordination recharging policy, behave in 30 situations regarding how each simulation sets conclude the simulation runs and how much time they work until recharging results. CT policy shows more reliable results in extreme system usage. This work conclusion presents the potential of these three IoT applications to achieve their perpetual service without communication between drones and ground stations. This work can be a baseline for future policies and simulation parameter enhancements.</description>

      <title>Which Agent Causes Task Failures and When? On Automated Failure Attribution of LLM Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Failure attribution in LLM multi-agent systems-identifying the agent and step responsible for task failures-provides crucial clues for systems debugging but remains underexplored and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose and formulate a new research area: automated failure attribution for LLM multi-agent systems. To support this initiative, we introduce the Who&amp;When dataset, comprising extensive failure logs from 127 LLM multi-agent systems with fine-grained annotations linking failures to specific agents and decisive error steps. Using the Who&amp;When, we develop and evaluate three automated failure attribution methods, summarizing their corresponding pros and cons. The best method achieves 53.5% accuracy in identifying failure-responsible agents but only 14.2% in pinpointing failure steps, with some methods performing below random. Even SOTA reasoning models, such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1, fail to achieve practical usability. These results highlight the task's complexity and the need for further research in this area.

      <description>arXiv:2410.01706v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) progresses towards solving larger and more complex problems, it becomes increasingly important that algorithms exhibit the key properties of (1) strong performance, (2) memory efficiency, and (3) scalability. In this work, we introduce Sable, a performant, memory-efficient, and scalable sequence modeling approach to MARL. Sable works by adapting the retention mechanism in Retentive Networks (Sun et al., 2023) to achieve computationally efficient processing of multi-agent observations with long context memory for temporal reasoning. Through extensive evaluations across six diverse environments, we demonstrate how Sable is able to significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in a large number of diverse tasks (34 out of 45 tested). Furthermore, Sable maintains performance as we scale the number of agents, handling environments with more than a thousand agents while exhibiting a linear increase in memory usage. Finally, we conduct ablation studies to isolate the source of Sable's performance gains and confirm its efficient computational memory usage.</description>

      <title>Many Heads Are Better Than One: Improved Scientific Idea Generation by A LLM-Based Multi-Agent System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09403v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of scientific progress requires innovative tools that can accelerate knowledge discovery. Although recent AI methods, particularly large language models (LLMs), have shown promise in tasks such as hypothesis generation and experimental design, they fall short of replicating the collaborative nature of real-world scientific practices, where diverse experts work together in teams to tackle complex problems. To address the limitations, we propose an LLM-based multi-agent system, i.e., Virtual Scientists (VirSci), designed to mimic the teamwork inherent in scientific research. VirSci organizes a team of agents to collaboratively generate, evaluate, and refine research ideas. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that this multi-agent approach outperforms the state-of-the-art method in producing novel scientific ideas. We further investigate the collaboration mechanisms that contribute to its tendency to produce ideas with higher novelty, offering valuable insights to guide future research and illuminating pathways toward building a robust system for autonomous scientific discovery.

      <title>Interacting Large Language Model Agents. Interpretable Models and Social Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses the theory and algorithms for interacting large language model agents (LLMAs) using methods from statistical signal processing and microeconomics. While both fields are mature, their application to decision-making involving interacting LLMAs remains unexplored. Motivated by Bayesian sentiment analysis on online platforms, we construct interpretable models and algorithms that enable LLMAs to interact and perform Bayesian inference. Because interacting LLMAs learn from both prior decisions and external inputs, they can exhibit bias and herding behavior. Thus, developing interpretable models and stochastic control algorithms is essential to understand and mitigate these behaviors. This paper has three main results. First, we show using Bayesian revealed preferences from microeconomics that an individual LLMA satisfies the necessary and sufficient conditions for rationally inattentive (bounded rationality) Bayesian utility maximization and, given an observation, the LLMA chooses an action that maximizes a regularized utility. Second, we utilize Bayesian social learning to construct interpretable models for LLMAs that interact sequentially with each other and the environment while performing Bayesian inference. Our proposed models capture the herding behavior exhibited by interacting LLMAs. Third, we propose a stochastic control framework to delay herding and improve state estimation accuracy under 2 settings: (a) centrally controlled LLMAs (b) autonomous LLMAs with incentives. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on real datasets for hate speech classification and product quality assessment, using open-source models like LLaMA and closed-source models like ChatGPT. The main takeaway of this paper, based on empirical analysis and mathematical formalism, is that LLMAs act as rationally bounded Bayesian agents that exhibit social learning when interacting.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Aware Resource Management for C-V2X Platooning via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication transmits the extracted features of information rather than raw data, significantly reducing redundancy, which is crucial for addressing spectrum and energy challenges in 6G networks. In this paper, we introduce semantic communication into a cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X)- based autonomous vehicle platoon system for the first time, aiming to achieve efficient management of communication resources in a dynamic environment. Firstly, we construct a mathematical model for semantic communication in platoon systems, in which the DeepSC model and MU-DeepSC model are used to semantically encode and decode unimodal and multi-modal data, respectively. Then, we propose the quality of experience (QoE) metric based on semantic similarity and semantic rate. Meanwhile, we consider the success rate of semantic information transmission (SRS) metric to ensure the fairness of channel resource allocation. Next, the optimization problem is posed with the aim of maximizing the QoE in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links while improving SRS. To solve this mixed integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP) and adapt to time-varying channel conditions, the paper proposes a distributed semantic-aware multi-modal resource allocation (SAMRA) algorithm based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), referred to as SAMRAMARL. The algorithm can dynamically allocate channels and power and determine semantic symbol length based on the contextual importance of the transmitted information, ensuring efficient resource utilization. Finally, extensive simulations have demonstrated that SAMRAMARL outperforms existing methods, achieving significant gains in QoE, SRS, and communication delay in C-V2X platooning scenarios.</description>

      <title>Federated Domain Generalization with Data-free On-server Matching Gradient</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) aims to learn from multiple known source domains a model that can generalize well to unknown target domains. One of the key approaches in DG is training an encoder which generates domain-invariant representations. However, this approach is not applicable in Federated Domain Generalization (FDG), where data from various domains are distributed across different clients. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, dubbed Federated Learning via On-server Matching Gradient (FedOMG), which can \emph{efficiently leverage domain information from distributed domains}. Specifically, we utilize the local gradients as information about the distributed models to find an invariant gradient direction across all domains through gradient inner product maximization. The advantages are two-fold: 1) FedOMG can aggregate the characteristics of distributed models on the centralized server without incurring any additional communication cost, and 2) FedOMG is orthogonal to many existing FL/FDG methods, allowing for additional performance improvements by being seamlessly integrated with them. Extensive experimental evaluations on various settings to demonstrate the robustness of FedOMG compared to other FL/FDG baselines. Our method outperforms recent SOTA baselines on four FL benchmark datasets (MNIST, EMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100), and three FDG benchmark datasets (PACS, VLCS, and OfficeHome).</description>

Abstract: TextArena is an open-source collection of competitive text-based games for training and evaluation of agentic behavior in Large Language Models (LLMs). It spans 57+ unique environments (including single-player, two-player, and multi-player setups) and allows for easy evaluation of model capabilities via an online-play system (against humans and other submitted models) with real-time TrueSkill scores. Traditional benchmarks rarely assess dynamic social skills such as negotiation, theory of mind, and deception, creating a gap that TextArena addresses. Designed with research, community and extensibility in mind, TextArena emphasizes ease of adding new games, adapting the framework, testing models, playing against the models, and training models. Detailed documentation of environments, games, leaderboard, and examples are available on https://github.com/LeonGuertler/TextArena and https://www.textarena.ai/.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Inference through Bayesian and Inverse Bayesian Inference with Symmetry-Bias in Nonstationary Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12796v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel inference framework, designated as Bayesian and inverse Bayesian (BIB) inference, which concurrently performs both conventional and inverse Bayesian updates by integrating symmetry bias into Bayesian inference. The effectiveness of the model was evaluated through a sequential estimation task involving observations sampled from a Gaussian distribution with a stochastically time-varying mean. Conventional Bayesian inference entails a fundamental trade-off between adaptability to abrupt environmental shifts and estimation accuracy during stable intervals. The BIB framework addresses this limitation by dynamically modulating the learning rate through inverse Bayesian updates, thereby enhancing adaptive flexibility. The BIB model generated spontaneous bursts in the learning rate during sudden environmental transitions, transiently entering a high-sensitivity state to accommodate incoming data. This intermittent burst-relaxation pattern functions as a dynamic mechanism that balances adaptability and accuracy. Further analysis of burst interval distributions demonstrated that the BIB model consistently produced power-law distributions under diverse conditions. Such robust scaling behavior, absent in conventional Bayesian inference, appears to emerge from a self-regulatory mechanism driven by inverse Bayesian updates. These results present a novel computational perspective on scale-free phenomena in natural systems and offer implications for designing adaptive inference systems in nonstationary environments.</description>
