      <title>Coupled Twiss Parameters Estimation from Turn-by-Turn Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14287v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear optics parameters are often estimated using readily available turn-by-turn (TbT) data. In-plane beta functions, which are the most common measurement objectives, can be estimated from the amplitudes or phases of TbT data, providing an overall characterization of the linear lattice. In addition to estimating uncoupled Twiss parameters, TbT data can also be utilized for characterizing coupled linear motion. We investigate several methods for constructing a full normalization matrix at each beam position monitor (BPM). BPMs provide information on beam centroid transverse coordinates, but direct observation of transverse momenta is not available. To estimate momenta, one can use a pair of BPMs or fit data obtained from several BPMs. By using both coordinates and momenta, it is possible to fit the one-turn matrix or its power at each BPM, allowing for the computation of coupled Twiss parameters. Another approach involves the minimization of peak coupling amplitudes in the spectrum of normalized complex coordinates. Similarly, the normalization matrix can be estimated by fitting linear coupled invariants. In this study, we derive and utilize a special form of the normalization matrix, which remains non-singular in the zero coupling limit. Coupled Twiss parameters can be obtained from the normalization matrix. The paper presents the results of applying and comparing these methods to both modeled and measured VEPP-4M TbT data, demonstrating effective estimation of coupled Twiss parameters.</description>

      <title>Coupled Axial and Transverse Currents Method for Finite Element Modelling of Periodic Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the Coupled Axial and Transverse currents (I) (CATI) method, as an efficient and accurate finite element approach for modelling the electric and magnetic behavior of periodic composite superconducting conductors. The method consists of a pair of two-dimensional models coupled via circuit equations to account for the conductor geometrical periodicity. This allows to capture three-dimensional effects with two-dimensional models and leads to a significant reduction in computational time compared to conventional three-dimensional models. After presenting the method in detail, we verify it by comparison with reference finite element models, focussing on its application to twisted multifilamentary superconducting strands. In particular, we show that the CATI method captures the transition from uncoupled to coupled filaments, with accurate calculation of the interfilament coupling time constant. We then illustrate the capabilities of the method by generating a detailed loss map and magnetization curves of given strand types for a range of external transverse magnetic field excitations, with and without transport current.</description>
