      <title>Weyl magnetoplasma waves in magnetic Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weyl degeneracies in spectra of magnetoplasma waves enable nonreciprocal energy flow and topologically protected modes, yet conventional materials require impractical magnetic fields to operate. Developing an effective Hamiltonian framework for magnetic Weyl semimetals, we show that these systems overcome the limit, hosting Weyl magnetoplasma physics at zero field due to their giant intrinsic anomalous Hall response. The resulting topology supports nonreciprocal modes localized at magnetic domain walls, including a pair of topological "Fermi-arc-like modes and additional bound states. These effects are fully developed across a broad THz window, and we propose feasible experimental routes for their detection.</description>

      <title>Hybrid superinductance with Al/InAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report microwave spectroscopy of Josephson junctions chains made from an epitaxial Al/InAs heterostructure. The chains exhibit superinductance, with characteristic wave impedance exceeding $R_{Q} = \hbar/(2e)^{2}$. The planar nature of the junctions results in a large plasma frequency, with no measurable deviations from ideal dispersion up to $12~\mathrm{GHz}$. Internal quality factors decrease sharply with frequency, which we describe with a simple loss model. The possibility of a loss mechanism intrinsic to the superconductor-semiconductor junction is considered.</description>

      <title>Anomalous transport in quasiperiodic lattices: emergent exceptional points at band edges and log-periodic oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic systems host exotic transport regimes that are distinct from those found in periodic or disordered lattices. In this work, we study quantum transport in the Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper lattice in a two-terminal setup coupled to zero-temperature reservoirs, where the conductance is evaluated via the nonequilibrium Green's function method. In the extended phase, we uncover a universal subdiffusive transport when the bath chemical potential aligns with the band edges. Specifically, the typical conductance displays a scaling of $\mathcal{G}_{\text{typ}}\sim L^{-2}$ with system size $L$. We attribute this behavior to the emergence of an exceptional point (Jordan normal form) in the transfer matrix in the thermodynamic limit. In the localized phase, the conductance shows exponential decay governed by the Lyapunov exponent. Intriguingly, in the critical phase, we identify pronounced log-periodic oscillations of the conductance as a function of system size, arising from the discrete scale invariance inherent to the singular-continuous spectrum. We further extend our analysis to the generalized Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model and provide numerical evidence suggesting that the exact mobility edge resides within a finite spectral gap. This results in a counter-intuitive exponential suppression of conductance precisely at the mobility edge. Our work highlights the distinct transport behaviors in quasiperiodic systems and elucidates how they are rigorously dictated by the underlying local spectral structure.</description>

      <title>Electroluminescence in dopant-free GaAs/AlGaAs single heterojunctions: 2D free excitons, H-band, and the tidal effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bright electroluminescence (EL) from dopant-free ambipolar lateral p-n junctions in GaAs/AlGaAs single heterointerface (SH) heterostructures is used to probe neutral free excitons arising from two-dimensional electron and hole gases (2DEGs and 2DHGs). The EL spectra reveal both the heavy-hole neutral free exciton (X$^0$) and the high-energy free exciton of the H band (HE). A combination of transition energies, lifetimes, spatial emission profiles, and temperature dependences points to a predominantly two-dimensional character for these excitons at the SH. For X$^0$, the EL peak energies (1515.5-1515.7 meV) lie slightly above the corresponding bulk GaAs photoluminescence (PL) line at 1515.3 meV, while time-resolved measurements yield markedly shorter lifetimes for EL than for PL (337 ps vs. 1610 ps), consistent with recombination in a confined interfacial layer. The HE exciton exhibits a Stark blueshift under forward bias below threshold, and its energies and lifetimes (down to 575 ps) are tuned by the topgate voltage; above threshold, HE emission is quenched in favor of X$^0$. Finally, the tidal effect $-$ a form of pulsed EL generated by swapping the topgate voltage polarity in ambipolar field-effect transistors $-$ produces an X$^0$ line at the same energy as in the lateral p-n junction and reproduces the characteristic nonmonotonic frequency dependence of the brightness previously observed in quantum-well heterostructures, again indicating a 2D-like origin. Taken together, these results show electrically generated and controllable 2D-like excitons (HE and X$^0$), thereby bridging 2D exciton physics and 2DEG/2DHG platforms in dopant-free GaAs/AlGaAs SH devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Theory and Unusual Dielectric Functions of Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the spatially nonlocal dielectric functions of graphene at any frequency derived starting fromthe first principles of thermal quantum field theory using the formalism of the polarization tensor. After a brief review of this formalism, the longitudinal and transverse dielectric functions are considered at any relationship between the frequency and the wave vector. The analytic properties of their real and imaginary parts are investigated at low and high frequencies. Emphasis is given to the double pole at zero frequency which arises in the transverse dielectric function. The role of this unusual property for solving the problem of disagreement between experiment and theory in the Casimir effect is discussed. We guess that a more complete dielectric response of ordinary metals should also be spatially nonlocal and its transverse part may possess the double pole in the region of evanescent waves.</description>

      <title>Plasmon dynamics in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmons are collective oscillations of mobile electrons. Using terahertz spacetime metrology, we probe plasmon dynamics of mono- and bi-layer graphene. In both systems, the experimentally measured Drude weight systematically exceeds the prediction based on non-interacting electronic system. This enhancement is most pronounced at ultra-low carrier densities. We attribute the observed deviation to pseudospin dynamics of the Dirac fermions in multi-layer graphene, which leads to a breakdown of Galilean invariance. Our results establish that pseudospin structure of the single-particle electronic wave function can directly govern collective excitations, with implications that extend beyond graphene to a broad class of quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Topologically switchable transport in a bundled cable of wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in the next generation of mesoscopic electronics require an understanding of topological phases in inhomogeneous media and the principles that govern them. Motivated by the nature of motifs available in printable conducting inks, we introduce and study quantum transport in a minimal model that describes a bundle of one-dimensional metallic wires that are randomly interconnected by semiconducting chains. Each of these interconnects is represented by a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain, which can reside in either a trivial or a topological phase. Using a tight-binding approach, we show that such a system can transit from an insulating phase to a robust metallic phase as the interconnects undergo a transition from a trivial to a topological phase. In the latter, despite the random interconnectedness, the metal evades Anderson localization and exhibits a ballistic conductance that scales linearly with the number of wires. We show that this behavior originates from hopping renormalization in the wire network. The zero-energy modes of the topological interconnects act as effective random dimers, giving rise to an energy-dependent localization length that diverges as $\sim 1/E^2$. Our work establishes that random networks provide a yet-unexplored platform to host intriguing phases of topological quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Molecularly Thin Polyaramid Nanomechanical Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional polyaramids exhibit strong hydrogen bonding to create molecularly thin nanosheets analogous to graphene. Here, we report the first nanomechanical resonators made out of a two-dimensional polyaramid, 2DPA-1, with thicknesses as small as 8 nm. To fabricate these molecular-scale resonators, we transferred nanofilms of 2DPA-1 onto chips with previously etched arrays of circular microwells. We then characterized the thermal resonances of these resonators under different conditions. When there is no residual gas inside the 2DPA-1-covered microwells, the eigenfrequencies are well-described by a tensioned plate theory, providing the Young's modulus and tension of the 2DPA-1 nanofilms. With gas present, the nanofilms bulge up and mechanical resonances are modified due to the adhesion, bulging and slack present in the system. The fabrication and mechanical characterization of these first 2DPA-1 nanomechanical resonators represent a convincing path toward molecular-scale polymeric NEMS with high mechanical strength, low density, and synthetic processability.</description>

      <title>Emergent electric field induced by dissipative sliding dynamics of domain walls in a Weyl magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic motion of topological defects in magnets induces an emergent electric field, as exemplified by the continuous flow of skyrmion vortices. However, the electrodynamics underlying this emergent field remains poorly understood. In this context, magnetic domain walls - one dimensional topological defects with two collective modes, sliding and spin tilt - offer a promising platform for exploration. Here, we demonstrate that the dissipative motion of domain walls under oscillatory current excitation generates an emergent electric field. We image domain patterns and quantify domain wall length under applied magnetic fields in mesoscopic devices based on the magnetic Weyl semimetal NdAlSi. These devices exhibit exceptionally strong domain wall scattering and a pronounced emergent electric field, observed in the imaginary component of the complex impedance. Spin dynamics simulations reveal that domain wall sliding dominates over spin tilting, where the phase delay of the domain wall motion with respect to the driving force impacts the emergent electric field. Our findings establish domain-wall dynamics as a platform for studying emergent electromagnetic fields and motivate further investigations on the coupled motion of magnetic solitons and conduction electrons.</description>

      <title>Resolution of Topology and Geometry from Momentum-Resolved Spectroscopies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting the complete quantum geometric and topological character of Bloch wavefunctions from experiments remains a challenge in condensed matter physics. Here, we resolve this by introducing the "wavefunction form factor" (WFF) matrix, a quantity directly constructible from intensities in momentum- and energy-resolved spectroscopies like ARPES and INS. We demonstrate that band topology is encoded in "spectral nodes" -- momentum-space points where the WFF determinant vanishes, providing a direct readout of topological invariants via a topological selection rule. Furthermore, when the number of independent probes exceeds the number of the target bands, our framework yields an effective band projector. This enables the determination of Wilson loop spectra and the extraction of an effective quantum geometric tensor, providing a model-independent measurement of the non-Abelian Berry curvature and quantum metric as resolved by the experimental probes.</description>

      <title>Viewpoint: On the Emergence of van der Waals Magnets: A Personal Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of magnetism in atomically thin van der Waals (vdW) antiferromagnets (FePS$_3$, NiPS$_3$, and MnPS$_3$) in 2016 marked an important moment in the development of two-dimensional (2D) physics. In this personal reflection, I describe how a simple question, posed in the early 2010s, motivated experimental efforts that culminated in the demonstration of antiferromagnetic order in monolayer FePS$_3$. Alongside subsequent reports of vdW ferromagnets in 2017, these developments helped establish intrinsic magnetism as a viable degree of freedom in atomically thin materials. I close with personal lessons drawn from this period and a perspective on the opportunities that now shape the field's second decade and beyond.</description>

      <title>Multiple Andreev Reflection Effects in Asymmetric STM Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have examined the electrical behavior of Josephson junctions formed by a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) with a Nb sample and a Nb tip, with normal-state resistances Rn varying between 1 kOhm and 10 MOhm. Current-voltage characteristics were obtained as a function of Rn by varying the distance between the tip and sample at temperatures of 50 mK and 1.5 K. Rn decreases as the tip-sample separation is reduced, and the junction evolves from a phase-diffusion regime to an underdamped small junction regime, and then to a point contact regime. The subgap structure exhibits pronounced multiple Andreev reflection (MAR) features whose amplitudes and onset energies depend sensitively on junction transparency and gap asymmetry. To interpret these spectra, we generalize the Averin-Bardas MAR theory to superconductors with unequal gap magnitudes, providing a quantitative model appropriate for asymmetric STM junctions. The resulting fits yield the superconducting gaps of the electrodes, barrier transparency, and number of conduction channels as a function of Rn. Combining this analysis with Josephson junction dynamics, we further account for the observed switching and retrapping currents and the finite resistance of the supercurrent branch. Our results demonstrate that incorporating intrinsic electrode asymmetry is essential for reliably extracting transport parameters in STM-based superconducting weak links.</description>

      <title>Reentrant topological phases and entanglement scalings in moir\'e-modulated extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies of moir\'e physics have unveiled a wealth of opportunities for significantly advancing the field of quantum phase transitions. However, properties of reentrant phase transitions driven by moir\'e strength are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the reentrant sequence of phase transitions and the invariant of universality class in moir\'e-modulated extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. For the simplified case with intercell hopping $w=0$, we analytically derive renormalization relations of Hamiltonian parameters to explain the reentrant phenomenon. For the general case, numerical phase boundaries are calculated in the thermodynamic limit. The bulk boundary correspondence between zero-energy edge modes and entanglement spectrum is revealed from the degeneracy of both quantities. We also address the correspondence between the central charge obtained from entanglement entropy and the change in winding number during the phase transition. Our results shed light on the understanding of universal characteristics and bulk-boundary correspondence for moir\'e induced reentrant phase transitions in 1D condensed-matter systems.</description>

      <title>Density of States of Ru3 and Pt3 Clusters Supported on Sputter-Deposited TiO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, 3-atom clusters, Ru3 and Pt3, were deposited onto radio frequency RF-sputter deposited TiO2, treated with Ar+ ion sputtering. Ru3 was deposited by both solution submersion and chemical vapor deposition of Ru3(CO)12, while Pt3 was deposited under ultra-high vacuum using a laser vaporisation cluster source. The valence electronic density of states (DOS) of the deposited clusters were analysed after heat treatment using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and metastable impact electron spectroscopy (MIES), where UPS measures the top several layers while MIES measures only the top atomic layer. XPS was used to determine the cluster surface coverages. The DOS were found to be very similar between Ru3 deposited by solution submersion and chemical vapor deposition. MIES results for Ru3 had contributions from titania O 2p sites due to encapsulation by a reduced titania overlayer. For Pt3 clusters the UPS and MIES results provided evidence that Pt was present on the topmost layer, and encapsulation did not occur. The proposed reason for the encapsulation of Ru3 but not of Pt3 is the higher surface energy of Ru over Pt. It is concluded that Pt clusters deposited onto TiO2 can modify the outermost layer by adding discrete energy levels on the surface, whereas the Ru clusters being encapsulated just below the surface generate a broad distribution of energy states close to the Fermi level. The outcome of this work is that Pt3-cluster-modified surfaces could be used as catalysts for reactions where the Pt3 energy levels are suitable for the respective reaction. The implication of the DOS found for photocatalytic water splitting are discussed.</description>

      <title>Coherence Limits in Interference-Based cos(2$\varphi$) Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the coherence properties of parity-protected $\cos(2\varphi)$ qubits based on interferences between two Josephson elements in a superconducting loop. We show that qubit implementations of a $\cos(2\varphi)$ potential using a single loop, such as those employing semiconducting junctions, rhombus circuits, flowermon and KITE structures, can be described by the same Hamiltonian as two multi-harmonic Josephson junctions in a SQUID geometry. We find that, despite the parity protection arising from the suppression of single Cooper pair tunneling, there exists a fundamental trade-off between charge and flux noise dephasing channels. Using numerical simulations, we examine how relaxation and dephasing rates depend on external flux and circuit parameters, and we identify the best compromise for maximum coherence. With currently existing circuit parameters, the qubit lifetime $T_1$ can exceed milliseconds while the dephasing time $T_\varphi$ remains limited to only a few microseconds due to either flux or charge noise. Our findings establish practical limits on the coherence of this class of qubits and raise questions about the long-term potential of this approach.</description>

      <title>Optimal control of a dissipative micromaser quantum battery in the ultrastrong coupling regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the open system dynamics of a micromaser quantum battery operating in the ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime under environmental dissipation. The battery consists of a single-mode electromagnetic cavity sequentially interacting, via the Rabi Hamiltonian, with a stream of qubits acting as chargers. Dissipative effects arise from the weak coupling of the qubit-cavity system to a thermal bath. Non-negligible in the USC regime, the counter-rotating terms substantially improve the charging speed, but also lead, in the absence of dissipation, to unbounded energy growth and highly mixed cavity states. Dissipation during each qubit-cavity interaction mitigates these detrimental effects, yielding steady-state of finite energy and ergotropy. Optimal control on qubit preparation and interaction times enhances battery's performance in: (i) Maximizing the stored ergotropy trhough an optimized charging protocol; (ii) Stabilizing the stored ergotropy against dissipative losses through an optimized measurement-based passive-feedback strategy. Overall, our numerical results demonstrate that the interplay of ultrastrong light-matter coupling, controlled dissipation, and optimized control strategies enables micromaser quantum batteries to achieve both enhanced charging performance and long-term stability under realistic conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum bianisotropy and chirality are fundamental concepts in light matter interaction that describe how materials with broken symmetries respond to electromagnetic fields at the level of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics. In quantum bianisotropy, magnetoelectric (ME) energy plays a critical role in mediating and enhancing light matter interactions. This concept is essential for bridging the gap between classical electromagnetics (where bianisotropy often involves field nonlocality) and quantum mechanics in metamaterials. The precise manipulation of a quantum emitter's properties at a subwavelength scale is due to near fields, which effectively function as a tunable environment. We show that the ME near field, interpreted as a structure combining the effect of bianisotropy (chirality) with a quantum atmosphere, is a nonMaxwellian field with spacetime symmetry breaking. Quantum ME fields arise from the dynamic modulation and topological coupling of magnetization and electric polarization within ME meta atoms, specific subwavelength structural elements with magnetic and dielectric subsystems in magnetic insulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a majorization-based theory for bounding observables of waves with varied coherence. For any measurement, exact bounds are attained by the maximal and minimal elements in the set of input coherence spectra. The set's supremum and infimum, which may lie outside the set, provide optimal universal bounds: any alternative spectrum yielding universal bounds produces weaker constraints. We present an algorithm to compute the supremum and infimum, and prove that they lie either at singular boundary points or strictly outside the set of coherence spectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phase mode of a superconductor's order parameter encodes fundamental information about pairing and dissipation, but is typically inaccessible at low frequencies due to the Anderson-Higgs mechanism. Superconducting samples thinner than the London penetration depth, however, support a gapless phase mode whose dispersion can be reshaped by a proximal screening layer. Here, we theoretically and experimentally show that this screened phase mode in a superconducting thin film integrated into on-chip terahertz circuitry naturally forms a superconducting microcavity that hosts resonant finite-momentum standing waves of supercurrent density, which we term Cooper plasmons. We measure two Cooper plasmons in a superconducting NbN microcavity and demonstrate that their resonance frequencies and linewidths independently report the density of participating carriers and plasmon's dissipation at finite momenta. Our results reveal an emergent collective mode of an integrated superconductor-circuit system and establish design principles for engineering or suppressing Cooper plasmons in superconducting terahertz devices and circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rotating shallow water equations (RSWE) are a mainstay of atmospheric and oceanic modeling, and their wave dynamics has close analogues in settings ranging from two-dimensional electron gases to active-matter fluids. While recent work has emphasized the topological character of RSWE wave bands, here we develop a complementary quantum-geometric description by computing the full quantum geometric tensor (QGT) for the linearized RSWE on an $f$-plane. The QGT unifies two pieces of band geometry: its real part defines a metric that quantifies how rapidly wave polarization changes with parameters, while its imaginary part is the Berry curvature that controls geometric phases and topological invariants. We obtain compact, symmetry-guided expressions for all three bands, highlighting the transverse structure of the metric and the monopole-like Berry curvature that yields Chern numbers for the Poincar\'e bands. Finally, we describe a feasible route to probing this geometry in rotating-tank experiments via weak, time-periodic parametric driving.</description>

      <title>Scalable Spin Squeezing in Power-Law Interacting XXZ Models with Disorder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While spin squeezing has been traditionally considered in all-to-all interacting models, recent works have shown that spin squeezing can occur in systems with power-law interactions, leading to direct testing in Rydberg atoms, trapped ions, ultracold atoms and nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. For the latter, Wu. et al. Nature 646 (2025) demonstrated that spin squeezing is heavily affected by positional disorder, reducing any capacity for a practical squeezing advantage, which requires scalability with the system size. In this Letter we explore the robustness of spin-squeezing in two-dimensional lattices with a fraction of unoccupied lattice sites. Using semi-classical modeling, we demonstrate the existence of scalable squeezing in power-law interacting XXZ models up to a disorder threshold, above which squeezing is not scalable. We produce a phase diagram for scalable squeezing, and explain its absence in the aforementioned NV experiment. Our work illustrates the maximum disorder allowed for realizing scalable spin squeezing in a host of quantum simulators, highlights a regime with substantial tolerance to disorder, and identifies controlled defect creation as a promising route for scalable squeezing in solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>Emergence and transition of incompressible phases in decorated Landau levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show a single Landau level (LL) dressed with periodic electrostatic potentials can realize a plethora of interacting topological phases where the Hall conductivity generally does not equal to the LL filling factor. Their physics can be captured by a minimal model of a delta potential lattice within a single LL, realizing exact zero energy Chern bands (denoted as decorated Landau levels or dLL) gapped from dispersive bands with rich geometric properties. With $p/q$ magnetic fluxes per unit cell, there are $q$ dispersive bands and $p-q$ zero energy bands forming the dLL. When the one-body potential strength dominates the electron-electron interaction, band mixing is suppressed and the dispersion bands consist of ``localized states" with vanishing total Chern number. Nevertheless these dispersive bands can have highly nontrivial Berry curvature distribution, and even non-zero Chern numbers when $q&gt;1$. Interestingly even in the limit of large short range interaction, band mixing between dLL and dispersion bands can be strongly suppressed at low filling factor, leading to robust topological phases within the dLL stabilized by the one-body potential. The dLL and the associated dispersive bands can serve as minimal theoretical models for correlated physics in lattice or moire systems; they are also highly tunable experimental platforms for realizing rich phase diagrams of exotic 2D quantum fluids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06586v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a time-reversal invariant vortex, namely a spin vortex, in helical superconductors by focusing on its emergent gravitational structure. The topology of the time-reversal invariant vortex is classified by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant: helical Majorana zero modes appear at the vortex core when the winding number is odd, while no such zero modes exist when it is even. We provide a formal mapping to the theory of gravity to describe this $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological structure. Identifying a superconducting order parameter as a vielbein in the theory of gravity, we explicitly convert the Bogoliubov-de-Genne Hamiltonian into the Dirac Hamiltonian coupled to a nontrivial gravitational field. Then we find that a gravitational curvature is induced at the vortex core, with its total flux quantized in integer multiples of $\pi$, reflecting the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology. Although the curvature vanishes everywhere except at the vortex core, the energy spectrum remains sensitive to the total curvature flux, owing to the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect. We further demonstrate that our gravitational framework can be applied to the topological phase transition driven by the vortex-linking precess in three-dimensional helical superconductors such as the He-B phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a one-dimensional superconducting lattice that realizes all internal symmetries permitted in non-Hermitian systems, characterized by nonreciprocal hopping, onsite dissipation, and $s$-wave singlet pairing in a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-type structure. The combined presence of pseudo-Hermiticity and sublattice symmetry imposes constraints on the energy spectra. We identify parameter regimes featuring real spectra, purely imaginary spectra, complex flat bands, and Majorana zero modes, the latter emerging when a uniform transverse magnetic field suppresses the non-Hermitian skin effect. We show that a uniform onsite dissipation is essential for stabilizing the zero modes, whereas a purely staggered dissipation destroys the topological superconductivity. Through Hermitianization, we construct a spectral winding number as a topological invariant and demonstrate its correspondence with the gap closing conditions and appearance of the Majorana zero modes, allowing us to establish topological phase diagrams. Moreover, we reveal nontrivial correlations between the particle-hole and spin components of left and right eigenstates, enforced by chiral symmetry, pseudo-Hermiticity, and their combination. Our results highlight how non-Hermiticity, sublattice structure, and superconductivity together enrich symmetry properties and give rise to novel topological phenomena.</description>

      <title>Nonrelativistic Functional Properties in Collinear Antiferromagnets Based on Multipole Representation Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the concept of multipoles has been widely used to describe and classify various magnetic and electric responses in solids, providing a systematic way to identify symmetry-allowed or -forbidden physical responses. Conventionally, multipole classifications rely on the magnetic point group of a system, which inherently incorporates the effects of relativistic spin-orbit coupling because the spin orientation is supposed to follow the point-group transformation of the lattice. However, this approach becomes insufficient in situations where relativistic spin-orbit coupling is negligibly weak or where the spin and orbital (lattice) degrees of freedom are decoupled, thereby requiring a more comprehensive symmetry description. In this work, we introduce a multipole description on the basis of the spin-point-group symmetries, enabling a systematic exploration of nonrelativistic phenomena that persist even without spin-orbit coupling in a collinear antiferromagnet. As an application, we theoretically demonstrate spin-current generation driven by elastic waves in a specific collinear antiferromagnet, fully independent of spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Long-range optomechanical interactions in SiN membrane arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optomechanical systems using a membrane-in-the-middle configuration can exhibit a long-range type of interaction similar to how atoms show collective motion in an optical potential. Photons bounce back and forth inside a high-finesse Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity and mediate the interaction between multiple membranes over a significant distance compared to the wavelength. Recently, it has been demonstrated that off-resonant coupling between light and the inter-membrane cavity can lead to coherent mechanical noise cancellation. On-resonance coupling of light with both the Fabry-P\'{e}rot and inter-membrane cavities, predicted to enhance the single photon optomechanical coupling, have to date not been experimentally demonstrated, however. In our experiment, a double-membrane system inside a Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity resonantly enhances the cavity field, resulting in a stronger optomechanical coupling strength from the increased radiation pressure. The resonance condition is first identified by analyzing the slope of the dispersion relation. Then, the optomechanical coupling is determined at various chip positions over one wavelength range. The optimum coupling conditions are obtained and enhancement is demonstrated for double membrane arrays with three different reflectivites, reaching nearly four-fold enhancement for the collective motion of $R=65\%$ double membranes. The cavity losses at the optimum coupling are also characterized and the potential of reaching the single-photon strong coupling regime is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the sublattice currents as a feasible route to odd-parity altermagnetism (ALM), where nonrelativistic collinear spin splitting occurs in the bands as an odd function of momentum. In contrast to previously classified ALMs, the sublattice currents break the time-reversal symmetry in the nonmagnetic crystal structure and allow for such odd-parity spin splitting. A representative example is the Haldane-Hubbard model at half filling. Although the compensated collinear magnetic ground state was previously recognized as antiferromagnetism, we show that sublattice currents induce spin splitting in the bands and therefore turn it into an odd-parity ALM. Interestingly, its topological version serves as an example of ALM Chern insulator. We further generalize the Haldane-Hubbard model to common two- and three-dimensional bipartite lattices. With spin splitting from sublattice currents, the compensated collinear magnetic ground states at half filling are generally odd-parity ALM.</description>

Abstract: Silicon is the foundation of current information technology, and a promising platform for future quantum information technology as silicon-based qubits exhibit some of the longest coherence times in solid-state. At the same time, silicon is the underlying material for advanced photonics activity, and photonics structures in silicon can be used to define optomechanical cavities where the vibrations of nanoscale mechanical resonators can be probed down to the quantum level with laser light. Here, we propose to bring all these developments together by coupling silicon donor spins into optomechanical structures. We show theoretically and numerically that this allows telecom wavelength optical readout of the spin-qubits and implementing high-fidelity entangling two-qubit gates between donor spins that are spatially separated by tens of micrometers. We present an optimized geometry of the proposed device and discuss with the help of numerical simulations the predicted performance of the proposed quantum bus. We analyze the optomechanical spin readout fidelity and find the optimal donor species for different coupling mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Thomas-Fermi theory for 2D abelian anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional abelian anyons are, in the magnetic gauge picture, represented as fermions coupled to magnetic flux tubes. For the ground state of such a system in a trapping potential, we theoretically and numerically investigate a Hartree approximate model, obtained by restricting trial states to Slater determinants and introducing a self-consistent magnetic field, locally proportional to matter density. This leads to a fermionic variant of the Chern-Simons-Schr{\"o}dinger system. We find that for dense systems, a semi-classical approximation yields qualitatively good results. Namely, we derive a density functional theory of magnetic Thomas-Fermi type, which correctly captures the trends of our numerical results. In particular, we explore the subtle dependence of the ground state with respect to the fraction of magnetic flux units attached to particles.</description>

      <title>Scaling High-Performance Nanoribbon Transistors with Monolayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanoscale transistors require aggressive reduction of all channel dimensions: length, width, and thickness. While monolayer two-dimensional semiconductors (2DS) offer ultimate thickness scaling, good performance has largely been achieved only in micrometer-wide channels. Here, we demonstrate both $\it{n}$- and $\it{p}$-type nanoribbon transistors based on monolayer 2DS, fabricated using a multi-patterning process, reaching channel widths and lengths down to 25-30 nm. 'Anchored' contacts improve device yield, while nanoscale imaging, including tip-enhanced photoluminescence, reveals minimal edge degradation. The devices reach on-state currents up to 560, 420, and 130 $\mu$A $\mu$m$^{-1}$ at 1 V drain-to-source voltage for $\it{n}$-type MoS$_{2}$, WS$_{2}$, and $\it{p}$-type WSe$_{2}$, respectively, integrated with thin high-$\kappa$ dielectrics. These results surpass prior reports for single-gated nanoribbons, the WS$_{2}$ by over 100 times, even in normally-off (enhancement-mode) transistors. Taken together, these findings suggest that top down patterned 2DS nanoribbons are promising building blocks for future nanosheet transistors.</description>

      <title>Niobium's intrinsic coherence length and penetration depth revisited using low-energy muon spin spectroscopy and secondary-ion mass spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report direct, simultaneous measurements of the London penetration depth ($\lambda_L$) and Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) coherence length ($\xi_0$) in oxygen-doped niobium, with impurity concentrations spanning the "clean" to "dirty" limits. Two depth-resolved techniques - low-energy muon spin spectroscopy (LE-$\mu$SR) and secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) - were used to quantify the element's Meissner screening profiles, analyzed within a framework that accounts for nonlocal electrodynamics. The analysis indicates intrinsic length scales of $\lambda_L = 29.1(10)$ nm and $\xi_0 = 39.9(25)$ nm, corresponding to a Ginzburg-Landau (GL) parameter of $\kappa = 0.70(5)$. The obtained $\lambda_L$ and $\kappa$ values, accurately quantified at the nanoscale, are smaller than values commonly used in applications and modeling, and indicate that clean niobium lies at the boundary between type-I and type-II superconductivity, supporting the contemporary view that its intrinsic state may be type-I.</description>
