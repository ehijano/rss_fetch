      <title>Emperical Study on the Effect of Multi-Sampling in the Prediction Step of the Particle Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle filters are applicable to a wide range of nonlinear, non-Gaussian state-space models and have already been applied to a variety of problems. However, there is a problem in the calculation of smoothed distributions, where particles gradually degenerate and accuracy is reduced. The purpose of this paper is to consider the possibility of generating multiple particles in the prediction step of the particle filter and to empirically verify the effect using real data.</description>

      <title>Efficient pooling designs and screening performance in group testing for two type defectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group testing is utilized in the case when we want to find a few defectives among large amount of items. Testing n items one by one requires n tests, but if the ratio of defectives is small, group testing is an efficient way to reduce the number of tests. Many research have been developed for group testing for a single type of defectives. In this paper, we consider the case where two types of defective A and B exist. For two types of defectives, we develop a belief propagation algorithm to compute marginal posterior probability of defectives. Furthermore, we construct several kinds of collections of pools in order to test for A and B. And by utilizing our belief propagation algorithm, we evaluate the performance of group testing by conducting simulations.</description>

      <title>Leveraging graphical model techniques to study evolution on phylogenetic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of molecular and phenotypic traits is commonly modelled using Markov processes along a rooted phylogeny. This phylogeny can be a tree, or a network if it includes reticulations, representing events such as hybridization or admixture. Computing the likelihood of data observed at the leaves is costly as the size and complexity of the phylogeny grows. Efficient algorithms exist for trees, but cannot be applied to networks. We show that a vast array of models for trait evolution along phylogenetic networks can be reformulated as graphical models, for which efficient belief propagation algorithms exist. We provide a brief review of belief propagation on general graphical models, then focus on linear Gaussian models for continuous traits. We show how belief propagation techniques can be applied for exact or approximate (but more scalable) likelihood and gradient calculations, and prove novel results for efficient parameter inference of some models. We highlight the possible fruitful interactions between graphical models and phylogenetic methods. For example, approximate likelihood approaches have the potential to greatly reduce computational costs for phylogenies with reticulations.</description>

      <title>A review of regularised estimation methods and cross-validation in spatiotemporal statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review article focuses on regularised estimation procedures applicable to geostatistical and spatial econometric models. These methods are particularly relevant in the case of big geospatial data for dimensionality reduction or model selection. To structure the review, we initially consider the most general case of multivariate spatiotemporal processes (i.e., $g &gt; 1$ dimensions of the spatial domain, a one-dimensional temporal domain, and $q \geq 1$ random variables). Then, the idea of regularised/penalised estimation procedures and different choices of shrinkage targets are discussed. Finally, guided by the elements of a mixed-effects model setup, which allows for a variety of spatiotemporal models, we show different regularisation procedures and how they can be used for the analysis of geo-referenced data, e.g. for selection of relevant regressors, dimensionality reduction of the covariance matrices, detection of conditionally independent locations, or the estimation of a full spatial interaction matrix.</description>
