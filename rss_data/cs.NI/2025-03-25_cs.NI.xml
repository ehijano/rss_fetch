      <title>Periodic Chains Scheduling on Dedicated Resources - A Crucial Problem in Time-Sensitive Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic messages transfer data from sensors to actuators in cars, planes, and complex production machines. When considering a given routing, the unicast message starts at its source and goes over several dedicated resources to reach its destination. Such unicast message can be represented as a chain of point-to-point communications. Thus, the scheduling of the periodic chains is a principal problem in time-triggered Ethernet, like IEEE 802.1Qbv Time-Sensitive Networks. This paper studies a strongly NP-hard periodic scheduling problem with harmonic periods, task chains, and dedicated resources. We analyze the problem on several levels of generality and complexity and provide the corresponding proofs. We describe a solution methodology to find a feasible schedule that minimizes the chains' degeneracy related to start-to-end latency normalized in the number of periods. We use the local search with the first fit scheduling heuristic, which we warm-start with a constraint programming model. This notably improves the schedulability of instances with up to 100% utilization and thousands (and more) of tasks, with high-quality solutions found in minutes. An efficient constraint programming matheuristic significantly reduces the degeneracy of the found schedules even further. The method is evaluated on sets of industrial-, avionic-, and automotive-inspired instances.</description>

      <title>Enhancing V2X Communications with UAV-mounted Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the crucial need for reliable wireless communication in vehicular networks, particularly vital for the safety and efficacy of (semi-)autonomous driving amid increasing traffic. We explore the use of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISes) mounted on Drone Relay Stations (DRS) to enhance communication reliability. Our study formulates an optimization problem to pinpoint the optimal location and orientation of the DRS, thereby creating an additional propagation path for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. We introduce a heuristic approach that combines trajectory optimization for DRS positioning and a Q-learning scheme for RIS orientation. Our results not only confirm the convergence of the Q-learning algorithm but also demonstrate significant communication improvements achieved by integrating a DRS into V2X networks.</description>

      <title>Rank-Based Modeling for Universal Packets Compression in Multi-Modal Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid increase in networked systems and data transmission requires advanced data compression solutions to optimize bandwidth utilization and enhance network performance. This study introduces a novel byte-level predictive model using Transformer architecture, capable of handling the redundancy and diversity of data types in network traffic as byte sequences. Unlike traditional methods that require separate compressors for different data types, this unified approach sets new benchmarks and simplifies predictive modeling across various data modalities such as video, audio, images, and text, by processing them at the byte level. This is achieved by predicting subsequent byte probability distributions, encoding them into a sparse rank sequence using lossless entropy coding, and significantly reducing both data size and entropy. Experimental results show that our model achieves compression ratios below 50%, while offering models of various sizes tailored for different communication devices. Additionally, we successfully deploy these models on a range of edge devices and servers, demonstrating their practical applicability and effectiveness in real-world network scenarios. This approach significantly enhances data throughput and reduces bandwidth demands, making it particularly valuable in resource-constrained environments like the Internet of Things sensor networks.</description>

      <title>Partitioned Task Offloading for Low-Latency and Reliable Task Completion in 5G MEC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for MEC has increased with the rise of data-intensive applications and 5G networks, while conventional cloud models struggle to satisfy low-latency requirements. While task offloading is crucial for minimizing latency on resource-constrained User Equipment (UE), fully offloading of all tasks to MEC servers may result in overload and possible task drops. Overlooking the effect of number of dropped tasks can significantly undermine system efficiency, as each dropped task results in unfulfilled service demands and reduced reliability, directly impacting user experience and overall network performance. In this paper, we employ task partitioning, enabling partitions of task to be processed locally while assigning the rest to MEC, thus balancing the load and ensuring no task drops. This methodology enhances efficiency via Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and Cuckoo Search, resulting in effective task assignment and minimum latency. Moreover, we ensure each user's RB allocation stays within the maximum limit while keeping latency low. Experimental results indicate that this strategy surpasses both full offloading and full local processing, providing significant improvements in latency and task completion rates across diverse number of users. In our scenario, MILP task partitioning results in 24% reduction in latency compared to MILP task offloading for the maximum number of users, whereas Cuckoo search task partitioning yields 18% latency reduction in comparison with Cuckoo search task offloading.</description>

      <title>A Reliable and Efficient 5G Vehicular MEC: Guaranteed Task Completion with Minimal Latency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the advancement of Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) as a tailored application of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) for the automotive industry, addressing the rising demand for real-time processing in connected and autonomous vehicles. VEC brings computational resources closer to vehicles, reducing data processing delays crucial for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving and intelligent traffic management. However, the challenge lies in managing the high and dynamic task load generated by vehicles' data streams. We focus on enhancing task offloading and scheduling techniques to optimize both communication and computation latencies in VEC networks. Our approach involves implementing task scheduling algorithms, including First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Deadline First (SDF), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for optimization. Additionally, we divide portions of tasks between the MEC servers and vehicles to reduce the number of dropped tasks and improve real-time adaptability. This paper also compares fixed and shared bandwidth scenarios to manage transmission efficiency under varying loads. Our findings indicate that MEC+Local (partitioning) scenario significantly outperforms MEC-only scenario by ensuring the completion of all tasks, resulting in a zero task drop ratio. The MEC-only scenario demonstrates approximately 5.65% better average end-to-end latency compared to the MEC+Local (partitioning) scenario when handling 200 tasks. However, this improvement comes at the cost of dropping a significant number of tasks (109 out of 200). Additionally, allocating shared bandwidth helps to slightly decrease transmission waiting time compared to using fixed bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Empirical Analysis of the Impact of 5G Jitter on Time-Aware Shaper Scheduling in a 5G-TSN Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deterministic communications are essential for industrial automation, ensuring strict latency requirements and minimal jitter in packet transmission. Modern production lines, specializing in robotics, require higher flexibility and mobility, which drives the integration of Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and 5G networks in Industry 4.0. TSN achieves deterministic communications by using mechanisms such as the IEEE 802.1Qbv Time-Aware Shaper (TAS), which schedules packet transmissions within precise cycles, thereby reducing latency, jitter, and congestion. 5G networks complement TSN by providing wireless mobility and supporting ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications. However, 5G channel effects such as fast fading, interference, and network-induced latency and jitter can disrupt TSN traffic, potentially compromising deterministic scheduling and performance. This paper presents an empirical analysis of 5G network latency and jitter on IEEE 802.1Qbv performance in a 5G-TSN network. We evaluate the impact of 5G integration on TSN's deterministic scheduling through a testbed combining IEEE 802.1Qbv-enabled switches, TSN translators, and a commercial 5G system. Our results show that, with proper TAS configuration in the TSN switch aligned with the 5G system, jitter can be mitigated, maintaining deterministic performance.</description>

      <title>Energy-aware Joint Orchestration of 5G and Robots: Experimental Testbed and Field Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 5G mobile networks introduce a new dimension for connecting and operating mobile robots in outdoor environments, leveraging cloud-native and offloading features of 5G networks to enable fully flexible and collaborative cloud robot operations. However, the limited battery life of robots remains a significant obstacle to their effective adoption in real-world exploration scenarios. This paper explores, via field experiments, the potential energy-saving gains of OROS, a joint orchestration of 5G and Robot Operating System (ROS) that coordinates multiple 5G-connected robots both in terms of navigation and sensing, as well as optimizes their cloud-native service resource utilization while minimizing total resource and energy consumption on the robots based on real-time feedback. We designed, implemented and evaluated our proposed OROS in an experimental testbed composed of commercial off-the-shelf robots and a local 5G infrastructure deployed on a campus. The experimental results demonstrated that OROS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of energy savings by offloading demanding computational tasks to the 5G edge infrastructure and dynamic energy management of on-board sensors (e.g., switching them off when they are not needed). This strategy achieves approximately 15% energy savings on the robots, thereby extending battery life, which in turn allows for longer operating times and better resource utilization.</description>

      <title>RCC-PFL: Robust Client Clustering under Noisy Labels in Personalized Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of cluster identity estimation in a personalized federated learning (PFL) setting in which users aim to learn different personal models. The backbone of effective learning in such a setting is to cluster users into groups whose objectives are similar. A typical approach in the literature is to achieve this by training users' data on different proposed personal models and assign them to groups based on which model achieves the lowest value of the users' loss functions. This process is to be done iteratively until group identities converge. A key challenge in such a setting arises when users have noisy labeled data, which may produce misleading values of their loss functions, and hence lead to ineffective clustering. To overcome this challenge, we propose a label-agnostic data similarity-based clustering algorithm, coined RCC-PFL, with three main advantages: the cluster identity estimation procedure is independent from the training labels; it is a one-shot clustering algorithm performed prior to the training; and it requires fewer communication rounds and less computation compared to iterative-based clustering methods. We validate our proposed algorithm using various models and datasets and show that it outperforms multiple baselines in terms of average accuracy and variance reduction.</description>

      <title>STATGRAPH: Effective In-vehicle Intrusion Detection via Multi-view Statistical Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-vehicle network (IVN) is facing complex external cyber-attacks, especially the emerging masquerade attacks with extremely high difficulty of detection while serious damaging effects. In this paper, we propose the STATGRAPH, which is an effective and fine-grained intrusion detection methodology for IVN security services via multi-view statistical graph learning on in-vehicle controller area network (CAN) messages with insight into their variations in periodicity, payload and signal combinations. Specifically, STATGRAPH generates two statistical graphs, timing correlation graph (TCG) and coupling relationship graph (CRG), in every CAN message detection window, where edge attributes in TCGs represent temporal correlation between different message IDs while edge attributes in CRGs denote the neighbour relationship and contextual similarity. Besides, a lightweight shallow layered graph convolution network is trained based on graph property of TCGs and CRGs, which learns the universal laws of various patterns more effectively and further enhance the performance of detection. To address the problem of insufficient attack types in previous intrusion detection, we select two real in-vehicle CAN datasets covering five new instances of sophisticated and stealthy masquerade attacks that are never investigated before. Experimental result shows STATGRAPH improves both detection granularity and detection performance over state-of-the-art intrusion detection methods.

      <title>Multi-hop Differential Topology based Algorithms for Resilient Network of UAV Swarm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm networks face severe challenges of communication network split (CNS) issues caused by massive damage in hostile environments. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm to restore network connectivity by repositioning remaining UAVs based on damage information within local topologies. Particularly, the locations of destroyed UAVs distributed in gaps between disconnected sub-nets are considered for recovery trajectory planning. Specifically, we construct the multi-hop differential sub-graph (MDSG) to represent local damage-varying topologies. Based on this, we develop two distinct algorithms to address CNS issues. The first approach leverages an artificial potential field algorithm to calculate the recovery velocities via MDSG, enabling simple deployment on low-intelligence UAVs. In the second approach, we design an MDSG-based graph convolution framework to find the recovery topology for high-intelligence swarms. As per the unique topology of MDSG, we propose a novel bipartite graph convolution operation, enhanced with a batch-processing mechanism to improve graph convolution efficiency. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms expedite the recovery with significant margin while improving the spatial coverage and topology degree uniformity after recovery.</description>
