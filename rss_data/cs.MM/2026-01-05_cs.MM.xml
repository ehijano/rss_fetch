      <title>FCMBench: A Comprehensive Financial Credit Multimodal Benchmark for Real-world Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As multimodal AI becomes widely used for credit risk assessment and document review, a domain-specific benchmark is urgently needed that (1) reflects documents and workflows specific to financial credit applications, (2) includes credit-specific understanding and real-world robustness, and (3) preserves privacy compliance without sacrificing practical utility. Here, we introduce FCMBench-V1.0 -- a large-scale financial credit multimodal benchmark for real-world applications, covering 18 core certificate types, with 4,043 privacy-compliant images and 8,446 QA samples. The FCMBench evaluation framework consists of three dimensions: Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness, including 3 foundational perception tasks, 4 credit-specific reasoning tasks that require decision-oriented understanding of visual evidence, and 10 real-world acquisition artifact types for robustness stress testing. To reconcile compliance with realism, we construct all samples via a closed synthesis-capture pipeline: we manually synthesize document templates with virtual content and capture scenario-aware images in-house. This design also mitigates pre-training data leakage by avoiding web-sourced or publicly released images. FCMBench can effectively discriminate performance disparities and robustness across modern vision-language models. Extensive experiments were conducted on 23 state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) from 14 top AI companies and research institutes. Among them, Gemini 3 Pro achieves the best F1(\%) score as a commercial model (64.61), Qwen3-VL-235B achieves the best score as an open-source baseline (57.27), and our financial credit-specific model, Qfin-VL-Instruct, achieves the top overall score (64.92). Robustness evaluations show that even top-performing models suffer noticeable performance drops under acquisition artifacts.</description>

      <title>Timed text extraction from Taiwanese Kua-\'a-h\`i TV series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Taiwanese opera (Kua-\'a-h\`i), a major form of local theatrical tradition, underwent extensive television adaptation notably by pioneers like I\^unn L\=e-hua. These videos, while potentially valuable for in-depth studies of Taiwanese opera, often have low quality and require substantial manual effort during data preparation. To streamline this process, we developed an interactive system for real-time OCR correction and a two-step approach integrating OCR-driven segmentation with Speech and Music Activity Detection (SMAD) to efficiently identify vocal segments from archival episodes with high precision. The resulting dataset, consisting of vocal segments and corresponding lyrics, can potentially supports various MIR tasks such as lyrics identification and tune retrieval.

      <title>MR-DAW: Towards Collaborative Digital Audio Workstations in Mixed Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) are central to modern music production but often encumber the musician's workflow, tethering them to a desk and hindering natural interaction with their instrument. Furthermore, effective remote collaboration remains a significant challenge, with existing solutions hampered by network latency and asynchronous file sharing. This paper investigates the potential of Mixed Reality (MR) to overcome these barriers, creating an intuitive environment for real-time, remote musical collaboration. We employ qualitative and speculative design techniques to better understand: 1) how players currently use DAWs, and 2) to imagine a speculative future of collaborative MR-DAWs. To facilitate this discussion, we developed and evaluated the usability of a design probe, MR-DAW. An MR system enabling multiple, geographically dispersed users to control a single, shared DAW instance while moving freely in their local spaces. Our networked system enables each remote musician to use a physical foot pedal for collaborative looping, merging a familiar, hands-free interaction with a shared virtual session. Based on interviews and system evaluations with 20 musicians, we analyze current practices, report on the user experience with our MR system, and speculate on the future of musical collaboration in MR. Our results highlight the affordances of MR for unencumbered musical interaction and provide a speculative outlook on the future of remote collaborative DAWs in the Musical Metaverse.</description>

      <title>Effects of Limited Field of View on Musical Collaboration Experience with Avatars in Extended Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During musical collaboration, visual cues are essential for communication between musicians. Extended Reality (XR) applications, often used with head-mounted displays like Augmented Reality (AR) glasses, can limit the field of view (FOV) of players. We conducted a study to investigate the effects of limited FOV on co-presence, gesture recognition, overall enjoyment, and reaction time.
  Initially, we observed experienced musicians collaborating informally with and without visual occlusion, noting that collaboration suffered with limited FOV. We then conducted a within-subjects study with 19 participants, comparing an unrestricted FOV holographic setup called HoloJam to Nreal AR glasses with a 52$^{\circ}$ limited FOV. In the AR setup, we tested two conditions: standard AR with a 52$^{\circ}$ FOV and a modified AR notification system called Mini Musicians.
  Results showed that HoloJam provided higher co-presence, quicker gesture recognition, and greater enjoyment. The Mini Musicians application reduced reaction time and maintained enjoyment compared to the standard AR setup. We conclude that limited FOV impacts musical collaboration, but notifications can improve reaction time and should be considered in future XR music collaborations.</description>

      <title>Avatar Forcing: Real-Time Interactive Head Avatar Generation for Natural Conversation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Talking head generation creates lifelike avatars from static portraits for virtual communication and content creation. However, current models do not yet convey the feeling of truly interactive communication, often generating one-way responses that lack emotional engagement. We identify two key challenges toward truly interactive avatars: generating motion in real-time under causal constraints and learning expressive, vibrant reactions without additional labeled data. To address these challenges, we propose Avatar Forcing, a new framework for interactive head avatar generation that models real-time user-avatar interactions through diffusion forcing. This design allows the avatar to process real-time multimodal inputs, including the user's audio and motion, with low latency for instant reactions to both verbal and non-verbal cues such as speech, nods, and laughter. Furthermore, we introduce a direct preference optimization method that leverages synthetic losing samples constructed by dropping user conditions, enabling label-free learning of expressive interaction. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework enables real-time interaction with low latency (approximately 500ms), achieving 6.8X speedup compared to the baseline, and produces reactive and expressive avatar motion, which is preferred over 80% against the baseline.</description>

      <title>GameTileNet: A Semantic Dataset for Low-Resolution Game Art in Procedural Content Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: GameTileNet is a dataset designed to provide semantic labels for low-resolution digital game art, advancing procedural content generation (PCG) and related AI research as a vision-language alignment task. Large Language Models (LLMs) and image-generative AI models have enabled indie developers to create visual assets, such as sprites, for game interactions. However, generating visuals that align with game narratives remains challenging due to inconsistent AI outputs, requiring manual adjustments by human artists. The diversity of visual representations in automatically generated game content is also limited because of the imbalance in distributions across styles for training data. GameTileNet addresses this by collecting artist-created game tiles from OpenGameArt.org under Creative Commons licenses and providing semantic annotations to support narrative-driven content generation. The dataset introduces a pipeline for object detection in low-resolution tile-based game art (e.g., 32x32 pixels) and annotates semantics, connectivity, and object classifications. GameTileNet is a valuable resource for improving PCG methods, supporting narrative-rich game content, and establishing a baseline for object detection in low-resolution, non-photorealistic images.
  TL;DR: GameTileNet is a semantic dataset of low-resolution game tiles designed to support narrative-driven procedural content generation through visual-language alignment.</description>

      <title>Narrative-to-Scene Generation: An LLM-Driven Pipeline for 2D Game Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable compelling story generation, but connecting narrative text to playable visual environments remains an open challenge in procedural content generation (PCG). We present a lightweight pipeline that transforms short narrative prompts into a sequence of 2D tile-based game scenes, reflecting the temporal structure of stories. Given an LLM-generated narrative, our system identifies three key time frames, extracts spatial predicates in the form of "Object-Relation-Object" triples, and retrieves visual assets using affordance-aware semantic embeddings from the GameTileNet dataset. A layered terrain is generated using Cellular Automata, and objects are placed using spatial rules grounded in the predicate structure. We evaluated our system in ten diverse stories, analyzing tile-object matching, affordance-layer alignment, and spatial constraint satisfaction across frames. This prototype offers a scalable approach to narrative-driven scene generation and lays the foundation for future work on multi-frame continuity, symbolic tracking, and multi-agent coordination in story-centered PCG.</description>
