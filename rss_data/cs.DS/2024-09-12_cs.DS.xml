      <title>A Simple Linear Space Data Structure for ANN with Application in Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Locality Sensitive Filters are known for offering a quasi-linear space data structure with rigorous guarantees for the Approximate Near Neighbor search problem. Building on Locality Sensitive Filters, we derive a simple data structure for the Approximate Near Neighbor Counting problem under differential privacy. Moreover, we provide a simple analysis leveraging a connection with concomitant statistics and extreme value theory. Our approach achieves the same performance as the recent findings of Andoni et al. (NeurIPS 2023) but with a more straightforward method. As a side result, the paper provides a more compact description and analysis of Locality Sensitive Filters for Approximate Near Neighbor Search under inner product similarity, improving a previous result in Aum\"{u}ller et al. (TODS 2022).</description>

      <title>Dual-Step Optimization for Binary Sequences with High Merit Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of finding aperiodic low auto-correlation binary sequences (LABS) presents a significant computational challenge, particularly as the sequence length increases. Such sequences have important applications in communication engineering, physics, chemistry, and cryptography. This paper introduces a novel dual-step algorithm for long binary sequences with high merit factors. The first step employs a parallel algorithm utilizing skew-symmetry and restriction classes to generate sequence candidates with merit factors above a predefined threshold. The second step uses a priority queue algorithm to refine these candidates further, searching the entire search space unrestrictedly. By combining GPU-based parallel computing and dual-step optimization, our approach has successfully identified new best-known binary sequences for all lengths ranging from 450 to 527, with the exception of length 518, where the previous best-known value was matched with a different sequence. This hybrid method significantly outperforms traditional exhaustive and stochastic search methods, offering an efficient solution for finding long sequences with good merit factors.</description>

      <title>Deterministic approximation for the volume of the truncated fractional matching polytope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a deterministic polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for the volume of the truncated fractional matching polytope for graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$, where the truncation is by restricting each variable to the interval $[0,\frac{1+\delta}{\Delta}]$, and $\delta\le \frac{C}{\Delta}$ for some constant $C&gt;0$. We also generalise our result to the fractional matching polytope for hypergraphs of maximum degree $\Delta$ and maximum hyperedge size $k$, truncated by $[0,\frac{1+\delta}{\Delta}]$ as well, where $\delta\le C\Delta^{-\frac{2k-3}{k-1}}k^{-1}$ for some constant $C&gt;0$. The latter result generalises both the first result for graphs (when $k=2$), and a result by Bencs and Regts (2024) for the truncated independence polytope (when $\Delta=2$). Our approach is based on the cluster expansion technique.</description>

      <title>Improved Hardness Results of the Cardinality-Based Minimum s-t Cut Problem in Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In hypergraphs an edge that crosses a cut can be split in several ways, depending on how many nodes are placed on each side of the cut. A cardinality-based splitting function assigns a nonnegative cost of $w_i$ for each cut hyperedge $e$ with exactly $i$ nodes on the side of the cut that contains the minority of nodes from $e$. The cardinality-based minimum $s$-$t$ cut aims to find an $s$-$t$ cut with minimum total cost. Assuming the costs $w_i$ are polynomially bounded by the input size and $w_0=0$ and $w_1=1$, we show that if the costs satisfy $w_i &gt; w_{i-j}+w_{j}$ for some $i \in \{2, \ldots \floor*{n/2}\}$ and $j \in \{1,\ldots,\floor*{i/2}\}$, then the problem becomes NP-hard. Our result also holds for $k$-uniform hypergraphs with $k \geq 4$. Additionally, we show that the \textsc{No-Even-Split} problem in $4$-uniform hypergraphs is NP-hard.</description>

      <title>Partitioning Problems with Splittings and Interval Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.11753v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $n$-way number partitioning problem is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization, with applications to diverse settings such as fair allocation and machine scheduling. All these problems are NP-hard, but various approximation algorithms are known. We consider three closely related kinds of approximations.
  The first two variants optimize the partition such that: in the first variant some fixed number $s$ of items can be \emph{split} between two or more bins and in the second variant we allow at most a fixed number $t$ of \emph{splittings}. The third variant is a decision problem: the largest bin sum must be within a pre-specified interval, parameterized by a fixed rational number $u$ times the largest item size.
  When the number of bins $n$ is unbounded, we show that every variant is strongly {\sf NP}-complete. When the number of bins $n$ is fixed, the running time depends on the fixed parameters $s,t,u$. For each variant, we give a complete picture of its running time.
  For $n=2$, the running time is easy to identify. Our main results consider any fixed integer $n \geq 3$. Using a two-way polynomial-time reduction between the first and the third variant, we show that $n$-way number-partitioning with $s$ split items can be solved in polynomial time if $s \geq n-2$, and it is {\sf NP}-complete otherwise. Also, $n$-way number-partitioning with $t$ splittings can be solved in polynomial time if $t \geq n-1$, and it is {\sf NP}-complete otherwise. Finally, we show that the third variant can be solved in polynomial time if $u \geq (n-2)/n$, and it is {\sf NP}-complete otherwise. Our positive results for the optimization problems consider both min-max and max-min versions.
  Using the same reduction, we provide a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the case where the number of split items is lower than $n-2$.</description>

      <title>A nearly optimal randomized algorithm for explorable heap selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.05982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explorable heap selection is the problem of selecting the $n$th smallest value in a binary heap. The key values can only be accessed by traversing through the underlying infinite binary tree, and the complexity of the algorithm is measured by the total distance traveled in the tree (each edge has unit cost). This problem was originally proposed as a model to study search strategies for the branch-and-bound algorithm with storage restrictions by Karp, Saks and Widgerson (FOCS '86), who gave deterministic and randomized $n\cdot \exp(O(\sqrt{\log{n}}))$ time algorithms using $O(\log(n)^{2.5})$ and $O(\sqrt{\log n})$ space respectively. We present a new randomized algorithm with running time $O(n\log(n)^3)$ using $O(\log n)$ space, substantially improving the previous best randomized running time at the expense of slightly increased space usage. We also show an $\Omega(\log(n)n/\log(\log(n)))$ for any algorithm that solves the problem in the same amount of space, indicating that our algorithm is nearly optimal.</description>

      <title>The Structure of Hypergraphs Arising in Cellular Mobile Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.00515v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An assumption that researchers have often used to model interference in a wireless network is the unit disk graph model. While many theoretical results and performance guarantees have been obtained under this model, an open research direction is to extend these results to hypergraph interference models. Motivated by recent results that the worst-case performance of the distributed maximal scheduling algorithm is characterized by the interference degree of the hypergraph, in the present work we investigate properties of the interference degree of the hypergraph and the structure of hypergraphs arising from physical constraints. We show that the problem of computing the interference degree of a hypergraph is NP-hard and we prove some properties and results concerning this hypergraph invariant. We investigate which hypergraphs are realizable, i.e. which hypergraphs arise in practice, based on physical constraints, as the interference model of a wireless network. In particular, a question that arises naturally is: what is the maximal value of $r$ such that the hypergraph $K_{1,r}$ is realizable? We determine this quantity for various integral and nonintegral values of the path loss exponent of signal propagation. We also investigate hypergraphs generated by line networks.</description>
