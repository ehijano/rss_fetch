      <title>A Masked Representation Learning to Model Cardiac Functions Using Multiple Physiological Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In clinical settings, monitoring hemodynamics is crucial for managing patient prognosis, necessitating the integrated analysis of multiple physiological signals. While recent research has analyzed single signals such as electrocardiography (ECG) or photoplethysmography (PPG), there has yet to be a proposal for an approach that encompasses the complex signal analysis required in actual clinical scenarios. In this study, we introduce the SNUPHY-M (Seoul National University hospital PHYsiological signal Masked representation learning) model extracts physiological features reflecting the electrical, pressure, and fluid characteristics of the cardiac cycle in the process of restoring three masked physiological signals based on self-supervised learning (SSL): ECG, PPG, and arterial blood pressure (ABP) signals. By employing multiple physical characteristics, the model can extract more enriched features only using non-invasive signals. We evaluated the model's performance in clinical downstream tasks such as hypotension, stroke volume, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and age prediction. Our results showed that the SNUPHY-M significantly outperformed supervised or SSL models, especially in prediction tasks using non-invasive signals. To the best of our knowledge, SNUPHY-M is the first model to apply multi-modal SSL to cardiovascular analysis involving ECG, PPG, and ABP signals. This approach effectively supports clinical decision-making and enables precise diagnostics, contributing significantly to the early diagnosis and management of hemodynamics without invasiveness.</description>

      <title>Deploying AI for Signal Processing education: Selected challenges and intriguing opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools that have emerged in recent years -- including large language models, automated coding assistants, and advanced image and speech generation technologies -- are the result of monumental human achievements. These breakthroughs reflect mastery across multiple technical disciplines and the resolution of significant technological challenges. However, some of the most profound challenges may still lie ahead. These challenges are not purely technical but pertain to the fair and responsible use of AI in ways that genuinely improve the global human condition. This article explores one promising application aligned with that vision: the use of AI tools to facilitate and enhance education, with a specific focus on signal processing (SP). It presents two interrelated perspectives: identifying and addressing technical limitations, and applying AI tools in practice to improve educational experiences. Primers are provided on several core technical issues that arise when using AI in educational settings, including how to ensure fairness and inclusivity, handle hallucinated outputs, and achieve efficient use of resources. These and other considerations -- such as transparency, explainability, and trustworthiness -- are illustrated through the development of an immersive, structured, and reliable "smart textbook." The article serves as a resource for researchers and educators seeking to advance AI's role in engineering education.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Deep Learning-Based Scatter Estimation in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Scatter artifacts drastically degrade the image quality of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans. Although deep learning-based methods show promise in estimating scatter from CBCT measurements, their deployment in mobile CBCT systems or edge devices is still limited due to the large memory footprint of the networks. This study addresses the issue by applying networks at varying resolutions and suggesting an optimal one, based on speed and accuracy.
  Methods: First, the reconstruction error in down-up sampling of CBCT scatter signal was examined at six resolutions by comparing four interpolation methods. Next, a recent state-of-the-art method was trained across five image resolutions and evaluated for the reductions in floating-point operations (FLOPs), inference times, and GPU memory requirements.
  Results: Reducing the input size and network parameters achieved a 78-fold reduction in FLOPs compared to the baseline method, while maintaining comarable performance in terms of mean-absolute-percentage-error (MAPE) and mean-square-error (MSE). Specifically, the MAPE decreased to 3.85% compared to 4.42%, and the MSE decreased to 1.34 \times 10^{-2} compared to 2.01 \times 10^{-2}. Inference time and GPU memory usage were reduced by factors of 16 and 12, respectively. Further experiments comparing scatter-corrected reconstructions on a large, simulated dataset and real CBCT scans from water and Sedentex CT phantoms clearly demonstrated the robustness of our method.
  Conclusion: This study highlights the underappreciated role of downsampling in deep learning-based scatter estimation. The substantial reduction in FLOPs and GPU memory requirements achieved by our method enables scatter correction in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile CBCT and edge devices.</description>

      <title>6G Resilience -- White Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 6G must be designed to withstand, adapt to, and evolve amid prolonged, complex disruptions. Mobile networks' shift from efficiency-first to sustainability-aware has motivated this white paper to assert that resilience is a primary design goal, alongside sustainability and efficiency, encompassing technology, architecture, and economics. We promote resilience by analysing dependencies between mobile networks and other critical systems, such as energy, transport, and emergency services, and illustrate how cascading failures spread through infrastructures. We formalise resilience using the 3R framework: reliability, robustness, resilience. Subsequently, we translate this into measurable capabilities: graceful degradation, situational awareness, rapid reconfiguration, and learning-driven improvement and recovery.
  Architecturally, we promote edge-native and locality-aware designs, open interfaces, and programmability to enable islanded operations, fallback modes, and multi-layer diversity (radio, compute, energy, timing). Key enablers include AI-native control loops with verifiable behaviour, zero-trust security rooted in hardware and supply-chain integrity, and networking techniques that prioritise critical traffic, time-sensitive flows, and inter-domain coordination.
  Resilience also has a techno-economic aspect: open platforms and high-quality complementors generate ecosystem externalities that enhance resilience while opening new markets. We identify nine business-model groups and several patterns aligned with the 3R objectives, and we outline governance and standardisation. This white paper serves as an initial step and catalyst for 6G resilience. It aims to inspire researchers, professionals, government officials, and the public, providing them with the essential components to understand and shape the development of 6G resilience.</description>

      <title>Personalized Sleep Prediction via Deep Adaptive Spatiotemporal Modeling and Sparse Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sleep forecast allows individuals and healthcare providers to anticipate and proactively address factors influencing restful rest, ultimately improving mental and physical well-being. This work presents an adaptive spatial and temporal model (AdaST-Sleep) for predicting sleep scores. Our proposed model combines convolutional layers to capture spatial feature interactions between multiple features and recurrent neural network layers to handle longer-term temporal health-related data. A domain classifier is further integrated to generalize across different subjects. We conducted several experiments using five input window sizes (3, 5, 7, 9, 11 days) and five predicting window sizes (1, 3, 5, 7, 9 days). Our approach consistently outperformed four baseline models, achieving its lowest RMSE (0.282) with a seven-day input window and a one-day predicting window. Moreover, the method maintained strong performance even when forecasting multiple days into the future, demonstrating its versatility for real-world applications. Visual comparisons reveal that the model accurately tracks both the overall sleep score level and daily fluctuations. These findings prove that the proposed framework provides a robust and adaptable solution for personalized sleep forecasting using sparse data from commercial wearable devices and domain adaptation techniques.</description>

      <title>Improving the Elevational Focusing of Fast Orthogonal Row-Column Electronic Scanning (FORCES) Ultrasound Imaging using Retrospective Transmit Beamforming (RTB)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in Row Column Arrays (RCAs) have presented promising options for volumetric imaging without the need for the excessive channel counts of fully wired 2D-arrays. Bias programmable RCAs, also known as Top Orthogonal to Bottom Electrode (TOBE) Arrays, show further promise in that imaging schemes, such as Fast Orthogonal Row-Column Electronic Scanning (FORCES) allow for full transmit and receive focusing everywhere in the image plane. However, due to its fixed elevational focus and large transmit aperture, FORCES experiences poor elevational focusing away from the focal point. In this study we present a modification to the FORCES imaging scheme by applying Retrospective Transmit Beamforming (RTB) in the elevational direction to allow for elevational transmit focusing everywhere in the imaging plane. We evaluate FORCES and uFORCES methods, with and without RTB applied, when imaging both a cyst and wire phantom. With experiment we show improved elevational focusing capabilities away from the focal point when RTB is applied to both FORCES and uFORCES. At the focal point, performance with RTB remains comparable or improved relative to standard FORCES. This is quantified by the measurement of Full Width Half Max when imaging the wire phantom, and by the generalized Contrast to Noise Ratio when imaging the tubular cyst phantom. We also demonstrate the volumetric imaging capabilities of FORCES RTB with the wire phantom.</description>

      <title>Signed Graph Learning with Hidden Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signed graphs, which are characterized by both positive and negative edge weights, have recently attracted significant attention in the field of graph signal processing (GSP). Existing works on signed graph learning typically assume that all graph nodes are available. However, in some specific applications, only a subset of nodes can be observed while the remaining nodes stay hidden. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method for identifying signed graph that accounts for hidden nodes, termed \textit{signed graph learning with hidden nodes under column-sparsity regularization} (SGL-HNCS). Our method is based on the assumption that graph signals are smooth over signed graphs, i.e., signal values of two nodes connected by positive (negative) edges are similar (dissimilar). Rooted in this prior assumption, the topology inference of a signed graph is formulated as a constrained optimization problem with column-sparsity regularization, where the goal is to reconstruct the signed graph Laplacian matrix without disregarding the influence of hidden nodes. We solve the constrained optimization problem using a tailored block coordinate descent (BCD) approach. Experimental results using synthetic data and real-world data demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed SGL-HNCS method.</description>

      <title>Sequential Spectral Clustering of Data Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of nonparametric clustering of data sequences, where each data sequence comprises i.i.d. samples generated from an unknown distribution. The true clusters are the clusters obtained using the Spectral clustering algorithm (SPEC) on the pairwise distance between the true distributions corresponding to the data sequences. Since the true distributions are unknown, the objective is to estimate the clusters by observing the minimum number of samples from the data sequences for a given error probability. To solve this problem, we propose the Sequential Spectral clustering algorithm (SEQ-SPEC), and show that it stops in finite time almost surely and is exponentially consistent. We also propose a computationally more efficient algorithm called the Incremental Approximate Sequential Spectral clustering algorithm (IA-SEQ-SPEC). Through simulations, we show that both our proposed algorithms perform better than the fixed sample size SPEC, the Sequential $K$-Medoids clustering algorithm (SEQ-KMED) and the Sequential Single Linkage clustering algorithm (SEQ-SLINK). The IA-SEQ-SPEC, while being computationally efficient, performs close to SEQ-SPEC on both synthetic and real-world datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on spectral clustering of data sequences under a sequential framework.</description>

      <title>JFRFFNet: A Data-Model Co-Driven Graph Signal Denoising Model with Partial Prior Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wiener filtering in the joint time-vertex fractional Fourier transform (JFRFT) domain has shown high effectiveness in denoising time-varying graph signals. Traditional filtering models use grid search to determine the transform-order pair and compute filter coefficients, while learnable ones employ gradient-descent strategies to optimize them; both require complete prior information of graph signals. To overcome this shortcoming, this letter proposes a data-model co-driven denoising approach, termed neural-network-aided joint time-vertex fractional Fourier filtering (JFRFFNet), which embeds the JFRFT-domain Wiener filter model into a neural network and updates the transform-order pair and filter coefficients through a data-driven approach. This design enables effective denoising using only partial prior information. Experiments demonstrate that JFRFFNet achieves significant improvements in output signal-to-noise ratio compared with some state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>On Sampling of Multiple Correlated Stochastic Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple stochastic signals possess inherent statistical correlations, yet conventional sampling methods that process each channel independently result in data redundancy. To leverage this correlation for efficient sampling, we model correlated channels as a linear combination of a smaller set of uncorrelated, wide-sense stationary latent sources. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the total sampling density for zero mean-square error reconstruction, proving it equals the ratio of the joint spectral bandwidth of latent sources to the number of correlated signal channels. We then develop a constructive multi-band sampling scheme that attains this bound. The proposed method operates via spectral partitioning of the latent sources, followed by spatio-temporal sampling and interpolation. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets confirm that our scheme achieves near-lossless reconstruction precisely at the theoretical sampling density, validating its efficiency.</description>

      <title>Improved Riemannian potato field: an Automatic Artifact Rejection Method for EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) signal cleaning has long been a critical challenge in the research community. The presence of artifacts can significantly degrade EEG data quality, complicating analysis and potentially leading to erroneous interpretations. While various artifact rejection methods have been proposed, the gold standard remains manual visual inspection by human experts-a process that is time-consuming, subjective, and impractical for large-scale EEG studies. Existing techniques are often hindered by a strong reliance on manual hyperparameter tuning, sensitivity to outliers, and high computational costs. In this paper, we introduce the improved Riemannian Potato Field (iRPF), a fast and fully automated method for EEG artifact rejection that addresses key limitations of current approaches. We evaluate iRPF against several state-of-the-art artifact rejection methods, using two publicly available EEG databases, labeled for various artifact types, comprising 226 EEG recordings. Our results demonstrate that iRPF outperforms all competitors across multiple metrics, with gains of up to 22% in recall, 102% in specificity, 54% in precision, and 24% in F1-score, compared to Isolation Forest, Autoreject, Riemannian Potato, and Riemannian Potato Field, respectively. Statistical analysis confirmed the significance of these improvements (p &lt; 0.001) with large effect sizes (Cohen's d &gt; 0.8) in most comparisons. Additionally, on a typical EEG recording iRPF performs artifact cleaning in under 8 milliseconds per epoch using a standard laptop, highlighting its efficiency for large-scale EEG data processing and real-time applications. iRPF offers a robust and data-driven artifact rejection solution for high-quality EEG pre-processing in brain-computer interfaces and clinical neuroimaging applications.</description>

      <title>On the Relation of Characteristic Modes of Different Conducting Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A formalism is derived to analyze the scattering of a conducting structure based on the characteristic modes of another structure whose surface is a superset of the first structure. This enables the analysis and comparison of different structures using a common basis of characteristic modes. Additionally, it is shown that the scattering matrices and perturbation matrices are no longer diagonal in these cases. Based on this, a modal transformation matrix is defined to describe the mapping between the characteristic fields and the weighting coefficients of the two structures. This matrix enables the conversion of the perturbation matrices in different bases. Finally, two examples are provided along with a discussion of some aspects of the theory. The first example aims to validate and illustrate the formalism. The second example shows how the formalism can be applied in the design process of an antenna element that is gradually modified, starting from a base structure.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation and Analog Precoding for Pixel-based Fluid-Antenna-Assisted Multiuser MIMO-OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pixel-based fluid antennas provide enhanced multiplexing gains and quicker radiation pattern switching than traditional designs. However, this innovation introduces challenges for channel estimation and analog precoding due to the state-non-separable channel response problem. This paper explores a multiuser MIMO-OFDM system utilizing pixel-based fluid antennas, informed by measurements from a real-world prototype. We present a sparse channel recovery framework for uplink channel sounding, employing an approximate separable channel response model with DNN-based antenna radiation functions. We then propose two low-complexity channel estimation algorithms that leverage orthogonal matching pursuit and variational Bayesian inference to accurately recover channel responses across various scattering cluster angles. These estimations enable the prediction of composite channels for all fluid antenna states, leading to an analog precoding scheme that optimally selects switching states for different antennas. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms several baseline methods, especially in high signal-to-noise ratio environments with numerous users.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Scale Feature Extraction and Fusion UNet for Pathloss Prediction in UAV-Assisted mmWave Radio Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate pathloss prediction is essential for the design and optimization of UAV-assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) networks. While deep learning approaches have shown strong potential, their generalization across diverse environments, robustness to noisy inputs, and sensitivity to UAV altitude remain underexplored. To address these challenges, we propose a UNet-based deep learning architecture that combines multi-scale feature extraction, convolution-based feature fusion, and an atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) bottleneck for efficient context aggregation. The model predicts pathloss maps from log-distance, line-of-sight (LOS) mask, and building mask inputs. In addition, we develop a fully vectorized LOS mask computation algorithm that significantly accelerates pre-processing and enables large-scale dataset generation. Extensive evaluations on both in-house ray-tracing data and the RadioMapSeer benchmark demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy and efficiency. All source code is publicly released to support reproducibility and future research.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Identifying Pareto-Efficient Coordination -- A Distributionally Robust Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to identify Pareto-efficient behavior in a multi-agent system, and reconstruct utility functions of the individual agents. Motivated by the problem of detecting UAV coordination, how can we construct a statistical detector for Pareto-efficient behavior given noisy measurements of the decisions of a multi-agent system? This paper approaches this IRL problem by deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for a dataset of multi-agent system dynamics to be consistent with Pareto-efficient coordination, and providing algorithms for recovering utility functions which are consistent with the system dynamics. We derive an optimal statistical detector for determining Pareto-efficient coordination from noisy system measurements, which minimizes Type-I statistical detection error. Then, we provide a utility estimation algorithm which minimizes the worst-case estimation error over a statistical ambiguity set centered at empirical observations; this min-max solution achieves distributionally robust IRL, which is crucial in adversarial strategic interactions. We illustrate these results in a detailed example for detecting Pareto-efficient coordination among multiple UAVs given noisy measurement recorded at a radar. We then reconstruct the utility functions of the UAVs in a distributionally robust sense.</description>

      <title>A Scoping Review of Machine Learning Applications in Power System Protection and Disturbance Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of renewable and distributed energy resources reshapes modern power systems, challenging conventional protection schemes. This scoping review synthesizes recent literature on machine learning (ML) applications in power system protection and disturbance management, following the PRISMA for Scoping Reviews framework. Based on over 100 publications, three key objectives are addressed: (i) assessing the scope of ML research in protection tasks; (ii) evaluating ML performance across diverse operational scenarios; and (iii) identifying methods suitable for evolving grid conditions. ML models often demonstrate high accuracy on simulated datasets; however, their performance under real-world conditions remains insufficiently validated. The existing literature is fragmented, with inconsistencies in methodological rigor, dataset quality, and evaluation metrics. This lack of standardization hampers the comparability of results and limits the generalizability of findings. To address these challenges, this review introduces a ML-oriented taxonomy for protection tasks, resolves key terminological inconsistencies, and advocates for standardized reporting practices. It further provides guidelines for comprehensive dataset documentation, methodological transparency, and consistent evaluation protocols, aiming to improve reproducibility and enhance the practical relevance of research outcomes. Critical gaps remain, including the scarcity of real-world validation, insufficient robustness testing, and limited consideration of deployment feasibility. Future research should prioritize public benchmark datasets, realistic validation methods, and advanced ML architectures. These steps are essential to move ML-based protection from theoretical promise to practical deployment in increasingly dynamic and decentralized power systems.</description>

      <title>Automotive sound field reproduction using deep optimization with spatial domain constraint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sound field reproduction with undistorted sound quality and precise spatial localization is desirable for automotive audio systems. However, the complexity of automotive cabin acoustic environment often necessitates a trade-off between sound quality and spatial accuracy. To overcome this limitation, we propose Spatial Power Map Net (SPMnet), a learning-based sound field reproduction method that improves both sound quality and spatial localization in complex environments. We introduce a spatial power map (SPM) constraint, which characterizes the angular energy distribution of the reproduced field using beamforming. This constraint guides energy toward the intended direction to enhance spatial localization, and is integrated into a multi-channel equalization framework to also improve sound quality under reverberant conditions. To address the resulting non-convexity, deep optimization that use neural networks to solve optimization problems is employed for filter design. Both in situ objective and subjective evaluations confirm that our method enhances sound quality and improves spatial localization within the automotive cabin. Furthermore, we analyze the influence of different audio materials and the arrival angles of the virtual sound source in the reproduced sound field, investigating the potential underlying factors affecting these results.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimisation of Load Balancing and Energy Efficiency for O-RAN Deployments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture provides an intrinsic capability to exploit key performance monitoring (KPM) within Radio Intelligence Controller (RIC) to derive network optimisation through xApps. These xApps can leverage KPM knowledge to dynamically switch on/off the associated RUs where such a function is supported over the E2 interface. Several existing studies employ artificial intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) based approaches to realise such dynamic sleeping for increased energy efficiency (EE). Nevertheless, most of these approaches rely upon offloading user equipment (UE) to carve out a sleeping opportunity. Such an approach inherently creates load imbalance across the network. Such load imbalance may impact the throughput performance of offloaded UEs as they might be allocated a lower number of physical resource blocks (PRBs). Maintaining the same PRB allocation while addressing the EE at the network level is a challenging task. To that end, in this article, we present a comprehensive ML-based framework for joint optimisation of load balancing and EE for ORAN deployments. We formulate the problem as a multi-class classification system that predictively evaluates potential RU configurations before optimising the EE, mapping network conditions to three load balance categories (Well Balanced, Moderately Balanced, Imbalanced). Our multi-threshold approach (Conservative, Moderate, Aggressive) accommodates different operational priorities between energy savings and performance assurance. Experimental evaluation using 4.26 million real network measurements from simulations demonstrates that our Random Forest model achieves 98.3% F1-macro performance, representing 195% improvement over traditional baseline strategies.</description>

      <title>Frozen differential scattering in reconfigurable complex media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sensitivity of transmission to the input wavefront is a hallmark feature of complex media and the basis for wavefront shaping techniques. Yet, intriguing special cases exist in which the output wavefront is "frozen" (agnostic to the input wavefront). This happens when special structure in the complex medium collapses the rank of its transmission matrix to unity. Here, we unveil that an analogous phenomenon exists more universally for differential scattering (including reflection) in reconfigurable complex media. Specifically, for a localized perturbation, the differential scattering matrix of any complex medium has rank one. One consequence is that the differential output signal is perfectly coherent irrespective of the input wavefront's coherence. Moreover, the thermal noise emitted into the frozen differential output mode has a particular structure that can be exploited for thermal noise management. We experimentally evidence frozen differential scattering in a rich-scattering wireless link parametrized by a programmable meta-atom. Then, we demonstrate "customized freezing" by optimizing the configuration of additional programmable meta-atoms that parametrize the wireless link, as envisioned for 6G networks. We impose particular shapes of the frozen differential output mode, and maximize its signal-to-thermal-noise ratio. Potential applications include filtering and stabilization of differential wavefronts, as well as imaging, sensing, and communication in complex media.</description>

      <title>RSMA-Enhanced Data Collection in RIS-Assisted Intelligent Consumer Transportation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the data collection enhancement problem in a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered intelligent consumer transportation system (ICTS). We propose a novel framework where a data center (DC) provides energy to pre-configured roadside unit (RSU) pairs during the downlink stage. While in the uplink stage, these RSU pairs utilize a hybrid rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) and time-division multiple access (TDMA) protocol to transmit the processed data to the DC, while simultaneously performing local data processing using the harvested energy. Our objective is to maximize the minimal processed data volume of the RSU pairs by jointly optimizing the RIS downlink and uplink phase shifts, the transmit power of the DC and RSUs, the RSU computation resource allocation, and the time slot allocation. To address the formulated non-convex problem, we develop an efficient iterative algorithm integrating alternating optimization and sequential rank-one constraint relaxation methods. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms baseline schemes under diverse scenarios, validating its effectiveness in enhancing the data processing performance for intelligent transportation applications.</description>

      <title>Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Reliable Interpretation of Radio Regulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study question answering in the domain of radio regulations, a legally sensitive and high-stakes area. We propose a telecom-specific Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline and introduce, to our knowledge, the first multiple-choice evaluation set for this domain, constructed from authoritative sources using automated filtering and human validation. To assess retrieval quality, we define a domain-specific retrieval metric, under which our retriever achieves approximately 97% accuracy. Beyond retrieval, our approach consistently improves generation accuracy across all tested models. In particular, while naively inserting documents without structured retrieval yields only marginal gains for GPT-4o (less than 1%), applying our pipeline results in nearly a 12% relative improvement. These findings demonstrate that carefully targeted grounding provides a simple yet strong baseline and an effective domain-specific solution for regulatory question answering. All code and evaluation scripts, along with our derived question-answer dataset, are available at https://github.com/Zakaria010/Radio-RAG.</description>

      <title>EM-Based Channel Estimation for mMIMO LEO SATCOM Under Imperfect Doppler Compensation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output low-Earth-orbit communication channels are highly time-varying due to severe Doppler shifts and propagation delays. While satellite-mobility-induced Doppler shifts can be compensated using known ephemeris data, those caused by user mobility require accurate user positioning information; the absence of such information contributes to amplified channel aging in conventional channel estimators. To address this challenge, we propose a data-aided channel estimator based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, combined with a discrete Legendre polynomial basis expansion method (DLP-BEM), to estimate the channel under imperfect Doppler compensation. The EM algorithm iteratively exploits hidden data symbols for improved channel estimation, while DLP-BEM regularizes the process by projecting the channel estimate onto a lower-dimensional subspace that mitigates estimation errors. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework over existing methods in terms of normalized mean square error and symbol error rate.</description>

Abstract: This paper deals with the noise identification of a linear time-varying stochastic dynamic system described by the state-space model. In particular, the stress is laid on the design of the correlation measurement difference method for estimation of the state and measurement noise covariance matrices for both observable and \textit{unobservable} systems with possibly unknown input sequence. The method provides unbiased and consistent estimates and is implemented in a publicly available MATLAB toolbox and numerically evaluated.</description>

Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication is a key technology for enabling intelligent transportation systems (ITS) that can improve road safety, traffic efficiency, and environmental sustainability. Among the various V2X applications, platooning is one of the most promising ones, as it allows a group of vehicles to travel closely together at high speeds, reducing fuel consumption and emissions. However, it poses significant challenges for wireless communication, such as high reliability and low latency. In this paper, we evaluate the benefits of group scheduling, also referred to as Mode 2d, which is based on a distributed and scheduled resource allocation scheme that allows the group of cars to select resources from a configured pool without network assistance. We evaluated the scheme through simulations, and the results show that this approach can meet the reliability, low latency, and data rate requirements for platooning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrafast power Doppler imaging (uPDI) has achieved substantial progress and emerged as a key modality for both research and clinical applications. However, existing simulation tools are insufficient for generating three-dimensional (3D), quantitatively accurate flow fields with tissue motion that closely approximate in vivo conditions. In this study, we present an open-source framework, termed \emph{3D-Fully Quantitative Flow} (3D-FQFlow), designed to provide quantitative modeling of 3D vascular hemodynamics with physiologically realistic tissue motion for uPDI.The framework integrates a L-system-based vascular generator with hemodynamics modeling, a tissue motion simulator supporting user-defined or clinical-data-driven condition, an optimized ultrasound simulator, a GPU-accelerated image reconstruction module, and a quantitative analyzer (MSE/PSNR/SSIM).
  We demonstrate the workflow and performance of 3D-FQFlow using both synthetic vascular structures and clinical datasets. This framework provides ground-truth simulation models to support the development, validation, and benchmarking of uPDI techniques.

      <description>arXiv:2209.14900v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an intriguing distributed machine learning approach due to its privacy-preserving characteristics. To balance the trade-off between energy and execution latency, and thus accommodate different demands and application scenarios, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize a weighted sum of total energy consumption and completion time through two weight parameters. The optimization variables include bandwidth, transmission power and CPU frequency of each device in the FL system, where all devices are linked to a base station and train a global model collaboratively. Through decomposing the non-convex optimization problem into two subproblems, we devise a resource allocation algorithm to determine the bandwidth allocation, transmission power, and CPU frequency for each participating device. We further present the convergence analysis and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm not only has better performance at different weight parameters (i.e., different demands) but also outperforms the state of the art.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16557v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The channel polarization behavior of polar codes under noise with memory is investigated. By introducing a genie-aided channel model, we first show that the polarized subchannels still converge to extremal channels under the standard polar coding framework. More importantly, we explicitly quantify the gap between the mutual information achieved by ignoring memory effects and the actual capacity attained after sufficient polarization. It is proven that the channel capacity remains achievable even without prior knowledge of the channel noise. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the polarization rate is slower than that in the binary-input memoryless channel (BMC) case, provided that the channel transition function satisfies certain conditions. In particular, the Bhattacharyya parameter is asymptotically upper-bounded and lower-bounded by a polynomial function and an exponential function with respect to the block length, respectively.</description>

      <title>Communication Compression for Distributed Learning without Control Variates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributed learning algorithms, such as the ones employed in Federated Learning (FL), require communication compression to reduce the cost of client uploads. The compression methods used in practice are often biased, making error feedback necessary both to achieve convergence under aggressive compression and to provide theoretical convergence guarantees. However, error feedback requires client-specific control variates, creating two key challenges: it violates privacy-preserving principles and demands stateful clients. In this paper, we propose Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe), a novel distributed learning framework that allows highly compressible client updates by exploiting past aggregated updates, and does not require control variates. We consider Distributed Gradient Descent (DGD) as a representative algorithm and analytically prove CAFe's superiority to Distributed Compressed Gradient Descent (DCGD) with biased compression in the non-convex regime with bounded gradient dissimilarity. Experimental results confirm that CAFe outperforms existing distributed learning compression schemes.</description>

      <title>High Performance Signal Design for Optical OFDM Systems using Variational Autoencoder</title>

Abstract: This letter proposes a design of low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), low symbol error rate (SER), and high data rate signal for optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. The proposed design leverages a variational autoencoder (VAE) incorporating gradual loss learning to jointly optimize the geometry and probability of the constellation's symbols. This not only enhances mutual information (MI) but also effectively reduces the PAPR while maintaining a low SER for reliable transmission. We evaluate the performance of the proposed VAE-based design by comparing the MI, SER, and PAPR against existing techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a considerably lower PAPR while maintaining superior SER and MI performance for a wide range of SNRs.</description>

      <title>Preprocessing Algorithm Leveraging Geometric Modeling for Scale Correction in Hyperspectral Images for Improved Unmixing Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral variability significantly impacts the accuracy and convergence of hyperspectral unmixing algorithms. Many methods address complex spectral variability; yet large-scale distortions to the scale of the observed pixel signatures due to topography, illumination, and shadowing remain a major challenge. These variations often degrade unmixing performance and complicate model fitting. Because of this, correcting these variations can offer significant advantages in real-world GIS applications. In this paper, we propose a novel preprocessing algorithm that corrects scale-induced spectral variability prior to unmixing. By estimating and correcting these distortions to the scale of the pixel signatures, the algorithm produces pixel signatures with minimal distortions in scale. Since these distortions in scale (which hinder the performance of many unmixing methods) are greatly minimized in the output provided by the proposed method, the abundance estimation of the unmixing algorithms is significantly improved. We present a rigorous mathematical framework to describe and correct for scale variability and provide extensive experimental validation of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the algorithm's impact is evaluated across a wide range of state-of-the-art unmixing methods on two synthetic and two real hyperspectral datasets. The proposed preprocessing step consistently improves the performance of these algorithms, achieving error reductions of around 50%, even for algorithms specifically designed to handle spectral variability. This demonstrates that scale correction acts as a complementary step, facilitating more accurate unmixing with existing methods. The algorithm's generality, consistent impact, and significant influence highlight its potential as a key component in practical hyperspectral unmixing pipelines. The implementation code will be made publicly available upon publication.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Automatic Modulation Recognition With a Reconstruction-Driven Vision Transformer Under Limited Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio, spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised, self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust, discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only 15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and label-efficient solution for AMR.</description>
