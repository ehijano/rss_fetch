      <title>VN-Net: Vision-Numerical Fusion Graph Convolutional Network for Sparse Spatio-Temporal Meteorological Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse meteorological forecasting is indispensable for fine-grained weather forecasting and deserves extensive attention. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks (ST-GCNs) in predicting numerical data from ground weather stations. However, as one of the highest fidelity and lowest latency data, the application of the vision data from satellites in ST-GCNs remains unexplored. There are few studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of combining the above multi-modal data for sparse meteorological forecasting. Towards this objective, we introduce Vision-Numerical Fusion Graph Convolutional Network (VN-Net), which mainly utilizes: 1) Numerical-GCN (N-GCN) to adaptively model the static and dynamic patterns of spatio-temporal numerical data; 2) Vision-LSTM Network (V-LSTM) to capture multi-scale joint channel and spatial features from time series satellite images; 4) a GCN-based decoder to generate hourly predictions of specified meteorological factors. As far as we know, VN-Net is the first attempt to introduce GCN method to utilize multi-modal data for better handling sparse spatio-temporal meteorological forecasting. Our experiments on Weather2k dataset show VN-Net outperforms state-of-the-art by a significant margin on mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) for temperature, relative humidity, and visibility forecasting. Furthermore, we conduct interpretation analysis and design quantitative evaluation metrics to assess the impact of incorporating vision data.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learned Closure of URANS for Stably Stratified Turbulence: Connecting Physical Timescales &amp; Data Hyperparameters of Deep Time-Series Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop time-series machine learning (ML) methods for closure modeling of the Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (URANS) equations applied to stably stratified turbulence (SST). SST is strongly affected by fine balances between forces and becomes more anisotropic in time for decaying cases. Moreover, there is a limited understanding of the physical phenomena described by some of the terms in the URANS equations. Rather than attempting to model each term separately, it is attractive to explore the capability of machine learning to model groups of terms, i.e., to directly model the force balances. We consider decaying SST which are homogeneous and stably stratified by a uniform density gradient, enabling dimensionality reduction. We consider two time-series ML models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE). Both models perform accurately and are numerically stable in a posteriori tests. Furthermore, we explore the data requirements of the ML models by extracting physically relevant timescales of the complex system. We find that the ratio of the timescales of the minimum information required by the ML models to accurately capture the dynamics of the SST corresponds to the Reynolds number of the flow. The current framework provides the backbone to explore the capability of such models to capture the dynamics of higher-dimensional complex SST flows.</description>

      <title>Crucial Role of Obliquely Propagating Gravity Waves in the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In climate modelling, the reality of simulated flows in the middle atmosphere is largely affected by the model's representation of gravity wave processes that are unresolved, while these processes are usually simplified to facilitate computations. The simplification commonly applied in existing climate models is to neglect wave propagation in horizontal direction and time. Here we use a model that fully represents the propagation of unresolved waves in all directions, thereby elucidating its dynamical effect upon the most important climate mode in the tropical stratosphere, namely the quasi-biennial oscillation. Our simulation shows that the waves at the equatorial stratosphere, which are known to drive this climate mode, can originate far away from the equator in the troposphere. The waves propagating obliquely toward the equator are found to play a huge role in the phase progression of the quasi-biennial oscillation as well as in its penetration into the lower stratosphere. Such waves will require further attention, given that current climate models are struggling to simulate the quasi-biennial oscillation down to the lower stratosphere, which may be needed to reproduce its observed impacts on the surface climate.</description>

      <title>Using Deep Learning to Identify Initial Error Sensitivity of ENSO Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a hybrid method that integrates deep learning with model-analog forecasting, a straightforward yet effective approach that generates forecasts from similar initial climate states in a repository of model simulations. This hybrid framework employs a convolutional neural network to estimate state-dependent weights to identify analog states. The advantage of our method lies in its physical interpretability, offering insights into initial-error-sensitive regions through estimated weights and the ability to trace the physically-based temporal evolution of the system through analog forecasting. We evaluate our approach using the Community Earth System Model Version 2 Large Ensemble to forecast the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on a seasonal-to-annual time scale. Results show a 10% improvement in forecasting sea surface temperature anomalies over the equatorial Pacific at 9-12 months leads compared to the traditional model-analog technique. Furthermore, our hybrid model demonstrates improvements in boreal winter and spring initialization when evaluated against a reanalysis dataset. Our deep learning-based approach reveals state-dependent sensitivity linked to various seasonally varying physical processes, including the Pacific Meridional Modes, equatorial recharge oscillator, and stochastic wind forcing. Notably, disparities emerge in the sensitivity associated with El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na events. We find that sea surface temperature over the tropical Pacific plays a more crucial role in El Ni\~no forecasting, while zonal wind stress over the same region exhibits greater significance in La Ni\~na prediction. This approach has broad implications for forecasting diverse climate phenomena, including regional temperature and precipitation, which are challenging for the traditional model-analog forecasting method.</description>

      <title>covXtreme : MATLAB software for non-stationary penalised piecewise constant marginal and conditional extreme value models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17295v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The covXtreme software provides functionality for estimation of marginal and conditional extreme value models, non-stationary with respect to covariates, and environmental design contours. Generalised Pareto (GP) marginal models of peaks over threshold are estimated, using a piecewise-constant representation for the variation of GP threshold and scale parameters on the (potentially multidimensional) covariate domain of interest. The conditional variation of one or more associated variates, given a large value of a single conditioning variate, is described using the conditional extremes model of Heffernan and Tawn (2004), the slope term of which is also assumed to vary in a piecewise constant manner with covariates. Optimal smoothness of marginal and conditional extreme value model parameters with respect to covariates is estimated using cross-validated roughness-penalised maximum likelihood estimation. Uncertainties in model parameter estimates due to marginal and conditional extreme value threshold choice, and sample size, are quantified using a bootstrap resampling scheme. Estimates of environmental contours using various schemes, including the direct sampling approach of Huseby et al. 2013, are calculated by simulation or numerical integration under fitted models. The software was developed in MATLAB for metocean applications, but is applicable generally to multivariate samples of peaks over threshold. The software and case study data can be downloaded from GitHub, with an accompanying user guide.</description>
