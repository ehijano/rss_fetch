      <title>Anderson localization: A disorder-induced quantum bound state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02353v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrons at the Fermi energy lose their ability to propagate to long distances in disordered media when undergoing the Anderson localization transition. We use Green functions in an analytically solvable model to describe the vanishing of diffusion at this transition. We find that the low-energy asymptotics of the electron-hole correlation function undergoes a crossover with a disorder-dependent time scale separating the two regimes. This scale determines how long the propagating particle remains captured within a finite volume. It is critical and diverges at the localization transition. According to our analysis, the diffusionless phase consists of quantum bound states that cannot be described in the space of Bloch waves and with the diffusion equation. We identify the necessary amendments to the existing approaches to reach a consistent microscopic picture of the emergence of Anderson localization.</description>

      <title>The effect of priors on Learning with Restricted Boltzmann Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) are generative models designed to learn from data with a rich underlying structure. In this work, we explore a teacher-student setting where a student RBM learns from examples generated by a teacher RBM, with a focus on the effect of the unit priors on learning efficiency. We consider a parametric class of priors that interpolate between continuous (Gaussian) and binary variables. This approach models various possible choices of visible units, hidden units, and weights for both the teacher and student RBMs.
  By analyzing the phase diagram of the posterior distribution in both the Bayes optimal and mismatched regimes, we demonstrate the existence of a triple point that defines the critical dataset size necessary for learning through generalization. The critical size is strongly influenced by the properties of the teacher, and thus the data, but is unaffected by the properties of the student RBM. Nevertheless, a prudent choice of student priors can facilitate training by expanding the so-called signal retrieval region, where the machine generalizes effectively.</description>

      <title>Contractive Unitary and Classical Shadow Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of quantum technology demands efficient characterization of complex quantum many-body states. However, full quantum state tomography requires an exponential number of measurements in system size, preventing its practical use in large-scale quantum devices. A major recent breakthrough in this direction, called classical shadow tomography, significantly reduces the sample complexity, the number of samples needed to estimate properties of a state, by implementing random Clifford rotations before measurements. Despite many recent efforts, reducing the sample complexity below $\mathbf{2^k}$ for extracting any non-successive local operators with a size $\sim \mathbf{k}$ remains a challenge. In this work, we achieve a significantly smaller sample complexity of $\mathbf{\sim 1.8^k}$ using a protocol that hybridizes locally random and globally deterministic unitary operations. The key insight is the discovery of a deterministic global unitary, termed as \textit{contractive unitary}, which is more efficient in reducing the operator size to enhance tomography efficiency. The contractive unitary perfectly matches the advantages of the atom array quantum computation platform and is readily realized in the atom array quantum processor. More importantly, it highlights a new strategy in classical shadow tomography, demonstrating that a random-deterministic hybridized protocol can be more efficient than fully random measurements.</description>

      <title>Generalized Loschmidt echo and information scrambling in open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum information scrambling, typically explored in closed quantum systems, describes the spread of initially localized information throughout a system and can be quantified by measures such as the Loschmidt echo (LE) and out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC). In this paper, we explore information scrambling in the presence of dissipation by generalizing the concepts of LE and OTOC to open quantum systems governed by Lindblad dynamics. We investigate the universal dynamics of the generalized LE across regimes of weak and strong dissipation. In the weak dissipation regime, we identify a universal structure, while in the strong dissipation regime, we observe a distinctive two-local-minima structure, which we interpret through an analysis of the Lindblad spectrum. Furthermore, we establish connections between the thermal averages of LE and OTOC and prove a general relation between OTOC and R\'enyi entropy in open systems. Finally, we propose an experimental protocol for measuring OTOC in open systems. These findings provide deeper insights into information scrambling under dissipation and pave the way for experimental studies in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Disordered topological crystalline phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The imposition of crystalline symmetries is known to lead to a rich variety of insulating and superconducting topological phases. These include higher-order topological phases and obstructed atomic limits with and without filling anomalies. We here comprehensively classify such topological crystalline phases (TCPs) with mirror, twofold rotation, and inversion symmetries in the presence of disorder that preserves the crystalline symmetry on average. We find that the inclusion of disorder leads to a simplification of the classification in comparison to the clean case. We also find that, while clean TCPs evade a general bulk-boundary principle, disordered TCPs admit a complete bulk-boundary correspondence, according to which (bulk) topological phases are topologically equivalent if and only if they have the same anomalous boundary states and filling anomaly. We corroborate the stability of disordered TCPs by way of field-theoretic, numerical and symmetry-based analyses in various case studies. While the boundary signatures of most disordered TCPs are similar to their clean counterparts, the addition of disorder to certain mirror-symmetric TCPs results in novel higher-order statistical topological phases, in which zero-energy hinge states have critical wavefunction statistics, while remaining protected from Anderson localization.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations and the limit of predictability in protein evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein evolution involves mutations occurring across a wide range of time scales [Di Bari et al., PNAS 121, e2406807121 (2024)]. In analogy with other disordered systems, this dynamical heterogeneity suggests strong correlations between mutations happening at distinct sites and times. To quantify these correlations, we examine the role of various fluctuation sources in protein evolution, simulated using a data-driven epistatic landscape. By applying spatio-temporal correlation functions inspired by statistical physics, we disentangle fluctuations originating from the ancestral protein sequence from those driven by stochastic mutations along independent evolutionary paths. Our analysis shows that, in diverse protein families, fluctuations from the ancestral sequence predominate at shorter time scales. This allows us to identify a time scale over which ancestral sequence information persists, enabling its reconstruction. We link this persistence to the strength of epistatic interactions: ancestral sequences with stronger epistatic signatures impact evolutionary trajectories over extended periods. At longer time scales, however, ancestral influence fades as epistatically constrained sites evolve collectively. To confirm this idea, we apply a standard ancestral sequence reconstruction algorithm and verify that the time-dependent recovery error is influenced by the properties of the ancestor itself.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Dirac spectrum from chiral symmetry restoration and the fate of $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I discuss chiral symmetry restoration in the chiral limit $m\to 0$ of QCD with two light quark flavours of mass $m$, focussing on its consequences for scalar and pseudoscalar susceptibilities, and on the resulting constraints on the Dirac spectrum. I show that $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ symmetry remains broken in the $\mathrm{SU}(2)_A$ symmetric phase if the spectral density $\rho(\lambda;m)$ develops a singular near-zero peak, tending to $O(m^4)/\lambda$ in the chiral limit. Moreover, $\mathrm{SU}(2)_A$ restoration requires that the number of modes in the peak be proportional to the topological susceptibility, indicating that such a peak must be of topological origin.</description>

      <title>Realizing interdependent couplings as thermal or higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.08907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interdependence is a fundamental ingredient to analyze the stability of many real-world complex systems featuring functional liasons. Yet, physical realizations of this coupling are still unknown, due to the lack of a theoretical framework for their study. To address this gap, we develop an interdependent magnetization framework and show that dependency links between $K-1$ pairwise networks of Ising spins can be rigorously mapped to directed $K$-spin interactions or to adaptive thermal couplings. We adopt the thermal portrait to determine analytically the phase diagram of the model under different structural configurations and we corroborate our results by extensive simulations. We find that interdependence acts like an entropic force that amplifies site-to-site thermal fluctuations, yielding unusual forms of vulnerability and making the system's functioning often unrecoverable. Finally, we discover an isomorphism between the ground state of random multi-spin models and interdependent percolation on randomly coupled networks. This connection raises new perspectives of cross-fertilization, providing unfamiliar methods with relevant implications in the study of constraint satisfaction as well as to the functional robustness of interdependent systems.</description>

      <title>Ward identities and local potential approximation for large time quantum (2+p)-spin glass dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to study the functional renormalization group for quantum $(2+p)$-spin dynamics of a $N$-vector $\textbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^N$. By fixing the gauge symmetry in the construction of the FRG, that breaks the $O(N)$-symmetry and deriving the corresponding non-trivial Ward identity we can: In the first time coarse grain and focus on this study using a more attractive method such as the effective vertex expansion, and in the second time explore this model beyond the symmetry phase. We show finite scale singularities due to the disorder, interpreted as the signal in the perturbation theory. The unconventional renormalization group approach is based on coarse-graining over the eigenvalues of matrix-like disorder, viewed as an effective kinetic term, with an eigenvalue distribution following a deterministic law in the large $N$ limit. As an illustration, the case where $p=3$ is scrutinized.</description>

      <title>Absolutely stable time crystals at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.00585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that locally-interacting, periodically-driven (Floquet) Hamiltonian dynamics coupled to a Langevin bath support finite-temperature discrete time crystals (DTC) with an infinite auto-correlation time. By contrast to both prethermal and many-body localized DTCs, the time crystalline order we uncover is stable to arbitrary perturbations, including those that break the time translation symmetry of the underlying drive. Our approach utilizes a general mapping from probabilistic cellular automata (PCA) to open classical Floquet systems undergoing continuous-time Langevin dynamics. Applying this mapping to a variant of the Toom cellular automata, which we dub the ''$\pi$-Toom time crystal'', leads to a 2D Floquet Hamiltonian with a finite-temperature DTC phase transition. We provide numerical evidence for the existence of this transition, and analyze the statistics of the finite temperature fluctuations. Finally, we discuss how general results from the field of probabilistic cellular automata imply the existence of discrete time crystals (with an infinite auto-correlation time) in all dimensions, $d \geq 1$.</description>
