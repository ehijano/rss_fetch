      <title>Performance Evaluation of a Fan-Array Wind Tunnel for Advanced Aerodynamic Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wind tunnel's consisting an array of computer controlled/programmable fans have evolved over the last three decades for simulating the atmospheric turbulence to study the aerodynamic loads over bluff bodies such as buildings and bridges. In addition to civil engineering structures, these wind tunnels can also have applications extending towards free-flight aerodynamic tests on drones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Achieving velocity profiles such as linearly sheared flows or boundary layer flows in a traditional wind tunnel would require long fetch lengths for the flow to evolve. However, in this work, with the aid of an array of computer-controlled fans, a perfectly linearly sheared flow can be developed at a distance of 1 meter from the source. Unlike the previous fan-array wind tunnels (FAWT) developed for atmospheric boundary layer flows, the fan-array tunnel constructed in this work does not include a contraction section or a honeycomb, offering portability and compactness for performing unconfined flight tests. The current work involves the design and development of a 10 x 10 two-dimensional array of multiple fans facing a 2.4 m long, enclosed test section with a 1.44 $m^2$ cross-sectional area. A comprehensive characterization of key flow parameters, including turbulence intensity, mean velocity, and pressure, in the streamwise, spanwise, and transverse directions of the test section is investigated in the developed FAWT. These measurements were conducted under three distinct flow conditions, namely uniform, linearly sheared, and parabolic. Additionally, this work also presents the evolution of the turbulent length scales and time scales across various sections inside the tunnel for a range of wind speeds by employing autocorrelation techniques and power spectral analysis.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale particle-based simulations of flow in expansion-contraction microchannels at low Reynolds number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We computationally study the flow of Newtonian fluids through sinusoidal expansion-contraction microchannels at low Reynolds number. We first use a perturbation method to analytically derive series solutions for the stream function and volumetric flow rate that extend prior work [P.K. Kitanidis and B.B. Dykaar, Transport in Porous Media 26, 89-98 (1997)] up to tenth order. We then employ two particle-based mesoscale methods, dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) and multiparticle collision dynamics (MPCD), to simulate the same flows. We find that the fluid velocity at the expansion and contraction points as well as the volumetric flow rate are in good agreement between DPD, MPCD, and the fourth-order series solution for a wide range of microchannel geometries. The mesoscale fluid models exhibit some slip at the walls, leading to a small but consistent overprediction of the velocity and volumetric flow rate. The series solution fails for short microchannel lengths and large amplitudes; we identify lengths and amplitudes for which it converges to a given order. Overall, we find that DPD and MPCD are convenient and reasonably accurate methods, particularly for microchannel geometries where the series solution fails or is cumbersome to implement.</description>

      <title>Coherent motions to predict Lagrangian trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of Lagrangian trajectories in turbulent flow remains challenging due to limited temporal information in transport functions. This paper shows that even with sparse temporal observations, there might be enough information from surrounding coherent motions, sharing the same dynamics, to provide highly probable trajectories. The proposed coherent predictor is derived from the concept of Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs), which are advective transport barriers that govern the cohesive motion of neighbouring particles. Coherent trajectories are quantified using a local segmentation with the finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLE). The coherent predictor incorporates information from the particle's position history and neighbouring coherent velocity and acceleration into a novel generic energy function to predict its trajectory. We assess our proposed approach using both three-dimensional (3D) synthetic and experimental data of the wake behind a smooth cylinder and two-dimensional (2D) homogeneous isotropic turbulent (HIT) flow. The coherent predictor is deemed generic due to its consistent behaviour regardless of flow dimensions, Reynolds number, and flow topology. Our results demonstrate that the optimal parameters of the proposed energy function can be modelled based on measurement uncertainties, resulting in enhanced prediction accuracy and reduced uncertainty compared to current methods. We reveal direct signatures of flow topology, including the cylinder leading edge boundary layer, sideward shear layers, and vortex formation structures, on the prediction error map. These topologies, which are fundamental structures in fluid dynamics, are marked by high Lagrangian gradients and 3D directional motions. These findings on coherent predictions hold great potential for various Lagrangian analyses in turbulence.</description>

      <title>Tidally dominated flows past a three-dimensional topography: Wake vortices, turbulence, and mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oceanic turbulence influences the transport and mixing of freshwater, heat, nutrients, and other biogeochemical tracers. It also has broader implications for oceanic and atmospheric circulations. Tides contribute substantially to the mechanically driven turbulent ocean mixing through the internal waves resulting from tide-topography interactions. Tidal currents also drive turbulent wakes and shear layers when the topography is 3D. The hypothesis that seamounts are the ``stirring rods'' of the ocean has motivated considerable recent interest in turbulent flow features near 3D topography. It also motivates the present LES of tidally dominated flows (tidal oscillations superposed on a weaker mean) past an idealized steep seamount. Complex interactions occur between the topography, the near wake, and previously shed vortices, especially during the tidal phases when the flow direction is reversed. The topographic wake is shown to be a hotspot for mixing, featuring large dissipation rates in the attached shear layers, hydraulic jet, recirculation region in the near wake, and peripheries of shed vortices. The majority of the observed dissipation is due to the vertical shear. Over a tidal cycle, the volume-integrated local dissipation within the wake is at least four times greater than the internal wave flux that may be dissipated elsewhere. Furthermore, normalized dissipation rates are maximized for the purely tidal setting. Within the tidal cycle, bulk mixing efficiency ($\eta$) varies substantially and is maximized at $\eta \approx 0.25$ around flow reversals.</description>

      <title>Flow transition of liquid-liquid two-phase Taylor-Couette flow with axial flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A liquid-liquid two-phase Taylor-Couette flow is of fundamental and practical importance in multiphase flow systems. This study investigates the flow transitions in such a system with constant axial flow and gradually increased rotation of the inner cylinder. To clarify the effect of continuous-phase viscosity on flow transitions, several concentrations of glycerol-water solutions were employed as the continuous phase, while soybean oil was used as the dispersed phase. Visualization experiments revealed that the flow undergoes a cascade of transitions: stratified flow, disturbed stratified flow, transitional droplet flow (observed only in limited cases), unstable banded flow, and stable banded flow. A flow map was constructed using two dimensionless parameters, Reynolds number (Re) and Weber number (We). The transitions from disturbed stratified to unstable banded flow (TR I) and from unstable to stable banded flow (TR II) were found to be approximately expressed by a power-law relation of the form We ~ Re^A, where A is a fitting exponent. For TR I, A showed no clear dependence on continuous-phase viscosity, suggesting the combined effects of inertia, viscosity, and interfacial tension. In contrast, A decreased with increasing viscosity in TR II, becoming nearly zero at high glycerol concentration. Furthermore, to clarify the mechanism of stable banded flow formation, the droplet inertia was evaluated using the Stokes number (St). It was revealed that the stable banded structure results from the loss of droplet inertia, associated with droplet micronization under higher rotation and the increasing inertia of the continuous phase.</description>

      <title>Quantifying non-equilibrium pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layers through a symmetry-based framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study establishes a symmetry-based framework to quantify non-equilibrium processes in complex pressure gradient (PG) turbulent boundary layers (TBLs), using a Lie-group-informed dilation-symmetry-breaking formalism. We derive a universal multilayer defect scaling law for the evolution of total shear stress (TSS). The law shows that gradually varying adverse pressure gradients (APGs) break the dilation symmetry in the two-layer defect scaling of equilibrium TSS, leading to three-layer TSS structures. For abrupt PG transitions, we identify boundary-layer decoupling into: 1) an equilibrium internal boundary layer, and 2) a history-dependent outer flow, arising from disparate adaptation timescales. The framework introduces a unified velocity scale mapping non-equilibrium TSS to canonical zero-PG scaling. Validation spans different aerodynamic systems, including developing APG on airfoils, APG-to-favorable-PG transition on a Gaussian bump, and favorable PG to rapidly amplifying APG in a converging-diverging channel. The work enables improved prediction of non-equilibrium PG TBL behavior through unified characterization of stress evolution dynamics, providing new physics-based parameterizations that could promote machine learning of complex wall-bounded turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Long-wave instability of stratified two-phase MHD flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long wave instability of a stratified two-phase MHD parallel flow between two infinite plates is studied. It is argued that electric conductivity of the plates affects qualitatively the base flow and its stability properties, which calls for separate stability studies for the cases of perfectly insulating, perfectly conducting boundaries, or boundaries with finite conductivity. In this study we examine the effect of the transverse magnetic field on long wave instability of a two-layer flow consisting of layers of conductive liquid and non-conductive gas, for the cases of perfectly insulating or perfectly conducting lower boundary, considering a mercury-air system as a representative test case. To capture the behavior at small but finite wavenumbers, we extend the conventional first-order long-wave stability analysis by incorporating higher order terms. The results and discussion address the characteristics of the base flow, stability maps and profiles of the most unstable disturbances. The stability diagrams show that among the anticipated stabilizing effect of the magnetic field, at certain parameters a destabilization is observed. It is further argued that in spite the flow of mercury is strongly damped by the magnetic field, interaction of the two fluids at the interface becomes the strongest destabilizing effect, which, together with the shear-induced instabilities in the gas layer, may lead to flow destabilization with the increasing magnetic field.</description>

      <title>The Moffatt-Pukhnachev flow: a new twist on an old problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flow of a thin viscous film on the outside of a horizontal circular cylinder, whose angular velocity is time-periodic with specified frequency and amplitude, is investigated. The constant angular velocity problem was originally studied by Moffatt (1977) and Pukhnachev (1977). Surface tension is neglected. The evolution equation for the film thickness is solved numerically for a range of oscillation amplitudes and frequency. A blow-up map charted in amplitude-frequency space reveals highly intricate fractal-like structures exhibiting self-similarity. For a general initial condition the film surface reaches a slope singularity at a finite time and tends to overturn. The high-frequency and low-frequency limits are examined asymptotically using a multiple-scales approach. At high frequency the analysis suggests that an appropriate choice of initial profile can substantially delay the overturning time, and even yield a time-periodic solution. In the low-frequency limit it is possible to construct a quasi-periodic solution that does not overturn if the oscillation amplitude lies below a threshold value. Above this value the solution tends inexorably toward blow-up. It is shown how solutions exhibiting either a single-shock or a double-shock may be constructed in common with the steadily rotating cylinder problem.</description>

      <title>A Central Differential Flux with High-Order Dissipation for Robust Simulations of Transcritical Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of transcritical flows remains challenging due to strong thermodynamic nonlinearities that induce spurious pressure oscillations in conventional schemes.While primitive-variable formulations offer improved robustness under such conditions, they are always limited by energy conservation errors and the absence of systematic high-order treatments for numerical fluxes. In this paper, we introduce the Central Differential flux with High-Order Dissipation (CDHD), a novel numerical flux solver designed for primitive-variable discretization. This method combines a central flux for advection with a minimal, upwind-biased dissipation term to stabilize the simulation while maintaining formal accuracy. The dissipation term effectively suppresses oscillations and improves stability in transcritical flows. Compared to traditional primitive-variable approaches, CDHD reduces the energy conservation error in two order of magnitude. When incorporated into a hybrid framework with a conservative shock-capturing scheme, the method robustly handles both smooth transcritical phenomena and shock waves. Numerical tests validate the accuracy, stability, and energy-preserving capabilities of CDHD, demonstrating its potential as a reliable tool for complex real-gas flow simulations.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Real-Time Forecasting Framework for Cryogenic Fluid Management in Space Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate real-time forecasting of cryogenic tank behavior is essential for the safe and efficient operation of propulsion and storage systems in future deep-space missions. While cryogenic fluid management (CFM) systems increasingly require autonomous capabilities, conventional simulation methods remain hindered by high computational cost, model imperfections, and sensitivity to unanticipated boundary condition changes. To address these limitations, this study proposes an Adaptive Real-Time Forecasting Framework for Cryogenic Propellant Management in Space Systems, featuring a lightweight, non-intrusive method named ARCTIC (Adaptive Real-time Cryogenic Tank Inference and Correction). ARCTIC integrates real-time sensor data with precomputed nodal simulations through a data-driven correction layer that dynamically refines forecast accuracy without modifying the underlying model. Two updating mechanisms, auto-calibration and observation and correction, enable continuous adaptation to evolving system states and transient disturbances. The method is first assessed through synthetic scenarios representing self-pressurization, sloshing, and periodic operations, then validated using experimental data from NASA's Multipurpose Hydrogen Test Bed and K-Site facilities. Results demonstrate that ARCTIC significantly improves forecast accuracy under model imperfections, data noise, and boundary fluctuations, offering a robust real-time forecasting capability to support autonomous CFM operations. The framework's compatibility with existing simulation tools and its low computational overhead make it especially suited for onboard implementation in space systems requiring predictive autonomy.</description>

      <title>A Mixture of Experts Gating Network for Enhanced Surrogate Modeling in External Aerodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computational cost associated with high-fidelity CFD simulations remains a significant bottleneck in the automotive design and optimization cycle. While ML-based surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerate aerodynamic predictions, the field is characterized by a diverse and rapidly evolving landscape of specialized neural network architectures, with no single model demonstrating universal superiority. This paper introduces a novel meta-learning framework that leverages this architectural diversity as a strength. We propose a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that employs a dedicated gating network to dynamically and optimally combine the predictions from three heterogeneous, state-of-the-art surrogate models: DoMINO, a decomposable multi-scale neural operator; X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable multi-scale graph neural network; and FigConvNet, a factorized implicit global convolution network. The gating network learns a spatially-variant weighting strategy, assigning credibility to each expert based on its localized performance in predicting surface pressure and wall shear stress fields. To prevent model collapse and encourage balanced expert contributions, we integrate an entropy regularization term into the training loss function. The entire system is trained and validated on the DrivAerML dataset, a large-scale, public benchmark of high-fidelity CFD simulations for automotive aerodynamics. Quantitative results demonstrate that the MoE model achieves a significant reduction in L-2 prediction error, outperforming not only the ensemble average but also the most accurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities. This work establishes the MoE framework as a powerful and effective strategy for creating more robust and accurate composite surrogate models by synergistically combining the complementary strengths of specialized architectures.</description>

      <title>Machine-precision energy conservative quadrature hyperreduction of Lagrangian hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an energy conservative, quadrature based model reduction framework for the compressible Euler equations of Lagrangian hydrodynamics. Building on a high order finite element discretization of the governing equations, we develop a projection based reduced model using data driven reduced basis functions and hyperreduction via the empirical quadrature procedure (EQP). We introduce a strongly energy conservative variant of EQP that enforces exact discrete total energy conservation during the hyperreduction process. Numerical experiments for four benchmark problems -- Sedov blast, Gresho vortex, triple point and Taylor-Green vortex -- demonstrate that the numerical implementation of our proposed method conserves total energy to near machine precision while maintaining accuracy comparable to the basic EQP formulation. These results establish the energy conservative EQP (CEQP) method as an effective structure preserving hyperreduction strategy for the reduced simulation of nonlinear Lagrangian hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Reconnection and it's Dynamical Role in 2D Magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor instability (MRTI) governs material transport and mixing in astrophysical and laboratory plasmas under the influence of gravity and magnetic fields. While magnetic reconnection is known to occur during MRTI evolution, its role in the evolution and energy dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the role of reconnection in the two-dimensional MRTI dynamics, using high-resolution simulations. We establish that reconnection, through facilitating plume merger, relieving magnetic tension, and enabling continued instability growth, forms an essential component for the long-term instability evolution. To quantify the role of reconnection in energy dynamics, we develop a robust automated reconnection detection algorithm and perform a statistical analysis across a range of magnetic field strengths. We find that reconnection accounts for up to $80\%$ of the magnetic-to-kinetic energy transfer in the weak magnetic field regime, while contributing minimally ($\approx 3\%$) to magnetic energy dissipation. Our results establish magnetic reconnection as a critical mechanism that regulates large-scale MRTI dynamics, with implications for astrophysical plasmas and turbulent mixing in magnetized flows.</description>

Abstract: We derive a fourth order entropy stable extension of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations into the transition regime of rarefied gases. We do this through a novel reformulation of the closure of conservation equations derived from the Boltzmann equation that subsumes existing methods such as the Chapman-Enskog expansion. We apply the linearized version of this extension to the stationary heat problem and the Poiseuille channel and compare our analytical solutions to asymptotic and numerical solutions of the linearized Boltzmann equation. In both model problems, our solutions compare remarkably well in the transition regime. For some macroscopic variables, this agreement even extends far beyond the transition regime.</description>

      <title>Control of Rayleigh-B\'enard Convection: Effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning in the Turbulent Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12000</link>

Abstract: Data-driven flow control has significant potential for industry, energy systems, and climate science. In this work, we study the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for reducing convective heat transfer in the 2D Rayleigh-B\'enard Convection (RBC) system under increasing turbulence. We investigate the generalizability of control across varying initial conditions and turbulence levels and introduce a reward shaping technique to accelerate the training. RL agents trained via single-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are compared to linear proportional derivative (PD) controllers from classical control theory. The RL agents reduced convection, measured by the Nusselt Number, by up to 33% in moderately turbulent systems and 10% in highly turbulent settings, clearly outperforming PD control in all settings. The agents showed strong generalization performance across different initial conditions and to a significant extent, generalized to higher degrees of turbulence. The reward shaping improved sample efficiency and consistently stabilized the Nusselt Number to higher turbulence levels.</description>

      <title>Simulating many-engine spacecraft: Exceeding 1 quadrillion degrees of freedom via information geometric regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07392v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an optimized implementation of the recently proposed information geometric regularization (IGR) for unprecedented scale simulation of compressible fluid flows applied to multi-engine spacecraft boosters. We improve upon state-of-the-art computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques along computational cost, memory footprint, and energy-to-solution metrics. Unified memory on coupled CPU--GPU or APU platforms increases problem size with negligible overhead. Mixed half/single-precision storage and computation on well-conditioned numerics is used. We simulate flow at 200 trillion grid points and 1 quadrillion degrees of freedom, exceeding the current record by a factor of 20. A factor of 4 wall-time speedup is achieved over optimized baselines. Ideal weak scaling is seen on OLCF Frontier, LLNL El Capitan, and CSCS Alps using the full systems. Strong scaling is near ideal at extreme conditions, including 80% efficiency on CSCS Alps with an 8-node baseline and stretching to the full system.</description>

      <title>Thermal quasi-geostrophic model on the sphere: derivation and structure-preserving simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the global model of thermal quasi-geostrophy on the sphere via asymptotic expansion of the thermal rotating shallow water equations. The model does not rely on the asymptotic expansion of the Coriolis force and extends the quasi-geostrophic model on the sphere by including an additional transported buoyancy field acting as a source term for the potential vorticity. We give its Hamiltonian description in terms of semidirect product Lie--Poisson brackets. The Hamiltonian formulation reveals the existence of an infinite number of conservation laws, Casimirs, parameterized by two arbitrary smooth functions. A structure-preserving discretization is provided based on Zeitlin's self-consistent matrix approximation for hydrodynamics. A Casimir-preserving time integrator is employed to numerically fully preserve the resulting finite-dimensional Lie--Poisson structure. Simulations reveal the formation of vorticity and buoyancy fronts, and large-scale structures in the buoyancy dynamics induced by the buoyancy-bathymetry interaction.</description>

      <title>Microrheology with rotational Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14047v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Passive rotational microrheology (RMR) for evaluating the dynamic modulus \(G^*\) of a suspending fluid through the rotational Brownian motion of a spherical probe particle is validated using direct numerical simulations (DNS) of Brownian motion in a viscoelastic fluid. Two methods of RMR are compared: an inertialess RMR based on the Generalized Stokes--Einstein relation for rotational diffusion (RGSER) and the full RMR based on the generalized Langevin equation for rotation, which accounts for fluid and particle inertia. Our analysis, performed using DNS of the fluctuating Oldroyd-B fluid, reveals that inertialess RMR accurately estimates \(G^*\) for \(\omega\lambda \alt 1\), but deviates significantly at high frequencies. In contrast, the full RMR improves \(G^*\) estimation accuracy up to the frequency \(\omega \approx \tau_{s}^{-1}=\eta_{s}/\rho_{f}a^{2}\), where fluid inertia becomes relevant. However, in the ballistic regime (\(t \ll \tau_{s}\)), particle inertia dominates, making accurate \(G^*\) evaluation challenging even with the full RMR. This study clarifies the applicability range of RMR. Additionally, rotational Brownian motion is turned out to be insensitive to periodic boundary conditions, which allows direct application to various mesoscale molecular simulations, including coarse-grained molecular dynamics, dissipative particle dynamics, and fluid dynamics simulations. In conclusion, rotational microrheology offers a promising approach for detailed rheological analysis in complex systems and conditions.</description>
