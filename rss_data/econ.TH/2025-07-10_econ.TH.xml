      <title>No Midcost Democracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Which level of voting costs is optimal in a democracy? This paper argues that intermediate voting costs - what we term a "Midcost democracy" - should be avoided, as they fail to ensure that electoral outcomes reflect the preferences of the majority. We study a standard binary majority decision in which a majority of the electorate prefers alternative A over alternative B. The population consists of partisan voters, who always participate, and non-partisan voters, who vote only when they believe their participation could be pivotal, given that voting entails a cost. We show that the probability of the majority-preferred alternative A winning is non-monotonic in the level of voting costs. Specifically, when voting costs are either high or negligible, alternative A wins in all equilibria. However, at intermediate cost levels, this alignment breaks down. These findings suggest that democratic systems should avoid institutional arrangements that lead to moderate voting costs, as they may undermine the majority principle.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Stability in Many-to-One Matching with Non-Responsive Couples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study many-to-one matching problems between institutions and individuals, where each institution may be matched to multiple individuals. The matching market includes couples, who view pairs of institutions as complementary. Institutions' preferences over sets of individuals are assumed to satisfy responsiveness, whereas couples' preferences over pairs of institutions may violate responsiveness.
  In this setting, we first assume that all institutions share a common preference ordering over individuals, and we establish: (i) a complete characterization of all couples' preference profiles for which a stable matching exists, under the additional assumption that couples violate responsiveness only to ensure co-location at the same institution, and (ii) a necessary and sufficient condition on the common institutional preference such that a stable matching exists when couples may violate responsiveness arbitrarily.
  Next, we relax the common preference assumption, requiring institutions to share a common ranking only over the members of each couple. Under this weaker assumption, we provide: (i) a complete characterization of all couples' preferences for which a stable matching exists, and (ii) a sufficient condition on individuals' preferences that guarantees the existence of a stable matching.</description>

      <title>Stability in Many-to-One Matching with Couples having Responsive Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies matching markets where institutions are matched with possibly more than one individual. The matching market contains some couples who view the pair of jobs as complements. First, we show by means of an example that a stable matching may fail to exist even when both couples and institutions have responsive preferences. Next, we provide conditions on couples' preferences that are necessary and sufficient to ensure a stable matching for every preference profile where institutions may have any responsive preference. Finally, we do the same with respect to institutions' preferences, that is, we provide conditions on institutions' preferences that are necessary and sufficient to ensure a stable matching for every preference profile where couples may have any responsive preference.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Predictability of Performative, Social Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social predictions do not passively describe the future; they actively shape it. They inform actions and change individual expectations in ways that influence the likelihood of the predicted outcome. Given these dynamics, to what extent can social events be predicted? This question was discussed throughout the 20th century by authors like Merton, Morgenstern, Simon, and others who considered it a central issue in social science methodology. In this work, we provide a modern answer to this old problem. Using recent ideas from performative prediction and outcome indistinguishability, we establish that one can always efficiently predict social events accurately, regardless of how predictions influence data. While achievable, we also show that these predictions are often undesirable, highlighting the limitations of previous desiderata. We end with a discussion of various avenues forward.</description>

      <title>On the hidden costs of passive investing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Passive investing has gained immense popularity due to its low fees and the perceived simplicity of focusing on zero tracking error, rather than security selection. However, our analysis shows that the passive (zero tracking error) approach of waiting until the market close on the day of index reconstitution to purchase a stock (that was announced days earlier as an upcoming addition) results in costs amounting to hundreds of basis points compared to strategies that involve gradually acquiring a small portion of the required shares in advance with minimal additional tracking errors. In addition, we show that under all scenarios analyzed, a trader who builds a small inventory post-announcement and provides liquidity at the reconstitution event can consistently earn several hundreds of basis points in profit and often much more, assuming minimal risk.</description>

Abstract: We prove that any optimal, independent, and zero unanimous fuzzy classification aggregation function of a continuum of individual classifications of $m\ge 3$ objects into $2\le p\le m$ types must be a weighted arithmetic mean.</description>
