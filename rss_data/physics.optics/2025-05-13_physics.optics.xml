      <title>Maximal Electromagnetic Coupling Between Arbitrary-Shaped Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of electromagnetic waves with pairs of nanotubes having arbitrary-shaped cross sections is investigated. The study starts by thoroughly examining nanotube couples with circular boundaries to identify the structural, textural and excitation parameters that enhance the electric field concentration. Such an initial step generates a design space across which the regions of interest are determined to formulate a shape optimization problem targeting at the maximization of the signal internally to the nanotubes by modifying their boundary surface while maintaining the values for the remaining operational parameters. An IsoGeometric-Analysis-based Boundary Element Method (IGABEM) is employed for estimating the electric field around nanotube boundaries, which is subsequently used towards the overall solution of the boundary value problem. A combination of global and local optimizers along with geometric parametric models that generate valid nanotube cross sections complement the IGABEM method in the quest of optimal designs. The achieved optimal shapes attain substantial boost in the concentration of the electric field which can easily exceed, by 30 times or more, the corresponding value obtained by circular nanotube pairs. This superior performance is maintained for a large range of wave angles and nanotube areas and, accordingly, the robustness of the obtained results and their potential applicability in a wide range of applications, is demonstrated. Finally, the computational method developed in this work can be easily extended for analyzing a finite array of nanotubes, while insights gained by the reported optimal shapes pave the way for their optimization and fine tuning in collective setups like electromagnetic gratings and photonic metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Optical microcavity characterization via resonance spectra and modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes how resonance spectra and mode profiles can be used to characterize and quantify the mode-shaping effects in open-access plano-concave optical microcavities.The presented semi-analytic theory is based on the application of perturbation theory to the roundtrip evolution of the optical field. It includes various nonparaxial effects that become prominently visible in microcavities with small radii of curvature. It extends the theory presented by van Exter et al. (2022, Phys. Rev. A 106, 013501) and verified Koks et al. (2022, Phys. Rev. A 105, 063502) to the common Gaussian mirror shape with finite mirror depth and shows how the associated spherical aberration modifies the transverse-mode splitting and the fine structure in the resonance spectrum. The presented measurements demonstrate how the different mode-shaping effects can be individually distinguished and quantified. Spin-orbit coupling, which is one of the nonparaxial effects, is prominently visible in the intriguing polarization patterns of the resonant modes. Polarization tomography yields the shape-induced birefringence and the associated polarization splitting of the fundamental modes.</description>

      <title>Ultrastrong Light-Matter Coupling in Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrastrong light-matter coupling has traditionally been studied in optical cavities, where it occurs when the light-matter coupling strength reaches a significant fraction of the transition frequency. This regime fundamentally alters the ground and excited states of the particle-cavity system, unlocking new ways to control its physics and chemistry. However, achieving ultrastrong coupling in engineered cavities remains a major challenge. Here, we show that ultra- and deep-strong coupling naturally occur in bulk materials without the need for external cavities. By analyzing experimental data from over 70 materials, we demonstrate that phonon-, exciton-, and plasmon-polaritons in many solids exhibit ultrastrong coupling, systematically surpassing the coupling strengths achieved in cavity-based systems. To explain this phenomenon, we introduce a dipole lattice model based on a generalized Hopfield Hamiltonian, which unifies photon-matter, matter-matter, and photon-photon interactions. The complete overlap between the photonic and collective dipole modes in the lattice enables ultrastrong coupling, leading to excited-state mixing, radiative decay suppression, and potential phase transitions into collective ground states. Applying our model to real materials, we show that it reproduces light-matter coupling across broad material classes and may underlie structural phase transitions that give rise to emergent phenomena such as ferroelectricity, insulator-to-metal transitions, and exciton condensation. Recognizing ultrastrong coupling as an intrinsic property of solids reshapes our understanding of light-matter interactions and opens new avenues for exploring quantum materials and exotic phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Propagation Dynamics of Photonic Toroidal Vortices Mediated by Orbital Angular Momenta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of vortex rings in fluids have long captivated researchers due to the intriguing complexity of their behavior, despite the apparent simplicity of their structure. In optics, photonic toroidal vortices constitute a novel class of three-dimensional, space-time nonseparable structured light fields that carry transverse orbital angular momentum. However, as solutions to the dispersive form of Maxwell's equations, these wavepackets do not survive upon nondispersive propagation, and their dynamics remain elusive. In this article, the dynamics of photonic toroidal vortices under various dispersion regimes, mediated by both transverse and longitudinal orbital angular momentum, are investigated through simulations and experiments. The results reveal that the motion of a toroidal vortex is strongly affected by the presence of longitudinal orbital angular momentum. The swirling flow destabilizes the toroidal structure under dispersion conditions and induces topological transformations in the vortex line characterized by its annihilation and subsequent reformation in vacuum. Remarkably, the renascent toroidal vortex exhibits robust propagation in vacuum while maintaining its toroidal structure. These findings are supported by experimental validation and highlight the potential of photonic toroidal vortices as controllable channels for directional energy and information transfer.</description>

      <title>Effectively nonlinear magneto-optical detection under strong laser fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a strong-field detection method for magnetic materials, based on the characterization of crystal time-reversal symmetry through the elliptical dichroism of harmonics. The consistency of the low-order harmonics driven by laser fields with opposite helicities originates from the time-reversal symmetry of crystals, and thus the appearance of harmonic elliptical dichroism can serve as evidence for the breaking of crystal time-reversal symmetry. We have used the semiconductor Bloch equation to calculate the harmonic spectra of the bilayer ferromagnetic material Cr2Ge2Te6, with and without spin-orbit coupling. In magnetic materials, strong spin-orbit coupling causes the loss of time-reversal symmetry in the phase of polarization currents between different spin states, inducing elliptical dichroism in the harmonics. Here we extend the magneto-optical Faraday or Kerr effect to the nonlinear domain using strong laser fields, improving the sensitivity and applicability of magneto-optical detection methods.</description>

      <title>Realization of tunable spectral shift and linewidth reduction of Fano resonances at a dielectric metasurface due to near-field interactions among multipole moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fano resonance is a well-known phenomenon in fields like atomic physics and grating optics, and it has recently started to gain interest in artificially engineered dielectric, metallic or composite metasurfaces, and metamaterials, to name a few. This work elucidates the role of the induced multipole moments within a dielectric metasurface that leads to the interference, and the resulting scattering response in the far-field emerges into Fano resonance. Here, we report the details of the interference between fields generated by induced multipole moments and their effect on the scattered response when a maneuvered change in the excitation source is applied from the far-field plane wave excitation to a dipole emitter interacting in the near-field of the metasurface. This change in excitation leads to observed effects like resonance red-shift and linewidth narrowing for the out-coupled scattering. Starting from Maxwell's equations, we follow Feshbach formalism for electromagnetic scattering applied to the all-dielectric nanostructure used in this work, which leads us to satisfactory qualitative explanations along with the relevant results obtained from numerical calculations to support the observations we made experimentally. This work could help to explain and explore possibilities to observe asymmetric resonances in metasurfaces for various excitation conditions, and the key results of resonance shift and linewidth narrowing could be significant for precision applications and fundamental optical studies.</description>

      <title>Non-monotonic temperature dependence of light-matter interaction in hyperbolic metamaterial due to interplay of electron-phonon scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperbolic metamaterials (HMM) are artificially engineered materials that are congenial for light-matter interaction studies and nanophotonic applications with the hyperbolic dispersion of light propagating through them, which offers a large photonic density of states. We have explored HMM's broadband cavity-like modes and ultrasmall mode volumes, even though the system has lossy plasmonic constituents. The light-matter interaction properties of plasmonic materials strongly depend on different internal damping mechanisms. Temperature is a macroscopic parameter that controls these internal mechanisms and is reflected in their corresponding interaction behaviors. In this work, we investigated the light-matter interaction properties of the HMM system with temperature. We studied the HMM system weakly coupled to quantum emitters. This weakly coupled system shows a non-monotonicity in its broadband absorption and the emission from near-field coupling with quantum emitters. This is determined by the interplay between the electron-phonon and the phonon-phonon scatterings occurring in the metal nanowire array, effectively providing the damping with temperature. Theoretically, we confirmed the increased presence of the phonon-phonon scattering in nanowires compared to bulk metals, which plays an instrumental role in the observed light-matter interaction effects. This study could efficiently predict the use of the HMM in optics and photonics applications, with precise tuning and availability of control parameters with temperature. Also, this study could help identify the effect of increased phonon-phonon scattering in nanostructures and explore the possibility of quantifying and applying it by optical measurements.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Bound States in the Continuum in Bilayer Structures against Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the robustness of bound states in the continuum (BICs) in a bilayer dielectric rod array against geometric and material perturbations. Our analysis focuses on both symmetry-protected and Fabry-P\'erot BICs, examining their transformation into quasi-BICs under three structural modifications: (i) in-plane displacement of one layer, which breaks the $C_2$ symmetry of the system; (ii) introduction of material losses that break time-reversal symmetry; and (iii) variation in the interlayer distance, which preserves structural symmetry. In particular, we demonstrate that material losses inevitably induce radiation in Fabry-P\'erot BICs via second-order perturbation processes, converting them into quasi-BICs, while symmetry-protected BICs remain non-radiative. We further show that, despite the inherent instability of BICs under symmetry-breaking effects, their resilience can be significantly enhanced through proper design. Both Fabry-P\'erot and symmetry-protected BICs exhibit exponentially weak sensitivity to $C_2$-breaking perturbations as the interlayer distance increases. Our findings pave the way for the development of BIC-based photonic devices with improved robustness against fabrication imperfections, environmental variations, and material losses.</description>

      <title>Optical Skyrmions in Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical skyrmions are topologically non-trivial polarization fields which have recently attracted attention due to their potential use in high density data applications such as optical communications, photonic computing and more. An important hurdle in utilizing optical skyrmions for such applications is establishing conditions under which their topological structure remains preserved during propagation: while results of this type already exist for paraxial beams in free-space propagation, the critical case relevant to modern applications involves propagation in confined media, such as waveguide systems. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time that, within a conducting waveguide, the preservation of the skyrmion number during propagation is determined by the presence of so-called topologically stabilizing modes. If such a mode is present, not only will topological protection hold despite the transverse polarization profile changing due to modal dispersion, but there is also a degree of robustness to variations in the coefficients of TE and TM modes present. Lastly, we demonstrate how a generalized skyrmion number can recover topological protection in situations where the usual skyrmion number is not preserved. Our methods open new avenues for robust high-dimensional information manipulation in waveguiding systems.</description>

      <title>Closed-Form Statistics and Design of Mode-Division-Multiplexing Systems Employing Group-Delay Compensation and Mode Permutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excessive accumulation of group-delay (GD) spread increases computational complexity and affects tracking of receiver-based multi-input multi-output signal processing, posing challenges to long-haul mode-division multiplexing in multimode fiber (MMF). GD compensation, which involves periodically exchanging propagating signals between modes with lower and higher GDs, can potentially reduce GD spread. In this work, we investigate two GD compensation schemes: conventional compensation, which alternates fiber types with opposite GD orderings, and self-compensation, which employs a single fiber type with periodically inserted mode permuters. We provide analytical expressions for GD statistics in compensated systems with arbitrary MMF types and mode permuters, accounting for random inter-group coupling, mode scrambling, and refractive index errors. To enhance the effectiveness of GD compensation over the C-band, we propose optimized graded-index depressed-cladding MMFs with index profiles tailored to control mode-dependent chromatic dispersion. We also analyze the impact of fiber fabrication errors and explore mitigation strategies based on GD characterization and sorting. Design examples and numerical simulations demonstrate improved system performance, highlighting the trade-offs between compensation effectiveness, system complexity, and transmission losses.</description>

      <title>Low-Loss All-Fiber Mode Permuter Design Exploiting Propagation Constant Engineering and Cascaded Bragg Gratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Managing group-delay (GD) spread is vital for reducing the complexity of digital signal processing (DSP) in long-haul systems using multi-mode fibers. GD compensation through mode permutation, which involves periodically exchanging power between modes with lower and higher GDs, can reduce GD spread. GD spread is maximally reduced when the modal GDs of the transmission fiber satisfy a specific relation and the mode permuter exchanges power between specific modes. Mode permuters with fiber Bragg gratings have been developed for links accommodating $D=6$ guided spatial and polarization modes; however, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no designs for links supporting a greater number of modes. We present two mode permuter designs based on fiber Bragg gratings for links employing graded-index transmission fibers with $D=12$ guided spatial and polarization modes. One design utilizes a step-index (SI) transverse profile, and the other features a free-form-optimized transverse profile achieving improved performance. For the SI design, we achieve mode-dependent loss standard deviation (MDL STD) and mode-averaged loss (MAL) of less than $0.14$ dB and $0.27$ dB, respectively, over the C-band. For the design with a free-form-optimized transverse profile, we achieve MDL STD and MAL of less than $0.11$ dB and $0.07$ dB, respectively, over the C-band. We numerically evaluate the designs through link simulations and quantify the reduction in GD spread for different levels of random inter-group coupling in the fiber. Our results show that in a link with periodic mode permutation and mode scrambling, the GD STD is reduced by a factor over $3.13$ compared to a link relying solely on periodic mode scrambling.</description>

      <title>An ultrastable hard x-ray attosecond split-delay line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel split-delay line design for generating hard x-ray attosecond pulse pulse pairs. The design introduces an unconventional delay adjustment mechanism, where an x-ray mirror pair rotation was used for adjusting the path length differential between two beam paths. The exit beam pointing stability is guaranteed by the mirror-pair self-compensating geometry, therefore enabling stable continuous delay adjustments. We present a parameter study for this concept covering 5-11 keV photon energies with high efficiency over a delay time coverage window of 20-femstosecond with sub-20 attosecond scanning resolution. Wavefront simulations incorporating realistic mirror parameters demonstrate that the system achieves high throughput and is capable of delivering high-peak-intensity pulses. Attosecond x-ray pump x-ray probe capability enabled by such a delay line is poised to unlock a wide range of hard x-ray nonlinear spectroscopy measurements at sub-femtosecond timescales for the first time.</description>

      <title>17 GHz Lossless InP-Membrane Active Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-speed active metasurfaces enable spatiotemporal control of incident light within an ultra-thin layer, offering new possibilities for optical communication, computing, and sensing. However, a fundamental tradeoff between electrical conductivity and optical absorption of the material has hindered the realization of active metasurfaces that simultaneously achieve broad modulation bandwidth and low optical loss. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a high-speed active metasurface operating in the 1.5-{\mu}m wavelength range that realizes a record-high modulation bandwidth of 17.5 GHz, while maintaining a high quality (Q) factor of 102 and an ultra-low optical loss of 0.56 dB. The key enabling technology is the indium-phosphide (InP) membrane platform; an n-type InP offers both high electron mobility and low free-carrier optical absorption, making it an ideal material for active metasurface devices. The high-Q Friedrich-Wintgen quasi-bound-states-in-the-continuum mode inside the InP-membrane high-contrast grating (HCG) is utilized to trap the normally incident light within an organic electro-optic (OEO) material, enabling efficient modulation. InP HCG also serves as an ultralow-resistance interdigitated electrodes for applying high-speed electrical signals to the OEO material, thereby offering 50-fold improvement in modulation bandwidth compared to conventional silicon-based counterparts. Our work paves the way towards high-speed, low-loss active metasurfaces for spatiotemporal control of light beyond the gigahertz regime.</description>

Abstract: We present a systematic far-field characterization of four commercial PIN diode terahertz photomixers over the 0.2-1.5 THz frequency range using a two-dimensional (2D) raster scanning method. The emission pattern of each transmitter, equipped with an integrated hyper-hemispherical silicon lens, was characterized using a broadband Schottky diode receiver over a 35 mm x 35 mm grid. The results reveal consistent frequency-dependent beam divergence and the emergence of distinct Airy diffraction patterns at intermediate frequencies, attributed to lens-induced aperture effects. This comprehensive mapping underscores the importance of full 2D beam profiling for understanding THz propagation and offers insights into lens design and photomixer packaging for optimized system performance.</description>

      <title>Resonant Self-Diffraction of Femtosecond Extreme Ultraviolet Pulses in Cobalt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-diffraction is a non-collinear four-wave mixing technique well-known in optics. We explore self-diffraction in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) range, taking advantage of intense femtosecond EUV pulses produced by a free electron laser. Two pulses are crossed in a thin cobalt film and their interference results in a spatially periodic electronic excitation. The diffraction of one of the same pulses by the associated refractive index modulation is measured as a function of the EUV wavelength. A sharp peak in the self-diffraction efficiency is observed at the M$_{2,3}$ absorption edge of cobalt at 59 eV and a fine structure is found above the edge. The results are compared with a theoretical model assuming that the excitation results in an increase of the electronic temperature. EUV self-diffraction offers a potentially useful spectroscopy tool and will be instrumental in studying coherent effects in the EUV range.</description>

      <title>Ultracompact 4H-silicon carbide optomechanical resonator with $f_m\cdot Q_m$ exceeding $10^{13}$ Hz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) has great potential for optomechanical applications due to its outstanding optical and mechanical properties. However, challenges associated with SiC nanofabrication have constrained its adoption in optomechanical devices, as embodied by the considerable optical loss or lack of integrated optical access in existing mechanical resonators. In this work, we overcome such challenges and demonstrate a low-loss, ultracompact optomechanical resonator in an integrated 4H-SiC-on-insulator (4H-SiCOI) photonic platform for the first time. Based on a suspended $4.3$-$\mu$m-radius microdisk, the SiC optomechanical resonator features low optical loss ($&lt;1$ dB/cm), a high mechanical frequency $f_m$ of $0.95 \times 10^9$ Hz, a mechanical quality factor $Q_m$ of $1.92\times10^4$, and a footprint of $&lt;1\times 10^{-5}$ mm$^2$. The corresponding $f_m\cdot Q_m$ product is estimated to be $1.82 \times 10^{13}$ Hz, which is among the highest reported values of optomechanical cavities tested in an ambient environment at room temperature. In addition, the strong optomechanical coupling in the SiC microdisk enables coherent regenerative optomechanical oscillations at a threshold optical dropped power of 14 $\mu$W, which also supports efficient harmonic generation at increased power levels. With such competitive performance, we envision a range of chip-scale optomechanical applications to be enabled by the low-loss 4H-SiCOI platform.</description>

      <title>OAM spatial demultiplexing by diffraction-based noiseless mode conversion with axicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics of orbital angular momentum (OAM) carrying light has been well-defined since the 1990s. Leveraging its physical phenomena has become a significant focus in various areas of research. For instance, OAM is applied in hybrid free-space optical communication channels, like wavelength division multiplexing. Due to its orthogonality, OAM can be multiplexed and demultiplexed, enabling the use of multiple orthogonal OAM beams to achieve high-capacity optical communication systems. In this appliance, there will be instability of light because its phase distribution is quite complicated. This study focuses on spatial demultiplexing using Computer Generated Holography (CGH) based OAM diffraction. Earlier research on OAM diffraction primarily involved fork gratings. Spatial demultiplexing has phase distribution instability and noise problems in free space optics. Axicons have been studied extensively in the context of perfect vortex generation. Drawing inspiration from these two areas of physics, we propose a noiseless topological charge conversion through axicon properties in spatial demultiplexing using CGH. Furthermore, we estimate the axicon optical approximate solution that is appropriate for research purposes.</description>

      <title>Correction of broadband terahertz electro-optic sampling with GaSe crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gallium selenide (GaSe) is an efficient nonlinear crystal for electro-optic (EO) sampling in the multi-terahertz (THz) frequency range. However, the lattice resonance at several THz frequencies hampers broadband EO sampling, resulting in distorted pulse waveforms. In this work, we experimentally evaluated the frequency-dependent response function in EO sampling, considering the effects of phonons, phase mismatch, and gate pulse waveforms. The phonon effect is described using an effective Faust-Henry coefficient, which was determined to be $-0.21 \pm 0.02$. The corrected field amplitude of multi-THz pulses aligns with additional measurements of average power and a beam diameter. The successful compensation of the frequency characteristics in GaSe will contribute to a more accurate evaluation of multi-THz transients.</description>

      <title>Measuring choriocapillaris blood flow with laser Doppler optical coherence tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on using a laser Doppler processing of Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) data for the assessment of pulsatile blood flow in the choriocapillaris. Signal fluctuations in B-scans recorded at 2 kHz were analyzed by Fourier transform to extract blood flow information. The spectral broadening of light backscattered by the choriocapillaris was used to derive a choriocapillaris flow velocity index in physical units, with sufficient temporal resolution to capture heartbeat-induced variations. Furthermore, the asymmetry in the spectral broadening enabled us to determine the axial direction of blood flow with high sensitivity, allowing for the detection of flow orientation in retinal capillaries. This approach is promising as it can be directly implemented on widely available fast-scanning Fourier-domain OCT instruments.</description>

      <title>RoNo: A novel way in generating reconfigurable on-chip nonlinear activation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the limitations of Moore's Law and the increasing demand of computing, optical neural network (ONNs) are gradually coming to the stage as an alternative to electrical neural networks. The control of nonlinear activation functions in optical environments, as an important component of neural networks, has always been a challenge. In this work, firstly, we use inverse design tools to design a optical patterned area in silicon-carbide-on-insulator. This patterned area could generate two different nonlinear responses of the amplitude. Secondly, the patterned region is integrated with a control network to form a reconfigurable on-chip nonlinear activation function generator for wave-based analog computing. Experiment shows that neural network that uses such a system as an activation function performs well in the MNIST handwritten dataset and CIFAR-10, respectively. Compared to previous works, we propose a novel approach to generate on-chip reconfigurable activation functions in optical neural networks, which achieves compact footprint and enables high-quality activation function generation.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Intrinsic Dispersion Locking for Achieving Spatio-Spectral Selectivity with Misaligned Bi-metagratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatio-spectral selectivity, the capability to select a single mode with a specific wavevector (angle) and wavelength, is imperative for light emission and imaging. Continuous band dispersion of a conventional periodic structure, however, sets up an intrinsic locking between wavevectors and wavelengths of photonic modes, making it difficult to single out just one mode. Here, we show that the radiation asymmetry of a photonic mode can be explored to tailor the transmission/reflection properties of a photonic structure, based on Fano interferences between the mode and the background. In particular, we find that a photonic system supporting a band dispersion with certain angle-dependent radiation-directionality can exhibit Fano-like perfect reflection at a single frequency and a single incident angle, thus overcoming the dispersion locking and enabling the desired spatio-spectral selectivity. We present a phase diagram to guide designing angle-controlled radiation-directionality and experimentally demonstrate double narrow Fano-like reflection in angular (5{\deg}) and wavelength (14 nm) bandwidths, along with high-contrast spatio-spectral selective imaging, using a misaligned bilayer metagrating with tens-of-nanometer-scale thin spacer. Our scheme promises new opportunities in applications in directional thermal emission, nonlocal beam shaping, augmented reality, precision bilayer nanofabrication, and biological spectroscopy.</description>

Abstract: The effect of temperature on two-dimensional plasmons in large-area AlGaN/GaN plasmonic crystals was studied experimentally. With the temperature increase the resonant plasmon frequency redshifts due to the strong temperature dependence of the electron effective mass and electron concentration under open to the environment surface of AlGaN. The temperature dependence of electron effective mass is confirmed by the cyclotron resonance measurements.</description>

      <title>The effect of aging in thin films in the picosecond sonar experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work examines aging effects in thin-film stacks studied by picosecond acoustics experiments. The method uses a strain wave created by the absorption of a laser pulse in the top metal transducer layer to study the inner structure and properties of multilayers. We show that significant changes in measured signals developed over time, rapidly after sample deposition and continuing for months. Most apparent was the evolution of the thermal exponential background of the signal, but close inspection showed modifications also in the shape of the echoes and the phase of the Brillouin oscillations. We revealed that these changes originate from the titanium transducer layer exposed to the ambient atmosphere. The aging process involves both - irreversible Ti oxidation and reversible gas/water vapor adsorption. Importantly, these aging effects can be eliminated by passivating the Ti layer with a thin 10 nm Si3N4 coating, providing a simple solution for ensuring long-term measurement stability.</description>

      <title>Superdirective Mixed-Multipole-based Unidirectional Spherical Dielectric Lens Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of superdirective dielectric lens antennas are reported emphasizing unidirectional properties. The developed antennas are based on the higher-order transverse electric and magnetic modes present in a multilayered sphere realized with high permittivity dielectrics. The superdirective properties of the lenses are empowered by exciting them with a basic unidirectional mixed-multipole antenna. Genetic algorithm (GA) optimization was employed to identify configurations that yielded both large directivity and front-to-back ratio outcomes. The analytical evaluations of several example systems of spheres having different outer radii and numbers of layers are described. Their radiated field patterns are presented along with comparisons with known directivity bounds to confirm their superdirective performance characteristics. Subsequent numerical assessments with commercial full-wave finite element simulations of more realistic versions of several selected examples illustrate their potential for experimental realization.</description>

      <title>Attonsecond Streaking Phase Retrieval Via Deep Learning Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attosecond streaking phase retrieval is essential for resolving electron dynamics on sub-femtosecond time scales yet traditional algorithms rely on iterative minimization and central momentum approximations that degrade accuracy for broadband pulses. In this work phase retrieval is reformulated as a supervised computer-vision problem and four neural architectures are systematically compared. A convolutional network demonstrates strong sensitivity to local streak edges but lacks global context; a vision transformer captures long-range delay-energy correlations at the expense of local inductive bias; a hybrid CNN-ViT model unites local feature extraction and full-graph attention; and a capsule network further enforces spatial pose agreement through dynamic routing. A theoretical analysis introduces local, global and positional sensitivity measures and derives surrogate error bounds that predict the strict ordering $CNN&lt;ViT&lt;Hybrid&lt;Capsule$. Controlled experiments on synthetic streaking spectrograms confirm this hierarchy, with the capsule network achieving the highest retrieval fidelity. Looking forward, embedding the strong-field integral into physics-informed neural networks and exploring photonic hardware implementations promise pathways toward real-time attosecond pulse characterization under demanding experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>Phase-based stimulated emission depletion (pSTED) magnetic particle imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is an in vivo method to detect magnetic nanoparticles for cell tracking, vascular imaging, and molecular target imaging without ionizing radiation. Current magnetic particle imaging is accomplished by forming an field-free line (FFL) through a gradient selection field. By translating and rotating FFL under excitation and drive fields, the harmonic complex signal of a point source forms a Lorentzian-shape point spread function on the plane perpendicular to FFL. The Lorentzian PSF has a finite size and limited resolution due to the non-sharp Langevin function and weak selection field. This study proposes a donut-shaped focal spot by borrowing the stimulated emission depletion (STED) fluorescence microscopy principle. The influence of the gradient selection field on the relaxation time of magnetic particles determines the nonlinear phase shift of the harmonic complex signals, resulting in the formation of a donut-shaped focal spot. By subtracting the donut-shaped focal spot from the Lorentzian focal spot, the STED focal spot size was reduced by up to 4 times beyond the Langevin magnetization resolution barrier. In human brain FFL-based MPI scanner, the donut-shaped focal spot can be used to reconstruct images with super-resolution and super-sensitivity through the deconvoution of the STED focal spot and filtered backprojection algorithm.</description>

      <title>Direct space-time modeling of mechanically dressed dipole-dipole interactions with electromagnetically-coupled oscillating dipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the radiative dynamics of coupled electric dipoles, modelled as Lorentz oscillators (LOs), in the presence of real-time mechanical oscillations. The dipoles are treated in a self-consistent way through a direct electromagnetic simulation approach that fully includes the dynamical movement of the charges, accounting for radiation reaction, emission and absorption. This allows for a powerful numerical solution of optomechanical resonances without any perturbative approximations for the mechanical motion. The scaled population (excitation) dynamics of the LOs are investigated as well as the emitted radiation and electromagnetic spectra, which demonstrates how the usual dipole-dipole resonances couple to the underlying Floquet states, yielding multiple spectral peaks that are separated from the superradiant and subradiant states by an integer number of the mechanical oscillation frequency. Moreover, we observe that when the mechanical amplitude and frequency are sufficiently large, these additional spectral peaks undergo further modification, including spectral splitting, spectral squeezing, or shifting. These observations are fully corroborated by a theoretical Floquet analysis conducted on two coupled harmonic oscillators.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Wave Splatting for Computer-Generated Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art neural rendering methods optimize Gaussian scene representations from a few photographs for novel-view synthesis. Building on these representations, we develop an efficient algorithm, dubbed Gaussian Wave Splatting, to turn these Gaussians into holograms. Unlike existing computer-generated holography (CGH) algorithms, Gaussian Wave Splatting supports accurate occlusions and view-dependent effects for photorealistic scenes by leveraging recent advances in neural rendering. Specifically, we derive a closed-form solution for a 2D Gaussian-to-hologram transform that supports occlusions and alpha blending. Inspired by classic computer graphics techniques, we also derive an efficient approximation of the aforementioned process in the Fourier domain that is easily parallelizable and implement it using custom CUDA kernels. By integrating emerging neural rendering pipelines with holographic display technology, our Gaussian-based CGH framework paves the way for next-generation holographic displays.</description>

      <title>Satellites promise global-scale quantum networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Academia, governments, and industry around the world are on a quest to build long-distance quantum communication networks for a future quantum internet. Using air and fiber channels, quantum communication quickly faced the daunting challenge of exponential photon loss with distance. Quantum repeaters were invented to solve the loss problem by probabilistically establishing entanglement over short distances and using quantum memories to synchronize the teleportation of such entanglement to long distances. However, due to imperfections and complexities of quantum memories, ground-based proof-of-concept repeater demonstrations have been restricted to metropolitan-scale distances. In contrast, direct photon transmission from satellites through empty space faces almost no exponential absorption loss and only quadratic beam divergence loss. A single satellite successfully distributed entanglement over more than 1,200 km. It is becoming increasingly clear that quantum communication over large intercontinental distances (e.g. 4,000-20,000 km) will likely employ a satellite-based architecture. This could involve quantum memories and repeater protocols in satellites, or memory-less satellite-chains through which photons are simply reflected, or some combination thereof. Rapid advancements in the space launch and classical satellite communications industry provide a strong tailwind for satellite quantum communication, promising economical and easier deployment of quantum communication satellites.</description>

      <title>Optimizing spin polarization in quantum dot vertical-gain structures through pump wavelength selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spintronic applications require an efficient injection of spin-polarized carriers. We study the maximally achievable spin polarization in InAs quantum dots in a vertical-cavity gain structure to be used in telecoms-wavelength vertical-external-cavity surface-emitting lasers via measurement of the Stokes parameter of the photoluminescence emission around 1290 nm. Using five pump wavelengths between 850 and 1070 nm, the observed spin polarization depends strongly on the pump wavelength with the highest polarization of nearly 5% found for excitation at 980 nm. This corresponds to an effective spin lifetime of 40 ps and is attributed to the dominant excitation of heavy holes only.</description>

      <title>Interaction Effects on the Electronic Floquet Spectra: Excitonic Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floquet engineering of electronic states by light is a central topic in modern experiments. However, the impact of many-body interactions on the single-electron properties remains unclear in this non-equilibrium situation. We propose that interaction effects could be reasonably understood by performing perturbative expansion in both the pump field and the electron-electron interaction when computing physical quantities. As an example, we apply this approach to semiconductors and show analytically that excitonic effects, i.e., effects of electron-hole interaction, lead to dramatic corrections to the single-electron Floquet spectra even when the excitons are only virtually excited by the pump light. We compute these effects in phosphorene and monolayer MoS$_2$ for time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (Tr-ARPES) and ultrafast optical experiments.</description>

      <title>Single-photon ionization of H$_2^+$ in near-circular laser fields with lower photon energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study single-photon ionization of aligned H$_2^+$ in low-intensity near-circular laser fields with lower photon energy numerically and analytically. The photoelectron momentum distribution (PMD) within the laser polarization plane, obtained by numerical simulations, shows a remarkable offset angle, which changes with changing the internuclear distance and the laser frequency. This phenomenon is different from that observed in recent experiments [Science 370, 339 (2020)] which is related to the PMD along the propagation direction of the laser. This phenomenon holds even for H$_2^+$ with short-range Coulomb potentials but disappears for atoms, different from that observed in attoclock experiments. We show that the molecular Coulomb potential near the two atomic centers plays an important role here and theory models associated with more accurate continuum wave function of the molecule are needed for reproducing this phenomenon. This phenomenon can be useful for ultrafast probing of molecules with high resolution of several attoseconds or even zeptoseconds.</description>

      <title>Integrated Multi-Wavelength Photonic Architectures for Future Scalable Trapped Ion Quantum Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances of quantum technologies rely on precise control and integration of quantum objects, and technological breakthrough is anticipated for further scaling up to realize practical applications. Trapped-ion quantum technology is a promising candidates to realize them, while its scalability depends on the development of intra-node scaling up, reproducibility of quantum nodes and photonic interconnection among them. Utilization of integrated photonics instead of free-space optics is a crucial step toward mass production of trapped-ion quantum nodes and manifests itself as useful for laser delivery for various quantum operations and photon detection. However, whole architecture of the scalable photonic circuits for them is left unexplored. In this work, we discuss photonic architectures for trapped-ion quantum devices, in which lasers of multiple wavelengths are delivered to multiple trapping zones within a single chip. We analyze two methods of configuring nanophotonic waveguides and compare them in terms of loss of total laser power. This work opens up a new landscape of photonic architecture for various applications not only to quantum ones such as trapped-ion devices but also to classical photonics, e.g. optoelectronic devices and biochemical sensing.</description>

      <title>PtyRAD: A High-performance and Flexible Ptychographic Reconstruction Framework with Automatic Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron ptychography has recently achieved unprecedented resolution, offering valuable insights across diverse material systems, including in three dimensions. However, high-quality ptychographic reconstruction is computationally expensive and time consuming, requiring a significant amount of manually tuning even for experts. Additionally, essential tools for ptychographic analysis are often scattered across multiple software packages, with some advanced features available only in costly commercial software like MATLAB. To address these challenges, we introduce PtyRAD, an open-source software framework offers a comprehensive, flexible, and computationally efficient solution for electron ptychography. PtyRAD provides seamless optimization of multiple parameters--such as sample thickness, local tilts, probe positions, and mixed probe and object modes--using gradient-based methods with automatic differentiation (AD). By utilizing PyTorch's highly optimized tensor operations, PtyRAD achieves up to a 17x speedup in reconstruction time compared to existing packages without compromising image quality. In addition, we propose a real-space depth regularization, which avoids wrap-around artifacts and can be useful for twisted two-dimensional (2D) material datasets and vertical heterostructures. Moreover, PtyRAD integrates a Bayesian optimization workflow that streamlines hyperparameter selection. We hope the open-source nature of PtyRAD will foster reproducibility and community-driven development for future advances in ptychographic imaging.</description>

      <title>A practical guide to Digital Micro-mirror Devices (DMDs) for wavefront shaping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17496v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital micromirror devices have gained popularity in wavefront shaping, offering a high frame rate alternative to liquid crystal spatial light modulators. They are relatively inexpensive, offer high resolution, are easy to operate, and a single device can be used in a broad optical bandwidth. However, some technical drawbacks must be considered to achieve optimal performance. These issues, often undocumented by manufacturers, mostly stem from the device's original design for video projection applications. Herein, we present a guide to characterize and mitigate these effects. Our focus is on providing simple and practical solutions that can be easily incorporated into a typical wavefront shaping setup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of polar systems coupled to classical external beams in the ultrastrong coupling regime. The permanent dipole moments (PDMs) sustained by polar systems can couple to the electromagnetic field, giving rise to a variety of processes such as difference-frequency and harmonic generation, reflected in complicated dynamics of the atomic system. Here, we demonstrate that the dynamics can be described simply in a dynamic reference frame. We derive a Jaynes-Cummings-like framework with effective parameters describing frequency shift, coupling strength with the driving field, and a rescaled relaxation rate. The familiar linear scaling of the interaction strength with the field amplitude is replaced with a nonlinear dependence, suggesting potential applications for improving the coherence of quantum system ensembles with permanent dipoles.</description>

      <title>Conservation law for angular momentum based on optical field derivatives: Analysis of optical spin-orbit conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13135v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for analyzing the loss of optical angular momentum (AM), including spin (SAM) and orbital (OAM) components, in light-matter interactions. Conventional SAM and OAM conservation laws rely on transverse field components, neglecting longitudinal fields and limiting applicability to vacuum. Our approach defines optical AM using time derivatives of the electric and magnetic fields, yielding a gauge-invariant formulation that includes both transverse and longitudinal components and explicitly incorporates charge and current densities. This enables a more complete description of AM dissipation in materials. We apply this framework to analyze spin-orbit conversion (SOC) in two scenarios: scattering of circularly polarized (CP) beams by a gold nanoparticle and focusing of CP and linearly polarized optical vortex beams by a lens. The results show that SOC depends on particle size and polarization, with notable OAM loss in larger particles and CP beam focusing. This framework enables the evaluation of previously overlooked SAM and OAM losses, providing a powerful tool for studying systems in which the analysis of AM losses is intrinsically important, such as chiral materials, as well as for designing photonic devices and exploring light-matter interactions at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Observation of Moir\'e Plasmonic Skyrmion Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05576v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Skyrmions are topological defects belonging to nontrivial homotopy classes in particle theory. Their remarkably stable topology has recently been observed in electromagnetic waves. For the evanescent fields near a surface, this has been realized so far only for elementary optical skyrmions, with a fixed skyrmion number. Here we report, both in theory and experiment, the concept of moir\'e plasmonic skyrmion clusters, where multi-skyrmions are nested to form a large optical skyrmion cluster. By leveraging twistronics engineering of plasmonic nanostructures, we demonstrate both crystallized and quasi-crystallized optical skyrmion lattices, revealing an unprecedented degree of topological control. In a misaligned composite nanostructure, the rapid inverting of optical skyrmion number is achieved, which is explained by a lattice model. This topological change of moir\'eplasmonic skyrmion clusters can serve as a precise beacon of the relative alignment deviation between composite nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Observation of Strong Nonreciprocal Thermal Emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kirchhoff`s law of thermal radiation stating the equivalence of emissivity and absorptivity at the same wavelength, angle, and polarization, has completely constrained emission and absorption processes. Achieving strong nonreciprocal emission points to fundamental advances for applications such as energy harvesting, heat transfer, and sensing, but strong nonreciprocal thermal emission has not been experimentally realized. Here, we observe strong nonreciprocal thermal emission using a custom-designed angle-resolved magnetic thermal emission spectroscopy and an epitaxially-transferred gradient-doped metamaterial. We show that under magnetic field, the metamaterial strongly breaks the Kirchhoff`s law, with a difference between emissivity and absorptivity at the same wavelength and angle reaching as high as 0.43. Significant nonreciprocal emission persists over broad spectral and angular ranges. The demonstration of strong nonreciprocal thermal emission and the approach can be useful for systematic exploration of nonreciprocal thermal photonics for thermal management, infrared camouflage, and energy conversion.</description>

      <title>Universal analytical modeling of coated plasmonic particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From a structural point of view, plasmonic nanoparticles are always at least two-layer structures with a dielectric layer of stabilizing, targeting, fluorescent, Raman, or other functional molecules. To optimize the optical properties of such bioconjugates, one needs efficient analytical models based on simple physical ideas and with reasonable accuracy comparable to rigorous numerical methods requiring significant computer resources. Recently, we suggested an analytical approach based on a combination of the modal expansion method (MEM) and the dipole equivalence method (DEM). Here, we extend the MEM+DEM approach for particles of various shapes and orientations. To illustrate the possibilities of our method, we calculate extinction and scattering spectra of gold and silver nanorods, nanodiscs, triangle nanoprisms, bicones, and bipyramids with a dielectric coating thickness from 0 to 100 nm. For the main plasmonic peaks, we found excellent agreement between our analytical method and numerical simulations performed with COMSOL, except for some disagreement between MEM and COMSOL solutions for bicones with small rounding radii. To illustrate the application of our method, we prepared 12 AuNR samples using a chemical etching with fine tuning of the LPR over the 1020-580 nm range. By including the CTAB shell in the simulation model, we achieved excellent agreement between the calculated and measured dependence of the LPR peak position on the AuNR aspect ratio. In summary, our method uses the MEM parameters of the original metal particles and does not require additional numerical calculations to build analytical models for bilayered or multilayered conjugates. Due to the simplicity and reasonable accuracy analytical models, they can help apply machine learning to predict various plasmonic responses such as light absorption, scattering, SERS, and metal-enhanced fluorescence.</description>

Abstract: Spatial and temporal light modulation is a well-established technology that enables dynamic shaping of the phase and amplitude of optical fields, significantly enhancing the resolution and sensitivity of imaging methods. Translating this capability to electron beams is highly desirable within the framework of a transmission electron microscope (TEM) to benefit from the nanometer spatial resolution of these instruments. In this work, we report on the experimental realization of a photonic-based free-electron modulator integrated into the column of two ultrafast TEMs for pre-sample electron-beam shaping. Electron-photon interaction is employed to coherently modulate both the transverse and longitudinal components of the electron wave function, while leveraging dynamically controlled optical fields and tailored design of electron-laser-sample interaction geometry. Using energy- and momentum-resolved electron detection, we successfully reconstruct the shaped electron wave function at the TEM sample plane. These results demonstrate the ability to manipulate the electron wave function before probing the sample, paving the way for the future development of innovative imaging methods in ultrafast electron microscopy.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate a direct one-to-one correspondence between nonlinear optical fields in defocusing Kerr media and wave functions in weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensates or quantum fluids. Based on this correspondence, we propose the existence of excitations in an optical vortex beam characterized by a helical deformation of its phase singularity core. These excitations are direct analogues of Kelvin waves known in quantum and classical fluid dynamics. We further show that the excitations exhibit two distinct branches, one of which includes a stationary solution. A feasible experimental scheme for generating these excitations is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Metasurface Lens for Long-Wavelength Infrared Radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dielectric metasurfaces are structured thin films with thickness smaller than the wavelength that aim at replacing and enhancing conventional bulk optical components by structuring local resonances across an aperture. At visible and near-infrared frequencies, titania or silicon are routinely used as substrates to realize these ultrathin devices, ideally suited for conventional nanofabrication techniques. Unfortunately, directly scaling these design and material approaches to long-wave infrared frequencies is not practical, due to challenges in the required thicknesses and the presence of phonon absorption lines. Nonlocal metasurfaces based on extended resonances with a local geometric phase offer a compelling design platform that can address these challenges. They enable ultrathin metasurfaces, as they leverage lattice resonances, while they also offer multi-functionalities and frequency-selectivity, and they can be implemented in a range of low-loss material platforms. Here, we demonstrate nonlocal metalenses based on germanium thin films on a zinc-selenide substrate, operating around 10.3{\mu}m within a deeply subwavelength device thickness of 1.45{\mu}m (14% the free-space wavelength). We showcase a novel meta-unit geometry based on a square lattice with highly isotropic dispersion features, supporting a resonant geometric phase that is highly stable in frequency, simplifying the rational design of complex metasurface operations. The introduced platform promises highly multi-functional, low-profile meta-optics with enhanced meta-unit designs, compatible with the challenging thermal spectral region for imaging and sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Reality-Infused Deep Learning for Angle-resolved Quasi-optical Fourier Surfaces</title>

Abstract: Optical Fourier surfaces (OFSs), featuring sinusoidally profiled diffractive elements, manipulate light through patterned nanostructures and incident angle modulation. Compared to altering structural parameters, tuning elevation and azimuth angles offers greater design flexibility for light field control. However, angle-resolved responses of OFSs are often complex due to diverse mode excitations and couplings, complicating the alignment between simulations and practical fabrication. Here, we present a reality-infused deep learning framework, empowered by angle-resolved measurements, to enable real-time and accurate predictions of angular dispersion in quasi-OFSs. This approach captures critical features, including nanofabrication and measurement imperfections, which conventional simulation-based methods typically overlook. Our framework significantly accelerates the design process while achieving predictive performance highly consistent with experimental observations across broad angular and spectral ranges. Our study supports valuable insights into the development of OFS-based devices, and represents a paradigm shift from simulation-driven to reality-infused methods, paving the way for advancements in optical design applications.</description>

      <title>Defect-evolved quadrupole higher-order topological nanolasers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological photonics have been garnering widespread interest in engineering the flow of light with topological ideas. Strikingly, the recent introduction of higher-order topological insulators has generalized the fundamental framework of topological photonics, endowing counterintuitive strong confinement of light at lower-dimensional boundaries, thus unlocking exciting prospects for the exploration of topological phenomena in fresh routes as well as the design of topology-driven nanoscale light sources. Here, we revealed the photonic quadrupole topological phases can be activated by defect evolution and performed experimental demonstrations of associated nanoscale lasing operation under this paradigm. The quadrupole higher-order topological nanocavity is constructed by two topologically distinct photonic crystal slabs with opposite directions of defect evolution. Stable single mode emission and low lasing threshold in telecom C-band are achieved at room temperature of the defect-evolved quadrupole topological nanolaser. This work reveals new possibilities for photonic quadrupole topological phase transition, providing an intriguing route toward light confinement and modulation under the topological framework.</description>

      <title>Scheimpflug cameras for range-resolved observations of the atmospheric effects on laser propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the development of Scheimpflug cameras for lidar and remote sensing with an emphasis on active and passive range-finding. Scheimpflug technology uses a tilted camera geometry to natively encode 3D information through projected off-axis pixel view angles and holds the unique potential to serve as an alternative to traditional lidar and remote sensing systems with the demonstrated advantages of high configurability, SWaP-C (Size, Weight and Power-Cost) efficiency and short- vs. far-range optimization. In this work, we demonstrate several compact Scheimpflug-enabled systems as a snapshot atmospheric lidar detector to measure aerosol extinction and optical turbulence effects with high precision over ranges from a few meters to a few kilometer. We compare the instrument's measurements to variance-based Cn2 data collected by a conic anemometer and scintillometer over a 50 m horizontal path. This paper also presents preliminary results on utilizing Scheimpflug technology for photogrammetry, 2D/3D mapping and includes a generalized discussion on the design, alignment and calibration procedures. We believe this work provides a strong basis for the broad use of Scheimpflug technology across multiple use-cases with the fields of lidar and remote sensing.</description>

      <title>Narrowband, angle-stable, and highly efficient polariton organic light emitting diodes employing thermally activated delayed fluorescence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Narrowband emission is crucial for next generation optoelectronic devices to satisfy demands for high color brilliance. Microcavities can narrow emission spectra of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) through the creation of resonant standing waves, independent of emitter material, enabling flexibility in molecular and device design. However, they induce a strong angle-dependence of the perceived emission color. Utilizing strong light-matter coupling of cavity photons with the virtually angle-independent exciton, leads to exciton-polariton emission showing reduced linewidths and suppressed angular dispersion if tuned correctly. Creating polaritons in highly efficient materials such as thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules is however difficult as their low oscillator strengths intrinsically disfavor light-matter interaction. Here, we present the successful combination of a highly efficient but intrinsically broadband TADF emitter with a strongly absorbing assistant strong coupling material in a modified microcavity structure. Through optimizing the assistant strong coupling layer architecture, we demonstrate polariton OLEDs with exceptionally narrowband, angle stable emission at external quantum efficiencies above 20% for both bottom- and top-emitting designs, more than doubling the performance of previous record devices. The results pave the way for utilizing polaritonic emission at practical device efficiencies for display applications.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Focusing on a Nonlinear Target in a Complex Medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wavefront shaping techniques allow waves to be focused on a diffraction-limited target deep inside disordered media. To identify the target position, a guidestar is required that typically emits a frequency-shifted signal. Here we present a noninvasive matrix approach operating at a single frequency only, based on the variation of the field scattered by a nonlinear target illuminated at two different incident powers. The local perturbation induced by the nonlinearity serves as a guide for identifying optimal incident wavefronts. We demonstrate maximal focusing on electronic devices embedded in chaotic microwave cavities and extend our approach to temporal signals. Finally, we exploit the programmability offered by reconfigurable smart surfaces to enhance the intensity delivered to a nonlinear target. Our results pave the way for deep imaging protocols that use any type of nonlinearity as feedback, requiring only the measurement of a monochromatic scattering matrix.</description>

      <title>Super-bunching light with giant high-order correlations and extreme multi-photon events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05419v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-classical light sources emitting bundles of N-photons with strong correlation represent versatile resources of interdisciplinary importance with applications ranging from fundamental tests of quantum mechanics to quantum information processing. Yet, high-order correlations, gN(0),quantifying photon correlation, are still limited to hundreds. Here, we report the generation of a super-bunching light source in photonic crystal fiber with g2(0) reaching 5.86*104 and g5(0) up to 2.72*108, through measuring its photon number probability distributions. under giant g2(0) values, the super-bunching light source presents upturned-tail photon distributions and ubiquitous extreme multi-photon events, where 31 photons from a single light pulse at a mean of 1.99*10-4 photons per pulse have been determined. The probability of this extreme event has been enhanced by 10139 folds compared to a coherent laser with Poissonian distribution. By varying the power of the pumping laser, both photon number distributions and corresponding high-order correlations of this light source can be substantially tailored from Poissonian to super-bunching distributions. These phenomena are attributed to the synchronized nonlinear interactions in photonic crystal fibers pumping by bright squeezed light, and the theoretical simulations agree well with the experimental results. Our research showcases the ability to achieve non-classical light sources with giant high-order correlations and extreme multi-photon events, paving the way for high-order correlation imaging, extreme nonlinear optical effects, quantum information processing, and exploring light-matter interactions with multi-photon physics.</description>

      <title>Attosecond physics hidden in Cherenkov radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cherenkov radiation of charged particles moving with superluminal velocities in transparent media is a well-studied phenomenon with a plethora of applications. Its microscopic origins can be traced to the polarization of atomic shells, characterized by time scales in the subfemtosecond range - dynamics that eludes conventional macroscopic treatment. Here we present a theoretical framework for probing the intrinsic dynamics of Cherenkov radiation, unveiling quantum features absent in classical realm and even in a fully quantum theory in momentum space. These features include a finite formation length and spreading time of the photon, the latter becoming negative nearby the Cherenkov angle, a finite flash duration tied to the size of the electron packet, along with a shift in the photon arrival time that can be either positive or negative and necessitates going beyond the far-field approximation. The calculated time scales lie in the attosecond range for the relevant parameters, thus linking this macroscopic phenomenon back to its atomic origins. Finally, we propose that by measuring the duration of the Cherenkov flash one can in principle retrieve the length of the emitting packet, deepening our understanding of quantum coherence effects in photon emission.</description>

      <title>Quartic soliton solutions of a normal dispersion based mode-locked laser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We studied the characteristics, regions of existence and stability of different types of solitons for a distributed model of a mode-locked laser whose dispersion is purely quartic and normal. Among the different types of solitons, we identified three main branches that are named according to their different amplitude: low, medium and high amplitude solitons. It was found that the first solitons are always unstable while the latter two exist and are stable in relatively large regions of the parameter space. Moreover, the stability regions of medium and high amplitude solitons overlap over a certain range of parameters, manifesting effects of bistability. The energy of high amplitude solitons increases quadratically with their width, whereas the energy of medium amplitude solitons may decrease or increase with the width depending on the parameter region. Furthermore, we have investigated the long term evolution of the continuous wave solutions under modulational instability, showing that medium amplitude solitons can arise in this scenario. Additionally, we assessed the effects of second and third order dispersion on medium and high amplitude solitons and found that both remain stable in the presence of these terms.</description>

      <title>Position-correlated biphoton wavefront sensing for quantum adaptive imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum imaging with spatially entangled photons offers advantages such as enhanced spatial resolution, robustness against noise, and counter-intuitive phenomena. In quantum adaptive optics, biphoton spatial aberration correction has been achieved by using classical beams to detect the aberration source or scanning the correction phase on biphotons when the source is unreachable. Here, a new method named position-correlated biphoton Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensing is introduced, where the phase pattern added on photon pairs with a strong position correlation is reconstructed from their position centroid distribution at the back focal plane of a microlens array. Experimentally, biphoton phase measurement and adaptive imaging against the disturbance of a plastic film are demonstrated. This single-shot method is a more direct and efficient approach to biphoton phase measurement, suitable for integration into quantum microscopy, remote imaging, and communication.</description>

      <title>Estimations of lung structural properties from a single propagation-based dark-field X-ray image</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this investigation, we applied a single-projection dark-field imaging technique to gain statistical information on the smallest airway structures within the lung$\unicode{x2014}$the alveoli$\unicode{x2014}$focusing on their size and number as key indicators of lung health. The algorithm employed here retrieves the projected thickness of the sample from a propagation-based phase contrast image using the transport-of-intensity equation. The first Born approximation is then used to isolate the dark-field signal associated with edge scattering, which increases the visibility of microstructure boundaries. PMMA spheres of known sizes were imaged first as an idealised alveolar model. The dark-field signal was then recovered from propagation-based phase-contrast X-ray images of the lungs of small mammals using this method. The retrieved dark-field signal was found to be proportional to both the alveolar size ($R^2 = 0.85$) and the number in projection ($R^2 = 0.69$), and these measurements could be combined to provide an estimate of the total surface area of the alveolar interfaces ($R^2 = 0.78$). This demonstrates the approach's ability to indicate lung health using the dark-field signal retrieved from a single-phase-contrast X-ray image.</description>
