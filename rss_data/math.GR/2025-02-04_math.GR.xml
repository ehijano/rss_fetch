      <title>Word maps and random words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss some recent results by a number of authors regarding word maps on algebraic groups and finite simple groups, their mixing properties and the geometry of their fibers, emphasizing the role played by equidistribution results in finite fields via recent advances on character bounds and non-abelian arithmetic combinatorics. In particular, we discuss character varieties of random groups. In the last section, we give a new proof of a recent theorem of Hrushovski about the geometric irreducibility of the generic fibers of convolutions of dominant morphisms to simply connected algebraic groups.
  These notes stem out of lectures given by the authors in Oxford, and by the first author in ICTS Bangalore, in spring 2024.</description>

      <title>A note on involution prefixes in Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(W, R)$ be a Coxeter system and let $w \in W$. We say that $u$ is a prefix of $w$ if there is a reduced expression for $u$ that can be extended to one for $w$. That is, $w = uv$ for some $v$ in $W$ such that $\ell(w) = \ell(u) + \ell(v)$. We say that $w$ has the ancestor property if the set of prefixes of $w$ contains a unique involution of maximal length. In this paper we show that all Coxeter elements of finitely generated Coxeter groups have the ancestor property, and hence a canonical expression as a product of involutions. We conjecture that the property in fact holds for all non-identity elements of finite Coxeter groups.</description>

      <title>Galois cohomology and the subalgebras of the special linear algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_3(\mathbb{R})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize Galois cohomology to classify the real subalgebras of the special linear algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_3(\mathbb{R})$, leveraging the established classification of complex subalgebras of $\mathfrak{sl}_3(\mathbb{C})$. Although a classification of the real subalgebras of $\mathfrak{sl}_3(\mathbb{R})$ already exists, our results and the methodology employed are significant for three key reasons. Firstly, it introduces a new approach to classifying real subalgebras of real semisimple Lie algebras, providing a framework for future work. Secondly, given the computational complexity and intricacy of such classifications, our verification of the previous classification through a different method provides a valuable contribution to the literature. Thirdly, subalgebras of semisimple Lie algebras have applications in both physics and applied mathematics; contributions to understanding the subalgebra structure of semisimple Lie algebras may enhance the implementation and comprehension of these applications.</description>

      <title>Categorification of characteristic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a representation theory of categories as a means to explore characteristic structures in algebra. Characteristic structures play a critical role in isomorphism testing of groups and algebras, and their construction and description often rely on specific knowledge of the parent object and its automorphisms. In many cases, questions of reproducibility and comparison arise. Here we present a categorical framework that addresses these questions. We prove that every characteristic structure is the image of a functor equipped with a natural transformation. This shifts the local description in the parent object to a global one in the ambient category. Through constructions in representation theory, such as tensor products, we can combine characteristic structure across multiple categories. Our results are constructive, stated in the language of a constructive type theory, which facilitates implementations in theorem checkers.</description>

      <title>Simple Expansion Sets and Non-Positive Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An expansion set is a set $\mathcal{B}$ such that each $b \in \mathcal{B}$ is equipped with a set of expansions $\mathcal{E}(b)$. The theory of expansion sets offers a systematic approach to the construction of classifying spaces for generalized Thompson groups.
  We say that $\mathcal{B}$ is simple if proper expansions are unique when they exist.
  We will prove that any given simple expansion set determines a cubical complex with a metric of non-positive curvature. In many cases, the cubical complex will be CAT(0). We are thus able to recover proofs that Thompsons groups $F$, $T$, and $V$, Houghton's groups $H_{n}$, and groups defined by finite similarity structures all act on CAT(0) cubical complexes. We further state a sufficient condition for the cubical complex to be locally finite, and show that the latter condition is satisfied in the cases of $F$, $T$, $V$, and $H_{n}$.</description>

      <title>Almost homomorphisms and measurable cocycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several results regarding the rigidity of maps and cocycles in the setting of Polish groups are established.
  Firstly, if $G\overset{\phi}\longrightarrow H$ is a map from a locally compact second countable group $G$ into a group $H$ and such that there is a conull subset $Z\subseteq G\times G$ satisfying $$ \phi(xy)=\phi(x)\cdot \phi(y) $$ for all $(x,y)\in Z$, then there is a homomorphism $G\overset{\pi}\longrightarrow H$ agreeing with $\phi$ almost everywhere. A similar statement holds for Baire category.
  Secondly, if $G\times X\overset{\psi}\longrightarrow H$ is a Baire measurable cocycle associated with a Polish group action $G\curvearrowright X$ and $\psi$ is continuous in the second variable, then $\psi$ is jointly continuous. Again, a related statement holds for measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider semi-extraspecial $p$-groups $G$ that have an automorphism of order $|G:G'| - 1$. We prove that these groups are isomorphic to Sylow $p$-subgroups of ${\rm SU}_3 (p^{2a})$ for some integer $a$. If $p$ is odd, this is equivalent to saying that $G$ is isomorphic to a Sylow $p$-subgroup of ${\rm SL}_3 (p^a)$.</description>

      <title>Extensibility and denseness of periodic semigroup actions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study periodic points and finitely supported invariant measures for continuous semigroup actions. Introducing suitable notions of periodicity in both topological and measure-theoretical contexts, we analyze the space of invariant Borel probability measures associated with these actions. For embeddable semigroups, we establish a direct relationship between the extensibility of invariant measures to the free group on the semigroup and the denseness of finitely supported invariant measures. Applying this framework to shift actions on the full shift, we prove that finitely supported invariant measures are dense for every left amenable semigroup that is residually a finite group and for every finite-rank free semigroup.</description>

      <title>Canonical Commutation Relations: A quick proof of the Stone-von Neumann theorem and an extension to general rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a (not necessary commutative) ring with unit, $d\geq 1$ an integer, and $\lambda$ a unitary character of the additive group $(R,+).$ A pair $(U,V)$ of unitary representations $U$ and $V$ of $R^d$ on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ is said to satisfy the canonical commutation relations (relative to $\lambda$) if $U(a) V(b)= \lambda(a\cdot b)V(b) U(a)$ for all $a=(a_1, \dots, a_d), b= (b_1, \dots, b_d)\in R^d$, where $a\cdot b= \sum_{k=1}^d a_k b_k.$ We give a new and quick proof of the classical Stone von Neumann Theorem about the essential uniqueness of such a pair in the case where $R$ is a local field (e.g. $R= \mathbf{R}$). Our methods allow us to give the following extension of this result to a general locally compact ring $R$. For a unitary representation $U$ of $R^d$ on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}, $ define the inflation $U^{(\infty)}$ of $U$ as the (countably) infinite multiple of $U$ on $\mathcal{H}^{(\infty)}=\oplus_{i\in \mathbf{N}} \mathcal{H}$. Let $(U_1, V_1), (U_2, V_2)$ be two pairs of unitary representations of $R^d$ on corresponding Hilbert spaces $\mathcal{H}_1, \mathcal{H}_2$ satisfying the canonical commutation relations (relative to $\lambda$). Provided that $\lambda$ satisfies a mild faithful condition, we show that the inflations $(U_1^{(\infty)}, V_1^{(\infty)}), (U_2^{(\infty)}, V_2^{(\infty)})$ are approximately equivalent, that is, there exists a sequence $(\Phi_n)_n$ of unitary isomorphisms $\Phi_n: \mathcal{H}_1^{(\infty)}\to \mathcal{H}_2^{(\infty)}$ such that $\lim_{n} \Vert U_2^{(\infty)}(a) - \Phi_n U_1^{(\infty)}(a) \Phi_n^{*}\Vert=0$ and $\lim_{n} \Vert V_2^{(\infty)}(b) - \Phi_n V_1^{(\infty)}(b) \Phi_n^{*}\Vert=0,$ uniformly on compact subsets of $R^d.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a permutation group $G$, the derangement graph of $G$ is defined with vertex set $G$, where two elements $x$ and $y$ are adjacent if and only if $xy^{-1}$ is a derangement. We establish that, if $G$ is transitive with degree exceeding 30, then the derangement graph of $G$ contains a complete subgraph with four vertices.
  As a consequence, if $G$ is a normal subgroup of $A$ such that $|A : G| = 3$, and if $U$ is a subgroup of $G$ satisfying $G = \bigcup_{a \in A} U^a$, then $|G : U| \leq 10$. This result provides support for a conjecture by Neumann and Praeger concerning Kronecker classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study here the higher derived limits of mod $p$ cohomology on the centric orbit category of a saturated fusion system on a finite $p$-group. It is an open problem whether all such higher limits vanish. This is known in many cases, including for fusion systems realized by a finite group and for many classes of fusion systems which are not so realized. We prove that the higher limits of $H^j$ vanish provided $j \leq p-2$, by showing that the same is true for the contravariant part of a simple Mackey composition factor of $H^j$ under the same conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a countable group $A$ with trivial bounded cohomology for all semi-separable coefficients and any group $\Gamma$, we prove that the bounded cohomology of certain restricted verbal wreath products $\Gamma \wr^{_W} A$ vanishes in positive degrees, for all semi-separable coefficients. Examples of such verbal wreath products include the standard restricted wreath product (extending a recent result by Monod for lamplighters groups) as well as verbal wreath products arising from $n$-solvable, $n$-nilpotent and $k$-Burnside ($k = 2,3,4,6$) verbal products. Moreover, we prove that the stable commutator length of any verbal wreath product $\Gamma \wr^{_W} A$ vanishes. As an application, we show that every group of type $F_p$ isometrically embeds into a group of type $F_p$ with vanishing bounded cohomology in degree $n\geq 1$ for all semi-separable coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.00637v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two papers published in 1979, R. Bowen and C. Series defined a dynamical system from a Fuchsian group, acting on the hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}^2$. The dynamics is given by a map on $S^1$ which is, in particular, an expanding piecewise homeomorphism of the circle. In this paper we consider a reverse question: which dynamical conditions for an expanding piecewise homeomorphism of $S^1$ are sufficient for the map to be a ``Bowen-Series-type" map (see below) for some group $G$ and which groups can occur? We give a partial answer to these questions.</description>

      <title>Amenable actions on ill-behaved simple C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By combining R{\o}rdam's construction and the author's previous construction, we provide the first examples of amenable actions of non-amenable groups on simple separable nuclear C*-algebras that are neither stably finite nor purely infinite. For free groups, we also provide unital examples. We arrange the actions so that the crossed products are still simple with both a finite and an infinite projection.</description>

      <title>Aperiodic Flows on Finite Semigroups: Foundations and First Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of flows was used as a crucial tool in the recent proof by Margolis, Rhodes and Schilling that Krohn-Rhodes complexity is decidable. In this paper we begin a systematic study of aperiodic flows. We give the foundations of the theory of flows and give a unified approach to the Presentation Lemma and its relations to flows and the Slice Theorem. We completely describe semigroups having a flow over the trivial semigroup and connect this to classical results in inverse semigroup theory. We reinterpret Tilson's Theorem on the complexity of small monoids in terms of flows. We conclude with examples of semigroups built from the character table of Abelian Groups that have an aperiodic flows.</description>

      <title>Dynamic asymptotic dimension growth for group actions and groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of dynamic asymptotic dimension growth for actions of discrete groups on compact spaces, and more generally for locally compact \'etale groupoids. Using the work of Bartels, L\"uck, and Reich, we bridge asymptotic dimension growth for countable discrete groups with our notion for their group actions, thereby providing numerous concrete examples. Moreover, we demonstrate that the asymptotic dimension growth for a discrete metric space of bounded geometry is equivalent to the dynamic asymptotic dimension growth for its associated coarse groupoid. Consequently, we deduce that the coarse groupoid with subexponential dynamic asymptotic dimension growth is amenable. More generally, we show that every $\sigma$-compact locally compact Hausdorff \'etale groupoid with compact unit space having dynamic asymptotic dimension growth at most $x^{\alpha}$ $(0&lt;\alpha&lt;1)$ is amenable.</description>
