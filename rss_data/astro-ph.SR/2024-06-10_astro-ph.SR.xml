      <title>Bistability in the sunspot cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A direct dynamical test of the sunspot-cycle is carried out which indicates that a stochastically forced non-linear oscillator characterizes its dynamics. The sunspot series is then decomposed into its eigen time-delay coordinates. The analysis of these coordinates reveals that the sunspot series exhibits bistability, and suggests the possibility of modeling the solar cycle as a stochastically and periodically forced bistable oscillator, accounting for the Poloidal and Toroidal modes of the solar magnetic field. Such a representation of the sunspot series in terms of stochastic bistable dynamical system enables us to conjecture stochastic resonance as the key mechanism in amplifying the planetary influence of Jupiter on the sun, and that extreme events, due to turbulent convection noise inside the sun, dictate crucial phases of the sunspot cycle, such as the Maunder minimum.</description>

      <title>Prevalence of non-standard collapsing of strong Langmuir turbulence in solar corona plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fully-kinetic simulation of the full life cycle of strong Langmuir turbulence (SLT) excited by electron beams that are accelerated under the solar corona conditions. We find that (1) most packets ($\sim$80%) are affected by their neighbors during their collapse, as a result, their spatial scale variations present non-standard evolutionary features, i.e., deviating away from what was predicted by the Zakharov model; (2) the collapsing cavity is too shallow to trap the wave packet due to the growth of the Coulomb force, as a result a majority ($\sim$70%) of the packet energy runs away and a secondary localization may occur. The study indicates that the non-standard Langmuir collapse may play an important role in coronal plasmas interacting with an intense electron beam, that may be eventually confirmed by humanity's first mission to fly through the corona.</description>

      <title>EUV polarimetric diagnostics of the solar corona: the Hanle effect of Ne VIII 770 \AA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields are the primary driver of the plasma thermodynamics in the upper solar atmosphere, especially in the corona. However, magnetic field measurements in the solar corona are sporadic, thereby limiting us from the complete understanding of physical processes occurring in the coronal plasma. In this paper, we explore the diagnostic potential of a coronal emission line in the extreme-ultraviolet (EUV), i.e., Ne VIII 770 \AA to probe the coronal magnetic fields. We utilize 3D 'Magneto-hydrodynamic Algorithm outside a Sphere' (MAS) models as input to the FORWARD code to model polarization in Ne VIII line produced due to resonance scattering, and interpret its modification due to collisions and the magnetic fields through the Hanle effect. The polarization maps are synthesized both on the disk as well as off-the-limb. The variation of this polarization signal through the different phases of solar cycle 24 and the beginning phase of solar cycle 25 is studied in order to understand the magnetic diagnostic properties of this line owing to different physical conditions in the solar atmosphere. The detectability of the linear polarization signatures of the Hanle effect significantly improves with increasing solar activity, consistently with the increase in the magnetic field strength and the intensity of the mean solar brightness at these wavelengths. We finally discuss the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirements by considering realistic instrument designs.</description>

      <title>Multi-color and TESS photometric investigation of four lo mass-ratio contact binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the TESS and BVRcIc light curves solution of four low mass-ratio contact binary systems TIC 159102550), V1068 Her, MW Pav and TIC 321576458. Except MW Pav, all three systems have been studied for the first time. The period analysis of TIC 159102550 show anti-correlation between primary and secondary minima and no long term variation is reported. The systems V1068 Her and MW Pav show increasing orbital period trends. Data for TIC 321576458 is too few to determine any periodic variations. The light curve analysis using Wilson-Divinney model shows that systems are low mass-ratio contact binaries. Out of four targets, two systems TIC 159102550 and V1068 Her, are shallow contact binary systems with fill-out factor of 20% and 14%, respectively. The two contact binaries MW Pav and TIC 321576458 are in deep contact state with fill-out factor 63% and 61%, respectively. V1068 Her shows EB-type light curve, however the temperature difference between the primary secondary component is only 17K, which indicates that system is in thermal contact. To understand the evolutionary status of these systems, the components are plotted on the mass-luminosity diagram. The primary companions are in the ZAMS zone while the secondary components of all the systems are away from TAMS which indicates that secondary is more evolved than the primary components. V1068 Her and MW Pav are expected to evolve into a single rapidly rotating star provided that they meet the well-know Hut's criterion. Through statistical investigation of more than hundred low mass-ratio contact binary systems including our targets, we have found that all of the low mass-ratio contact binaries have undergone the mass-ratio inversion process. Based on our sample, the relationship between mass ratio and spin and orbital angular momentum ratio has been updated and proposed a new value of qmin = 0.0388 for Darwin's stability.</description>

      <title>A detailed survey of the parallel mean free path of solar energetic particle protons and electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, more than a dozen solar energetic particle (SEP) events are identified where the source region is magnetically well-connected to at least one spacecraft at 1~au. The observed intensity-time profiles, for all available proton and electron energy channels, are compared to results computed using a numerical 1D SEP transport model in order to derive the parallel mean free paths (pMFPs) as a function of energy (or rigidity) at 1~au. These inversion results are then compared to theoretical estimates of the pMFP, using observed turbulence quantities with observationally-motivated variations as input. For protons, a very good comparison between inversion and theoretical results is obtained. It is shown that the observed inter-event variations in the inversion pMFP values can be explained by natural variations in the background turbulence values. For electrons, there is relatively good agreement with pMFPs derived assuming the damping model of dynamical turbulence, although the theoretical values are extremely sensitive to the details of the turbulence dissipation range which themselves display a high level of variation.</description>

      <title>Apparent non-variable stars from the Kepler mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of non-variable stars is generally neglected in the literature. However, such objects are needed for many calibration processes and for testing pulsational models. The photometric time series of the Kepler satellite mission still stand as the most accurate data available today and are excellently suited to the search for non-variable stars. We analysed all long-cadence light curves for stars not reported as a variable so far from the Kepler satellite mission. Using the known characteristics and flaws of these data sets, we defined three different frequency ranges where we searched for non-variability. We used the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and the false-alarm probability (FAP) to analyse the cleaned data sets of 138 451 light curves. We then used log FAP &gt; -2 to define a star as "non-variable" in the ranges below 0.1 c/d, 0.1 to 2.0 c/d, and 2.0 to 25.0 c/d, respectively. Furthermore, we also calculated the standard deviation of the mean light curve to obtain another parameter. In total, we found 14 154 stars that fulfil the set</description>

      <title>New ACV variables discovered in the Zwicky Transient Facility survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manifestation of surface spots on magnetic chemically peculiar (mCP) stars is most commonly explained by the atomic diffusion theory, which requires a calm stellar atmosphere and only moderate rotation. While very successful and well described, this theory still needs to be revised and fine-tuned to the observations. Our study aims to enlarge the sample of known photometrically variable mCP stars (ACV variables) to pave the way for more robust and significant statistical studies. We derive accurate physical parameters for these objects and discuss our results in the framework of the atomic diffusion theory. We studied 1314 candidate ACV variables that were selected from the Zwicky Transient Factory catalogue of periodic variables based on light curve characteristics. We investigated these objects using photometric criteria, a colour-magnitude diagram, and spectroscopic data from the LAMOST and Gaia missions to confirm their status as ACV variables. We present a sample of 1232 new ACV variables, including information on distance from the Sun, mass, fractional age on the main sequence, fraction of the radius between the zero-age and terminal-age main sequence, and the equatorial velocity and its ratio to the critical velocity. Our results confirm that the employed selection process is highly effcient for detecting ACV variables. We have identified 38 stars with v(equ) in excess of 150 km/s (with extreme values up to 260 km/s). This challenges current theories that cannot explain the occurrence of such fast-rotating mCP stars.</description>

      <title>High-resolution spectroscopy of the variable hot post-AGB star LS 4331 (IRAS 17381-1616)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analysis of high-resolution ($R\sim48\,000$) optical spectrum of hot (B1Ibe) post-AGB star LS 4331 (IRAS 17381-1616) is presented. The detailed identification of the observed absorption and emission features in the wavelength range 3700-9200 \r{A} is carried out for the first time. From non-LTE analysis of absorption lines the atmospheric parameters and chemical composition of the star are derived. We estimate $T_{\rm eff}=20~900\pm500$ K, $\log g=2.57\pm0.08$, $V_r=-51.7\pm0.8$ km s$^{-1}$, $\xi_{\rm t}=24\pm4$ km s$^{-1}$ and $v \sin i=30\pm5$ km s$^{-1}$. A abundance analysis for C, N, O, Mg, Al, S and Si reveals that the N and O abundance is close to solar while metal underabundances relative to the solar value (i.e. [Mg/H] = -1.04 dex, [Al/H] = -1.20 dex, [Si/H] = -0.46 dex) are found. We conclude that LS 4331 is a high galactic latitude metal-poor and carbon deficient hot post-AGB star. The underabundance of carbon ([C/H]= -0.64 dex) is similar to that found in other hot post-AGB stars and indicates that the star's AGB phase of evolution was terminated before the third dredge up. From the nebular emission lines the plasma diagnostics are derived. The presence of nebular emission lines in the spectrum of LS 4331 indicates that the photoionization of circumstellar envelope has already started. The nebular parameters and expansion velocity of the nebula is derived. Using the Gaia DR3 distance the absolute luminosity of the star is derived and the star's position on the post-AGB evolutionary tracks suggests that its initial main sequence mass is about 1.2$M_{\odot}$. It is also reported that fast irregular brightness variations with an amplitude of up to 0.3 mag in $V$ band have been found in the star, typical of hot post-AGB objects.</description>

      <title>Exploring the generation and annihilation of three dimensional nulls through MHD simulations in initially chaotic magnetic field devoid of nulls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) magnetic nulls are abundant in the solar atmosphere, as been firmly established through contemporary observations. They are established to be important magnetic structures in, for example, jets and circular ribbon flares. While simulations and extrapolations support this, the mechanisms behind 3D null generation remain an open question. Recent magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations propose that magnetic reconnection is responsible for both generating and annihilating 3D nulls, a novel concept. However, these simulations began with initial magnetic fields already supporting pre-existing nulls, raising the question of whether magnetic reconnection can create nulls in fields initially devoid of them. Previously, this question was briefly explored in a simulation with an initial chaotic magnetic field. However, the study failed to precisely identify locations, topological degrees, and natures (spiral or radial) of nulls, and it approximated magnetic reconnection without fully tracking field line in time. In this paper these findings are revisited in light of recent advancements and tools used to locate and trace nulls, along with the tracing of field lines, through which the concept of generation/annihilation of 3D nulls from chaotic fields is established in a precise manner.</description>

      <title>Characteristics and Energy Flux Distributions of Decayless Transverse Oscillations Depending on Coronal Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lim et al. (2023) have recently proposed that the slope ($\delta$) of the power law distribution between the energy flux and oscillation frequency could determine whether high-frequency transverse oscillations give a dominant contribution to the heating ($\delta&lt;1$). A meta-analysis of decayless transverse oscillations revealed that high-frequency oscillations potentially play a key role in heating the solar corona. We aim to investigate how (whether) the distributions of the energy flux contained in transverse oscillations, and their slopes, depend on the coronal region in which the oscillation occurs. We analyse transverse oscillations from 41 quiet Sun (QS) loops and 22 active region (AR) loops observed by Solar Orbiter/Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (SolO/EUI) HRIEUV. The energy flux and energy are estimated using analysed oscillation parameters and loop properties, such as periods, displacement amplitudes, loop lengths, and minor radii of the loops. It is found that about 71% of QS loops and 86% of AR loops show decayless oscillations. We find that the amplitude does not change depending on different regions, but the difference in the period is more pronounced. Although the power law slope ($\delta=-1.79$) in AR is steeper than that ($\delta=-1.59$) in QS, both of them are significantly less than the critical slope of 1. Our statistical study demonstrates that high-frequency transverse oscillations can heat the QS. For ARs, the total energy flux is insufficient unless yet-unobserved oscillations with frequencies up to 0.17 Hz are present. Future EUI campaigns will be planned to confirm this.</description>

      <title>Probing the Heights and Depths of Y Dwarf Atmospheres: A Retrieval Analysis of the JWST Spectral Energy Distribution of WISE J035934.06$-$540154.6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an atmospheric retrieval analysis of the Y0 brown dwarf WISE J035934.06$-$540154.6 using the low-resolution 0.96--12 $\mu$m JWST spectrum presented in \citet{Beiler_2023}. We obtain volume number mixing ratios of the major gas-phase absorbers (H$_2$O, CH$_4$, CO, CO$_2$, PH$_3$, and H$_2$S) that are 3--5$\times$ more precise than previous work that used HST spectra. We also find an order-of-magnitude improvement in the precision of the retrieved thermal profile, a direct result of the broad wavelength coverage of the JWST data. We used the retrieved thermal profile and surface gravity to generate a grid of chemical forward models with varying metallicity, (C/O)$_\textrm{atm}$, and strengths of vertical mixing as encapsulated by the eddy diffusion coefficient $K_\textrm{zz}$. Comparison of the retrieved abundances with this grid of models suggests that the deep atmosphere of WISE 0359$-$54 shows signs of vigorous vertical mixing with $K_\textrm{zz}=10^9$ [cm$^{2}$ s$^{-1}$]. To test the sensitivity of these results to our 5-knot spline thermal profile model, we performed a second retrieval using the \citet{Madhusudhan_2009} thermal profile model. While the results of the two retrievals generally agree well, we do find differences between the retrieved values of mass and volume number mixing ratio of H$_2$S with fractional differences of the median values of $-$0.64 and $-$0.10, respectively. In addition, the 5-knot thermal profile is consistently warmer at pressure between 1 and 70 bar. Nevertheless, our results underscore the power that the broad-wavelength infrared spectra obtainable with the James Webb Space Telescope have to characterize the atmospheres of cool brown dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the nuclear models informed by PREX and CREX: a view from Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New measurements of the weak charge density distributions of $^{48}$Ca and $^{208}$Pb challenge existing nuclear models. In the post-PREX-CREX era, it is unclear if current models can simultaneously describe weak charge distributions along with accurate measurements of binding energy and charge radii. In this letter, we explore the parameter space of relativistic and non-relativistic models to study the differences between the form factors of the electric and weak charge distributions, $\Delta F=F_{ch}-F_{w}$, in $^{48}$Ca and $^{208}$Pb. We show, for the first time, the parts of the mean-field models that are the most important in determining the relative magnitude of the neutron skin in lead and calcium nuclei. We carefully disentangle the tension between the PREX/CREX constraints and the ability of the RMF and Skyrme models to accurately describe binding energies and charge radii. We find that the nuclear symmetry energy coefficient $S_\mathrm{V}$ and the isovector spin-orbit coefficient $b'_4$ play different roles in determining $\Delta F$ of $^{48}$Ca and $^{208}$Pb. Consequently, adjusting $S_\mathrm{V}$ or $b'_4$ shifts predicted $\Delta F$ values toward or away from PREX/CREX measurements. Additionally, $S_\mathrm{V}$ and the slope L are marginally correlated given the constraints of our Bayesian inference, allowing us to infer them separately from PREX and CREX data.</description>

      <title>The PLATO Mission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PLATO (PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars) is ESA's M3 mission designed to detect and characterise extrasolar planets and perform asteroseismic monitoring of a large number of stars. PLATO will detect small planets (down to &lt;2 R_(Earth)) around bright stars (&lt;11 mag), including terrestrial planets in the habitable zone of solar-like stars. With the complement of radial velocity observations from the ground, planets will be characterised for their radius, mass, and age with high accuracy (5 %, 10 %, 10 % for an Earth-Sun combination respectively). PLATO will provide us with a large-scale catalogue of well-characterised small planets up to intermediate orbital periods, relevant for a meaningful comparison to planet formation theories and to better understand planet evolution. It will make possible comparative exoplanetology to place our Solar System planets in a broader context. In parallel, PLATO will study (host) stars using asteroseismology, allowing us to determine the stellar properties with high accuracy, substantially enhancing our knowledge of stellar structure and evolution.
  The payload instrument consists of 26 cameras with 12cm aperture each. For at least four years, the mission will perform high-precision photometric measurements. Here we review the science objectives, present PLATO's target samples and fields, provide an overview of expected core science performance as well as a description of the instrument and the mission profile at the beginning of the serial production of the flight cameras. PLATO is scheduled for a launch date end 2026. This overview therefore provides a summary of the mission to the community in preparation of the upcoming operational phases.</description>

      <title>The size of the Milky Way galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The size of a galaxy is one of the fundamental parameters that reflects its growth and assembly history. Traditionally, the size of the Milky Way has been characterized by the scale length of the disk, based on the assumption of an exponential density profile. Earlier scale length measurements suggest the Milky Way is an overly compact galaxy, compared to similar galaxies of its mass. These size measurements, however, ignore the presence of the bulge, and the assumption of a single-exponential disk profile faces growing challenges from the recent observations. The half-light radius is an alternative size measurement that is independent of the galaxy density profile and has been widely used to quantify the size of external galaxies. Here we report the half-light radius of the Milky Way, derived from a new measurement of the age-resolved Galactic surface brightness profile in an unprecedentedly wide radial range from ${\rm R=0}$ to 17~kpc. We find a broken surface brightness profile with a nearly flat distribution between 3.5 and 7.5 kpc, which results in a half-light radius of 5.75$\pm$0.38 kpc, significantly larger than the scale-length inferred from the canonical single-exponential disk profile but in good consistency with local disk galaxies of similar mass. Because our density profile can be decomposed by stellar age and extrapolated backwards in time, we can also confirm that the size history of the Milky Way is broadly consistent with high-redshift galaxies but with systematically smaller size at each look back time. Our results suggest that the Milky Way is a typical disk galaxy regarding its size and has likely experienced inefficient secular size growth.</description>

      <title>Simulation Models for Exploring Magnetic Reconnection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations have played a critical role in the advancement of our knowledge of magnetic reconnection. However, due to the inherently multiscale nature of reconnection, it is impossible to simulate all physics at all scales. For this reason, a wide range of simulation methods have been crafted to study particular aspects and consequences of magnetic reconnection. This chapter reviews many of these methods, laying out critical assumptions, numerical techniques, and giving examples of scientific results. Plasma models described include magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), Hall MHD, Hybrid, kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC), kinetic Vlasov, Fluid models with embedded PIC, Fluid models with direct feedback from energetic populations, and the Rice Convection Model (RCM).</description>

      <title>On the age distribution of Classical Cepheids in the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of the positive correlation between age and Galactocentric distance seen in Galactic Classical Cepheids, which at first sight is counter-intuitive in the context of inside-out galaxy formation. To explain it, we use the Besan\c{c}on Galaxy Model and a simulation of star particles in the Galactic disc coupled with stellar evolutionary models. We then select Classical Cepheids from this simulation and test in qualitative terms which ingredients are necessary to find agreement with the observational data. We show that the observed age vs. Galactocentric radius distribution in the Milky Way is a direct consequence of the disc's negative radial metallicity gradient (and, depending on the set of stellar models used, a metallicity dependence of the instability strip). The interplay of the metallicity gradient and the metallicity dependence of the Cepheids' life-time in the instability strip results in a pronounced positive age-Galactocentric distance relation. This renders a reconstruction of the recent star-formation history based on Classical Cepheids unlikely. It also has important consequences on our interpretation of the observed scatter about the radial metallicity gradient measured with Galactic Classical Cepheids.</description>

      <title>Most nearby young star clusters formed in three massive complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efforts to unveil the structure of the local interstellar medium and its recent star formation history have spanned the past seventy years. Recent studies utilizing precise data from space astrometry missions have revealed nearby, newly formed star clusters with connected origins. Nonetheless, mapping young clusters across the entire sky back to their natal regions has been hindered by a lack of clusters with precise radial velocity data. Here we show that 155 out of 272 (57 percent) high-quality young clusters within one kiloparsec of the Sun arise from three distinct spatial volumes. This conclusion is based upon the analysis of data from the third Gaia release and other large-scale spectroscopic surveys. Currently dispersed throughout the Solar Neighborhood, their past positions over 30 Myr ago reveal that these families of clusters each formed in one of three compact, massive star-forming complexes. One of these families includes all of the young clusters near the Sun -- the Taurus and Sco-Cen star-forming complexes. We estimate that over 200 supernovae were produced from these families and argue that these clustered supernovae produced both the Local Bubble and the largest nearby supershell GSH 238+00+09, both of which are clearly visible in modern three-dimensional dust maps.</description>

      <title>A Deficit of Massive White Dwarfs in Gaia Astrometric Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The third data release of Gaia introduced a large catalog of astrometric binaries, out of which about 3,200 are likely main-sequence stars with a white-dwarf (WD) companion. These binaries are typically found with orbital separations of ~1 AU, a separation range that was largely unexplored due to observational challenges. Such systems are likely to have undergone a phase of stable mass transfer while the WD progenitor was on the asymptotic giant branch. Here we study the WD mass distribution of a volume-complete sample of binaries with K/M-dwarf primaries and orbital separations ~1 AU. We find that the number of massive WDs relative to the total number of WDs in these systems is smaller by an order of magnitude compared to their occurrence among single WDs in the field. One possible reason can be an implicit selection of the WD mass range if these are indeed post-stable-mass-transfer systems. Another reason can be the lack of merger products in our sample compared to the field, due to the relatively tight orbital separations of these systems. In addition, we find that about 14% of these systems have distant tertiary companions within 1 pc.</description>

      <title>Confronting sparse Gaia DR3 photometry with TESS for a sample of around 60,000 OBAF-type pulsators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gaia mission has delivered hundreds of thousands of variable star light curves in multiple wavelengths. Recent work demonstrates that these light curves can be used to identify (non-)radial pulsations in the OBAF-type stars, despite the irregular cadence and low light curve precision of order a few mmag. With the considerably more precise TESS photometry, we revisit these candidate pulsators to conclusively ascertain the nature of their variability. We seek to re-classify the Gaia light curves with the first two years of TESS photometry for a sample of 58,970 p- and g- mode pulsators, encompassing gamma Dor, delta Scuti, SPB, and beta Cep variables. We also supply four new catalogues containing the confirmed pulsators, along with their dominant and secondary pulsation frequencies, the number of independent mode frequencies, and a ranking according to their usefulness for future asteroseismic ensemble analysis. We find that the Gaia photometry is exceptionally accurate for detecting the dominant and secondary frequencies, reaching approximately 80% accuracy in frequency for p- and g-mode pulsators. The majority of Gaia classifications are consistent with the classifications from the TESS data, illustrating the power of the low-cadence Gaia photometry for pulsation studies. We find that the sample of g-mode pulsators forms a continuous group of variable stars along the main sequence across B, A, and F spectral types, implying that the mode excitation mechanisms for all these pulsators need to be updated with improved physics. Finally, we provide a rank-ordered table of pulsators according to their asteroseismic potential for follow-up studies. Our catalogue offers a major increase in the number of confirmed gravity-mode pulsators with an identified dominant mode suitable for follow-up TESS ensemble asteroseismology of such stars.</description>

Abstract: Proton-$\gamma$ coincidences from $(\mathrm{d},\mathrm{p})$ reactions between a $^{66}\mathrm{Ni}$ beam and a deuterated polyethylene target have been analyzed with the inverse-Oslo method to find the nuclear level density (NLD) and $\gamma$-ray strength function ($\gamma$SF) of $^{67}\mathrm{Ni}$. The $^{66}\mathrm{Ni}(\mathrm{n},\gamma)$ capture cross section has been calculated using the Hauser-Feshbach model in TALYS using the measured NLD and $\gamma$SF as constraints. The results confirm that the $^{66}\mathrm{Ni}(\mathrm{n},\gamma)$ reaction acts as a bottleneck when relying on one-zone nucleosynthesis calculations. However, the impact of this reaction is strongly damped in multi-zone low-metallicity AGB stellar models experiencing i-process nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Nuclear mass table in deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum, II: Even-$Z$ nuclei</title>

Abstract: The mass table in the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc) with the PC-PK1 density functional has been established for even-$Z$ nuclei with $8\le Z\le120$, extended from the previous work for even-even nuclei [Zhang $\it{et.~al.}$ (DRHBc Mass Table Collaboration), At. Data Nucl. Data Tables 144, 101488 (2022)]. The calculated binding energies, two-nucleon and one-neutron separation energies, root-mean-square (rms) radii of neutron, proton, matter, and charge distributions, quadrupole deformations, and neutron and proton Fermi surfaces are tabulated and compared with available experimental data. A total of 4829 even-$Z$ nuclei are predicted to be bound, with an rms deviation of 1.477 MeV from the 1244 mass data. Good agreement with the available experimental odd-even mass differences, $\alpha$ decay energies, and charge radii is also achieved. The description accuracy for nuclear masses and nucleon separation energies as well as the prediction for drip lines is compared with the results obtained from other relativistic and nonrelativistic density functional. The comparison shows that the DRHBc theory with PC-PK1 provides an excellent microscopic description for the masses of even-$Z$ nuclei. The systematics of the nucleon separation energies, odd-even mass differences, pairing energies, two-nucleon gaps, $\alpha$ decay energies, rms radii, quadrupole deformations, potential energy curves, neutron density distributions, and neutron mean-field potentials are discussed.</description>

      <title>WST -- Widefield Spectroscopic Telescope: Motivation, science drivers and top-level requirements for a new dedicated facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the wide-field spectroscopic survey telescope (WST) project. WST is a 12-metre wide-field spectroscopic survey telescope with simultaneous operation of a large field-of-view (3 sq. degree), high-multiplex (20,000) multi-object spectrograph (MOS), with both a low and high-resolution modes, and a giant 3x3 arcmin2 integral field spectrograph (IFS). In scientific capability, these specifications place WST far ahead of existing and planned facilities. In only 5 years of operation, the MOS would target 250 million galaxies and 25 million stars at low spectral resolution, plus 2 million stars at high resolution. Without need for pre-imaged targets, the IFS would deliver 4 billion spectra offering many serendipitous discoveries. Given the current investment in deep imaging surveys and noting the diagnostic power of spectroscopy, WST will fill a crucial gap in astronomical capability and work in synergy with future ground and space-based facilities. We show how it can address outstanding scientific questions in the areas of cosmology; galaxy assembly, evolution, and enrichment, including our own Milky Way; the origin of stars and planets; and time domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. WST's uniquely rich dataset may yield unforeseen discoveries in many of these areas. The telescope and instruments are designed as an integrated system and will mostly use existing technology, with the aim to minimise the carbon footprint and environmental impact. We will propose WST as the next European Southern Observatory (ESO) project after completion of the 39-metre ELT.</description>
