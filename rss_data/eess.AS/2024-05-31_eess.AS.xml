      <title>Gaussian Flow Bridges for Audio Domain Transfer with Unpaired Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio domain transfer is the process of modifying audio signals to match characteristics of a different domain, while retaining the original content. This paper investigates the potential of Gaussian Flow Bridges, an emerging approach in generative modeling, for this problem. The presented framework addresses the transport problem across different distributions of audio signals through the implementation of a series of two deterministic probability flows. The proposed framework facilitates manipulation of the target distribution properties through a continuous control variable, which defines a certain aspect of the target domain. Notably, this approach does not rely on paired examples for training. To address identified challenges on maintaining the speech content consistent, we recommend a training strategy that incorporates chunk-based minibatch Optimal Transport couplings of data samples and noise. Comparing our unsupervised method with established baselines, we find competitive performance in tasks of reverberation and distortion manipulation. Despite encoutering limitations, the intriguing results obtained in this study underscore potential for further exploration.</description>

      <title>1st Place Solution to Odyssey Emotion Recognition Challenge Task1: Tackling Class Imbalance Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech emotion recognition is a challenging classification task with natural emotional speech, especially when the distribution of emotion types is imbalanced in the training and test data. In this case, it is more difficult for a model to learn to separate minority classes, resulting in those sometimes being ignored or frequently misclassified. Previous work has utilised class weighted loss for training, but problems remain as it sometimes causes over-fitting for minor classes or under-fitting for major classes. This paper presents the system developed by a multi-site team for the participation in the Odyssey 2024 Emotion Recognition Challenge Track-1. The challenge data has the aforementioned properties and therefore the presented systems aimed to tackle these issues, by introducing focal loss in optimisation when applying class weighted loss. Specifically, the focal loss is further weighted by prior-based class weights. Experimental results show that combining these two approaches brings better overall performance, by sacrificing performance on major classes. The system further employs a majority voting strategy to combine the outputs of an ensemble of 7 models. The models are trained independently, using different acoustic features and loss functions - with the aim to have different properties for different data. Hence these models show different performance preferences on major classes and minor classes. The ensemble system output obtained the best performance in the challenge, ranking top-1 among 68 submissions. It also outperformed all single models in our set. On the Odyssey 2024 Emotion Recognition Challenge Task-1 data the system obtained a Macro-F1 score of 35.69% and an accuracy of 37.32%.</description>

      <title>Sonos Voice Control Bias Assessment Dataset: A Methodology for Demographic Bias Assessment in Voice Assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works demonstrate that voice assistants do not perform equally well for everyone, but research on demographic robustness of speech technologies is still scarce. This is mainly due to the rarity of large datasets with controlled demographic tags. This paper introduces the Sonos Voice Control Bias Assessment Dataset, an open dataset composed of voice assistant requests for North American English in the music domain (1,038 speakers, 166 hours, 170k audio samples, with 9,040 unique labelled transcripts) with a controlled demographic diversity (gender, age, dialectal region and ethnicity). We also release a statistical demographic bias assessment methodology, at the univariate and multivariate levels, tailored to this specific use case and leveraging spoken language understanding metrics rather than transcription accuracy, which we believe is a better proxy for user experience. To demonstrate the capabilities of this dataset and statistical method to detect demographic bias, we consider a pair of state-of-the-art Automatic Speech Recognition and Spoken Language Understanding models. Results show statistically significant differences in performance across age, dialectal region and ethnicity. Multivariate tests are crucial to shed light on mixed effects between dialectal region, gender and age.</description>

      <title>Luganda Speech Intent Recognition for IoT Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has generated massive interest in voice-controlled smart homes. While many voice-controlled smart home systems are designed to understand and support widely spoken languages like English, speakers of low-resource languages like Luganda may need more support. This research project aimed to develop a Luganda speech intent classification system for IoT applications to integrate local languages into smart home environments. The project uses hardware components such as Raspberry Pi, Wio Terminal, and ESP32 nodes as microcontrollers. The Raspberry Pi processes Luganda voice commands, the Wio Terminal is a display device, and the ESP32 nodes control the IoT devices. The ultimate objective of this work was to enable voice control using Luganda, which was accomplished through a natural language processing (NLP) model deployed on the Raspberry Pi. The NLP model utilized Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) as acoustic features and a Convolutional Neural Network (Conv2D) architecture for speech intent classification. A dataset of Luganda voice commands was curated for this purpose and this has been made open-source. This work addresses the localization challenges and linguistic diversity in IoT applications by incorporating Luganda voice commands, enabling users to interact with smart home devices without English proficiency, especially in regions where local languages are predominant.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Assessment of Oral Reading Fluency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reading fluency assessment is a critical component of literacy programmes, serving to guide and monitor early education interventions. Given the resource intensive nature of the exercise when conducted by teachers, the development of automatic tools that can operate on audio recordings of oral reading is attractive as an objective and highly scalable solution. Multiple complex aspects such as accuracy, rate and expressiveness underlie human judgements of reading fluency. In this work, we investigate end-to-end modeling on a training dataset of children's audio recordings of story texts labeled by human experts. The pre-trained wav2vec2.0 model is adopted due its potential to alleviate the challenges from the limited amount of labeled data. We report the performance of a number of system variations on the relevant measures, and also probe the learned embeddings for lexical and acoustic-prosodic features known to be important to the perception of reading fluency.</description>

      <title>Explainable Attribute-Based Speaker Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a fully explainable approach to speaker verification (SV), a task that fundamentally relies on individual speaker characteristics. The opaque use of speaker attributes in current SV systems raises concerns of trust. Addressing this, we propose an attribute-based explainable SV system that identifies speakers by comparing personal attributes such as gender, nationality, and age extracted automatically from voice recordings. We believe this approach better aligns with human reasoning, making it more understandable than traditional methods. Evaluated on the Voxceleb1 test set, the best performance of our system is comparable with the ground truth established when using all correct attributes, proving its efficacy. Whilst our approach sacrifices some performance compared to non-explainable methods, we believe that it moves us closer to the goal of transparent, interpretable AI and lays the groundwork for future enhancements through attribute expansion.</description>

      <title>Spectral Mapping of Singing Voices: U-Net-Assisted Vocal Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Separating vocal elements from musical tracks is a longstanding challenge in audio signal processing. This study tackles the distinct separation of vocal components from musical spectrograms. We employ the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to extract audio waves into detailed frequency-time spectrograms, utilizing the benchmark MUSDB18 dataset for music separation. Subsequently, we implement a UNet neural network to segment the spectrogram image, aiming to delineate and extract singing voice components accurately. We achieved noteworthy results in audio source separation using of our U-Net-based models. The combination of frequency-axis normalization with Min/Max scaling and the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) loss function achieved the highest Source-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR) of 7.1 dB, indicating a high level of accuracy in preserving the quality of the original signal during separation. This setup also recorded impressive Source-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) and Source-to-Artifact Ratio (SAR) scores of 25.2 dB and 7.2 dB, respectively. These values significantly outperformed other configurations, particularly those using Quantile-based normalization or a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function.

      <title>Fill in the Gap! Combining Self-supervised Representation Learning with Neural Audio Synthesis for Speech Inpainting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most speech self-supervised learning (SSL) models are trained with a pretext task which consists in predicting missing parts of the input signal, either future segments (causal prediction) or segments masked anywhere within the input (non-causal prediction). Learned speech representations can then be efficiently transferred to downstream tasks (e.g., automatic speech or speaker recognition). In the present study, we investigate the use of a speech SSL model for speech inpainting, that is reconstructing a missing portion of a speech signal from its surrounding context, i.e., fulfilling a downstream task that is very similar to the pretext task. To that purpose, we combine an SSL encoder, namely HuBERT, with a neural vocoder, namely HiFiGAN, playing the role of a decoder. In particular, we propose two solutions to match the HuBERT output with the HiFiGAN input, by freezing one and fine-tuning the other, and vice versa. Performance of both approaches was assessed in single- and multi-speaker settings, for both informed and blind inpainting configurations (i.e., the position of the mask is known or unknown, respectively), with different objective metrics and a perceptual evaluation. Performances show that if both solutions allow to correctly reconstruct signal portions up to the size of 200ms (and even 400ms in some cases), fine-tuning the SSL encoder provides a more accurate signal reconstruction in the single-speaker setting case, while freezing it (and training the neural vocoder instead) is a better strategy when dealing with multi-speaker data.</description>

      <title>Iterative Feature Boosting for Explainable Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In speech emotion recognition (SER), using predefined features without considering their practical importance may lead to high dimensional datasets, including redundant and irrelevant information. Consequently, high-dimensional learning often results in decreasing model accuracy while increasing computational complexity. Our work underlines the importance of carefully considering and analyzing features in order to build efficient SER systems. We present a new supervised SER method based on an efficient feature engineering approach. We pay particular attention to the explainability of results to evaluate feature relevance and refine feature sets. This is performed iteratively through feature evaluation loop, using Shapley values to boost feature selection and improve overall framework performance. Our approach allows thus to balance the benefits between model performance and transparency. The proposed method outperforms human-level performance (HLP) and state-of-the-art machine learning methods in emotion recognition on the TESS dataset.</description>

      <title>RapVerse: Coherent Vocals and Whole-Body Motions Generations from Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a challenging task for simultaneously generating 3D holistic body motions and singing vocals directly from textual lyrics inputs, advancing beyond existing works that typically address these two modalities in isolation. To facilitate this, we first collect the RapVerse dataset, a large dataset containing synchronous rapping vocals, lyrics, and high-quality 3D holistic body meshes. With the RapVerse dataset, we investigate the extent to which scaling autoregressive multimodal transformers across language, audio, and motion can enhance the coherent and realistic generation of vocals and whole-body human motions. For modality unification, a vector-quantized variational autoencoder is employed to encode whole-body motion sequences into discrete motion tokens, while a vocal-to-unit model is leveraged to obtain quantized audio tokens preserving content, prosodic information, and singer identity. By jointly performing transformer modeling on these three modalities in a unified way, our framework ensures a seamless and realistic blend of vocals and human motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our unified generation framework not only produces coherent and realistic singing vocals alongside human motions directly from textual inputs but also rivals the performance of specialized single-modality generation systems, establishing new benchmarks for joint vocal-motion generation. The project page is available for research purposes at https://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/RapVerse.</description>

      <title>A Large-Scale Evaluation of Speech Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The foundation model paradigm leverages a shared foundation model to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for various tasks, requiring minimal downstream-specific modeling and data annotation. This approach has proven crucial in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, the speech processing community lacks a similar setup to explore the paradigm systematically. In this work, we establish the Speech processing Universal PERformance Benchmark (SUPERB) to study the effectiveness of the paradigm for speech. We propose a unified multi-tasking framework to address speech processing tasks in SUPERB using a frozen foundation model followed by task-specialized, lightweight prediction heads. Combining our results with community submissions, we verify that the foundation model paradigm is promising for speech, and our multi-tasking framework is simple yet effective, as the best-performing foundation model shows competitive generalizability across most SUPERB tasks. For reproducibility and extensibility, we have developed a long-term maintained platform that enables deterministic benchmarking, allows for result sharing via an online leaderboard, and promotes collaboration through a community-driven benchmark database to support new development cycles. Finally, we conduct a series of analyses to offer an in-depth understanding of SUPERB and speech foundation models, including information flows across tasks inside the models, the correctness of the weighted-sum benchmarking protocol and the statistical significance and robustness of the benchmark.</description>

      <title>Multi-View Spectrogram Transformer for Respiratory Sound Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09655v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have been applied to audio spectrograms for respiratory sound classification. Existing models often treat the spectrogram as a synthetic image while overlooking its physical characteristics. In this paper, a Multi-View Spectrogram Transformer (MVST) is proposed to embed different views of time-frequency characteristics into the vision transformer. Specifically, the proposed MVST splits the mel-spectrogram into different sized patches, representing the multi-view acoustic elements of a respiratory sound. These patches and positional embeddings are then fed into transformer encoders to extract the attentional information among patches through a self-attention mechanism. Finally, a gated fusion scheme is designed to automatically weigh the multi-view features to highlight the best one in a specific scenario. Experimental results on the ICBHI dataset demonstrate that the proposed MVST significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for classifying respiratory sounds.</description>

      <title>Advancing Large Language Models to Capture Varied Speaking Styles and Respond Properly in Spoken Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In spoken dialogue, even if two current turns are the same sentence, their responses might still differ when they are spoken in different styles. The spoken styles, containing paralinguistic and prosodic information, mark the most significant difference between text and speech modality. When using text-only LLMs to model spoken dialogue, text-only LLMs cannot give different responses based on the speaking style of the current turn. In this paper, we focus on enabling LLMs to listen to the speaking styles and respond properly. Our goal is to teach the LLM that "even if the sentences are identical if they are spoken in different styles, their corresponding responses might be different". Since there is no suitable dataset for achieving this goal, we collect a speech-to-speech dataset, StyleTalk, with the following desired characteristics: when two current speeches have the same content but are spoken in different styles, their responses will be different. To teach LLMs to understand and respond properly to the speaking styles, we propose the Spoken-LLM framework that can model the linguistic content and the speaking styles. We train Spoken-LLM using the StyleTalk dataset and devise a two-stage training pipeline to help the Spoken-LLM better learn the speaking styles. Based on extensive experiments, we show that Spoken-LLM outperforms text-only baselines and prior speech LLMs methods.</description>

      <title>Look Once to Hear: Target Speech Hearing with Noisy Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06289v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In crowded settings, the human brain can focus on speech from a target speaker, given prior knowledge of how they sound. We introduce a novel intelligent hearable system that achieves this capability, enabling target speech hearing to ignore all interfering speech and noise, but the target speaker. A naive approach is to require a clean speech example to enroll the target speaker. This is however not well aligned with the hearable application domain since obtaining a clean example is challenging in real world scenarios, creating a unique user interface problem. We present the first enrollment interface where the wearer looks at the target speaker for a few seconds to capture a single, short, highly noisy, binaural example of the target speaker. This noisy example is used for enrollment and subsequent speech extraction in the presence of interfering speakers and noise. Our system achieves a signal quality improvement of 7.01 dB using less than 5 seconds of noisy enrollment audio and can process 8 ms of audio chunks in 6.24 ms on an embedded CPU. Our user studies demonstrate generalization to real-world static and mobile speakers in previously unseen indoor and outdoor multipath environments. Finally, our enrollment interface for noisy examples does not cause performance degradation compared to clean examples, while being convenient and user-friendly. Taking a step back, this paper takes an important step towards enhancing the human auditory perception with artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures for speaker verification typically require more training data than ECAPA-TDNN. Therefore, recent work has generally been trained on VoxCeleb1&amp;2. We propose a backbone network based on self-attention, which can achieve competitive results when trained on VoxCeleb2 alone. The network alternates between neighborhood attention and global attention to capture local and global features, then aggregates features of different hierarchical levels, and finally performs attentive statistics pooling. Additionally, we employ a progressive channel fusion strategy to expand the receptive field in the channel dimension as the network deepens. We trained the proposed PCF-NAT model on VoxCeleb2 and evaluated it on VoxCeleb1 and the validation sets of VoxSRC. The EER and minDCF of the shallow PCF-NAT are on average more than 20% lower than those of similarly sized ECAPA-TDNN. Deep PCF-NAT achieves an EER lower than 0.5% on VoxCeleb1-O. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/ChenNan1996/PCF-NAT.</description>
