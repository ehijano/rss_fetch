      <title>Spectral densities from Euclidean-time lattice correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum field theories, spectral densities are directly related to relevant physical observables. In Lattice QCD, their non-perturbative extraction from first principles requires the Inverse Laplace transform of Euclidean-time correlation functions, a notorious ill-posed problem. Here we review our recent proposal [1,2] for a new strategy to perform this inversion both in the continuum and on the lattice, also suitable for smeared spectral densities, both in the continuum and in the discrete cases.</description>

      <title>Left-hand cut and the HAL QCD method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the left-hand cut (LHC) problem is treated in the HAL QCD method. For this purpose, we first consider the effect of the LHC to the scattering problem in non-relativistic quantum mechanics with potentials. We show that the $S$-matrix or the scattering phase shift obtained from the potential including the Yukawa term ($e^{- m_\pi r}/r$) with the infra-red (IR) cutoff $R$ is well-defined even for the complex momentum $k$ as long as $R$ is finite, and they are compared with those obtained by the analytic continuation without the IR cutoff. In the $R\to\infty$ limit, the phase shift approaches the result from the analytic continuation at ${\rm Im}\, k &lt; m_\pi/2$, while they differ at ${\rm Im}\, k &gt; m_\pi/2$, except $k= k_b$, where $k_b$ is the binding momentum. We also observe that $k_b$ can be correctly obtained even at finite but large $R$. Using knowledge obtained in the non-relativistic quantum mechanics, we present how we should treat the LHC in the HAL QCD potential method.</description>

      <title>Renormalisation Group Equations for 2+1 clover fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many lattice QCD simulations now have many lattice spacings available, and it is of interest to investigate how they scale. In this talk we first derive renormalisation group equations appropriate for 2+1 clover fermions. This is then used together with pion mass and gradient flow results at five lattice spacings to study scaling.</description>

      <title>CASK: A Gauge Covariant Transformer for Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Transformer neural network architecture specifically designed for lattice QCD, focusing on preserving the fundamental symmetries required in lattice gauge theory. The proposed architecture is gauge covariant/equivariant, ensuring it respects gauge symmetry on the lattice, and is also equivariant under spacetime symmetries such as rotations and translations on the lattice. A key feature of our approach lies in the attention matrix, which forms the core of the Transformer architecture. To preserve symmetries, we define the attention matrix using a Frobenius inner product between link variables and extended staples. This construction ensures that the attention matrix remains invariant under gauge transformations, thereby making the entire Transformer architecture covariant. We evaluated the performance of the gauge covariant Transformer in the context of self-learning HMC. Numerical experiments show that the proposed architecture achieves higher performance compared to the gauge covariant neural networks, demonstrating its potential to improve lattice QCD calculations.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic corrections to O($a^2$) effects in lattice QCD with unrooted Staggered quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the asymptotic lattice-spacing dependence $a^2[2b_0\bar{g}^2(1/a)]^{\hat{\gamma}_i}$ relevant for spectral quantities of lattice QCD, when using unrooted Staggered quarks. Without taking any effects from matching into account we find $\min_i\hat{\gamma}_i\approx -0.273, -0.301, -0.913, -2.614$ for $N_\mathrm{f}=0,4,8,12$ respectively. Common statements in the literature on the absence of mass-dimension~5 operators from the on-shell basis of the Symanzik Effective Field Theory action are being clarified for a description using strictly local tastes, here playing the role of continuum quark flavours. Potential impact of $\mathrm{O}(a)$ EOM-vanishing terms beyond spectral quantities is being discussed.</description>

      <title>Field-theoretical approach to neutral pion contribution to muon $g-2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hadronic light-by-light scattering induces a substantial contribution to the muon $g-2$ with present accuracy of its measurement. The effect caused by the neutral pion through this scattering on the muon $g-2$ has been scrutinized intensively by model calculation and lattice QCD simulation. All of those estimates have been done based on one formula, but it has one pathological aspect. The purpose of this article is to resolve such a pathology from a field-theoretical approach, i.e., by defining the effect in question as the neutral pion intermediate state contribution to the QCD vacuum expectation value of time-ordered product of four electromagnetic currents. It leads (1) the pion pole term corresponding to the imaginary part of the pion propagator $\frac{1}{q^2 - m_\pi^2 + \mathrm{i} \epsilon}$, (2) and no principle value term corresponding to its real part.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Transition of Non-Hermitian Systems using Variational Quantum Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The motivation for studying non-Hermitian systems and the role of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry is discussed. We investigate the use of a quantum algorithm to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, with applications to quantum phase transitions. We use a recently proposed variational algorithm. The systems studied are the transverse Ising model with both a purely real and a purely complex transverse field.</description>

      <title>Goldstone bosons at non-zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking in quantum field theories at non-zero temperature still holds fundamental open questions, in particular what happens to vacuum Goldstone bosons when the temperature is increased. By investigating a complex scalar field theory on the lattice we demonstrate that Goldstone bosons at non-zero temperature behave like screened massless particle-like excitations, so-called thermoparticles, which continue to exist even in the symmetry-restored phase of the theory. We provide non-perturbative evidence for the functional form of the Goldstone mode's dissipative behaviour, which is distinct from standard perturbative expectations, and determine its corresponding spectral properties.</description>

      <title>Persistence of charmed hadrons in QGP from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the nature of charm degrees of freedom near the chiral crossover based on lattice QCD calculations of the second and fourth-order cumulants of charm fluctuations, and their correlations with net baryon number, electric charge, and strangeness fluctuations. We show that below the chiral crossover temperature, $T_{pc}$, the thermodynamics of charm can be very well understood in terms of charmed hadrons. We present evidence that above $T_{pc}$, however, charm quark-like excitations emerge as new degrees of freedom contributing to the partial charm pressure. Nonetheless, up to temperatures as high as 175 MeV, charmed hadron-like excitations significantly contribute to the partial charm pressure.</description>

      <title>$\eta$ invariant of massive Wilson Dirac operator and the index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the lattice index theorem in the perspective of $K$-theory. The standard definition given by the overlap Dirac operator equals to the $\eta$ invariant of the Wilson Dirac operator with a negative mass. This equality is not coincidental but reflects a mathematically profound significance known as the suspension isomorphism of $K$-groups. Specifically, we identify the Wilson Dirac operator as an element of the $K^1$ group, which is characterized by the $\eta$-invariant. Furthermore, we prove that, at sufficiently small but finite lattice spacings, this $\eta$-invariant equals to the index of the continuum Dirac operator. Our results indicate that the Ginsparg-Wilson relation and the associated exact chiral symmetry are not essential for understanding gauge field topology in lattice gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Symmetry of screening masses of mesons in two-flavor lattice QCD at high temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12675v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate spatial two-point correlation functions of mesonic operators in two-flavor lattice QCD at high temperatures. The simulated temperatures over the range $T \in [147, 330]$ MeV, where the critical temperature is estimated around 165 MeV. To ensure a good control of the chiral symmetry we employ the M\"obius domain-wall fermion action for two degenerate flavors of quarks. With a lattice cut off $a^{-1}\sim 2.6$ GeV, the residual mass is reduced to 0.14 MeV. With the energy spectrum obtained from the screening mass at incremental values of the temperature range, we examine the $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ chiral symmetry, the anomalous axial $U(1)$ as well as an enhanced symmetry which exchanges the spin degrees of freedom. We also study how the data approaches the perturbative prediction given by twice the Matsubara frequency of free quarks.</description>
