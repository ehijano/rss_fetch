      <title>A Quadratic Vertex Kernel and a Subexponential Algorithm for Subset-FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Subset Feedback Arc Set in Tournaments, Subset-FAST problem we are given as input a tournament $T$ with a vertex set $V(T)$ and an arc set $A(T)$, along with a terminal set $S \subseteq V(T)$, and an integer $ k$. The objective is to determine whether there exists a set $ F \subseteq A(T) $ with $|F| \leq k$ such that the resulting graph $T-F $ contains no cycle that includes any vertex of $S$. When $S=V(T)$ this is the classic Feedback Arc Set in Tournaments (FAST) problem. We obtain the first polynomial kernel for this problem parameterized by the solution size. More precisely, we obtain an algorithm that, given an input instance $(T, S, k)$, produces an equivalent instance $(T',S',k')$ with $k'\leq k$ and $V(T')=O(k^2)$.
  It was known that FAST admits a simple quadratic vertex kernel and a non-trivial linear vertex kernel. However, no such kernel was previously known for Subset-FAST. Our kernel employs variants of the most well-known reduction rules for FAST and introduces two new reduction rules to identify irrelevant vertices. As a result of our kernelization, we also obtain the first sub-exponential time FPT algorithm for Subset-FAST.</description>

      <title>Forming Coordinated Teams that Balance Task Coverage and Expert Workload</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a new formulation of the team-formation problem, where the goal is to form teams to work on a given set of tasks requiring different skills. Deviating from the classic problem setting where one is asking to cover all skills of each given task, we aim to cover as many skills as possible while also trying to minimize the maximum workload among the experts. We do this by combining penalization terms for the coverage and load constraints into one objective. We call the corresponding assignment problem $\texttt{Balanced-Coverage}$, and show that it is NP-hard. We also consider a variant of this problem, where the experts are organized into a graph, which encodes how well they work together. Utilizing such a coordination graph, we aim to find teams to assign to tasks such that each team's radius does not exceed a given threshold. We refer to this problem as $\texttt{Network-Balanced-Coverage}$. We develop a generic template algorithm for approximating both problems in polynomial time, and we show that our template algorithm for $\texttt{Balanced-Coverage}$ has provable guarantees. We describe a set of computational speedups that we can apply to our algorithms and make them scale for reasonably large datasets. From the practical point of view, we demonstrate how to efficiently tune the two parts of the objective and tailor their importance to a particular application. Our experiments with a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate the utility of our problem formulation as well as the efficiency of our algorithms in practice.</description>

      <title>Characterizing optimal monitoring edge-geodetic sets for some structured graph classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, a set $S\subseteq V$ is said to be a monitoring edge-geodetic set if the deletion of any edge in the graph results in a change in the distance between at least one pair of vertices in $S$. The minimum size of such a set in $G$ is called the monitoring edge-geodetic number of $G$ and is denoted by $meg(G)$.
  In this work, we compute the monitoring edge-geodetic number efficiently for the following graph classes: distance-hereditary graphs, $P_4$-sparse graphs, bipartite permutation graphs, and strongly chordal graphs. The algorithms follow from structural characterizations of the optimal monitoring edge-geodetic sets for these graph classes in terms of \emph{mandatory vertices} (those that need to be in every solution). This extends previous results from the literature for cographs, interval graphs and block graphs.</description>

      <title>Theoretical and Computational Approaches to Determining Sets of Orders for $(k,g)$-Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cage Problem requires for a given pair $k \geq 3, g \geq 3$ of integers the determination of the order of a smallest $k$-regular graph of girth $g$. We address a more general version of this problem and look for the $(k,g)$-spectrum of orders of $(k,g)$-graphs: the (infinite) list of all orders of $(k,g)$-graphs. By establishing these spectra we aim to gain a better understanding of the structure and properties of $(k,g)$-graphs and hope to use the acquired knowledge in both determining new orders of smallest $k$-regular graphs of girth $g$ as well as developing a set of tools suitable for constructions of extremal graphs with additional requirements. We combine theoretical results with computer-based searches, and determine or determine up to a finite list of unresolved cases the $(k,g)$-spectra for parameter pairs for which the orders of the corresponding cages have already been established.</description>

      <title>Near Triple Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce near triple arrays as binary row-column designs with at most two consecutive values for the replication numbers of symbols, for the intersection sizes of pairs of rows, pairs of columns and pairs of a row and a column. Near triple arrays form a common generalization of such well-studied classes of designs as triple arrays, (near) Youden rectangles and Latin squares.
  We enumerate near triple arrays for a range of small parameter sets and show that they exist in the vast majority of the cases considered. As a byproduct, we obtain the first complete enumerations of $6 \times 10$ triple arrays on $15$ symbols, $7 \times 8$ triple arrays on $14$ symbols and $5 \times 16$ triple arrays on $20$ symbols.
  Next, we give several constructions for families of near triple arrays, and e.g. show that near triple arrays with 3 rows and at least 6 columns exist for any number of symbols. Finally, we investigate a duality between row and column intersection sizes of a row-column design, and covering numbers for pairs of symbols by rows and columns. These duality results are used to obtain necessary conditions for the existence of near triple arrays. This duality also provides a new unified approach to earlier results on triple arrays and balanced grids.</description>

      <title>Playing Sudoku on random 3-regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sudoku number $s(G)$ of graph $G$ with chromatic number $\chi(G)$ is the smallest partial $\chi(G)$-colouring of $G$ that determines a unique $\chi(G)$-colouring of the entire graph. We show that the Sudoku number of the random $3$-regular graph $\mathcal{G}_{n,3}$ satisfies $s(\mathcal{G}_{n,3}) \leq (1+o(1))\frac{n}{3}$ asymptotically almost surely. We prove this by analyzing an algorithm which $3$-colours $\mathcal{G}_{n,3}$ in a way that produces many locally forced vertices, i.e., vertices which see two distinct colours among their neighbours. The intricacies of the algorithm present some challenges for the analysis, and to overcome these we use a non-standard application of Wormald's differential equations method that incorporates tools from finite Markov chains.</description>

      <title>Geometric realizations of dichotomous ordinal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A dichotomous ordinal graph consists of an undirected graph with a partition of the edges into short and long edges. A geometric realization of a dichotomous ordinal graph $G$ in a metric space $X$ is a drawing of $G$ in $X$ in which every long edge is strictly longer than every short edge. We call a graph $G$ pandichotomous in $X$ if $G$ admits a geometric realization in $X$ for every partition of its edge set into short and long edges. We exhibit a very close relationship between the degeneracy of a graph $G$ and its pandichotomic Euclidean or spherical dimension, that is, the smallest dimension $k$ such that $G$ is pandichotomous in $\mathbb{R}^k$ or the sphere $\mathbb{S}^k$, respectively. First, every $d$-degenerate graph is pandichotomous in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ and these bounds are tight for the sphere and for $\mathbb{R}^2$ and almost tight for $\mathbb{R}^d$, for $d\ge 3$. Second, every $n$-vertex graph that is pandichotomous in $\mathbb{R}^k$ has at most $\mu kn$ edges, for some absolute constant $\mu&lt;7.23$. This shows that the pandichotomic Euclidean dimension of any graph is linearly tied to its degeneracy and in the special cases $k\in \{1,2\}$ resolves open problems posed by Alam, Kobourov, Pupyrev, and Toeniskoetter. Further, we characterize which complete bipartite graphs are pandichotomous in $\mathbb{R}^2$: These are exactly the $K_{m,n}$ with $m\le 3$ or $m=4$ and $n\le 6$. For general bipartite graphs, we can guarantee realizations in $\mathbb{R}^2$ if the short or the long subgraph is constrained: namely if the short subgraph is outerplanar or a subgraph of a rectangular grid, or if the long subgraph forms a caterpillar.</description>

      <title>On the expressive power of $2$-edge-colourings of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finite set of $2$-edge-coloured graphs $\mathcal F$ and a hereditary property of graphs $\mathcal{P}$, we say that $\mathcal F$ expresses $\mathcal{P}$ if a graph $G$ has the property $\mathcal{P}$ if and only if it admits a $2$-edge-colouring not having any graph in $\mathcal F$ as an induced $2$-edge-coloured subgraph. We show that certain classic hereditary classes are expressible by some set of $2$-edge-coloured graphs on three vertices. We then initiate a systematic study of the following problem. Given a finite set of $2$-edge-coloured graphs $\mathcal F$, structurally characterize the hereditary property expressed by $\mathcal F$. In our main results we describe all hereditary properties expressed by $\mathcal F$ when $\mathcal F$ consists of 2-edge-coloured graphs on three vertices and (1) patterns have at most two edges, or (2) $\mathcal F$ consists of both monochromatic paths and a set of coloured triangles.
  On the algorithmic side, we consider the $\mathcal F$-free colouring problem, i.e., deciding if an input graph admits an $\mathcal F$-free $2$-edge-colouring. It follows from our structural characterizations, that for all sets considered in (1) and (2) the $\mathcal F$-free colouring problem is solvable in polynomial time. We complement these tractability results with a uniform reduction to boolean constraint satisfaction problems which yield polynomial-time algorithms that recognize most graph classes expressible by a set $\mathcal F$ of $2$-edge-coloured graphs on at most three vertices. Finally, we exhibit some sets $\mathcal F$ such that the $\mathcal F$-free colouring problem is NP-complete.</description>

      <title>A new density limit for unanimity in majority dynamics on random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Majority dynamics is a process on a simple, undirected graph $G$ with an initial Red/Blue color for every vertex of $G$. Each day, each vertex updates its color following the majority among its neighbors, using its previous color for tie-breaking. The dynamics achieves \textit{unanimity} if every vertex has the same color after finitely many days, and such color is said to \textit{win}.
  When $G$ is a $G(n,p)$ random graph, L. Tran and Vu (2019) found a codition in terms of $p$ and the initial difference $2\Delta$ beteween the sizes of the Red and Blue camps, such that unanimity is achieved with probability arbitrarily close to 1. They showed that if $p\Delta^2 \gg1 $, $p\Delta \geq 100$, and $p\geq (1+\varepsilon) n^{-1}\log n$ for a positive constant $\varepsilon$, then unanimity occurs with probability $1 - o(1)$. If $p$ is not extremely small, namely $p &gt; \log^{-1/16} n $, then Sah and Sawhney (2022) showed that the condition $p\Delta^2 \gg 1$ is sufficient.
  If $n^{-1}\log^2 n \ll p \ll n^{-1/2}\log^{1/4} n$, we show that $p^{3/2}\Delta \gg n^{-1/2}\log n$ is enough. Since this condition holds if $p\Delta \geq 100$ for $p$ in this range, this is an improvement of Tran's and Vu's result. For the closely related problem of finding the optimal condition for $p$ to achieve unanimity when the initial coloring is chosen uniformly at random among all possible Red/Blue assignments, our result implies a new lower bound $p \gg n^{-2/3}\log^{2/3} n$, which improves upon the previous bound of $n^{-3/5}\log n$ by Chakraborti, Kim, Lee and T. Tran (2021).</description>

      <title>Concentration via Metastable Mixing, with Applications to the Supercritical Exponential Random Graph Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a folklore belief that metastable wells in low-temperature statistical mechanics models exhibit high-temperature behavior. We prove a rigorous version of this phenomenon in the setting of the exponential random graph model (ERGM) through the lens of concentration of measure. To do this, we first present a new general result deriving concentration inequalities in a metastable well from the metastable mixing of a Markov chain with the appropriate stationary distribution, extending a result of Chatterjee [Cha05] which is suited for more traditional forms of global mixing. We then apply this result to the supercritical (low-temperature) ERGM which was recently proven to exhibit metastable mixing by Bresler, Nagaraj, and Nichani [BNN24], and obtain a novel concentration inequality for Lipschitz observables of the supercritical ERGM conditioned on a large metastable well, answering a question posed by [BNN24]. This extends a result of Ganguly and Nam [GN24] from the subcritical (high-temperature) regime to a metastable well in the supercritical regime, and we are also able to extend the applications of their concentration inequality to these metastable wells. Namely, we obtain an upper bound on the Wasserstein distance between the ERGM conditioned on a metastable well and an appropriate Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model, as well as derive a central limit theorem for the count of edges in certain small subcollections of possible edges. Finally, to supplement the mathematical content of the article, we also discuss the results of what appears to be the first simulation study of a metastable well in the supercritical ERGM.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Scale-free Graph Generator under Limited Resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph generation is one of the most challenging tasks in recent years, and its core is to learn the ground truth distribution hiding in the training data. However, training data may not be available due to security concerns or unaffordable costs, which severely blows the learning models, especially the deep generative models. The dilemma leads us to rethink non-learned generation methods based on graph invariant features. Based on the observation of scale-free property, we propose a hierarchical scale-free graph generation algorithm. Specifically, we design a two-stage generation strategy. In the first stage, we sample multiple anchor nodes to further guide the formation of substructures, splitting the initial node set into multiple ones. Next, we progressively generate edges by sampling nodes through a degree mixing distribution, adjusting the tolerance towards exotic structures via two thresholds. We provide theoretical guarantees for hierarchical generation and verify the effectiveness of our method under 12 datasets of three categories. Experimental results show that our method fits the ground truth distribution better than various generation strategies and other distribution observations.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hofstadter functions $G$, $H$ and beyond: numeration systems and discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12615v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hofstadter's $G$ function is recursively defined via $G(0)=0$ and then $G(n)=n-G(G(n-1))$. Following Hofstadter, a family $(F_k)$ of similar functions is obtained by varying the number $k$ of nested recursive calls in this equation. We study here some Fibonacci-like sequences that are deeply connected with these functions $F_k$. In particular, the Zeckendorf theorem can be adapted to provide digital expansions via sums of terms of these sequences. On these digital expansions, the functions $F_k$ are acting as right shifts of the digits. These Fibonacci-like sequences can be expressed in terms of zeros of the polynomial $X^k{-}X^{k-1}{-}1$. Considering now the discrepancy of each function $F_k$, i.e., the maximal distance between $F_k$ and its linear equivalent, we retrieve the fact that this discrepancy is finite exactly when $k \le 4$. Thanks to that, we solve two twenty-year-old OEIS conjectures stating how close the functions $F_3$ and $F_4$ are from the integer parts of their linear equivalents. Moreover we establish that $F_k$ can coincide exactly with such an integer part only when $k\le 2$, while $F_k$ is almost additive exactly when $k \le 4$. Finally, a nice fractal shape a la Rauzy has been encountered when investigating the discrepancy of $F_3$. Almost all this article has been formalized and verified in the Coq/Rocq proof assistant.</description>

Abstract: The inductive bias of a graph neural network (GNN) is largely encoded in its specified graph. Latent graph inference relies on latent geometric representations to dynamically rewire or infer a GNN's graph to maximize the GNN's predictive downstream performance, but it lacks solid theoretical foundations in terms of embedding-based representation guarantees. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a trainable deep learning architecture, coined neural snowflake, that can adaptively implement fractal-like metrics on $\mathbb{R}^d$. We prove that any given finite weights graph can be isometrically embedded by a standard MLP encoder. Furthermore, when the latent graph can be represented in the feature space of a sufficiently regular kernel, we show that the combined neural snowflake and MLP encoder do not succumb to the curse of dimensionality by using only a low-degree polynomial number of parameters in the number of nodes. This implementation enables a low-dimensional isometric embedding of the latent graph. We conduct synthetic experiments to demonstrate the superior metric learning capabilities of neural snowflakes when compared to more familiar spaces like Euclidean space. Additionally, we carry out latent graph inference experiments on graph benchmarks. Consistently, the neural snowflake model achieves predictive performance that either matches or surpasses that of the state-of-the-art latent graph inference models. Importantly, this performance improvement is achieved without requiring random search for optimal latent geometry. Instead, the neural snowflake model achieves this enhancement in a differentiable manner.</description>

      <title>Linear Recurrence Sequence Automata and the Addition of Abstract Numeration Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Abstract numeration systems encode natural numbers using radix ordered words of an infinite regular language and linear recurrence sequences play a key role in their valuation. Sequence automata, which are deterministic finite automata with an additional linear recurrence sequence on each transition, are introduced to compute various $\ZZ$-rational non commutating formal series in abstract numeration systems. Under certain Pisot conditions on the recurrence sequences, the support of these series is regular. This property can be leveraged to derive various synchronized relations including a deterministic finite automaton that computes the addition relation of various Dumont-Thomas numeration systems and regular finite automata converting between various numeration systems. A practical implementation for Walnut is provided.</description>

      <title>Neural Spacetimes for DAG Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a class of trainable deep learning-based geometries called Neural Spacetimes (NSTs), which can universally represent nodes in weighted directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) as events in a spacetime manifold. While most works in the literature focus on undirected graph representation learning or causality embedding separately, our differentiable geometry can encode both graph edge weights in its spatial dimensions and causality in the form of edge directionality in its temporal dimensions. We use a product manifold that combines a quasi-metric (for space) and a partial order (for time). NSTs are implemented as three neural networks trained in an end-to-end manner: an embedding network, which learns to optimize the location of nodes as events in the spacetime manifold, and two other networks that optimize the space and time geometries in parallel, which we call a neural (quasi-)metric and a neural partial order, respectively. The latter two networks leverage recent ideas at the intersection of fractal geometry and deep learning to shape the geometry of the representation space in a data-driven fashion, unlike other works in the literature that use fixed spacetime manifolds such as Minkowski space or De Sitter space to embed DAGs. Our main theoretical guarantee is a universal embedding theorem, showing that any $k$-point DAG can be embedded into an NST with $1+\mathcal{O}(\log(k))$ distortion while exactly preserving its causal structure. The total number of parameters defining the NST is sub-cubic in $k$ and linear in the width of the DAG. If the DAG has a planar Hasse diagram, this is improved to $\mathcal{O}(\log(k)) + 2)$ spatial and 2 temporal dimensions. We validate our framework computationally with synthetic weighted DAGs and real-world network embeddings; in both cases, the NSTs achieve lower embedding distortions than their counterparts using fixed spacetime geometries.</description>

Abstract: The Narayana morphism $\nu$ maps $0 \rightarrow 01$, $1 \rightarrow 2$, $2 \rightarrow 0$ and has a fixed point $\mathbf{n} = n_0 n_1 n_2 \cdots = {\tt 0120010120120}\cdots$. In this paper we study the properties of this word and related words using automata theory.</description>

      <title>Positionality of Dumont--Thomas numeration systems for integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Introduced in 2001 by Lecomte and Rigo, abstract numeration systems provide a way of expressing natural numbers with words from a language $L$ accepted by a finite automaton. As it turns out, these numeration systems are not necessarily positional, i.e., we cannot always find a sequence $U=(U_i)_{i\ge 0}$ of integers such that the value of every word in the language $L$ is determined by the position of its letters and the first few values of $U$. Finding the conditions under which an abstract numeration system is positional seems difficult in general. In this paper, we thus consider this question for a particular sub-family of abstract numeration systems called Dumont--Thomas numeration systems. They are derived from substitutions and were introduced in 1989 by Dumont and Thomas. We exhibit conditions on the underlying substitution so that the corresponding Dumont--Thomas numeration is positional. We first work in the most general setting, then particularize our results to some practical cases. Finally, we link our numeration systems to existing literature, notably properties studied by R\'{e}nyi in 1957, Parry in 1960, Bertrand-Mathis in 1989, and Fabre in 1995.</description>
