      <title>Understanding the Role of Large Language Models in Software Engineering: Evidence from an Industry Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) is reshaping software engineering by profoundly influencing coding, documentation, and system maintenance practices. As these tools become deeply embedded in developers' daily workflows, understanding how they are used has become essential. This paper reports an empirical study of LLM adoption in software engineering, based on a survey of 46 industry professionals with diverse educational backgrounds and levels of experience. The results reveal positive perceptions of LLMs, particularly regarding faster resolution of technical questions, improved documentation support, and enhanced source code standardization. However, respondents also expressed concerns about cognitive dependence, security risks, and the potential erosion of technical autonomy. These findings underscore the need for critical and supervised use of LLM-based tools. By grounding the discussion in empirical evidence from industry practice, this study bridges the gap between academic discourse and real-world software development. The results provide actionable insights for developers and researchers seeking to adopt and evolve LLM-based technologies in a more effective, responsible, and secure manner, while also motivating future research on their cognitive, ethical, and organizational implications.</description>

      <title>Fairness Is Not Just Ethical: Performance Trade-Off via Data Correlation Tuning to Mitigate Bias in ML Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional software fairness research typically emphasizes ethical and social imperatives, neglecting that fairness fundamentally represents a core software quality issue arising directly from performance disparities across sensitive user groups. Recognizing fairness explicitly as a software quality dimension yields practical benefits beyond ethical considerations, notably improved predictive performance for unprivileged groups, enhanced out-of-distribution generalization, and increased geographic transferability in real-world deployments. Nevertheless, existing bias mitigation methods face a critical dilemma: while pre-processing methods offer broad applicability across model types, they generally fall short in effectiveness compared to post-processing techniques. To overcome this challenge, we propose Correlation Tuning (CoT), a novel pre-processing approach designed to mitigate bias by adjusting data correlations. Specifically, CoT introduces the Phi-coefficient, an intuitive correlation measure, to systematically quantify correlation between sensitive attributes and labels, and employs multi-objective optimization to address the proxy biases. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that CoT increases the true positive rate of unprivileged groups by an average of 17.5% and reduces three key bias metrics, including statistical parity difference (SPD), average odds difference (AOD), and equal opportunity difference (EOD), by more than 50% on average. CoT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by three and ten percentage points in single attribute and multiple attributes scenarios, respectively. We will publicly release our experimental results and source code to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>CosmoCore-Evo: Evolutionary Dream-Replay Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the affective dream-replay reinforcement learning framework of CosmoCore, we introduce CosmoCore-Evo, an extension that incorporates evolutionary algorithms to enhance adaptability and novelty in code generation tasks. Inspired by anthropological aspects of human evolution, such as natural selection and adaptation in early hominids, CosmoCore-Evo treats RL trajectories as ``genomes'' that undergo mutation and selection during the nocturnal replay phase. This mechanism allows agents to break free from trained patterns, fostering emergent behaviors and improved performance in distribution-shifted environments, such as changing APIs or novel libraries. We augment the Dream Queue with evolutionary operations, including mutation of high-fitness trajectories and enterprise-tuned fitness functions that incorporate efficiency, compliance, and scalability metrics. Evaluated on extended benchmarks including HumanEval variants with shifts, BigCodeBench, and a custom PySpark pipeline simulation, CosmoCore-Evo achieves up to 35% higher novelty in solutions and 25% faster adaptation compared to the original CosmoCore and baselines like PPO and REAMER. Ablations confirm the role of evolutionary components in bridging the sentient gap for LLM agents. Code for replication, including a toy simulation, is provided.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent LLM Committees for Autonomous Software Beta Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manual software beta testing is costly and time-consuming, while single-agent large language model (LLM) approaches suffer from hallucinations and inconsistent behavior. We propose a multi-agent committee framework in which diverse vision-enabled LLMs collaborate through a three-round voting protocol to reach consensus on testing actions. The framework combines model diversity, persona-driven behavioral variation, and visual user interface understanding to systematically explore web applications. Across 84 experimental runs with 9 testing personas and 4 scenarios, multi-agent committees achieve an 89.5 percent overall task success rate. Configurations with 2 to 4 agents reach 91.7 to 100 percent success, compared to 78.0 percent for single-agent baselines, yielding improvements of 13.7 to 22.0 percentage points. At the action level, the system attains a 93.1 percent success rate with a median per-action latency of 0.71 seconds, enabling real-time and continuous integration testing. Vision-enabled agents successfully identify user interface elements, with navigation and reporting achieving 100 percent success and form filling achieving 99.2 percent success. We evaluate the framework on WebShop and OWASP benchmarks, achieving 74.7 percent success on WebShop compared to a 50.1 percent published GPT-3 baseline, and 82.0 percent success on OWASP Juice Shop security testing with coverage of 8 of the 10 OWASP Top 10 vulnerability categories. Across 20 injected regressions, the committee achieves an F1 score of 0.91 for bug detection, compared to 0.78 for single-agent baselines. The open-source implementation enables reproducible research and practical deployment of LLM-based software testing in CI/CD pipelines.</description>

      <title>AInsteinBench: Benchmarking Coding Agents on Scientific Repositories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce AInsteinBench, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating whether large language model (LLM) agents can operate as scientific computing development agents within real research software ecosystems. Unlike existing scientific reasoning benchmarks which focus on conceptual knowledge, or software engineering benchmarks that emphasize generic feature implementation and issue resolving, AInsteinBench evaluates models in end-to-end scientific development settings grounded in production-grade scientific repositories. The benchmark consists of tasks derived from maintainer-authored pull requests across six widely used scientific codebases, spanning quantum chemistry, quantum computing, molecular dynamics, numerical relativity, fluid dynamics, and cheminformatics. All benchmark tasks are carefully curated through multi-stage filtering and expert review to ensure scientific challenge, adequate test coverage, and well-calibrated difficulty. By leveraging evaluation in executable environments, scientifically meaningful failure modes, and test-driven verification, AInsteinBench measures a model's ability to move beyond surface-level code generation toward the core competencies required for computational scientific research.</description>

      <title>What Makes a GitHub Issue Ready for Copilot?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-agents help developers in different coding tasks, such as developing new features, fixing bugs, and reviewing code. Developers can write a Github issue and assign it to an AI-agent like Copilot for implementation. Based on the issue and its related discussion, the AI-agent performs a plan for the implementation, and executes it. However, the performance of AI-agents and LLMs heavily depends on the input they receive. For instance, a GitHub issue that is unclear or not well scoped might not lead to a successful implementation that will eventually be merged. GitHub Copilot provides a set of best practice recommendations that are limited and high-level. In this paper, we build a set of 32 detailed criteria that we leverage to measure the quality of GitHub issues to make them suitable for AI-agents. We compare the GitHub issues that lead to a merged pull request versus closed pull request. Then, we build an interpretable machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a GitHub issue resulting in a merged pull request. We observe that pull requests that end up being merged are those originating from issues that are shorter, well scoped, with clear guidance and hints about the relevant artifacts for an issue, and with guidance on how to perform the implementation. Issues with external references including configuration, context setup, dependencies or external APIs are associated with lower merge rates. We built an interpretable machine learning model to help users identify how to improve a GitHub issue to increase the chances of the issue resulting in a merged pull request by Copilot. Our model has a median AUC of 72\%. Our results shed light on quality metrics relevant for writing GitHub issues and motivate future studies further investigate the writing of GitHub issues as a first-class software engineering activity in the era of AI-teammates.</description>

      <title>Cerberus: Multi-Agent Reasoning and Coverage-Guided Exploration for Static Detection of Runtime Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In several software development scenarios, it is desirable to detect runtime errors and exceptions in code snippets without actual execution. A typical example is to detect runtime exceptions in online code snippets before integrating them into a codebase. In this paper, we propose Cerberus, a novel predictive, execution-free coverage-guided testing framework. Cerberus uses LLMs to generate the inputs that trigger runtime errors and to perform code coverage prediction and error detection without code execution. With a two-phase feedback loop, Cerberus first aims to both increasing code coverage and detecting runtime errors, then shifts to focus only detecting runtime errors when the coverage reaches 100% or its maximum, enabling it to perform better than prompting the LLMs for both purposes. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that Cerberus performs better than conventional and learning-based testing frameworks for (in)complete code snippets by generating high-coverage test cases more efficiently, leading to the discovery of more runtime errors.</description>

      <title>Fuzzwise: Intelligent Initial Corpus Generation for Fuzzing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mutation-based greybox fuzzing, generating high-quality input seeds for the initial corpus is essential for effective fuzzing. Rather than conducting separate phases for generating a large corpus and subsequently minimizing it, we propose FuzzWise which integrates them into one process to generate the optimal initial corpus of seeds (ICS). FuzzWise leverages a multi-agent framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). The first LLM agent generates test cases for the target program. The second LLM agent, which functions as a predictive code coverage module, assesses whether each generated test case will enhance the overall coverage of the current corpus. The streamlined process allows each newly generated test seed to be immediately evaluated for its contribution to the overall coverage. FuzzWise employs a predictive approach using an LLM and eliminates the need for actual execution, saving computational resources and time, particularly in scenarios where the execution is not desirable or even impossible. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that FuzzWise generates significantly fewer test cases than baseline methods. Despite the lower number of test cases, FuzzWise achieves high code coverage and triggers more runtime errors compared to the baselines. Moreover, it is more time-efficient and coverage-efficient in producing an initial corpus catching more errors.</description>

      <title>Code Clone Refactoring in C# with Lambda Expressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "Extract Method" refactoring is a technique for consolidating code clones. Parameterization approaches are used to extract a single method from multiple code clones that contain differences. This approach parameterizes expressions and behaviors within a method. In particular, behavior parameterization has been extensively studied in Java programs, but little research has been conducted on other programming languages.
  Lambda expressions can be used to parameterize behaviors, but the specifications of each programming language significantly affect the applicability of this technique. Therefore, the optimal "Extract Method" approach may vary depending on the programming language.
  In this study, we propose a C#-specific technique that uses lambda expressions to analyze and consolidate code clones. We evaluated our proposed method by applying it to code clones detected by the NiCad clone detector and measuring how many of them could be successfully consolidated.
  In total, 2,217 clone pairs from 22 projects were included in our evaluation. For the clone pairs determined to be refactorable, we also attempted refactoring actually. The proposed approach determined that 35.0% of all clone pairs were suitable for refactoring. Among these, 28.9% were successfully refactored.</description>

      <title>XTrace: A Non-Invasive Dynamic Tracing Framework for Android Applications in Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the complexity of mobile applications grows exponentially and the fragmentation of user device environments intensifies, ensuring online application stability faces unprecedented challenges. Traditional methods, such as static logging and post-crash analysis, lack real-time contextual information, rendering them ineffective against "ghost bugs" that only manifest in specific scenarios. This highlights an urgent need for dynamic runtime observability: intercepting and tracing arbitrary methods in production without requiring an app release. We propose XTrace, a novel dynamic tracing framework. XTrace introduces a new paradigm of non-invasive proxying, which avoids direct modification of the virtual machine's underlying data structures. It achieves high-performance method interception by leveraging and optimizing the highly stable, built-in instrumentation mechanism of the Android ART virtual machine. Evaluated in a ByteDance application with hundreds of millions of daily active users, XTrace demonstrated production-grade stability and performance. Large-scale online A/B experiments confirmed its stability, showing no statistically significant impact (p &gt; 0.05) on Crash User Rate or ANR rate, while maintaining minimal overhead (&lt;7 ms startup latency, &lt;0.01 ms per-method call) and broad compatibility (Android 5.0-15+). Critically, XTrace diagnosed over 11 severe online crashes and multiple performance bottlenecks, improving root-cause localization efficiency by over 90%. This confirms XTrace provides a production-grade solution that reconciles the long-standing conflict between stability and comprehensive coverage in Android dynamic tracing.</description>

      <title>Co-Evolution of Types and Dependencies: Towards Repository-Level Type Inference for Python Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Python's dynamic typing mechanism, while promoting flexibility, is a significant source of runtime type errors that plague large-scale software, which inspires the automatic type inference techniques. Existing type inference tools have achieved advances in type inference within isolated code snippets. However, repository-level type inference remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the complex inter-procedural dependencies that are difficult to model and resolve. To fill this gap, we present \methodName, a novel approach based on LLMs that achieves repository-level type inference through the co-evolution of types and dependencies. \methodName~constructs an Entity Dependency Graph (EDG) to model the objects and type dependencies across the repository. During the inference process, it iteratively refines types and dependencies in EDG for accurate type inference. Our key innovations are: (1) an EDG model designed to capture repository-level type dependencies; (2) an iterative type inference approach where types and dependencies co-evolve in each iteration; and (3) a type-checker-in-the-loop strategy that validates and corrects inferences on-the-fly, thereby reducing error propagation. When evaluated on 12 complex Python repositories, \methodName~significantly outperformed prior works, achieving a \textit{TypeSim} score of 0.89 and a \textit{TypeExact} score of 0.84, representing a 27\% and 40\% relative improvement over the strongest baseline. More importantly, \methodName~removed new type errors introduced by the tool by 92.7\%. This demonstrates a significant leap towards automated, reliable type annotation for real-world Python development.</description>

      <title>How Do Agents Perform Code Optimization? An Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performance optimization is a critical yet challenging aspect of software development, often requiring a deep understanding of system behavior, algorithmic tradeoffs, and careful code modifications. Although recent advances in AI coding agents have accelerated code generation and bug fixing, little is known about how these agents perform on real-world performance optimization tasks. We present the first empirical study comparing agent- and human-authored performance optimization commits, analyzing 324 agent-generated and 83 human-authored PRs from the AIDev dataset across adoption, maintainability, optimization patterns, and validation practices. We find that AI-authored performance PRs are less likely to include explicit performance validation than human-authored PRs (45.7\% vs. 63.6\%, $p=0.007$). In addition, AI-authored PRs largely use the same optimization patterns as humans. We further discuss limitations and opportunities for advancing agentic code optimization.</description>

      <title>The State of the SBOM Tool Ecosystems: A Comparative Analysis of SPDX and CycloneDX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) provides transparency by documenting software component metadata and dependencies. However, SBOM adoption depends on tool ecosystems. With two dominant formats: SPDX and CycloneDX - the ecosystems vary significantly in maturity, tool support, and community engagement. We conduct a quantitative comparison of use cases for 170 publicly advertised SBOM tools, identifying enhancement areas for each format. We compare health metrics of both ecosystems (171 CycloneDX versus 470 SPDX tools) to evaluate robustness and maturity. We quantitatively compare 36,990 issue reports from open-source tools to identify challenges and development opportunities. Finally, we investigate the top 250 open-source projects using each tool ecosystem and compare their health metrics. Our findings reveal distinct characteristics: projects using CycloneDX tools demonstrate higher developer engagement and certain health indicators, while SPDX tools benefit from a more mature ecosystem with broader tool availability and established industry adoption. This research provides insights for developers, contributors, and practitioners regarding complementary strengths of these ecosystems and identifies opportunities for mutual enhancement.</description>

      <title>A Story About Cohesion and Separation: Label-Free Metric for Log Parser Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Log parsing converts log messages into structured event templates, allowing for automated log analysis and reducing manual inspection effort. To select the most compatible parser for a specific system, multiple evaluation metrics are commonly used for performance comparisons. However, existing evaluation metrics heavily rely on labeled log data, which limits prior studies to a fixed set of datasets and hinders parser evaluations and selections in the industry. Further, we discovered that different versions of ground-truth used in existing studies can lead to inconsistent performance conclusions. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a novel label-free template-level metric, PMSS (parser medoid silhouette score), to evaluate log parser performance. PMSS evaluates both parser grouping and template quality with medoid silhouette analysis and Levenshtein distance within a near-linear time complexity in general. To understand its relationship with label-based template-level metrics, FGA and FTA, we compared their evaluation outcomes for six log parsers on the standard corrected Loghub 2.0 dataset. Our results indicate that log parsers achieving the highest PMSS or FGA exhibit comparable performance, differing by only 2.1% on average in terms of the FGA score; the difference is 9.8% for FTA. PMSS is also significantly (p&lt;1e-8) and positively correlated to both FGA and FTA: the Spearman's rho correlation coefficient of PMSS-FGA and PMSS-FTA are respectively 0.648 and 0.587, close to the coefficient between FGA and FTA (0.670). We further extended our discussion on how to interpret the conclusions from different metrics, identifying challenges in using PMSS, and provided guidelines on conducting parser selections with our metric. PMSS provides a valuable evaluation alternative when ground-truths are inconsistent or labels are unavailable.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Code Injection Attacks on LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems in Software Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic AI and Multi-Agent Systems are poised to dominate industry and society imminently. Powered by goal-driven autonomy, they represent a powerful form of generative AI, marking a transition from reactive content generation into proactive multitasking capabilities. As an exemplar, we propose an architecture of a multi-agent system for the implementation phase of the software engineering process. We also present a comprehensive threat model for the proposed system. We demonstrate that while such systems can generate code quite accurately, they are vulnerable to attacks, including code injection. Due to their autonomous design and lack of humans in the loop, these systems cannot identify and respond to attacks by themselves. This paper analyzes the vulnerability of multi-agent systems and concludes that the coder-reviewer-tester architecture is more resilient than both the coder and coder-tester architectures, but is less efficient at writing code. We find that by adding a security analysis agent, we mitigate the loss in efficiency while achieving even better resiliency. We conclude by demonstrating that the security analysis agent is vulnerable to advanced code injection attacks, showing that embedding poisonous few-shot examples in the injected code can increase the attack success rate from 0% to 71.95%.</description>

      <title>HALF: Process Hollowing Analysis Framework for Binary Programs with the Assistance of Kernel Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary program analysis is still very important in system security. There are many practical achievements in binary code analysis, but fine-grained analysis such as dynamic taint analysis, is constantly studied due to the problem of deployability, high memory usage, and performance overhead, so as to better adapt to the new analysis scenario, such as memory corruption exploits and sandbox evasion malware. This paper presents a new binary program analysis framework, in order to improve the usability and performance of fine-grained analysis. The framework mainly uses the kernel module to further expand the analysis capability of the traditional dynamic binary instrumentation. Then, based on the idea of decoupling analysis, the analysis environment is constructed in the container process through process hollowing techniques in a new way. It can reuse the functions of the existing dynamic binary instrumentation platforms and also reduce the impact on the execution of the target program. The prototype is implemented on the Windows platform. The validity and performance of the framework are verified by a large number of experiments with benchmark and actual programs. The effectiveness of the framework is also verified by the analysis of actual exploit programs and malicious code, demonstrating the value of the practical application.</description>

      <title>Reflection-Driven Control for Trustworthy Code Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contemporary large language model (LLM) agents are remarkably capable, but they still lack reliable safety controls and can produce unconstrained, unpredictable, and even actively harmful outputs. To address this, we introduce Reflection-Driven Control, a standardized and pluggable control module that can be seamlessly integrated into general agent architectures. Reflection-Driven Control elevates "self-reflection" from a post hoc patch into an explicit step in the agent's own reasoning process: during generation, the agent continuously runs an internal reflection loop that monitors and evaluates its own decision path. When potential risks are detected, the system retrieves relevant repair examples and secure coding guidelines from an evolving reflective memory, injecting these evidence-based constraints directly into subsequent reasoning steps. We instantiate Reflection-Driven Control in the setting of secure code generation and systematically evaluate it across eight classes of security-critical programming tasks. Empirical results show that Reflection-Driven Control substantially improves the security and policy compliance of generated code while largely preserving functional correctness, with minimal runtime and token overhead. Taken together, these findings indicate that Reflection-Driven Control is a practical path toward trustworthy AI coding agents: it enables designs that are simultaneously autonomous, safer by construction, and auditable.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Security Threats of Retriever Backdoors in Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG) is increasingly adopted to enhance Large Language Models for software development, yet its security implications remain dangerously underexplored. This paper conducts the first systematic exploration of a critical and stealthy threat: backdoor attacks targeting the retriever component, which represents a significant supply-chain vulnerability. It is infeasible to assess this threat realistically, as existing attack methods are either too ineffective to pose a real danger or are easily detected by state-of-the-art defense mechanisms spanning both latent-space analysis and token-level inspection, which achieve consistently high detection rates. To overcome this barrier and enable a realistic analysis, we first developed VenomRACG, a new class of potent and stealthy attack that serves as a vehicle for our investigation. Its design makes poisoned samples statistically indistinguishable from benign code, allowing the attack to consistently maintain low detectability across all evaluated defense mechanisms. Armed with this capability, our exploration reveals a severe vulnerability: by injecting vulnerable code equivalent to only 0.05% of the entire knowledge base size, an attacker can successfully manipulate the backdoored retriever to rank the vulnerable code in its top-5 results in 51.29% of cases. This translates to severe downstream harm, causing models like GPT-4o to generate vulnerable code in over 40% of targeted scenarios, while leaving the system's general performance intact. Our findings establish that retriever backdooring is not a theoretical concern but a practical threat to the software development ecosystem that current defenses are blind to, highlighting the urgent need for robust security measures.</description>

      <title>Agentic Structured Graph Traversal for Root Cause Analysis of Code-related Incidents in Cloud Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cloud incidents pose major operational challenges in production, with unresolved production cloud incidents cost on average over $2M per hour. Prior research identifies code- and configuration-related issues as the predominant category of root causes in cloud incidents. This paper introduces PRAXIS, an orchestrator that manages and deploys an agentic workflow for diagnosing code- and configuration-caused cloud incidents. PRAXIS employs an LLM-driven structured traversal over two types of graph: (1) a service dependency graph (SDG) that captures microservice-level dependencies; and (2) a hammock-block program dependence graph (PDG) that captures code-level dependencies for each microservice. Together, these graphs encode microservice- and code-level dependencies and the LLM acts as a traversal policy over these graphs, moving between services and code dependencies to localize and explain failures. Compared to state-of-the-art ReAct baselines, PRAXIS improves RCA accuracy by up to 3.1x while reducing token consumption by 3.8x. PRAXIS is demonstrated on a set of 30 comprehensive real-world incidents that is being compiled into an RCA benchmark.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Issues, Their Causes and Solutions in Microservices Systems: An Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01894v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many small to large organizations have adopted the Microservices Architecture (MSA) style to develop and deliver their core businesses. Despite the popularity of MSA in the software industry, there is a limited evidence-based and thorough understanding of the types of issues (e.g., errors, faults, failures, and bugs) that microservices system developers experience, the causes of the issues, and the solutions as potential fixing strategies to address the issues. To ameliorate this gap, we conducted a mixed-methods empirical study that collected data from 2,641 issues from the issue tracking systems of 15 open-source microservices systems on GitHub, 15 interviews, and an online survey completed by 150 practitioners from 42 countries across 6 continents. Our analysis led to comprehensive taxonomies for the issues, causes, and solutions. The findings of this study informthat Technical Debt, Continuous Integration and Delivery, Exception Handling, Service Execution and Communication, and Security are the most dominant issues in microservices systems. Furthermore, General Programming Errors, Missing Features and Artifacts, and Invalid Configuration and Communication are the main causes behind the issues. Finally, we found 177 types of solutions that can be applied to fix the identified issues. Based on our study results, we propose a future research framework that outlines key problem dimensions and actionable study strategies to support the engineering of emergent and next-generation microservices systems.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Large Language Models for Line-Level Vulnerability Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Automated Vulnerability Localization (AVL) has attracted growing attention, aiming to facilitate diagnosis by pinpointing the specific lines of code responsible for vulnerabilities. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in various domains, yet their effectiveness in line-level vulnerability localization remains underexplored.
  In this work, we present the first comprehensive empirical evaluation of LLMs for AVL. Our study examines 19 leading LLMs suitable for code analysis, including ChatGPT and multiple open-source models, spanning encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only architectures, with model sizes from 60M to 70B parameters. We evaluate three paradigms including few-shot prompting, discriminative fine-tuning, and generative fine-tuning with and without Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), on both a BigVul-derived dataset for C/C++ and a smart contract vulnerability dataset.}
  Our results show that discriminative fine-tuning achieves substantial performance gains over existing learning-based AVL methods when sufficient training data is available. In low-data settings, prompting advanced LLMs such as ChatGPT proves more effective. We also identify challenges related to input length and unidirectional context during fine-tuning, and propose two remedial strategies: a sliding window approach and right-forward embedding, both of which yield significant improvements. Moreover, we provide the first assessment of LLM generalizability in AVL, showing that certain models can transfer effectively across Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) and projects. However, performance degrades notably for newly discovered vulnerabilities containing unfamiliar lexical or structural patterns, underscoring the need for continual adaptation.</description>

Abstract: Geocoding systems are widely used in both scientific research for spatial analysis and everyday life through location-based services. The quality of geocoded data significantly impacts subsequent processes and applications, underscoring the need for next-generation systems. In response to this demand, this review first characterizes the technical requirements for next-generation geocoding inputs and outputs. We then decompose the geocoding workflow into modular functional units and survey existing implementations. For each component, we identify methodological limitations, articulate domain-specific research questions and hypotheses, and outline evaluation strategies needed. Finally, we identify opportunities to improve next-generation geocoding systems in light of recent technological advances. We envision that this review provides a technical foundation and research agenda for advancing the design, assessment, and deployment of next-generation geocoding systems.</description>

      <title>Detecting Flaky Tests in Quantum Software: A Dynamic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flaky tests, tests that pass or fail nondeterministically without changes to code or environment, pose a serious threat to software reliability. While classical software engineering has developed a rich body of dynamic and static techniques to study flakiness, corresponding evidence for quantum software remains limited. Prior work relies primarily on static analysis or small sets of manually reported incidents, leaving open questions about the prevalence, characteristics, and detectability of flaky tests.
  This paper presents the first large-scale dynamic characterization of flaky tests in quantum software. We executed the Qiskit Terra test suite 10,000 times across 23 releases in controlled environments. For each release, we measured test-outcome variability, identified flaky tests, estimated empirical failure probabilities, analyzed recurrence across versions, and used Wilson confidence intervals to quantify rerun budgets for reliable detection. We further mapped flaky tests to Terra subcomponents to assess component-level susceptibility.
  Across 27,026 test cases, we identified 290 distinct flaky tests. Although overall flakiness rates were low (0-0.4%), flakiness was highly episodic: nearly two-thirds of flaky tests appeared in only one release, while a small subset recurred intermittently or persistently. Many flaky tests failed with very small empirical probabilities ($\hat{p} \approx 10^{-4}$), implying that tens of thousands of executions may be required for confident detection. Flakiness was unevenly distributed across subcomponents, with 'transpiler' and 'quantum_info' accounting for the largest share.
  These results show that quantum test flakiness is rare but difficult to detect under typical continuous integration budgets. To support future research, we release a public dataset of per-test execution outcomes.</description>

      <title>One Tool Is Enough: Reinforcement Learning for Repository-Level LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Locating the files and functions requiring modification in large open-source software (OSS) repositories is challenging due to their scale and structural complexity. Existing large language model (LLM)-based methods typically treat this as a repository-level retrieval task and rely on multiple auxiliary tools, which overlook code execution logic and complicate model control. We propose RepoNavigator, an LLM agent equipped with a single execution-aware tool-jumping to the definition of an invoked symbol. This unified design reflects the actual flow of code execution while simplifying tool manipulation. RepoNavigator is trained end-to-end via Reinforcement Learning (RL) directly from a pretrained model, without any closed-source distillation. Experiments demonstrate that RL-trained RepoNavigator achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the 7B model outperforming 14B baselines, the 14B model surpassing 32B competitors, and even the 32B model exceeding closed-source models such as Claude-3.7. These results confirm that integrating a single, structurally grounded tool with RL training provides an efficient and scalable solution for repository-level issue localization.</description>

      <title>CP-Agent: Agentic Constraint Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Translating natural language into formal constraint models requires expertise in the problem domain and modeling frameworks. To investigate whether constraint modeling benefits from agentic workflows, we introduce CP-Agent, a Python coding agent using the ReAct framework with a persistent IPython kernel. Domain knowledge is provided through a project prompt of under 50 lines. The agent iteratively executes code, observes the solver's feedback, and refines models based on the execution results.
  We evaluate CP-Agent on CP-Bench's 101 constraint programming problems. We clarified the benchmark to address systematic ambiguities in problem specifications and errors in ground-truth models. On the clarified benchmark, CP-Agent solves all 101 problems. Ablation studies indicate that minimal guidance outperforms detailed procedural scaffolding, and that explicit task management tools have mixed effects on focused modeling tasks.</description>

      <title>Computational Foundations for Strategic Coopetition: Formalizing Interdependence and Complementarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18802v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coopetition refers to simultaneous cooperation and competition among actors who "cooperate to grow the pie and compete to split it up." Modern socio-technical systems are characterized by strategic coopetition in which actors concomitantly cooperate to create value and compete to capture it. While conceptual modeling languages such as i* provide rich qualitative representations of strategic dependencies, they lack mechanisms for quantitative analysis of dynamic trade-offs. Conversely, classical game theory offers mathematical rigor but strips away contextual richness. This technical report bridges this gap by developing computational foundations that formalize two critical dimensions of coopetition: interdependence and complementarity. We ground interdependence in i* structural dependency analysis, translating depender-dependee-dependum relationships into quantitative interdependence coefficients through a structured translation framework. We formalize complementarity following Brandenburger and Nalebuff's Added Value concept, modeling synergistic value creation with validated parameterization. We integrate structural dependencies with bargaining power in value appropriation and introduce a game-theoretic formulation where Nash Equilibrium incorporates structural interdependence. Validation combines comprehensive experimental testing comprising over 22,000 trials across power and logarithmic value function specifications, demonstrating functional form robustness, with empirical application to the Samsung-Sony S-LCD joint venture (2004-2011). This technical report serves as the foundational reference for a coordinated research program examining strategic coopetition in multi-agent systems, with companion work addressing trust dynamics, collective action, and reciprocity mechanisms.</description>
