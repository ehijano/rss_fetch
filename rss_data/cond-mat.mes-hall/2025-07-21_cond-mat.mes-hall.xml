      <title>Martini 3 application for the design of bistable nanomachines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During our previous modeling using all-atom molecular dynamics, we have identified several foldamers whose nanoscale behavior resembles that of classic bistable machines, namely the Euler archs and Duffing oscillators. However, time limitations of the all-atom molecular dynamics prevent us from performing a full-scale investigation of long-time behavior and prompt us to develop a coarse-grained model. In this work, we summarize our recent research on developing such models using the most widely available method called Martini.</description>

      <title>Supercurrent tuning of the Josephson coupling energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to non-dissipatively tune the Josephson coupling energy of Josephson junctions is a useful tool in frequency-tunable qubits. This is typically done by threading magnetic flux through two junctions connected in a loop, a geometry that exposes the qubit to magnetic environmental noise. In this paper, we show that by biasing a junction with supercurrent from a separate pair of superconducting leads coupled to the device, the Josephson energy can be tuned without the need for a flux loop. Our multiterminal device may enable the realization of a frequency-tunable qubit with greatly reduced susceptibility to flux noise.</description>

      <title>Chiral-induced circularly polarized light emission from a single-molecule junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work we theoretically analyze electroluminescence occurring in a biased single-molecule junction with a chiral bridge imitated by a helical chain. We show that optical transitions between electron states of the chiral linker may result in the emission of circular polarized light whose handedness depends on both direction of propagation and the polarity of the bias voltage provided that the coupling between the bridge sites is sufficiently strong. The mechanism controlling this specific light emission does not depend on the magnetic moments and spin-orbit interactions. It rather relies on the chiral properties of the bridge molecule and on the distribution of the bias voltage between the electrodes in the junction.</description>

      <title>Dynamic annihilation pathways of magnetic skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation of magnetic solitons often relies on numerical modeling to determine key features such as stability, annihilation, nucleation, and motion. However, as soliton sizes approach atomic length scales, the accuracy of these predictions become increasingly sensitive to the details of the numerical model. Here, we study the annihilation of two-dimensional magnetic skyrmions using a pseudospectral approach and compare its performance to that of conventional micromagnetic simulations. A central distinction between the models lies in their treatment of the exchange interaction, which governs the magnon dispersion relation and plays a crucial role to balance the uniaxial anisotropy to stabilise skyrmions. We demonstrate that both the choice of model and spatial discretisation significantly influence the skyrmion dynamics and the magnetic field required for annihilation. The pseudospectral model provides a consistent description across length scales and captures complex behaviours such as skyrmion breathing on its path to annihilation. Our results have direct implications in the state-of-the-art modeling of skyrmions and other two-dimensional textures and will impact the modeling of three-dimensional textures such as hopfions.</description>

      <title>Critical angles and one-dimensional moir\'e physics in twisted rectangular lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering moir\'e superlattices in van der Waals heterostructures provides fundamental control over emergent electronic, structural, and optical properties allowing to affect topological and correlated phenomena. This control is achieved through imposed periodic modulation of potentials and targeted modifications of symmetries. For twisted bilayers of van der Waals materials with rectangular lattices, such as PdSe2, this work shows that one-dimensional (1D) moir\'e patterns emerge universally. This emergence is driven by a series of critical twist angles (CAs). We investigate the geometric origins of these unique 1D moir\'e patterns and develop a universal mathematical framework to predict the CAs in twisted rectangular lattices. Through a density functional theory (DFT) description of the electronic properties of twisted bilayer PdSe2, we further reveal directionally localized flat band structures, localized charge densities and strong spin-orbit coupling along the dispersive direction which points to the emergence of an effectively 1D strongly spin-orbit coupled electronic systems. This establishes twisted rectangular systems as a unique platform for engineering low-symmetry moir\'e patterns, low-dimensional strongly correlated and topological physics, and spatially selective quantum phases beyond the isotropic paradigms of hexagonal moir\'e materials.</description>

      <title>Light-Induced Giant Enhancement of the Nonlinear Hall Effect in Two-Dimensional Electron Gases at KTaO3 (111) Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE), an emergent phenomenon in noncentrosymmetric systems, enables the generation of a transverse voltage without an external magnetic field through a second-order electrical response. However, achieving a sizable NLHE signal remains a critical challenge for its application in frequency-doubling and rectifying devices. Here, we report a light-induced giant enhancement of the NLHE in the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the CaZrO3/KTaO3 (111) interface. Under light illumination, the second harmonic Hall voltage (V2{\omega} y) increases substantially and undergoes a sign reversal. Correspondingly,the second-order transverse conductivity increases by nearly five orders of magnitude, reaching 2.4 um V-1 omega-1, while also reversing its sign. Scaling analysis indicates that skew scattering is the dominant mechanism underlying the NLHE and is highly tunable via optical gating. Photoexcitation pumps electrons from in-gap states into the higher-lying Ta 5d conduction band, generating high-mobility photocarriers that significantly increase the cubic transport scattering time, thereby driving a dramatic enhancement of {\sigma}(2) yxx. First-principles calculations further reveal that the Berry curvature distribution on the Fermi surface strongly depends on band filling. As the Fermi level approaches a band crossing in the Ta 5d subband near the M point, the Berry curvature triple undergoes a sign change, accounting for the experimentally observed sign reversal of the nonlinear Hall response. Our work offers a new strategy to optically boost and tune the nonlinear Hall effect in oxide 2DEG systems, paving the way for applications in light-controlled rectification and nonlinear electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Supersolidity in Optically Trapped Polariton Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superfluids under specific conditions can exhibit spontaneous breaking of continuous translation symmetries and form exotic spatially ordered states of matter known as supersolids. Despite its early theoretical prediction, it took over half-a-centrury to experimentally demonstrate the supersolid phase in ultracold atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, forming due to long-range interatomic interactions. Here we propose as a promising new platform for supersolidity exciton-polariton superfluids, confined in annular optically induced traps. The supersolid phase emerges due to effective attractive interactions, mediated by the normal excitonic component of the system. Experimental demonstration of spontaneously formed spatially ordered phase is in agreement with detailed mean-field theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. The spontaneous character of the observed supersolid transition is further evidenced by the formation of specific zero-energy Nambu-Goldstone modes in the collective excitation spectrum.</description>

      <title>Floquet composite Dirac semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dirac semimetals are classified into types I, II, and III based on the topological charge of their Dirac points. If a three-dimensional (3D) system can be sliced into a family of $k_z$-dependent normal and topological insulators, type I Dirac points separate a 2D normal insulator from a 2D first-order topological insulator, while type II (III) Dirac points separate a 2D normal (first-order) insulator from a 2D second-order topological insulator. To investigate the effects arising from the interplay of distinct Dirac points, one may wonder whether these Dirac points can coexist in single system. Here, we propose a scheme to induce composite Dirac semimetals in a Floquet four-band system with time-reversal and space-inversion symmetries. A general description is established to characterize Dirac semimetals in Floquet systems. The results show that Dirac semimetals hosting coexisting type I, II, and III Dirac points can be induced by delta-function or harmonic driving. Our results provide a promising new avenue for exploring novel Dirac semimetals.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-induced Hall-like lateral forces in a chiral-gain environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we demonstrate that vacuum fluctuations can induce lateral forces on a small particle positioned near a translation-invariant uniform non-Hermitian substrate with chiral gain. This type of non-Hermitian response can be engineered by biasing a low-symmetry conductor with a static electric field and is rooted in the quantum geometry of the material through the Berry curvature dipole. The chiral-gain material acts as an active medium for a particular circular polarisation handedness, while serving as a passive, dissipative medium for the other polarisation handedness. Owing to the nonreciprocity and gain characteristics, momentum is continuously exchanged in a preferred direction parallel to the surface between the test particle and the surrounding electromagnetic field, giving rise to lateral forces. Interestingly, the force can be viewed as a fluctuation-induced drag linked to the nonlinear Hall current. Indeed, although the gain is driven by an electric current, the resulting force acts perpendicular to the bias -- unlike conventional current-drag effects. This effect stems from the skewed propagation characteristics of surface modes and gain-momentum locking. Our theory reveals a Hall-like asymmetry in the field correlations and establishes a novel link between quantum geometry and fluctuation-induced phenomena, offering new possibilities for nanoscale control via tailored electromagnetic environments.</description>

      <title>Enhanced phonon-drag by nanoscale design of homoepitaxial \hbox{$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonon drag may be harnessed for thermoelectric generators and devices. Here, we demonstrate the geometric control of the phonon-drag contribution to the thermopower. In nanometer-thin electrically conducting $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films homoepitaxially-grown on insulating substrates it is enhanced from -0,4 mV/K to up to -3 mV/K at 100 K by choice of the film thickness. Analysis of the temperature-dependent Seebeck coefficients reveal that a crossover from three-dimensional to quasi-two-dimensional electron-phonon interaction occurs for film thicknesses below 75~nm. The ratio of phonon-phonon to electron-phonon relaxation times in these confined structures is $10$ times larger than that of bulk. Generally the phonon drag can be tuned depending on the relations between the phonon-drag interaction length $\lambda_\text{PD}$, the phonon mean free path $\lambda$ and the film thickness $d$. Phonon drag can be enhanced for $\lambda_\text{PD}\gg\lambda&gt;d$.</description>

      <title>Potential barriers are nearly-ideal quantum thermoelectrics at finite power output</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum thermodynamics defines the ideal quantum thermoelectric, with maximum possible efficiency at finite power output. However, such an ideal thermoelectric is challenging to implement experimentally. Instead, here we consider two types of thermoelectrics regularly implemented in experiments: (i) finite-height potential barriers or quantum point contacts, and (ii) double-barrier structures or single-level quantum dots. We model them with Landauer scattering theory as (i) step transmissions and (ii) Lorentzian transmissions. We optimize their thermodynamic efficiency for any given power output, when they are used as thermoelectric heat-engines or refrigerators. The Lorentzian's efficiency is excellent at vanishing power, but we find that it is poor at the finite powers of practical interest. In contrast, the step transmission is remarkably close to ideal efficiency (typically within 15%) at all power outputs. The step transmission is also close to ideal in the presence of phonons and other heat-leaks, for which the Lorentzian performs very poorly. Thus, a simple nanoscale thermoelectric - made with a potential barrier or quantum point contact - is almost as efficient as an ideal thermoelectric.</description>

      <title>Quantum Capacitance and Electronic Properties of a Hexagonal Boron Nitride based FET Gas Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical investigation of gas sensing in monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) based field-effect transistors (FET) using the non-equilibrium Green function formalism and Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker approach. Moving beyond conventional density functional theory analyses, our framework captures the full device level response by incorporating field-dependent quantum transport and temperature effects. We model the impact of NO, H$_2$S, HF and CO$_2$ gases on the band structure and density of states (DOS), carrier concentration, quantum capacitance and I-V characteristics. The results indicate that CO$_2$ followed by NO induce strongest perturbations via mid-gap states and band edge shifts, leading to the appearance of asymmetric Van-Hove singularities with enhanced carrier modulation and quantum capacitance. It is observed that HF induce moderate perturbation while H$_2$S induce weakest response for all temperature and biasing condition. It is found that an applied vertical electric field narrows the band gap via the Stark effect, further boosting mobility and tunability. Temperature influences sensing response by enhancing charge transfer at moderate levels and causing desorption at higher temperatures. We found that CO$_2$ consistently show the highest sensitivity and selectivity followed by NO and HF, while H$_2$S display the weakest response. This study offers a comprehensive framework to engineer h-BN based FET sensors by harnessing intrinsic band modulation and quantum capacitance for molecule discrimination and temperature optimization.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological trion insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trions, charged quasiparticles formed by binding an exciton to an excess charge carrier, dominate the optical response of doped transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and the study of the transport properties of trions in TMDs may have application in developing high-speed excitonic and optoelectronic devices. However, an important building block for low-dissipation optoelectronic devices that provides dissipationless transport channels for trions has remained elusive. Here, we propose the concept of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological trion insulator that features helical dissipationless edge states for trions. This is realized for intralayer trions, which inherit the valley-orbit coupling of intralayer excitons in TMDs subject to a moir\'e periodic potential. We find that under certain circumstances, the moir\'e trion band becomes topological, characterized by the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological number. We further provide two specific material realizations of this $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulator: a doped monolayer TMD placed on top of a twisted hBN substrate, and a generic twisted TMD heterobilayer. We also examine the effect of charge screening and find that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological trion insulator remains robust. Our work paves the way toward realizing dissipationless excitonic devices.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion Hall effect and shape deformation of current-driven bilayer skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The commonly believed absence of skyrmion Hall effect for topologically trivial magnetic skyrmions is reconsidered for bilayer skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets driven by spin-transfer and spin-orbit torques. Using a general Lagrangian formalism, we show that Bloch-type bilayer skyrmions acquire a finite Hall angle when driven by spin-orbit torque, while N\'{e}el-type skyrmions do not, in agreement with micromagnetic simulations. Both types of skyrmions exhibit current-induced elliptical deformation with minor and major axes aligned longitudinally and transversely to their velocity, respectively. A linear relation between velocity and longitudinal radius is derived with a coefficient proportional to the strength of spin-orbit torque. These effects are critical for antiferromagnetic skyrmion-based applications such as skyrmion racetrack memory. The Lagrange equations also reproduce the linear Hall angle-helicity relation reported by Msiska et al., Phys. Rev. Appl. 17, 064015 (2022). An intuitive explanation of the skyrmion Hall effect for arbitrary helicity based on the antiferromagnetic exchange torque is also provided.</description>

Abstract: Spin shuttling offers a promising approach for developing scalable silicon-based quantum processors by addressing the connectivity limitations of quantum dots (QDs). In this work, we demonstrate high-fidelity bucket-brigade (BB) spin shuttling in a silicon MOS device, utilizing Pauli Spin Blockade (PSB) readout. We achieve an average shuttling fidelity of \SI{99.8}{\percent}. The residual shuttling error is highly sensitive to the ratio between interdot tunnel coupling and Zeeman splitting, with tuning of these parameters enabling up to a twenty-fold variation in error rate. An appropriate four-level Hamiltonian model supports our findings. These results provide valuable insights for optimizing high-performance spin shuttling systems in future quantum architectures.</description>

      <title>Optimized Fabrication Procedure for High-Quality Graphene-based Moir\'e Superlattice Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices constitute a versatile platform to investigate emergent phenomena arising from the interplay of strong correlations and topology, while offering flexible in situ tunability. However, the fabrication of such moir\'e superlattices is challenging. It is difficult to achieve highly uniform devices with a precise twist angle because of the unintentional introduction of heterostrain, twist angle disorder, and angle/lattice relaxation during the nanofabrication process. This article introduces an optimized, experience-informed protocol for fabricating high-quality graphene-based moir\'e superlattice devices, focusing on a modified dry transfer technique. The transfer process is performed in a highly tunable, custom-built transfer setup that enables precise position, angle, and temperature control. By combining rigorous flake selection criteria, pre-cleaned bubble-free bottom gates, and graphene laser ablation, the moir\'e superlattice is constructed by deliberately overlaying twisted graphene flakes at a submicron speed at room temperature. Through precise control of the transfer process, the resulting graphene moir\'e superlattice devices exhibit high uniformity and desired twist angles. This optimized protocol addresses existing challenges in the fabrication of graphene-based moir\'e superlattice devices and paves the way for further advances in the rapidly evolving field of moir\'e materials.</description>

      <title>Magneto-Ionic Hardware Security Primitives: Embedding Data Protection at the Material Level</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Big Data revolution has heightened the demand for robust, energy-efficient security hardware capable of withstanding increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. Conventional encryption schemes, reliant on complex algorithms, are resource-intensive and remain vulnerable. To fortify sensitive information, society needs innovative anti-hacking and anti-counterfeiting technologies that exploit new materials and designs. Here, we present a magneto-ionic strategy for hardware-level security based on fully selective voltage-controlled N3- ion migration within pre-defined, initially paramagnetic FeCoN dots. This process generates ferromagnetic sublayers of tuneable thickness, resulting in either deterministic (single-domain or vortex) or probabilistic states (with coexisting magnetic configurations and voltage-adjustable probabilities), each exhibiting stochastic orientation and chirality, thereby providing a rich platform for magnetic fingerprinting. This approach enables self-protected primitives, including true random number generators, physical unclonable functions, and in-memory probabilistic inference. The resulting reconfigurable architecture combines tamper resistance, low energy consumption, and scalability, marking a significant leap toward next-generation hardware security rooted in emergent magnetic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Interplay of orbital and spin magnetization in trigonal tellurium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orbital effects, despite their fundamental significance and potential to engender novel physical phenomena and enable new applications, have long been underexplored compared to their spin counterparts. Recently, surging interest in the orbital degree of freedom has led to the discovery of a plethora of orbital-related effects, underscoring the need for a deeper understanding of their roles in quantum materials. Here, we report first experimental signatures of orbital magnetization in trigonal Tellurium, an elemental semiconductor with a unique helical crystal structure that serves as a natural platform for investigating orbital effects. Detailed angular dependent linear and nonlinear magnetotransport measurements, supported by theoretical Boltzmann transport analysis, reveal the coexistence of current-induced spin polarization and orbital magnetization. By disentangling the interplay between spin and orbital degrees of freedom, this work establishes a general framework for understanding orbital magnetization in chiral crystals and beyond, paving the way for its utilization in orbitronics and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Phonon density of states of magnetite (\ce{Fe3O4}) nanoparticles via molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive computational investigation of magnetite nanoparticles, systematically evaluating a range of force fields against experimental results. We analyze the influence of particle size, temperature, and surface-adsorbed water molecules on the structural and dynamic properties of the nanoparticles. We performed classical molecular dynamics of nanoparticles and bulk magnetite and utilized density functional theory calculations for bulk magnetite for comparison. Our results reveal that nanoparticle size and the presence of adsorbed water molecules have a pronounced impact on the density of states. Specifically, as the nanoparticle size is decreased, phonon modes exhibit significant broadening and softening, which is attributable to reduced phonon lifetimes resulting from enhanced boundary scattering. The incorporation of water further broadens the density of states and extends the spectra to higher energy regions. Temperature variations result in a slight broadening and softening of the phonon density of states, particularly in the oxygen-dominated region, which is attributed to phonon anharmonicity.</description>

      <title>Tunable exchange bias in Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ film on Gd$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferrimagnetic Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ grown on the (001) surface of paramagnetic Gd$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$ experiences an exchange bias field, which has been attributed to the magnetism of an interface layer between the two materials. We report here that when grown using sputtering and with lower post-annealing temperatures than in previous works, the blocking temperature of the interface magnetic layer is lowered to about 7 K, while still displaying a strong exchange bias. This exchange bias is then found to be tunable between its two extreme values by carefully varying the field cooling protocol. This is attributed to a slow and complex dynamics of the spins of the interface-layer when it is warmed up close to its blocking (or melting) temperature, which is reminiscent of a spin glass.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Anderson localization in higher-dimensional nonreciprocal lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocity breaks the symmetry between forward and backward propagation, giving rise to a range of peculiar wave phenomena. In this work, we investigate Anderson localization in higher-dimensional nonreciprocal lattices. Focusing on the two-dimensional Hatano-Nelson model, we uncover anisotropic hybrid modes (HMs) that exhibit skin localization along one direction and Anderson localization along the other. We determine the Anderson transition along different directions via the transfer matrix approach and finite-size scaling of Lyapunov exponents. This allows us to map out mobility edges that separate HMs from normal skin modes and Anderson localized modes (ALMs), revealing an ALM-HM-ALM reentrant transition. Our analysis extends to arbitrary dimensions, and we demonstrate the existence of skin-Anderson transitions on the infinite-dimensional nonreciprocal Bethe lattice using the forward-scattering approximation.</description>

      <title>Superconducting order parameter manifested in quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent discovery of the superconducting ground state in Quasicrystals (QCs) has opened up an exciting new avenue for superconductivity based on QCs. However, theoretical studies to date have largely focused on a limited subset of quasiperiodic structures. In this work, we broaden the scope by theoretically investigating the behavior of the superconducting order parameter (OP) across a wide class of aperiodic systems, including both generalized Fibonacci and non-Fibonacci QCs based on the attractive Hubbard model. We begin with a one-dimensional toy model, and for the generality of our findings, we extend our analysis to two-dimensional QCs. Remarkably, despite the increased dimensionality, the qualitative features of the OP remain largely preserved. By systematically analyzing models generated through various growth rules, we elucidate the influence of quasiperiodicity on the OP amplitudes. We study the evolution of the OP with respect to the temperature, strength of the interaction, and nearest-neighbor hopping amplitude. Our numerical analysis identifies the most favorable QC structure and parameter regime that supports enhanced onsite pairing amplitudes. Additionally, we provide a comparative analysis of the superconducting transition temperatures across the range of quasiperiodic configurations. To gain further insight into these systems, we compute key thermodynamic quantities: the entropy and electronic specific heat, and examine their dependence on the underlying structural sequences. This analysis enables us to determine which QC structures are most conducive to Cooper pair formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations in a planar graphene sheet, we investigate the temperature dependence of its mechanical behavior under uniaxial tensile stress applied either along the armchair or the zigzag direction. Stress-strain curves are calculated for different temperatures and the corresponding dependence of various elastic parameters, like the Young modulus, the third-order elastic modulus, the tensile strength and failure strain, is presented. Fracture stress and strain, as well as the Young modulus, decrease almost linearly with temperature. The distributions of bond lengths and bond angles at different strains and temperatures are also discussed and approximate analytical expressions are presented. The latter describe accurately the numerically obtained distributions.</description>

      <title>Sustained Amplification of Coherent Spin Waves by Parametric Pumping with Surface Acoustic Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parametric amplification offers a route to overcoming intrinsic damping in spin-wave systems, a key challenge in the development of magnonic signal processing and computing technologies. Here we demonstrate the sustained amplification of coherent forward volume magnetostatic spin waves in a yttrium-iron-garnet thin film using a traveling surface acoustic wave as a nonstationary pump. A gain of up to 6 dB is achieved under continuous pumping below the threshold for parametric instability. The interaction generates an idler wave at a distinct frequency, consistent with three-wave mixing governed by energy and momentum conservation. This approach enables stable, frequency- and wavevector-selective spin-wave gain using practical pump power levels, establishing acoustic wave pumping as a viable mechanism for realizing active components in integrated magnonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Power Factor Enhancement and Local Structural Transition in Ni-Doped TiCoSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a significant enhancement (~269%) in the power factor (PF) and a local structural transition in Ni-doped TiCoSb samples (TiCo_{1-x}Ni_xSb, (x= 0.0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, and 0.06). First-principles calculations reveal that even minute Ni doping induces a substantial shift in the Fermi level (EF) and alters the density of states (DOS). Structural analysis via Rietveld refinement of X-ray diffraction (XRD) data shows anomalous behavior at x = 0.02, supported by Williamson-Hall and modified methods. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Ti and Co K-edges further confirms a pronounced local structural change at this composition. These structural transitions are consistent with temperature-dependent resistivity (\rho(T)) and thermopower (S(T)) data, which reflect changes in EF and disorder. Analysis of Lorentz number and scattering parameters reinforces the observed modifications in the electronic structure. The simultaneous enhancement of S and electrical conductivity at x = 0.02 is attributed to the disorder-to-order transition, leading to the marked rise in PF.</description>

      <title>Giant Resonance Raman Scattering via Anisotropic Excitons in ReS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors recently have emerged as a promising platform for polarization-controlled Raman amplification. In this study, we probe energy-dependent resonant Raman scattering in few layer ReS2 under different polarization configurations. We identify two distinct excitation regimes, each characterized by a resonance condition where either the pump or the Stokes photon energy aligns with an excitonic transition. A two-order-of-magnitude enhancement in Raman intensity is observed when the pump energy is tuned near the exciton resonance. Under Stokes-resonant conditions, additional Raman lines accompanied by excitonic photoluminescence are observed, suggesting the participation of non-Bloch intermediate states in the scattering process. These findings shed light into the influence of excitons in modulating nonlinear optical phenomena in anisotropic 2D materials, offering valuable insights for the design of tunable photonic and optoelectronic devices based on anisotropic layered materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a unified framework for dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in non-Hermitian systems that encompasses both biorthogonal and self-norm non-biorthogonal formulations for pure and mixed states. Our framework provides explicit expressions for the Loschmidt amplitude, Loschmidt echo, and rate function, revealing a universal geometric signature of DQPTs: orthogonality of two related vectors in two-dimensional real space. Strikingly, we demonstrate that non-biorthogonal quenches from non-Hermitian to Hermitian Hamiltonians under chiral symmetry exhibit emergent topological characteristics, unveiling the intrinsic topological nature of DQPTs beyond conventional Hermitian regimes. This work establishes fundamental geometric and topological principles governing quantum criticality in open systems, with implications for quantum sensing and many-body physics in dissipative environments.</description>

      <title>Anomalous charge density wave in two-dimensional altermagnet WO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the study of novel physical properties arising from the combination of altermagnetism and other matter phases has attracted widespread attention, such as the integration of altermagnetism and topology. However, research on the combination of altermagnetism and charge density waves remains relatively sparse. In this letter, based on symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate for the first time that altermagnetism and charge density waves can coexist in a two-dimensional material and predict monolayer WO to be such a material. Moreover, our calculations reveal that the altermagnetic order in monolayer WO stabilizes the $\sqrt{2}\times\sqrt{2}$ charge density wave. Further, the $\sqrt{2}\times\sqrt{2}$ charge density wave is not driven by Fermi-surface nesting but rather by strong electron-phonon coupling. More importantly, the $\sqrt{2}\times\sqrt{2}$ charge density wave in monolayer WO leads to an anomalous transition from semimetal to metal. Therefore, we realize an anomalous charge density wave phase in altermagnetic WO. Considering the strong electron-phonon coupling and good metallic properties in the altermagnetic charge density wave state, our work may provide new insights into the realization of nontrivial altermagnetic superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit crossover and the origin of magnetic torque in kagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments on the kagome metal Cs$_3$Sb$_5$ reveal a curious phase transition-like feature: a nematic magnetic torque response that abruptly sets in at $T_\tau \approx 130$~K, above the known charge density wave transition at $T_\text{CDW} \approx 100$~K. Counterintuitively, elastoresistance measurements--a standard probe of nematicity--show no corresponding signal, ruling out a nematic phase transition and placing strong constraints on possible explanations. Beyond nematicity, the torque is paramagnetic for in-plane magnetic field, while above a critical out-of-plane field, an in-plane magnetisation appears, accompanied by hysteresis. We show that this combination of features cannot be accounted for by charge density waves or intraband magnetic order. Instead, we propose that interband ordering--via a symmetry-allowed interband spin-orbit coupling and a time-reversal and spatial symmetry-breaking interband order parameter--together with a background strain field, consistent with typical experimental conditions, provides a natural explanation; in our picture, the behaviour at $T_\tau$ is understood as a crossover in the symmetry-allowed interband spin-orbit coupling strength. Our theory accounts for the nematic magnetic torque, hysteresis, and the transition-like onset at $T_\tau$, while also making testable predictions, including strain-induced magnetisation. In doing so, it challenges the prevailing view of the normal state.</description>

      <title>Layer-selective Cooper pairing in an alternately stacked transition metal dichalcogenide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multigap superconductivity emerges when superconducting gaps form on distinct Fermi surfaces. Arising from locally overlapping atomic orbitals, multiple superconducting bands introduce a new internal degree of freedom in the material that, however, escapes external control due to their coexistence in real space in the known multigap superconductors. Here, we show that the layered superconductor 4Hb-TaSSe - composed of alternating trigonal (H) and octahedral (T) polymorph layers - is a multigap superconductor, featuring two weakly coupled superconducting condensates with distinct properties, spatially separated in alternating layers. Using high-resolution quasiparticle tunneling and Andreev reflection spectroscopy in the two polymorph layers, we identify two superconducting gaps that vary in size and internal structure. The intrinsic Cooper pairing in each polymorph is corroborated by the temperatures and magnetic fields at which the gaps open up, which differ in each polymorph layer and show opposing resilience to these parameters. This behavior enables selective external actuation upon the condensates. Our theoretical model based on ab-initio calculations reproduces key features of the observed superconducting gaps in the presence of finite interlayer hybridization and explains the unusually high critical field observed in the T-layer. Our results establish TMD polymorphs as platforms for engineering tunable multigap superconductors, offering new opportunities in layered superconducting device architectures.</description>

      <title>Fourier Plane Tomographic Spectroscopy Reveals Orientation-Dependent Multipolar Plasmon Modes in Micrometer-Scale Janus Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic Janus particles, comprising dielectric cores with thin metallic caps, exhibit complex optical properties due to their asymmetric structure. Despite applications in active matter research, their orientation-dependent scattering properties remain largely unexplored. We introduce Fourier plane tomographic spectroscopy for simultaneous four-dimensional characterization of scattering from individual micrometer-scale particles across wavelength, incident angle, scattering angle, and polarization. Combining measurements with finite-element simulations, we identify discrete spectral markers in visible and near-infrared regions that evolve predictably with cap orientation. Spherical-harmonics decomposition reveals these markers arise from three distinct multipolar modes up to fifth order: axial-propagating transverse-electric, transverse-propagating transverse-electric, and transverse-propagating axial-electric, with retardation-induced splitting. We observe progressive red-shifts and linewidth narrowing of higher-order resonances, demonstrating curvature's influence on mode dispersion. Orientation-specific scattering patterns exhibit polarization-dependent features enabling optical tracking of particle rotation. Our framework applies to diverse material combinations and geometries, offering a toolkit for designing orientation-responsive nanoantennas, reconfigurable metasurfaces, and active colloidal systems with tailored light-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Superconductivity and Vortex Dynamics in One-Dimensional TaS2 Nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the synthesis of high-quality 2H-TaS2 nanowires via a controlled two-step conversion process from TaS3 precursors, achieving robust superconductivity with a transition temperature Tc ~ 3.6 K which is significantly higher than bulk 2H-TaS2 (Tc ~ 0.8 K). Structural and compositional analyses confirm phase purity and preserved 1D morphology, while magnetotransport measurements reveal an enhanced upper critical field {\mu}oHc2 (2 K) ~ 5 T, far exceeding the bulk value ({\mu}oHc2 (0) ~ 1.17 T), attributed to dimensional confinement and suppression of charge density wave order. Magnetic characterization demonstrates complex vortex dynamics, including flux jumps and a second magnetization peak, indicative of strong pinning and crossover from elastic to plastic vortex regimes. These findings establish TaS2 nanowires as a versatile platform for studying superconductivity in reduced dimensions and exploiting confinement-driven quantum phenomena for advanced applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we have validated the application of Hertzian contact mechanics models and corrections for the analysis of force vs indentation curves, acquired using spherical indenters on linearly elastic samples, by means of finite elements simulations and AFM nanomechanical measurements of polyacrylamide gels possessing a thickness gradient. We have systematically investigated the impact of both large indentations and vertical spatial confinement (bottom effect) on the accuracy of the nanomechanical analysis performed with the Hertz model for the parabolic indenter compared to the Sneddon model for the spherical indenter. We demonstrated the accuracy of the combined correction of large indentation and bottom effects for the Hertz model proposed in the literature in the framework of linearized force vs indentation curves acquired using spherical indenters, as well as a validation of a new linearized form of the Sneddon model. Our results show that the corrected Hertz model allows to accurately quantify the Young's modulus of elasticity of linearly elastic samples with variable thickness at arbitrarily large indentations.</description>

      <title>Creation of domain-wall Skyrmions in chiral magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the capture of a magnetic Skyrmion into a domain wall (DW) structure in chiral magnets and find that in the respective ground states of the DW and the Skyrmion, they repel each other. This means that an isolated magnetic Skyrmion cannot a priori enter the DW and become a DW-Skyrmion. However, rotating the DW's phase away from the stable phase may cause the successful capture and hence creation of a stable bound state of a magnetic Skyrmion and a DW: the DW-Skyrmion. At certain distances, the DW may also destroy the magnetic Skyrmion by inducing shrinkage of the latter. This happens as the isolated magnetic Skyrmion has negative DMI energy, whereas the DW-Skyrmion has positive DMI energy; in a finite range from the DW, the magnetic Skyrmion can be pushed to have vanishing DMI energy, for which it collapses to a point. En passant, we find the possibility of pair creation of a Skyrmion anti-DW-Skyrmion pair and a creation of more than one DW-Skyrmions by a Kibble-like mechanism.</description>

Abstract: We show that a spinor traveling along a helical path develops a spin-orbit coupling because of the curvature of the path. We then estimate the magnitude of this effective geometric spin-orbit interaction for structures that showcase chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). We find that this chirality-induced spin-orbit coupling ($\chi$-SOC), in conjunction with broken time-reversal symmetry, may be an important ingredient for the microscopic underpinning of the CISS phenomenon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatially indirect excitons in semiconductor quantum wells are relevant to basic research and device applications because they exhibit enhanced tunability, delocalized wave functions, and potentially longer lifetimes relative to direct excitons. Here we investigate the properties of indirect excitons and their coupling interactions with direct excitons in asymmetric InGaAs double quantum wells using optical multidimensional coherent spectroscopy and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy. Analyses of the spectra confirm a strong influence of many-body effects, and reveal that excited-state zero-quantum coherences between direct and indirect excitons in the quantum wells dephase faster than the much higher-energy single-quantum coherences between excitonic excited states and ground states. The results also suggest an important energy-dependent role of continuum states in mediating system dynamics, and they indicate that dephasing mechanisms are associated with uncorrelated or anticorrelated energy-level fluctuations.</description>

Abstract: We highlight recent advances in the controlled creation of single-photon emitters in van der Waals materials and in the understanding of their atomistic origin. We focus on quantum emitters created in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, which provide spectrally sharp single-photon emission at cryogenic temperatures, and the ones in insulating hBN, which provide bright and stable single-photon emission up to room temperature. After introducing the different classes of quantum emitters in terms of band-structure properties, we review the defect creation methods based on electron and ion irradiation as well as local strain engineering and plasma treatments. A main focus of the review is put on discussing the microscopic origin of the quantum emitters as revealed by various experimental platforms, including optical and scanning probe methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address that the stray magnetic field emitted by the excited quantum states of the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers is spin-momentum locked, such that the spin transfer to nearby ferromagnetic nanostructures is unidirectional. This may allow the controlled excitation of propagating magnons by NV centers in diamond. A pair of NV spin qubits exchange virtual magnons in a magnetic nanowire in a chiral manner that leads to directional quantum entanglement. A magnon-based ``quantum-entanglement isolator" should be a useful device in future quantum information technology.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-field-induced nonlocal transport in the topological semimetal ZrTe$_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlocal transport, which goes beyond the Ohm's law, can be a key in understanding systems with topological order or edge states. Here we report an unusual nonlocal charge transport in the nodal-line semimetal ZrTe$_5$ that occurs in the ultra-quantum limit driven by the magnetic field applied along the $a$-axis. Surprisingly, the observed decay length of the nonlocality exceeds 100 $\mu$m and it increases linearly with the sample width. This nonlocal transport is detected not only in the longitudinal configuration, but also in the transverse one as an unusual nonlocal Hall effect. Our findings demonstrate that the nonlocal response can offer unprecedented insights into topological quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Scalable Dip-Coated Bragg Mirrors for Strong Light-Matter Coupling with 2D Perovskites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a scalable and cost-effective method for fabricating high-performance Bragg mirrors using a bottom-up approach that combines evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) and dip-coating. The photonic crystals are composed of alternating mesoporous SiO$_2$ and dense TiO$_2$ layers, providing a high refractive index contrast ($\sim$0.8). This enables strong reflectance (up to 96%) with as few as five bilayers and precise control of the photonic stop band across the visible spectrum by simply adjusting the deposition parameters. Integration of a thin film of the two-dimensional perovskite (PEA)$_2$PbI$_4$ leads to strong light--matter coupling at room temperature. Angle-resolved reflectance and photoluminescence measurements reveal the formation of upper and lower polariton branches, with a Rabi splitting of 90 meV. The observed polaritonic dispersion is well described by a two-level system and Green's function formalism. This work demonstrates an efficient strategy for constructing tunable optical cavities using simple solution-based methods. The combination of high optical quality, spectral tunability, and strong coupling performance positions this platform as a promising candidate for low-threshold polariton lasers, nonlinear optics, and integrated optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnetism provides new routes to realize Majorana zero modes with vanishing net magnetization. We consider a recently proposed heterostructure consisting of a semiconducting wire on top of an altermagnet and with proximity-induced superconductivity. We demonstrate that rotating the wire serves as a tuning knob to induce the topological phase. For $d$-, $g$- and $i$-wave altermagnetic pairing, we derive angle-dependent topological gap-closing conditions. We derive symmetry constraints on angles where the induced altermagnetism must vanish, which we verify by explicit models. Our results imply that a bent or curved wire realizes a spatially-dependent topological invariant with Majorana zero modes pinned to positions where the topological invariant changes. This provides a new experimental set-up whereby a single wire can host both topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes without $in$ $situ$ tuning.</description>

Abstract: The study of anyons in topologically ordered quantum systems has mainly relied on edge-state interferometry. However, realizing controlled braiding of anyons necessitates the ability to detect and manipulate individual anyons within the bulk. Here, we propose and theoretically investigate a first step toward this goal by demonstrating that a long-lived, optically generated interlayer exciton can bind to a quasihole in a fractional quantum Hall state, forming a composite excitation we term an anyon-trion. Using exact diagonalization, we show that mobile anyon-trions possess a binding energy of approximately 0.5 meV, whereas static anyon-trions exhibit a binding energy of about 0.9 meV, that is linearly proportional to the quasiholes fractional charge. An experimental realization based on photoluminescence from localized interlayer excitons in a quantum twisting microscope setup should allow for a direct optical observation of anyon-trions.</description>

      <title>Transversality-Enforced Tight-Binding Models for 3D Photonic Crystals aided by Topological Quantum Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18257v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tight-binding models can accurately replicate the band structure and topology of crystalline systems. They have been widely used in solid-state physics due to their versatility and low computational cost. It is straightforward to build an accurate tight-binding model of any crystalline system using the crystal's maximally localized Wannier functions as a basis. Unfortunately, in 3D photonic crystals, the transversality condition of Maxwell's equations precludes the construction of a basis of maximally localized Wannier functions via usual techniques. As a result, building reliable tight-binding models of 3D photonic crystals has not been straightforward up to now. In this work, we show how to overcome this problem using topological quantum chemistry, allowing us to express the band structure of the photonic crystal as a difference of band representations. This can be achieved by introducing a set of auxiliary modes, as recently proposed in Christensen et al., Phys. Rev. X 12, 021066 (2022), which regularizes the Gamma-point obstruction arising from the transversality constraint of Maxwell's equations. The decomposition into elementary band representations allows us to isolate a set of pseudo-orbitals that permit us to construct an accurate transversality-enforced tight-binding model that matches the dispersion, symmetry content, and topology of the 3D photonic crystal under study. Moreover, we show how to introduce the effects of a gyrotropic bias in the framework, modeled via non-minimal coupling to a static magnetic field. Our work provides the first systematic method to analytically model the photonic bands of the lowest transverse modes over the entire Brillouin zone via a transversality-enforced tight-binding model.</description>

Abstract: We add the magnetic degrees of freedom to the widely used Gaussian Approximation Potential of machine learning (ML) and present a model that describes the potential energy surface of a crystal based on the atomic coordinates as well as their noncollinear magnetic moments. Assuming an adiabatic approximation for the spin directions and magnitudes, the ML model depends solely on spin coordinates and orientation, resulting in computational efffciency and enabling ab initio spin dynamics. Leveraging rotational symmetries of magnetic interactions, the ML model can incorporate various magnetic interactions, expanding into two-body, three-body terms, etc., following the spirit of cluster expansion. For simplicity, we implement the ML model with a two-body form for the exchange interaction. Comparing total energies and local fields predicted by the model for noncollinear spin arrangements with explicit results of constrained noncollinear density functional calculations for bcc Fe yields excellent results, within 1 meV/spin for the total energy. Further optimization, including three-body and other terms, is expected to encompass diverse magnetic interactions and enhance the model's accuracy. This will extend the model's applicability to a wide range of materials and facilitate the machine learning ab initio spin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Mixing of counterpropagating signals in a traveling-wave Josephson device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light waves do not interact in vacuum, but may mix through various parametric processes when traveling in a nonlinear medium. In particular, a high-amplitude wave can be leveraged to frequency convert a low-amplitude signal, as long as the overall energy and momentum of interacting photons are conserved. These conditions are typically met when all waves propagate in the medium with comparable phase velocity along a particular axis. In this work, we investigate an alternative scheme by which an input microwave signal propagating along a 1-dimensional Josephson metamaterial is converted to an output wave propagating in the opposite direction. The interaction is mediated by a pump wave propagating at low phase velocity. In this regime, the input signal is exponentially attenuated as it travels down the device. We exploit this process to implement a robust on-chip microwave isolator that can be reconfigured into a reciprocal and tunable coupler. The device mode of operation is selected in situ, along with its working frequency over a wide microwave range. We measure an isolation over 5 dB in the 5-8.5 GHz range and over 10 dB in the 7-8.5 GHz range on a typical bandwidth of 200 MHz. Substantial margin for improvement exists through design optimization and by reducing fabrication disorder, opening new avenues for microwave routing and processing in superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Impurity states in altermagnetic superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01008v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetic superconductors offer the possibility of exploring unconventional superconductivity, including topological states and finite-momentum superconductivity, with promising applications in spintronics and quantum information. However, a direct experimental confirmation of their existence remains elusive. In this work, we propose non-magnetic impurities as probes of the interplay between altermagnetism and superconductivity. These impurities induce spin-polarized subgap states whose spatial extension reflects the magnetic order of the substrate material. Depending on whether or not the impurity respects the bulk symmetries, these states form spin-degenerate or spin-split doublets. An external magnetic field aligned with the N\'eel vector can further control the doublet splitting. We further demonstrate that coupling between impurity states leads to a position-dependent, spin-sensitive hybridization, enabling another approach for \textit{in situ} control of atomic-size quantum devices. These findings provide unambiguous experimental signatures of altermagnetic superconductivity accessible via local measurements such as scanning tunneling microscopy and open unexplored pathways for designing tunable quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic preparation of a number-conserving atomic Majorana phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a protocol to adiabatically prepare the ground state of a widely discussed number-conserving model Hamiltonian for ultracold atoms in optical lattices that supports Majorana edge states. In particular, we introduce a symmetry breaking mass term that amounts to threading a commensurate (artificial) magnetic flux through the plaquettes of the considered two-leg ladder which opens a constant bulk gap. This enables the preparation of the topological Majorana phase from a trivial Mott insulator state with optimal asymptotic scaling of the ramp time in system size, which is linear owing to the critical nature of the target state. Using constructive bosonization techniques that account for both finite size effects and global fermion number conservation, we are able to fully explain with theory the somewhat counterintuitive necessity of the aforementioned commensurate flux for a controlled bulk gap. Our analytical predictions are corroborated and quantified by unbiased numerical matrix product states (MPS) simulations. Directly building up on previous experimental work, the crucial flux-term of the proposed protocol is feasible with state-of-the-art experimental techniques in atomic quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Continuous and Reversible Electrical Tuning of Fluorescent Decay Rate via Fano Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the decay rates of a fluorescent molecule can be controlled by electrically shifting a transparency introduced by a Fano resonance. An auxiliary quantum object (QO), located at the hotspot of a plasmonic nanoparticle, suppresses plasmonic excitation at its level spacing {\omega}_QO. As a result, the local density of states (LDOS) associated with the plasmonic spectrum is also suppressed at {\omega}={\omega}_QO. By shifting {\omega}_QO via an applied voltage, we continuously tune the radiative and nonradiative decay rates of the fluorescent molecule by up to two orders of magnitude. This mechanism offers a valuable tool for integrated quantum technologies, enabling on-demand entanglement and single-photon sources, voltage-controlled quantum gate operations, and electrical control of superradiant-like phase transitions. The approach also holds promise for applications in super-resolution microscopy and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).</description>

      <title>Semi-group influence matrices for non-equilibrium quantum impurity models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for describing the real-time dynamics of quantum impurity models out of equilibrium which is based on the influence matrix approach. By replacing the dynamical map of a large fermionic quantum environment with an effective semi-group influence matrix (SGIM) which acts on a reduced auxiliary space, we overcome the limitations of previous proposals, achieving high accuracy at long evolution times. This SGIM corresponds to a uniform matrix-product state representation of the influence matrix and can be obtained by an efficient algorithm presented in this paper. We benchmark this approach by computing the spectral function of the single impurity Anderson model with high resolution. Further, the spectrum of the effective dynamical map allows us to obtain relaxation rates of the impurity towards equilibrium following a quantum quench. Finally, for a quantum impurity model with on-site two-fermion loss, we compute the spectral function and confirm the emergence of Kondo physics at large loss rates.</description>

      <title>Tuning of Josephson junctions -- the effects of depinning physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building more powerful quantum computers requires manufacturing processes with tight tolerances. To improve the tolerances on Josephson junctions, techniques to fine tune their properties after fabrication have been developed. Understanding how tuning techniques may physically modify the tunnel barrier of a Josephson junction is important and will enable these techniques to be optimised. We develop a model of junction tuning based on depinning theory to interpret a phase diagram of tuning rate. We extract the dependence on temperature, time-varying voltages and oscillation frequency. Using depinning theory we are able to show both why time-varying annealing potentials result in controlled junction tuning and how such protocols can be optimised. We examine how tuning changes the electrical breakdown of barriers and discrepancies between modeled and measured higher energy levels of transmon qubits.</description>

      <title>Layered Topological Antiferromagnetic Metal at Room Temperature -- YbMn$_2$Ge$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metallic antiferromagnets are essential for efficient spintronic applications due to their fast switching and high mobility, yet room-temperature metallic antiferromagnets are rare. Here, we investigate YbMn$_2$Ge$_2$, a room temperature antiferromagnet, and establish it as an exfoliable layered metal with altermagnetic surface states. Using multi-orbital Hubbard model calculations, we reveal that its robust metallic AFM ordering is stabilized by electronic correlations and a partially nested Fermi surface. Furthermore, we show that YbMn$_2$Ge$_2$ hosts symmetry-protected topological Dirac crossings, connecting unique even-order spin-polarized surface states with parabolic and inverted Mexican-hat-like dispersion. Our findings position YbMn$_2$Ge$_2$ as a promising platform for exploring the interplay of correlation, topology, and surface altermagnetism of layered antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Four-terminal Josephson junctions: diode effects, anomalous currents and transverse currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19376v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a multi-terminal Josephson junction consisting of a central spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) region with an in-plane Zeeman field connected to four superconducting terminals. This setup allows for the simultaneous measurement of both longitudinal and transverse Josephson currents in response to a phase bias and provides a platform to probe the planar Hall effect in superconducting transport. We find that the system exhibits anomalous Josephson effect (AJE) and Josephson diode effect (JDE) when the symmetry between opposite momentum modes is broken in SOC region. Specifically, breaking the symmetry between $k_x$ and $-k_x$ results in JDE and AJE in the longitudinal Josephson current, while breaking the symmetry between $k_y$ and $-k_y$ leads to a finite transverse Josephson current that also exhibits JDE and AJE. Transverse Josephson diode effect coefficient attains values as large as $500\%$ for realistic set of parameters. Furthermore, for specific parameter choices, the current-phase relation in the transverse direction supports unidirectional transport, highlighting its potential for superconducting circuit applications. Our setup offers a new route to engineering nonreciprocal superconducting transport.</description>

      <title>Metallicity-driven polar transitions in topological epilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polar metals, materials that exhibit both electric polarization and high conductivity, can also host topological phases. Because free carriers strongly suppress distortive polar order and change the Fermi level, controlling charge dynamics is crucial for simultaneously tuning ferroelectric and topological phases in the same material. Here, we explore the experimental conditions that enable access to these phases in bismuth-doped Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Te epilayers. For samples in the topological phase at $x = 0.5$, we use terahertz time-domain spectroscopy to evaluate their complex permittivity as a function of temperature. We observe a non-monotonic variation in carrier concentration with bismuth doping, indicating a change in carrier type. By tracking the transverse optical phonon mode, we identify a ferroelectric phase transition when distortive polar order emerges below a critical temperature that depends on carrier concentration. We show that bismuth doping controls the metallicity-dependent order parameters in the softening and hardening phases. Our work demonstrates a tunable platform for engineering exotic states of matter that integrate metallicity, ferroelectricity and topology.</description>

      <title>Unusual Electron-Phonon Interactions in Highly Anisotropic Two-Dimensional $Ta_2$$Ni_3$$Te_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron-phonon interactions (EPIs) represent a fundamental cornerstone of condensed matter physics, commanding persistent attention due to their pivotal role in driving novel quantum phenomena within low-dimensional materials. Here, we unveil unusual anisotropic electron-phonon coupling behaviors in quasi-one-dimensional $Ta_2$$Ni_3$$Te_5$ nano-flakes through a powerful combination of angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy and density functional perturbation theory (DFPT). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy directly visualize the pronounced quasi-one-dimensional atomic chains within the crystal structure, establishing a structural foundation for the observed anisotropic interactions. Our Raman investigations reveal remarkable polarization-dependent responses in $A_g$ phonon modes that deviate significantly from conventional behavior, which our theoretical analyses attribute to complex anisotropic electron-photon and electron-phonon interactions. Temperature-dependent Raman measurements further uncover an intriguing phonon decay mechanism involving both three- and four-phonon processes, with the latter showing significant contributions in some modes - a possible manifestation of strong anisotropic electron-phonon interactions. Beyond revealing $Ta_2$$Ni_3$$Te_5$ as an exceptional platform for exploring anisotropic EPIs, this work demonstrates that integrating angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy with DFPT calculations offers a powerful methodology for investigating electron-phonon interactions in emerging low-dimensional quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Observation of Berry Curvature-Enhanced Anomalous Photo-Nernst Effect in Magnetic Weyl Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The anomalous Nernst effect is the thermoelectric counterpart of the anomalous Hall effect, which can emerge in magnetic materials or topological materials without magnetic field. Such effect is critical to both fundamental topological physics and various application fields, including energy harvesting, spintronics and optoelectronics. In this work, we observe the anomalous photo-Nernst effect, which use light excitation to generate temperature gradients for the thermoelectric response. Our experiments reveal a pronounced edge photocurrent response in magnetic Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2 under zero magnetic field, originating from the anomalous photo-Nernst effect. The pronounced photo-Nernst current benefits from the exceptional properties of Co3Sn2S2, including the large thermoelectric coefficient, topologically enhanced anomalous response of Weyl bands and the Shockley-Ramo nature of long-range photocurrent generation. Furthermore, by comparing the nominal anomalous Nernst coefficient under different wavelength excitations, we observe a clear enhancement in the mid-infrared region, originating from the topological contribution from the large Berry curvature of Weyl bands. Our results reveal the interplay among light, magnetism, and topological order in magnetic Weyl semimetals, which not only offers insights for fundamental physics but also advances potential applications in quantum devices.</description>
