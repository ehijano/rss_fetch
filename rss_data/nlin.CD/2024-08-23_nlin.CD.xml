      <title>Diagnosing the pattern effect in the atmosphere-ocean coupled system through linear response theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energy surplus resulting from radiative forcing causes warming of the Earth system. This initial warming drives a myriad of changes including in sea surface temperatures (SSTs), leading to different radiative feedbacks. The relationship between the radiative feedbacks and the pattern of SST changes is referred to as the "pattern effect". The current approach to study the pattern effect relies on diagnosing the response of atmosphere-only models to perturbations in the SST boundary condition. Here, we argue that the fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR), together with coarse-graining procedures, is a computationally cheap and theoretically grounded alternative to model experiments. We introduce a protocol to study the pattern effect and present its application in a state-of-the-art coupled climate model. By focusing on the coupled dynamics, we unveil the role of the slow ocean component in setting the pattern effect. We present a new "sensitivity map", representing a first, qualitative prediction of the response of the average top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) radiative flux to perturbations in the SST field. We find negative sensitivity throughout the tropics, in contrast to the current understanding of a positive-negative dipole of sensitivity in the tropical Pacific. Considering only the shortest time scales, the response is dominated by the fast atmospheric variability and we recover results in qualitative agreement with the literature. Therefore, the difference between our results and previous studies, largely comes from including the atmosphere-ocean coupling. The framework offers a conceptually novel perspective on the pattern effect: feedbacks in the coupled system are encoded in a temporally and spatially dependent response operator, rather than time-independent maps as for previous studies.</description>

      <title>Longons from the nonlinear dispersion of Galerkin regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08583v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Irregular compactons and peakons from some nonlinear dispersions can be regularized by another type of nonlinear dispersion, defined by a pseudo-differential operator in physical space for the Galerkin truncation preserving finite Fourier modes of wavenumbers no larger than $K$. This resembles yet differs from the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) regularization of the Burgers-Hopf (BH) equation. The Galerkin-regularized compacton, peakon, KdV, and BH dynamics exhibit novel traveling waves and interacting solitonic structures amidst weaker, less-ordered components (`longons'), potentially yielding nontrivial implications for effective field theories and phenomenologies in various domains, including particle and condensed matter physics. Appropriate linear dispersion models can infinitely approximate the longon states. Time-dependent and stationary behaviors in the large-$K$ limit are addressed with numerical results.</description>
