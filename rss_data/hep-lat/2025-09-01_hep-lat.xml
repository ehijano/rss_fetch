      <title>Long-distance reconstruction of QED corrections to the hadronic vacuum polarization for the muon g-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-distance contribution of QED corrections to the hadronic vacuum polarization is particularly challenging to compute in lattice QCD+QED. Currently, it is one of the limiting factors towards matching the precision of the recent result by the Fermilab E989 experiment for the muon g-2. In this work, we present a method for obtaining high-precision results for this contribution by reconstructing exclusive finite-volume state contributions. We find relations between the pion-photon contributions of individual diagrams and demonstrate the reconstruction method with lattice QCD+QED data at a single lattice spacing of $a^{-1} \approx 1.73$ GeV and $m_\pi \approx 275$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Lattice evidence that scalar glueballs are small</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work reports the first calculation of the gravitational form factors (GFFs) of the scalar glueball, performed via lattice field theory in Yang-Mills theory at a single lattice spacing. The glueball GFFs are compared with those of other hadrons as determined in previous lattice calculations, providing strong indications that glueballs have a different gluonic structure than typical hadronic states. A mass radius of 0.263(31) fm is predicted, supporting previous suggestions that the scalar glueball is significantly smaller than other hadrons. These results point towards a potential smoking-gun characteristic to target by experimental glueball searches.</description>

      <title>Quadrupole forces between quark/gluon subsystems inside higher-spin particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the mechanical interpretation of the forces between quark and gluon subsystems, previously studied for the nucleon, to arbitrary higher-spin particles. For spin-0 and spin-1/2 particles, this force is characterized by the non-conserved $\bar{c}(t)$ form factor. However, such an interpretation has not yet been established for higher-spin particles due to the intricate structure of the non-conserved energy-momentum tensor (EMT) form factors. By performing a multipole expansion, we identify the physically meaningful combinations of the non-conserved covariant EMT form factors and provide them with a clear mechanical interpretation.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic corrections to O($a^2$) effects in lattice QCD with unrooted Staggered quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the asymptotic lattice-spacing dependence $a^2[2b_0\bar{g}^2(1/a)]^{\hat{\gamma}_i}$ relevant for spectral quantities of lattice QCD, when using unrooted Staggered quarks. Without taking any effects from matching into account we find $\min_i\hat{\gamma}_i\approx -0.273, -0.301, -0.913, -2.614$ for $N_\mathrm{f}=0,4,8,12$ respectively. Common statements in the literature on the absence of mass-dimension~5 operators from the on-shell basis of the Symanzik Effective Field Theory action are being clarified for a description using strictly local tastes, here playing the role of continuum quark flavours. Potential impact of $\mathrm{O}(a)$ EOM-vanishing terms beyond spectral quantities is being discussed.</description>

      <title>Isospin-violating vacuum polarization in the muon $(g-2)$ with SU(3) flavour symmetry from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the isospin-violating part $a_\mu^{\text{HVP}, 38}$ of the hadronic-vacuum-polarization (HVP) contribution to the muon $(g-2)$ in lattice QCD at the SU$(3)_{\rm f}$-symmetric point where $M_\pi=M_K\simeq 416$ MeV. All diagrams involving internal photons are evaluated in coordinate space, employing a Pauli-Villars-regulated photon propagator with a cutoff scale $\Lambda$ well below the lattice cutoff. The counterterm $(m_u-m_d)$, whose $\Lambda$ dependence is consistent with the expected logarithmic behaviour, is calibrated using the experimental kaon mass splitting as input. The bare electromagnetic contribution at fixed $\Lambda$ is compared to a phenomenological estimate based on the kaon-loop and pseudoscalar-pole contributions to the forward light-by-light amplitude. An extension of these calculations to physical pion and kaon masses appears promising.</description>

      <title>Center vortices in the novel phase of staggered fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geometry of center vortices is studied in the novel lattice-artefact phase that appears with staggered fermions to elucidate any insight provided by the center-vortex degrees of freedom. For various numbers of fermion flavors, the single-site shift symmetry of the staggered-fermion action is broken in a finite region of the $(\beta, m)$ phase space. Simulations are performed with six degenerate fermion flavors and a range of $\beta$ values that span the phase boundary. Center vortices are demonstrated to capture the broken shift symmetry that manifests in the unphysical phase. This persists at the level of each individual plaquette orientation, where it is revealed that only the plaquettes that span the broken dimension are affected. Several bulk center-vortex quantities, including the vortex and branching point densities, are considered to highlight other aspects of vortex geometry sensitive to the unphysical phase. A slight preference for the plaquettes affected by the broken shift symmetry to be pierced by a vortex is observed. This translates also to a greater branching point density in three-dimensional slices that span the broken dimension. Combined, these findings provide a novel characterization of the unphysical phase in terms of the fundamental center degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>A lattice study of two dimensional SU(2) gauge theories with a single massless Majorana fermion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massless overlap fermions in the real representation of two dimensional $SU(N_c)$ gauge theories exhibit a mod($2$) index due to the rigidity of its spectrum when viewed as a function of the background gauge field - lattice gauge fields on a periodic torus come under two classes; ones that have one set of chirally paired zero modes and ones that do not. Focusing on $SU(2)$ and a single Majorana fermion in an integer representation, $J$; we present numerical evidence that shows only one of these classes survives the continuum limit and this depends on the boundary conditions of the fermion and the gauge field. As such, two of the four possible partition functions are zero in the continuum limit. By defining modified partition functions which do not include the zero modes of the overlap fermions in the fermion determinant, we are able to define an expectation value for a fermion bilinear as ratios of two mixed partition functions. This observable is referred to as the topological condensate and has a non-zero expectation value on any finite physical torus and also has a non-zero limit as the size of the torus is taken to infinity. We study the spectral density of fermions and the scaling of the lowest eigenvalue with the size of the torus to show the absence of any spontaneous symmetry breaking but the emergence of zero modes in the infinite volume limit where it is prohibited in finite volume. These results remain the same for $J = 1, 2, 3, 4$. These results motivate us to propose an independent plaquette model which reproduces the correct physics in the infinite volume limit using a single partition function.</description>

      <title>The Dirac Vacuum in Discrete Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03466v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider introducing the Dirac sea in a quantum cellular automata model of fermions in discrete spacetime which approximates the Dirac equation in the continuum limit. However, if we attempt to fill up the `negative' energy states, we run into a problem. A new boundary is created between positive and negative energy states, at which pair creation seems energetically favourable. This happens because of the modular nature of energy in discrete time models. We then suggest a possible remedy by amending the model, in order to pull states away from the new boundary.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulating continuum field theories with large-spin lattice models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating the real-time dynamics of quantum field theories (QFTs) is one of the most promising applications of quantum simulators. Regularizing a bosonic QFT for quantum simulation purposes typically involves a truncation in Hilbert space in addition to a discretization of space. Here, we discuss how to perform such a regularization of scalar QFTs by explicitly constructing suitable many-body lattice Hamiltonians using multi-level or qudit systems, and show that this enables quantitative predictions in the continuum limit by extrapolating results obtained for large-spin models. With extensive matrix-product state simulations, we numerically demonstrate the sequence of extrapolations that leads to quantitative agreement of observables for the integrable sine-Gordon (sG) QFT. We further show how to prepare static and moving soliton excitations, and analyze their scattering dynamics in the continuum limit, in agreement with a semi-classical model and with quantitative analytical predictions. Finally, we illustrate how a non-integrable perturbation of the sG model gives rise to dynamics reminiscent of string breaking and plasma oscillations in gauge theories. Our methods are directly applicable in state-of-the-art analog quantum simulators, opening the door to quantitatively investigating a wide variety of scalar field theories and tackling long-standing questions in non-equilibrium QFT like the fate of the false vacuum.</description>
