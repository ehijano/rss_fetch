      <title>Variations on a Theme of Krylov</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spread complexity uses the distribution of support of a time-evolving state in the Krylov basis to quantify dispersal across accessible dimensions of a Hilbert space. Here, we describe how variations in initial conditions, the Hamiltonian, and the dimension of the Hilbert space affect spread complexity and Krylov basis structure. We introduce Koherence, the entropy of coherence between perturbed and unperturbed Krylov bases, which can, e.g., quantify dynamical amplification of differences in initial conditions in chaos. To illustrate, we show that dynamics on SL(2,R), SU(2), and Heisenberg-Weyl group manifolds, often used as paradigmatic settings for contrasting chaotic and integrable (semi-)classical behavior, display distinctively different responses to variations of the initial state or Hamiltonian. We then describe a lattice model that displays linear growth of spread complexity, saturating for bounded lattices and continuing forever in a thermodynamic limit. The latter example illustrates a breakdown of continuum/classical effective descriptions of complexity growth in bounded quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Symplectic structure in open string field theory I: Rolling tachyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a new formula for the symplectic structure on the phase space of open string field theory. Revisiting the setup of Cho, Mazel, and Yin, we use the formula to compute the energy of rolling tachyon solutions on unstable D-branes. An important aspect of the analysis is dealing with the singular ultraviolet behavior of string vertices in Lorentzian signature, a feature we refer to as transgressive locality. This forces us to carry out computations in momentum space, where time and causality are somewhat obscure. Nevertheless the symplectic structure appears to be sensible, giving results in agreement with boundary state computations. As further confirmation of our methods, we study the symplectic structure for rolling tachyons in scalar effective field theory, where vertices show similar high energy behavior to string field theory but the physics is that of local field theory. This model gives interesting insight into the runaway oscillations of the rolling tachyon.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Entanglement Entropy and Edge Modes from Double-Scaled SYK \&amp; Its Connection with Krylov Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate entanglement entropy in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model, its holographic interpretation in terms of edge modes (acting as quantum reference frames); particularly its de Sitter (dS) space limit; and its connection with Krylov complexity. We define subsystems relative to a particle insertion in the boundary theory. This leads to a natural notion of partial trace and reduced density matrices. The corresponding entanglement entropy takes the form of a generalized horizon entropy in the bulk dual; revealing the emergence of edge modes in the entangling surfaces. We match the entanglement entropy of the DSSYK in an appropriate limit to an area computed through a \emph{Ryu-Takayanagi formula} in dS$_2$ space with entangling surfaces at $\mathcal{I}^{\pm}$; providing a first principles example of holographic entanglement entropy for dS$_2$ space. This formula reproduces the Gibbons-Hawking entropy for specific entangling regions points; while it decreases for others. This construction does not display some of the puzzling features in dS holography. The entanglement entropy remains real-valued (since the boundary theory is unitary), and it depends on Krylov state complexity in this limit.</description>

      <title>Seeing double: shock waves and the de Sitter horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a de Sitter observer in his rest frame at late times who observes a particle slightly displaced from unstable equilibrium. Initially, the observer notices an axisymmetric and parity-violating deformation along the trajectory of the displaced particle of his cosmological horizon. On a time scale of order $\ell$, the de Sitter radius, the particle is nearly absorbed by the cosmological horizon and has been accelerated to an ultra-relativistic speed and thus is well approximated as a shock wave. In the shock wave limit, the observer sees an axisymmetric deformation of his horizon with parity restored, which we interpret as arising due to a particle from the complementary static patch. We comment on the holographic implications of this result and note that there is no need to extend the holographic screen of de Sitter spacetime beyond the empty static patch to account for this signal.</description>

      <title>Holographic black hole formation and scrambling in time-ordered correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a holographic mechanism for black hole formation via the collision of two shockwaves in three-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime. In the dual conformal field theory (CFT), a two-shockwave state corresponds to the insertion of two boosted precursor operators in complementary Rindler patches. Their operator product expansion is initially described by a universal mean field spectrum of exchanged states, which is dominated by operator dimensions that grow exponentially in the boost parameter. We propose their mean value as diagnosing the mass of the collision product in the bulk. It crosses the CFT heavy state threshold after two scrambling times, in accordance with expectations about black hole formation in general relativity. Our analysis also allows us to identify the scrambling characteristics usually associated with out-of-time-order correlation functions, using only the internal composition of thermal in-time-order correlators.</description>

      <title>Graded S-Matrices, Generalised Gibbs Ensembles and Fractional-Spin CDD Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a class of two-dimensional integrable quantum field theories that carry an internal $\mathbb{Z}_n$ structure. These models extend factorised scattering beyond the conventional framework, featuring both the usual hierarchy of integer-spin conserved charges and an additional tower of fractional-spin ones. Our construction relies on a reparametrisation of rapidity space that lifts standard scattering amplitudes to a multiplet related by an internal cyclic symmetry. This construction is naturally embedded within a generalised Gibbs ensemble, which provides the natural framework for a consistent graded Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz. This leads to new Y-systems encoding the graded spectrum. In a special case, these functional relations match those obtained via the ODE/IM correspondence from the monodromy analysis of the quantum cubic oscillator. Even in the simplest models, for one sign of the auxiliary temperature, the finite-volume ground-state energy spectrum undergoes an infinite sequence of level-crossing phenomena as the coupling strength increases. A preliminary analysis also suggests that these theories exhibit structural connections with cyclic orbifolds. Within this setup, one can consistently include extra CDD factors that realise fractional-spin analogues of the $T\bar{T}$ deformation. In analytically tractable cases, a Hagedorn-like behaviour is observed for a sign of the flow parameter, and the deformed spectrum develops a finite limiting temperature.</description>

      <title>Transient de Sitter and Quasi de Sitter States in SO(32) and E_8 x E_8 Heterotic String Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the long-standing puzzles in string theory has been on the existence of a four-dimensional de Sitter and quasi de Sitter configurations, the latter being defined with a temporally varying dark energy, in E_8 x E_8 and SO(32) heterotic theories. In this work, novel dynamical duality-sequences are devised that provide natural constructions of de Sitter and quasi de Sitter excited states in the aforementioned theories allowing no late-time singularities. The emergent positive dark energies -- including the intriguing possibility of their slow temporal variations -- appear from Borel resumming Gevrey series from the path-integral representations of such states. Additionally, precise ways to handle the equations of motion, Bianchi identities, flux quantizations and anomaly cancellations -- consistent with the underlying axionic cosmology and with the probability of forming wormholes that connect baby universes -- are presented for the SO(32) and the E_8 x E_8 theories within a framework that systematically incorporates perturbative and non-perturbative corrections in the far infrared. The temporally varying dark energy, which is much more natural in our set-up because of its emergent nature, surprisingly simplifies many of the aforementioned computations. Interestingly, our analysis also provides, probably for the first time, a set-up to consistently embed four-dimensional standard model degrees of freedom at late time in a realistic gravitational background with positive dark energy from string theory.</description>

      <title>Limits on the Statistical Description of Charged de Sitter Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermodynamics of de Sitter black holes is complicated by the presence of two horizons and the absence of a globally defined timelike Killing vector. The standard choice of the Gibbons-Hawking Killing vector is at odds with the interpretation of the surface gravity as an acceleration measured by a physical observer at rest. Focusing on four-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter black holes we show that this issue can be resolved by adopting a normalization originally proposed by Bousso and Hawking, which defines thermodynamic quantities relative to the unique freely-falling observer at a fixed radial coordinate. Within this framework, we derive new first laws for the black hole and cosmological horizon and re-examine the black hole's heat capacity. We find that the heat capacity remains finite in the near-extremal Nariai limit, thus averting a breakdown of the semi-classical thermodynamic description. However, the heat capacity does vanish in the cold limit, as expected, and for Nariai black holes in the ultracold limit, indicating that fundamental limitations on the statistical description persist in these regimes. We discuss the implications of our results for log-$T$ corrections to near-extremal de Sitter black holes.</description>

      <title>The Universal Floquet Modes of (Quasi)-Breathers and Oscillons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Just as linearized perturbations of time-independent configurations can be decomposed into normal modes, those of periodic systems can be decomposed into Floquet modes, which each evolve by a fixed phase over one period. We show that in the case of a (1+1)-dimensional relativistic field theory with a single scalar of mass $m$, all breathers, quasi-breathers and oscillons of length $1/\epsilon$ have identical nonrelativistic Floquet modes at leading order in an $\epsilon/m$ expansion. More precisely, these Floquet modes depend only on $\epsilon$ and $m$, and are independent of the potential of the theory. In particular, there is a continuum of Floquet modes corresponding to each real momentum plus four discrete modes corresponding to space translations, time translations, boosts and amplitude changes. There are no discrete shape modes. We provide simple, explicit formulas for these universal leading-order, nonrelativistic Floquet modes.</description>

      <title>String geometry phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a potential for string backgrounds is obtained from string geometry theory, which is a candidate for the non-perturbative formulation of string theory. By substituting a string phenomenological model with free parameters to the potential, one obtains a potential for the free parameters, whose minimum determines the free parameters. The model with the determined parameters is the ground state in the model. This will be the local minimum in a partial region of the model in the string theory landscape. By comparing it with the other local minimum, one can determine which model is near the minimum of the potential for string backgrounds, that will be the true vacuum in string theory, in the sense of the values of the potential. We will be able to find the true vacuum in string theory through a series of such researches. In this paper, we perform this analysis of a certain simple heterotic non-supersymmetric model explicitly, where the six-dimensional internal spaces are products of two-dimensional spaces of constant curvatures, and the generation number of massless fermions is given by the flux quantization numbers. As a result, we obtain a constraint between the compactification scale and the flux quanta.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Vacuum Self-Consistency Principle: Emergent Dynamics of Spacetime and the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The principle of self-consistency of the quantum vacuum postulates that the classical backgrounds we observe -- spacetime, gauge fields, and the Higgs condensate -- are macroscopic order parameters of a single quantum state sustained by its own fluctuations. Building on this postulate, a background-field, heat-kernel based derivation is developed that yields the coupled low-energy effective field equations for the metric, gauge, and Higgs fields as vacuum "equations of state." The framework rigorously recovers the Einstein, Yang-Mills, and Higgs equations, augmented by the higher-derivative operators required by quantum consistency. Phenomenological consequences follow. First, the anomaly- and loop-induced R^2 operator generically drives Starobinsky-type inflation, compatible with Planck data. Second, the universally calculable quantum correction to Newton's potential and the Yukawa tails from massive spin-0 and spin-2 modes are quantified and shown to satisfy laboratory bounds. Third, constraints from GW170817 enforce luminal gravitational wave speed. The theory is predictive in its inflationary sector and in its universal low-energy corrections to gravity, reducing to General Relativity and the Standard Model at accessible scales with controlled corrections.</description>

      <title>Peierls instability for systems with several Fermi surfaces: an example from the chiral Gross-Neveu model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As is well known, the chiral Gross-Neveu model at finite density can be solved semi-classically with the help of the chiral spiral mean field. The fermion spectrum has a single gap right at the Fermi energy, a reflection of the Peierls instability. Here, we divide the N fermion flavors up into two subsets to which we attribute two different densities. The Hartree-Fock ground state of such a system can again be found analytically, using as mean field the ``twisted kink crystal" of Basar and Dunne. Its spectrum displays two gaps with lower edges coinciding with the two Fermi energies. This solution is favored over the homogeneous one, providing us with an explicit example of a multiple Peierls instability.</description>

      <title>Automorphism-weighted ensembles from TQFT gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the recent proposal of arXiv:2405.20366 which poses a precise holographic duality between a 3d TQFT summed over all topologies and a unitary ensemble of boundary 2d CFTs. In that proposal, the sum over topologies is obtained via genus reduction from topologies with a large genus boundary Riemann surface, while the boundary ensemble is given by all CFTs described by Lagrangian condensations of the bulk TQFT. The main result of this work is to show that each member of this ensemble is weighted by a symmetry factor given by the invertible symmetry group of its categorical symmetry relative to the bulk TQFT as its SymTFT. This is the natural $\unicode{x2014}$ uniform up to isomorphism $\unicode{x2014}$ measure on the groupoid of Lagrangian algebras that describe the boundary theories. We also write the sum over topologies more explicitly in terms of equivalence classes of Heegaard splittings of 3-manifolds with a given boundary and comment on their weights. The holographic duality in this framework can then be viewed as a generalization of the Siegel-Weil formula. We discuss the implications of the main result for non-compact TQFTs. In particular, for the Virasoro case, this implies an ensemble of all CFTs at a given central charge in which CFTs are weighted by their full invertible symmetry. Finally, we show how this TQFT gravity framework gives a natural construction of the baby universe Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariance from quantum information principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is a hallmark of quantum theory, yet it alone does not capture the full extent of quantum complexity: some highly entangled states can still be classically simulated. Non-classical behavior also requires magic, the non-Clifford component that enables universal quantum computation. Here, we investigate whether the interplay between entanglement and magic constrains the structure of fundamental interactions. We study gluon-gluon and graviton-graviton scattering at tree level, explicitly breaking gauge and general covariance by modifying the quartic vertices and analyzing the resulting generation of entanglement and magic. We find that imposing maximal entanglement (MaxEnt) alone does not uniquely recover gauge-invariant and diffeomorphism-invariant interactions, but adding the condition of minimal, but nonzero, magic singles it out. Our results indicate that nature favors MaxEnt and low magic: maximal quantum correlations with limited non-Cliffordness, sufficient for universal quantum computing but close to classical simulability. This dual informational principle may underlie the emergence of gauge invariance in fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry Breaking with Fields, Strings and Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first part of this review tries to provide a self-contained view of supersymmetry breaking from the bottom-up perspective. We thus describe N=1 supersymmetry in four dimensions, the Standard Model and the MSSM, with emphasis on the ``soft terms'' that can link it to supergravity. The second part deals with the top-down perspective. It addresses, insofar as possible in a self-contained way, the basic setup provided by ten-dimensional strings and their links with supergravity, toroidal orbifolds, Scherk-Schwarz deformations and Calabi-Yau reductions, before focusing on a line of developments that is closely linked to our own research. Its key input is drawn from ten-dimensional non-tachyonic string models where supersymmetry is absent or non-linearly realized, and runaway ``tadpole potentials'' deform the ten-dimensional Minkowski vacua. We illustrate the perturbative stability of the resulting most symmetrical setups, which are the counterparts of circle reduction but involve internal intervals. We then turn to a discussion of fluxes in Calabi-Yau vacua and the KKLT setup, and conclude with some aspects of Cosmology, emphasizing some intriguing clues that the tadpole potentials can provide for the onset of inflation. The appendices collect some useful material on global and local N=1 supersymmetry, in components and in superspace, on string vacuum amplitudes, and on convenient tools used to examine the fluctuations of non-supersymmetric string vacua.</description>

      <title>Holographic CCFT Pseudo-Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the flat/CCFT correspondence, Carrollian conformal field theories (CCFT) in d dimensions are dual to asymptotically flat spacetimes in d+1 dimensions. In this paper, starting from the holographic interpretation of pseudo-entropy in the (A)dS$_3$/CFT$_2$, we show that both extremal spacelike and timelike curves possess a well-defined flat-space limit. The length of these curves can be regarded as the real and imaginary parts of the pseudo-entropy for the underlying field theory, where only the real part has been considered thus far. Our calculations can confirm that the entanglement entropy in the CCFTs is fundamentally pseudo-entropy, and these theories are non-unitary.</description>

      <title>Thermal superpotential and thermodynamics of neutral hairy black holes in extended SUGRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a family of exact neutral hairy black-hole solutions with spherical horizon topology in extended supergravity with Fayet--Iliopoulos terms. We consider a consistent dilaton truncation and analyze in detail a sector where the magnetic part of the FI terms vanishes. Using appropriate dilaton counterterms, we compute the thermodynamic quantities and show the existence of Hawking--Page phase transitions. As a holographic application, we derive the thermal superpotential in closed form and use it as a counterterm, explicitly demonstrating that no additional finite counterterms are required to regularize the Euclidean action and the quasi-local stress tensor. The dual stress tensor matches that of a thermal gas of massless particles and is consistent with mixed dilaton boundary conditions that preserve conformal symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Cauchy Slice Holography in de Sitter spacetime. By performing a $T^2$ deformation of a (bottom-up) dS/CFT model, we obtain a holographic theory living on flat Cauchy slices of de Sitter, for which time is an emergent dimension, associated with an RG flow. In this $T^2$-deformed field theory, the dS/CFT is an IR fixed point rather than a UV fixed point, potentially affecting discussions of naturalness. As in the case of AdS/CFT, the terms in the $T^2$ deformation depend on the dimension and the bulk matter sector; in this article we consider gravity, plus optionally a scalar field of arbitrary mass. We compute scalar and graviton two-point correlation functions in the deformed boundary theory, and demonstrate precise agreement with finite-time wavefunction coefficients, which we calculate independently on the bulk side. The results are analytic in the scalar field dimension $\Delta$, and may therefore be continued to arbitrary generic values, including the principal series. Although many aspects of the calculations are similar to the AdS/CFT case, some new features arise due to the complex phases which appear in cosmology. Our calculations confirm previous expectations that the holographic counterterms are purely imaginary, when expressed in terms of wavefunction coefficients. But cosmological correlators, calculated by the Born rule, are shifted in a more complicated and nonlinear way.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the work of Gang, Kang, and Kim arXiv:2405.16377, we propose 3D bulk dual field theories for 2D $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric minimal models $SM(P, Q)$ and $W_{N}$ algebra minimal models $W_{N}(P, Q)$. We associate to $SM(P, Q)$ a Seifert fibered space $S^2((P,P-R),(Q,S),(3,1))$ with $PS-QR=2$, and for $W_{N}(P, Q)$ a Seifert fibered space $S^2((P,P{-}R),(Q,S),(N{+}1,-2N{-}1))$ with $PS-QR=1$, and realize the bulk theory via the 3D-3D correspondence. For the unitary series, the bulk theory flows in the IR to a gapped phase which, under suitable boundary conditions, supports the unitary chiral minimal model on the boundary. For the non-unitary series, the bulk theory flows to the 3D $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal field theory whose topological twist yields a non-unitary topological field theory supporting the non-unitary chiral minimal model on the boundary under appropriate boundary conditions. We also propose UV gauge theory descriptions of the bulk theories obtained by gluing $T[SU(n)]$ building blocks. For $SM(P, Q)$, we provide non-trivial consistency checks -- matching between various bulk partition functions and boundary conformal data -- while for $W_N(P, Q)$, we present preliminary checks and leave further consistency checks for future work.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Casimir densities for a uniformly accelerating mirror in the Fulling-Rindler vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the local characteristics of the Fulling-Rindler vacuum for a massive Dirac field induced by a planar boundary moving with constant proper acceleration in $(D+1)$-dimensional flat spacetime. On the boundary, the field operator obeys the bag boundary condition. The boundary divides the right Rindler wedge into two separate regions, called RL and RR regions. In both these regions, the fermion condensate and the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the energy-momentum tensor are decomposed into two contributions. The first one presents the VEVs in the Fulling-Rindler vacuum when the boundary is absent and the second one is the boundary-induced contribution. For points away from the boundary, the renormalization is reduced to the one for the boundary-free geometry. The total VEVs are dominated by the boundary-free parts near the Rindler horizon and by the boundary-induced parts in the region near the boundary. For a massive field the boundary-free contributions in the fermion condensate and the vacuum energy density and effective pressures are negative everywhere. The boundary-induced contributions in the fermion condensate and the energy density are positive in the RL region and negative in the RR region. For a massless field the fermion condensate vanishes in spatial dimensions $D\geq 2$, while the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor is different from zero. This behavior contrasts with that of the VEVs in the Minkowski vacuum for the geometry of a boundary at rest relative to an inertial observer. In the latter case, the fermion condensate for a massless field is nonzero, while the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor becomes zero.</description>

      <title>Universal holographic Wilson loops in 3d SCFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the vacuum expectation value of half-BPS Wilson loop operators in two families of superconformal $\mathcal{N}=2$ Chern-Simons-matter theories. The first family is dual to AdS$_{4}$ solutions in M-theory, while the second one has a dual description in massive type IIA string theory. Utilizing the properties of the underlying geometry, we provide a universal description for the semiclassical quantization of a probe M2-brane and fundamental string in the respective holographic dual geometries. As a result, we find the one-loop partition function of both the M2-brane and the string which leads to a prediction for the large $N$ behaviour of the Wilson loops in the dual SCFTs. For theories with M-theory duals, we conjecture the full perturbative completion as a ratio of Airy functions.</description>

      <title>Ringdown modulation of acceleration radiation in the Schwarzschild background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analytic, first-order description of how black hole ringdown imprints on the operational signature of near-horizon thermality. Building on a static Schwarzschild baseline in which a freely falling two-level system coupled to a single outgoing mode exhibits geometric photon statistics and a detailed-balance ratio set by the surface gravity, we introduce an even-parity, axisymmetric quadrupolar perturbation and work in an ingoing Eddington-Finkelstein, horizon-regular framework. The perturbation corrects the outgoing eikonal through a gauge-invariant double-null contraction of the metric, yielding a compact redshift map that, when pulled back to the detector worldline, produces a universal, decaying-oscillatory modulation of the Boltzmann exponent at the quasinormal frequency. We derive a closed boundary formula for the response coefficient at the sampling radius, identify the precise adiabatic window in which the result holds, and prove that the modulation vanishes in all stationary limits. Detector specifics (gap, switching wavepacket width) enter only through a smooth prefactor, while the geometric content is captured by the quasinormal pair and the response coefficient. The analysis clarifies that near-horizon "thermality" is robust but not rigid: detailed balance persists as the organizing structure and is gently driven by ringdown dynamics. The framework is minimal yet extensible to other multipoles, parities, and slow rotation, and it suggests direct numerical and experimental cross-checks in controlled analog settings.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Freedom for Holographic Energy Correlators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate energy correlators in a holographic model incorporating elements of asymptotic freedom and confinement. We model a running coupling by considering a geometry with a warp factor that deviates logarithmically from anti-de Sitter (AdS). A novel aspect of our bulk metric is that it smoothly interpolates between a Randall-Sundrum solution with a hard wall and a geometry corresponding to a logarithmic running typical of gauge theories. By studying shockwave deformations of this metric, we compute a two-point energy correlator assuming a high-energy scalar source. This extends techniques recently developed for correlators in asymptotically AdS geometries. We use numerical methods to find the profile of shockwaves along the extra dimension, as it does not admit an analytical form. The running coupling leads to a decay of the two-point correlator at small angular separation, unlike the flat correlator one finds in AdS. In the back-to-back limit we observe an exponential falloff similar to other hard-wall models.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity Meets Confinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In high-energy physics, confinement denotes the tendency of fundamental particles to remain bound together, preventing their observation as free, isolated entities. Interestingly, analogous confinement behavior emerges in certain condensed matter systems, for instance, in the Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields, where domain walls become confined into meson-like bound states as a result of a longitudinal field-induced linear potential. In this work, we employ the Ising model to demonstrate that Krylov state complexity--a measure quantifying the spread of quantum information under the repeated action of the Hamiltonian on a quantum state--serves as a sensitive and quantitative probe of confinement. We show that confinement manifests as a pronounced suppression of Krylov complexity growth following quenches within the ferromagnetic phase in the presence of a longitudinal field, reflecting slow correlation dynamics. In contrast, while quenches within the paramagnetic phase exhibit enhanced complexity with increasing longitudinal field, reflecting the absence of confinement, those crossing the critical point to the ferromagnetic phase reveal a distinct regime characterized by orders-of-magnitude larger complexity and display trends of weak confinement. Notably, in the confining regime, the complexity oscillates at frequencies corresponding to the meson masses, with its power-spectrum peaks closely matching the semiclassical predictions.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Constraints on Charged Black Holes in Scalar--Tensor--Vector Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore charged black holes in Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity (STVG), unveiling their distinctive features across multiple physical domains. Our topological analysis reveals that the STVG coupling parameter $\alpha$ bolsters thermal stability while electromagnetic charge $Q$ weakens it. Using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we find that $\alpha$ amplifies light deflection and enlarges shadow silhouettes, with $Q$ generating opposite effects. Our quantum-corrected models with exponential entropy terms pinpoint phase transitions in the microscopic regime, modifying conventional thermodynamic relationships. Calculations of strong gravitational lensing, shadow geometry, and Hawking emission show clear STVG signatures that diverge from Einstein's predictions. Notably, our accretion disk analysis uncovers an intriguing phenomenon: specific combinations of $\alpha$ and $Q$ can produce radiation patterns resembling spinning Kerr black holes, creating potential identification challenges for observers. These findings establish concrete observational tests for STVG theory through next generation astronomical imaging and lensing campaigns. By connecting theoretical predictions to measurable quantities, we outline specific pathways to confirm or constrain STVG using data from current and future space telescopes.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible Kramers-Wannier duality-symmetry in the trotterized critical Ising chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrable trotterization provides a method to evolve a continuous time integrable many-body system in discrete time, such that it retains its conserved quantities. Here we explicitly show that the first order trotterization of the critical transverse field Ising model is integrable. The discrete time conserved quantities are obtained from an inhomogeneous transfer matrix constructed using the quantum inverse scattering method. The inhomogeneity parameter determines the discrete time step. We then focus on the non-invertible Kramers-Wannier duality-symmetry for the trotterized evolution. We find that the discretization of both space and time leads to a doubling of these duality operators. They account for discrete translations in both space and time. As an interesting application, we find that these operators also provide maps between trotterizations of different orders. This helps us extend our results beyond the trotterization scheme and investigate the Kramers-Wannier duality-symmetry for finite time Floquet evolution of the critical transverse field Ising chain.</description>

If this OCHA is further cyclic and unital in the sense of Kajiura and Stasheff, we produce a BV algebra structure on this cohomology via a cochain-level identity formulated with cyclic brace operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deep connection between black hole thermodynamics and spacetime geometry remains a central focus of general relativity. While recent studies have revealed a precise correspondence for null orbits, given by $K = -\lambda^2$ between the Gaussian curvature $K$ and the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$, its validity for timelike orbits had remained unknown. Our work introduces the massive particle surface (MPS) framework and constructs a new geometric quantity $\mathcal{G}$. We demonstrate that $\mathcal{G} \propto -\lambda^2$ on unstable timelike orbits, thus establishing the geometry-dynamics correspondence for massive particles. Crucially, near the first-order phase transition of a black hole, $\mathcal{G}$ displays synchronized multivalued behavior with the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$ and yields a critical exponent $\delta=1/2$. Our results demonstrate that spacetime geometry encodes thermodynamic information, opening a new pathway for studying black hole phase transitions from a geometric perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experiments devoted to charge parity (CP) violation are normally interpreted by adjusting the elements of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix to the measured violation parameters. However, the physical origin of these violations remains an open issue. To resolve this issue, the impact of Earth's gravity on meson oscillations is analysed. The effect of gravity is to couple flavour oscillations to quark zitterbewegung oscillations, and this coupling induces a superposition of CP eigenstates. The three types of CP violation effects result from this gravity-induced mixing. The three associated violation parameters are predicted in agreement with experimental data. The amplitude of the violation is linear with respect to gravity, so this new mechanism allows us to envisage cosmological evolutions that provide the observed baryonic asymmetry of the universe.</description>

We show that (i) they admit a closed-form expression in terms of finite number of matrix-valued functions without reference to any lattice parameter; (ii) they are obtained as a suitable continuum limit of matrix product operators; (iii) they preserve the entanglement area law directly in the continuum, and in particular they map continuous matrix product states (cMPS) to another cMPS. As an application, we use this ansatz to construct several families of continuous matrix product unitaries beyond quantum cellular automata.</description>

      <title>Addressing the DESI DR2 Phantom-Crossing Anomaly and Enhanced $H_0$ Tension with Reconstructed Scalar-Tensor Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent cosmological data, including DESI DR2, highlight significant tensions within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. When analyzed in the context of General Relativity (GR), the latest DESI data favor a dynamical dark energy (DDE) equation of state, $w(z)$, that crosses the phantom divide line $w=-1$. However, this framework prefers a lower Hubble constant, $H_0$, than Planck 2018, thereby worsening the tension with local measurements. This phantom crossing is a key feature that cannot be achieved by minimally coupled scalar fields (quintessence) within GR. This suggests the need for a new degree of freedom that can simultaneously: (A) increase the best-fit value of $H_0$ in the context of the DESI DR2 data, and (B) allow the crossing of the $w=-1$ line within a new theoretical approach. We argue that both of these goals may be achieved in the context of Modified Gravity (MG), and in particular, Scalar-Tensor (ST) theories, where phantom crossing is a natural and viable feature. We demonstrate these facts by analyzing a joint dataset including DESI DR2, Pantheon+, CMB, and growth-rate (RSD) data in the context of simple parametrizations for the effective gravitational constant, $\mu_G(z) \equiv G_{eff}/G_N$, and the DDE equation of state, $w(z)$. This MG framework significantly alleviates the tension, leading to a higher inferred value of $H_0 = 70.6 \pm 1.7 \, \text{km s}^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1}$. We also present a systematic, data-driven reconstruction of the required underlying ST Lagrangian and provide simple, generic analytical expressions for both the non-minimal coupling $F(\Phi) = 1+\xi\Phi^{2}e^{n\Phi}$ and the scalar potential $U(\Phi) = U_{0}+ae^{b\Phi^{2}}$, which well-describe the reconstructed functions.</description>

      <title>Effective matter sectors from modified entropies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general formalism linking modified entropy functions directly to a modified spacetime metric and, subsequently, to an effective matter sector of entropic origin. In particular, within the framework of general relativity, starting from the first law of black-hole thermodynamics we establish an explicit correspondence between the entropy derivative and the metric function, which naturally leads to an emergent stress-energy tensor representing an anisotropic effective fluid. This backreaction effect of horizon entropy may resolve possible inconsistencies recently identified in black hole physics with modified entropies. As specific examples, we apply this procedure to a wide class of modified entropies, such as Barrow, Tsallis-Cirto, Renyi, Kaniadakis, logarithmic, power-law, loop-quantum-gravity, and exponential modifications, and we derive the associated effective matter sectors, analyzing their physical properties and energy conditions.</description>

Abstract: Within a well-motivated 3-Higgs doublet model, in which the extended dark sector accommodates CP violation, we analyse the electroweak phase transition (EWPT) at one- and two-loop order. We show the importance of higher loop calculations in EWPT analyses and identify the regions of the parameter space of our model where EWPT is of first order while in agreement with all theoretical and experimental bounds, including Dark Matter relic density and direct and indirect searches.</description>

      <title>On the Bondi accretion of a self-interacting complex scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar fields with a global U(1) symmetry often appear in cosmology and astrophysics. We study the spherically-symmetric, stationary accretion of such a classical field onto a Schwarzschild black hole in the test-field approximation. Thus, we consider the relativistic Bondi accretion beyond a simplified perfect-fluid setup. We focus on the complex scalar field with canonical kinetic term and with a generic quartic potential which either preserves the U(1) symmetry or exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is well known that in the lowest order in gradient expansion the dynamics of such a scalar field is well approximated by a perfect superfluid; we demonstrate that going beyond this approximation systematically reduces the accretion rate with respect to the perfect fluid case. Hence, black holes can provide a way to distinguish a perfect fluid from its ultraviolet completion in form of the complex scalar field.</description>

      <title>XYZ integrability the easy way</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sutherland showed that the XYZ quantum spin-chain Hamiltonian commutes with the eight-vertex model transfer matrix, so that Baxter's subsequent tour de force proves the integrability of both. The proof requires parametrising the Boltzmann weights using elliptic theta functions and showing they satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation. We here give a simpler derivation of the integrability of the XYZ chain by explicitly constructing an extensive sequence of conserved charges from a matrix-product operator. We show that they commute with the XYZ Hamiltonian with periodic boundary conditions or an arbitrary boundary magnetic field. A straightforward generalisation yields impurity interactions that preserve the integrability. Placing such an impurity at the edge gives an integrable generalisation of the Kondo problem with a gapped bulk. We make contact with the traditional approach by relating our matrix-product operator to products of the eight-vertex model transfer matrix.</description>

Abstract: We study $U(N)$ SYM theories on spaces with orbifold singularities via an equivalent description in terms of gauge theories on smooth manifolds with insertions of Gukov-Witten and twist defects. The combined effect of the defects is to render the fields multivalued with respect to rotations around the support of the defects. This motivates a relation with theories on branched covers, for which the multivaluedness has a geometric interpretation. We compute the partition function of the theory with defects on a patch and use it as a building block to compute partition functions on several closed spaces with conical singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01290v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit Fujikawa's path integral formulation of the chiral anomaly and develop a generalised framework for systematically defining a regularised functional measure. This construction extends the $\eta$ regularisation scheme to operator language, making the connection between spectral asymmetry and measure transformation fully explicit. Before recovering Fujikawa's expression for the chiral anomaly from the regularised measure, we explore the deeper number-theoretic structure underlying the ill-defined spectral sum associated with the anomaly, interpreting it through the lens of smoothed asymptotics. Our approach unifies two complementary perspectives: the analytic regularisation of Fujikawa and the topological characterisation given by the Atiyah-Singer index theorem. We further investigate how the measure transforms under changes to the regularisation scale and derive a function $\iota_E(\Lambda)$ that encodes this dependence, showing how its Mellin moments govern the appearance of divergences. Finally, we comment on the conceptual relationship between the regularised measure, $\eta$ regularisation, and the generalised Schwinger proper-time formalism, with a particular focus on the two-dimensional Schwinger model.</description>

      <title>Electric-Magnetic Duality for Symmetric Tensor Gauge Theories and Immobile $p$-branes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study electric-magnetic duality in Lorentz invariant symmetric tensor gauge theories, where immobile charged particles - fractons - arise due to the generalized current conservation $\partial_{\mu} \partial_{\nu} J^{\mu \nu} = 0$ and the fracton gauge principle. We show that the duality in the symmetric gauge theories holds only in four-dimensional spacetime. In higher dimensions, the duality does not hold with only the symmetric gauge fields but tensor fields with more complex symmetries come into play. Furthermore, we show that a hierarchy for the symmetric gauge field theories of higher ranks is interpreted by the bi-form calculus. We also discuss the restricted immobility of $p$-branes in the mixed symmetric gauge theories. As a byproduct, we find that novel self-duality conditions are defined as BPS equations in the four-dimensional Euclidean space.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Sectors in Chord Space and Relational Holography in the DSSYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21447v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In holography, gauging symmetries of the boundary theory leads to important modifications in the bulk. In this work, we study constraints to gauge symmetry sectors in the chord Hilbert space of the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) with matter, and we connect them to different proposals of its bulk dual. These sectors include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (resulting from a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy matter chord) used in de Sitter holography. We define and evaluate partition functions and thermal correlation functions of the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems in the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.</description>

      <title>Inflation models selected by the swampland distance conjecture with the Lyth bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the extent to which the Swampland Conjecture can be employed to constrain large-field inflationary models from the perspective of quantum gravity consistency. In particular, we focus on the Swampland Distance Conjecture, which imposes an upper bound on the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves predicted by large-field inflation scenarios. This provides a striking contrast with the well-known Lyth bound, which yields a lower bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio in such models. The two bounds thus play complementary roles in assessing the viability of inflationary scenarios. We demonstrate that, for certain representative large-field inflation models, the Swampland Distance Conjecture alone can impose more stringent upper limits on the tensor-toscalar ratio than current observational constraints from the cosmic microwave background. These findings highlight the utility of Swampland criteria as a theoretical discriminator among competing inflationary models, independent of empirical data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The three-dimensional classical O($N$) model with a boundary has received renewed interest due to the discovery of the extraordinary-log boundary universality class for $2\leq N&lt; N_\text{c}$. The critical value $N_c$ and the exponent of the boundary correlation function are related to certain amplitudes in the normal universality class. To determine their precise values, we revisit the 3d O($N$) boundary conformal field theory for $N=1, 2, 3, 4, 5$. After substantially improving the accuracy of the boundary bootstrap, our determinations are in excellent agreement with the Monte Carlo results, resolving the previous discrepancies due to low truncation orders. We also use the recent bulk bootstrap results to deduce highly accurate Ising data. Many bulk and boundary predictions are obtained for the first time. Our results demonstrate the great potential of the $\eta$ minimization method for many unexplored bootstrap problems in which positivity constraints are absent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07804v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous work on Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity has shown that, at low temperatures, the annealed entropy becomes negative and departs from the quenched entropy. From the perspective of the random-matrix theory (RMT) dual of JT gravity, this effect is encoded in the continuous spectrum at the spectral edge that is universally described by the Airy model. At low temperature, the quenched entropy exhibits a power law dependence determined by the symmetry class of the RMT ensemble. Here we study the same question in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model which possesses much more structure than RMT. Through numerical simulations, we find that the level spacing statistics of the SYK model match the relevant RMT ensembles even near the spectral edge, thus leading to an agreement with the RMT prediction for the power-law behaviour of the quenched entropy at low temperatures. We also show similar effects in supersymmetric wormholes filled with matter, which is modeled by the $\mathcal N = 2$ supersymmetric SYK model. Numerically extracting the spectral edge properties of the BPS operators allows us to compute the quenched entanglement entropy of the wormhole in the large particle number limit.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study non-supersymmetric $O(16)\times O(16)$ heterotic theory on an $AdS_{3}\times S^{3}\times T^{4}$ background, finding a family of vacua parameterized by a pair of flux integers. Adding the one-loop scalar potential to the effective theory contributes positively to the cosmological constant, but we find that there is no uplift to de Sitter for any values of the fluxes. We study the fluctuations around these vacua and show that all scalar and tensor modes from the six-dimensional effective theory lie above the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound. The moduli coming from the torus compactification will also be above the bound, at least for a large range of fluxes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments identify pole-skipping as a `smoking-gun' signature of the hydrodynamic nature of chaos, offering an alternative way to probe quantum chaos in addition to the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC). We study the quantum chaos and pole-skipping phenomenon in the strongly coupled charged rotating fluids, holographically dual to rotating black holes with nontrivial gauge field. We find that the near-horizon equation governing energy-density fluctuations differs from the source-less shock wave equation determining the OTOC, which depends on the $U(1)$ gauge choice. This discrepancy is eliminated under an appropriate boundary condition on the $U(1)$ gauge potential at the event horizon, as required by the vanishing of Wilson loop at the Euclidean horizon. We further investigate the dependence of the butterfly velocity on the charge and rotation parameters in a specific black hole configuration--the Cveti\v{c}-L\"u-Pope solution.</description>

      <title>Islands in Kerr-Newman Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the information paradox in the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman black hole by employing the recently proposed island paradigm. We first consider the quantum field in the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman spacetime. By employing the near-horizon limit, we demonstrate that the field can be effectively described by a reduced two-dimensional field theory. Consequently, the formula of entanglement entropy in CFT$_2$ can be naturally adapted to this reduced two-dimensional theory. Under the framework of this reduced two-dimensional theory, we show that the entanglement entropy of radiation for the non-extremal case satisfies the unitarity in the later stage of the appearance of the entanglement islands. We further examine the impact of angular momentum and charges on the Page time and the scrambling time. Both quantities increases as the angular momentum increases, while decreases as the charge increases. At last, we consider the near extremal case. Resort to the Kerr/CFT correspondence, the near-horizon geometry of near extremal Kerr-Newman black holes can be taken account for a warped AdS geometry. In this scenario, the low-energy effective degrees of freedom are dominated by the Schwarzian zero mode, resulting in a one-loop correction to the partition function. The entanglement entropy is subsequently recalculated under the thermodynamic with corrections. Through explicit calculations, we finally find that the Page time and the scrambling time exhibits quantum delays. This strongly suggests that the near extremal geometry is governed by the Schwarzian dynamics, in which quantum fluctuations result in a reduced rate of information leakage. Our findings further substantiate the conservation of information and extend the applicability of the island paradigm to the most general stationary spacetime background.</description>

Abstract: In this note we introduce some concepts of Species Quantum Mechanics. Specifically, we consider quantum operators that correspond to the species number $N_s$ and the tower mass scale $m_t$ in the context of the swampland distance conjecture. We discuss the commutation relations, a possible wave function, and symplectic duality transformations on the conjugate variables. Furthermore, we argue that the Castellano-Ruiz-Valenzuela (CRV) pattern is a consequence of the canonical commutation rules of moduli space quantum mechanics. We also connect the canonical quantization to the periods of ${\cal N}=2$ Calabi-Yau compactifications to explore other aspects of the CRV pattern, including its possible connection to the Ooguri-Vafa-Verlinde black hole quantization procedure.</description>

      <title>The role of Coulomb branches in 2D gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.10124</link>
      <description>arXiv:1801.10124v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I give a simple construction of certain Coulomb branches $C_{3,4}(G;E)$ of gauge theory in 3 and 4 dimensions defined by Nakajima et al. for a compact Lie group $G$ and a polarisable quaternionic representation $E$. The manifolds $C(G; 0)$ are abelian group schemes (over the bases of regular adjoint $G_c$-orbits, respectively conjugacy classes), and $C(G;E)$ is glued together from two copies of $C(G;0)$ shifted by a rational Lagrangian section $\varepsilon_V$, the Euler class of the index bundle of a polarisation $V$ of $E$. Extending the interpretation of $C_3(G;0)$ as "classifying space" for topological 2D gauge theories, I characterise functions on $C_3(G;E)$ as operators on the equivariant quantum cohomologies of $M\times V$, for all compact symplectic $G$-manifolds $M$. The non-commutative version has an analogous description in terms of the $\Gamma$-function of $V$, appearing to play the role of Fourier transformed J-function of the gauged linear Sigma-model $V/G$.</description>

      <title>Birkhoff's Theorem and Uniqueness: A Peek Beyond General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In General Relativity, Birkhoff's theorem asserts that any spherically symmetric vacuum solution must be static and asymptotically flat. In this paper, we study the validity of Birkhoff's theorem for a broad class of modified gravity theories in four spacetime dimensions, including quadratic and higher-order gravity models. We demonstrate that the Schwarzschild spacetime remains the unique Einstein branch solution outside any spherically symmetric configuration of these theories. Consequently, unlike black holes, the breakdown of junction conditions at the surface of the star further implies that the actual spacetime metric outside a horizonless star in these modified theories cannot simultaneously be spherically symmetric and remain within the Einstein branch. This insight offers a unique observational probe for theories beyond General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Some Aspects of Three-Quark Potentials (Part II)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11234v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue our investigation of the effective string model for the triply heavy quark system, mimicking that in pure $SU(3)$ gauge theory. We present analytical and numerical studies of the three-quark potential for isosceles and collinear geometries. In the general case, we derive the asymptotic expression of the potential in the infrared limit. Here we also demonstrate the universality of the string tension and interpret the transition between two distinct regimes, occurring when one of the triangle's angles formed by the quarks is equal to $\frac{2}{3}\pi$, as a breaking of permutational symmetry. This symmetry breaking implies the emergence of a heavy quark dressed by gluons, transforming in the two-index antisymmetric representation. Additionally, we discuss various aspects of the $Y$- and $\Delta$-laws, diquarks, and connections to lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>A Conservative Theory of Semiclassical Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05237v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that semiclassical gravity can be made consistent by assuming that quantum systems source or are classically affected by a gravitational field only when they undergo certain non-gravitational interactions that give rise to environment-induced decoherence. When systems are not affected by this decoherence-inducing process, they do not source a gravitational field, and the expectation value of their stress-energy tensor does not enter the semiclassical equations describing the gravitational field in a region. In the absence of these interactions in a region, spacetime may be flat. We argue that this can be tested by investigating the gravitational field sourced by quasi-isolated systems and the absence of gravity-mediated entanglement in the Bose-Marletto-Vedral (BMV) experiment, providing distinct predictions. We propose a possible kind of decoherence-inducing interactions that give rise to gravity, which involve chains of causally ordered non-gravitational localized interactions between quantum systems modeled via decoherence and test functions that we call Stable Determination Chains (SDCs). SDCs obey conditions that aim to address the measurement problem and allow for a conservative theory of gravity. It is conservative because it does not need to modify the fundamental equations of quantum theory, unlike spontaneous and gravity-induced collapse approaches to semiclassical gravity, and without invoking relationalism. Furthermore, it does not appeal to nonlocal, retrocausal, or superdeterministic hidden variables. We argue that these SDCs provide additional benefits, such as a semiclassical estimate of the value of the cosmological constant, the prediction of a time-varying cosmological constant that weakens with time, in agreement with some of the recent evidence, and a proposal about how SDCs give rise to gravity.</description>

      <title>Scalable hybrid quantum Monte Carlo simulation of U(1) gauge field coupled to fermions on GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16298v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a GPU-accelerated hybrid quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to solve the fundamental yet difficult problem of $U(1)$ gauge field coupled to fermions, which gives rise to a $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state under the description of (2+1)d quantum electrodynamics QED$_3$. The algorithm renders a good acceptance rate and, more importantly, nearly linear space-time volume scaling in computational complexity $O(N_{\tau} V_s)$, where $N_\tau$ is the imaginary time dimension and $V_s$ is spatial volume, which is much more efficient than determinant QMC with scaling behavior of $O(N_\tau V_s^3)$. Such acceleration is achieved via a collection of technical improvements, including (i) the design of the efficient problem-specific preconditioner, (ii) customized CUDA kernel for matrix-vector multiplication, and (iii) CUDA Graph implementation on the GPU. These advances allow us to simulate the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state with unprecedentedly large system sizes, which is up to $N_\tau\times L\times L = 660\times66\times66$, and reveal its novel properties. With these technical improvements, we see the asymptotic convergence in the scaling dimensions of various fermion bilinear operators and the conserved current operator when approaching the thermodynamic limit. The scaling dimensions find good agreement with field-theoretical expectation, which provides supporting evidence for the conformal nature of the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state in the \qed. Our technical advancements open an avenue to study the Dirac spin liquid state and its transition towards symmetry-breaking phases at larger system sizes and with less computational burden.</description>

      <title>Stellar cooling limits on KK gravitons and dark dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit cooling bounds on light Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravitons, as arise in the dark dimension scenario, considering red giants, neutron stars, and supernovae. In addition to bremsstrahlung, we account for two novel production channels: resonant mixing with the in-medium photon and a pion-induced process in supernovae. The strongest limits arise from SN 1987A, with the emissivity from the pion process exceeding that from bremsstrahlung by a factor of a few. Given present uncertainties, we obtain a bound on the KK mass scale of $m_{\rm KK}\gtrsim 0.6\,{\rm eV}$ $(\gtrsim 500\,{\rm eV})$ for 2 (3) extra dimensions. Improved understanding of the properties of pions in supernovae could strengthen these limits to roughly ${\rm eV}$ $({\rm keV})$. For 1 extra dimension, the bounds are weaker than those from laboratory searches. We also show that constraints from KK graviton decays to Standard Model particles are less stringent than the cooling bounds if there is KK number violation at the level typically assumed in the dark dimension scenario, although these bounds could be strengthened by future observations.</description>

      <title>Exact Regions of Superradiant Instability of Kerr-Newman Black Holes and Massive Scalar Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the superradiant instability of Kerr-Newman black holes in the presence of a massive, charged scalar field using the Vieira-Bezerra-Kokkotas (VBK) method. We study the solutions of the exact polynomial condition for quasibound state frequencies and determine the domain of superradiant instability in parameter space without relying on the hydrogenic approximation or numerics. We derive the minimum scalar mass needed for quasibound states to exist, and identify the precise overlap region between the quasibound and superradiant conditions where instability can occur. We obtain perturbative and exact analytic expressions for the instability boundaries and growth rates, and clarify their relation to previous numerical results. Our analysis reveals how the instability region shifts from nearly neutral Kerr black holes for light fields to highly charged near-extremal Kerr-Newman black holes for heavier fields, while remaining absent in the Reissner-Nordstrom limit.</description>

      <title>The cosmological analysis of DES 3$\times$2pt data from the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3 data using predictions from the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS). Specifically, we fit three two-point observables (3$\times$2pt), galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and cosmic shear, using the one-loop expressions for the projected angular correlation functions. We validate our pipeline against numerical simulations and we check for several internal consistencies before applying it to the observational data. Fixing the spectral tilt and the baryons abundance, we measure $S_8=0.833\pm 0.032$, $\Omega_m = 0.272\pm 0.022$, and $h = 0.773\pm 0.049$, to about $3.8\%$, $8.1\%$, and $6.3\%$, at $68\%$CL, respectively. Our results are consistent at the $\sim 1.5-2\sigma$ level with those from Planck and the BOSS full-shape analyses, as well as with those from DES collaboration 3$\times$2pt analysis combined with a Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis prior and a Planck prior on $n_s$. The shift in the posterior compared to DES collaboration results highlights the impact of modeling, scale cuts, and choice of prior. The theory code and likelihood used for our analyses, \texttt{PyFowl}, is made publicly available.</description>
