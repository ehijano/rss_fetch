      <title>A convergence technique for the game i-Mark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The game of i-Mark is an impartial combinatorial game introduced by Sopena (2016). The game is parametrized by two sets of positive integers $S$, $D$, where $\min D\ge 2$. From position $n\ge 0$ one can move to any position $n-s$, $s\in S$, as long as $n-s\ge 0$, as well as to any position $n/d$, $d\in D$, as long as $n&gt;0$ and $d$ divides $n$. The game ends when no more moves are possible, and the last player to move is the winner. Sopena, and subsequently Friman and Nivasch (2021), characterized the Sprague-Grundy sequences of many cases of i-Mark$(S,D)$ with $|D|=1$. Friman and Nivasch also obtained some partial results for the case i-Mark$(\{1\},\{2,3\})$.
  In this paper we present a convergence technique that gives polynomial-time algorithms for the Sprague-Grundy sequence of many instances of i-Mark with $|D|&gt;1$. In particular, we prove our technique works for all games i-Mark$(\{1\},\{d_1,d_2\})$.
  Keywords: Combinatorial game, impartial game, Sprague-Grundy function, convergence, dynamic programming.</description>

      <title>A QUBO Framework for Team Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The team formation problem assumes a set of experts and a task, where each expert has a set of skills and the task requires some skills. The objective is to find a set of experts that maximizes coverage of the required skills while simultaneously minimizing the costs associated with the experts. Different definitions of cost have traditionally led to distinct problem formulations and algorithmic solutions. We introduce the unified TeamFormation formulation that captures all cost definitions for team formation problems that balance task coverage and expert cost. Specifically, we formulate three TeamFormation variants with different cost functions using quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), and we evaluate two distinct general-purpose solution methods. We show that solutions based on the QUBO formulations of TeamFormation problems are at least as good as those produced by established baselines. Furthermore, we show that QUBO-based solutions leveraging graph neural networks can effectively learn representations of experts and skills to enable transfer learning, allowing node embeddings from one problem instance to be efficiently applied to another.</description>

      <title>Multi-Pass Streaming Lower Bounds for Approximating Max-Cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Max-Cut problem in the streaming model, an algorithm is given the edges of an unknown graph $G = (V,E)$ in some fixed order, and its goal is to approximate the size of the largest cut in $G$. Improving upon an earlier result of Kapralov, Khanna and Sudan, it was shown by Kapralov and Krachun that for all $\varepsilon&gt;0$, no $o(n)$ memory streaming algorithm can achieve a $(1/2+\varepsilon)$-approximation for Max-Cut. Their result holds for single-pass streams, i.e.~the setting in which the algorithm only views the stream once, and it was open whether multi-pass access may help. The state-of-the-art result along these lines, due to Assadi and N, rules out arbitrarily good approximation algorithms with constantly many passes and $n^{1-\delta}$ space for any $\delta&gt;0$.
  We improve upon this state-of-the-art result, showing that any non-trivial approximation algorithm for Max-Cut requires either polynomially many passes or polynomially large space. More specifically, we show that for all $\varepsilon&gt;0$, a $k$-pass streaming $(1/2+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for Max-Cut requires $\Omega_{\varepsilon}\left(n^{1/3}/k\right)$ space. This result leads to a similar lower bound for the Maximum Directed Cut problem, showing the near optimality of the algorithm of [Saxena, Singer, Sudan, Velusamy, SODA 2025].
  Our lower bounds proceed by showing a communication complexity lower bound for the Distributional Implicit Hidden Partition (DIHP) Problem, introduced by Kapralov and Krachun. While a naive application of the discrepancy method fails, we identify a property of protocols called ``globalness'', and show that (1) any protocol for DIHP can be turned into a global protocol, (2) the discrepancy of a global protocol must be small. The second step is the more technically involved step in the argument, and therein we use global hypercontractive inequalities.</description>

      <title>On Gottschalk's surjunctivity conjecture for non-uniform cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gottschalk's surjunctivity conjecture for a group $G$ states that it is impossible for cellular automata (CA) over the universe $G$ with finite alphabet to produce strict embeddings of the full shift into itself. A group universe $G$ satisfying Gottschalk's surjunctivity conjecture is called a surjunctive group. The surjunctivity theorem of Gromov and Weiss shows that every sofic group is surjunctive. In this paper, we study the surjunctivity of local perturbations of CA and more generally of non-uniform cellular automata (NUCA) with finite memory and uniformly bounded singularity over surjunctive group universes. In particular, we show that such a NUCA must be invertible whenever it is reversible. We also obtain similar results which extend to the class of NUCA a certain dual-surjunctivity theorem of Capobianco, Kari, and Taati for CA.</description>

      <title>Directed treewidth is closed under taking butterfly minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Butterfly minors are a generalisation of the minor containment relation for undirected graphs to directed graphs. Many results in directed structural graph theory use this notion as a central tool next to directed treewidth, a generalisation of the width measure treewidth to directed graphs. Adler [JCTB'07] showed that the directed treewidth is not closed under taking butterfly minors. Over the years, many alternative definitions for directed treewidth appeared throughout the literature, equivalent to the original definition up to small functions. In this paper, we consider the major ones and show that not all of them share the problem identified by Adler.</description>

      <title>$\mathsf{P}$-completeness of Graph Local Complementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local complementation of a graph $G$ on vertex $v$ is an operation that results in a new graph $G*v$, where the neighborhood of $v$ is complemented. This operation has been widely studied in graph theory and quantum computing.
  This article introduces the Local Complementation Problem, a decision problem that captures the complexity of applying a sequence of local complementations. Given a graph $G$, a sequence of vertices $s$, and a pair of vertices $u,v$, the problem asks whether the edge $(u,v)$ is present in the graph obtained after applying local complementations according to $s$. The main contribution of this work is proving that this problem is $\mathsf{P}$-complete, implying that computing a sequence of local complementation is unlikely to be efficiently parallelizable. The proof is based on a reduction from the Circuit Value Problem, a well-known $\mathsf{P}$-complete problem, by simulating circuits through local complementations.
  Aditionally, the complexity of this problem is analyzed under different restrictions. In particular, it is shown that for complete and star graphs, the problem belongs to $\mathsf{LOGSPACE}$. Finally, it is conjectured that the problem remains $\mathsf{P}$-complete for the class of circle graphs.</description>

      <title>An Algorithm for the Assignment Game Beyond Additive Valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The assignment game, introduced by Shapley and Shubik (1971), is a classic model for two-sided matching markets between buyers and sellers. In the original assignment game, it is assumed that payments lead to transferable utility and that buyers have unit-demand valuations for the items being sold. Two important and mostly independent lines of work have studied more general settings with imperfectly transferable utility and gross substitutes valuations. Multiple efficient algorithms have been proposed for computing a competitive equilibrium, the standard solution concept in assignment games, in these two settings. Our main result is an efficient algorithm for computing competitive equilibria in a setting with both imperfectly transferable utility and gross substitutes valuations. Our algorithm combines augmenting path techniques from maximum matching and algorithms for matroid intersection. We also show that, in a mild generalization of our model, computing a competitive equilibrium is NP-hard.</description>

      <title>Coloring Grids Avoiding Bicolored Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vertex-coloring problem on graphs avoiding bicolored members of a family of subgraphs has been widely studied. Most well-known examples are star coloring and acyclic coloring of graphs (Gr\"unbaum, 1973) where bicolored copies of $P_4$ and cycles are not allowed, respectively. In this paper, we study a variation of this problem, by considering vertex coloring on grids forbidding bicolored paths. We let $P_k$-chromatic number of a graph be the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertex set properly avoiding a bicolored $P_k.$ We show that in any 3-coloring of the cartesian product of paths, $P_{k-2}\square P_{k-2}$, there is a bicolored $P_k.$ With our result, the problem of finding the $P_k$-chromatic number of product of two paths (2-dimensional grid) is settled for all $k.$</description>

      <title>Solving Combinatorial Pricing Problems using Embedded Dynamic Programming Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The combinatorial pricing problem (CPP) is a bilevel problem in which the leader maximizes their revenue by imposing tolls on certain items that they can control. Based on the tolls set by the leader, the follower selects a subset of items corresponding to an optimal solution of a combinatorial optimization problem. To accomplish the leader's goal, the tolls need to be sufficiently low to discourage the follower from choosing the items offered by the competitors. In this paper, we derive a single-level reformulation for the CPP by rewriting the follower's problem as a longest path problem using a dynamic programming model, and then taking its dual and applying strong duality. We proceed to solve the reformulation in a dynamic fashion with a cutting plane method. We apply this methodology to two distinct dynamic programming models, namely, a novel formulation designated as selection diagram and the well-known decision diagram. We also produce numerical results to evaluate their performances across three different specializations of the CPP and a closely related problem that is the knapsack interdiction problem. Our results showcase the potential of the two proposed reformulations over the natural value function approach, expanding the set of tools to solve combinatorial bilevel programs.</description>

      <title>Discrete-Time Open Quantum Walks for Vertex Ranking in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14770v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents a new quantum PageRank algorithm on graphs using discrete-time open quantum walks. Google's PageRank is a widely used algorithm for ranking the web pages on the World Wide Web in classical computation. From a broader perspective, it is also a fundamental measure for quantifying the importance of vertices in a network. Similarly, the new quantum PageRank also serves to quantify the significance of a network's vertices. In this work, we extend the concept of discrete-time open quantum walk on arbitrary directed and undirected graphs by utilizing the Weyl operators as Kraus operators. This new model of quantum walk is useful for building up the quantum PageRank algorithm, discussed in this article. We compare the classical PageRank and the newly defined quantum PageRank for different types of complex networks, such as the scale-free network, Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random network, Watts-Strogatz network, spatial network, Zachary Karate club network, GNC, GN, GNR networks, Barab\'asi and Albert network, etc. In addition, we study the convergence of the quantum PageRank process and its dependency on the damping factor $\alpha$. We observe that this quantum PageRank procedure is faster than many other proposals reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Optimal Inapproximability of Maxmin $k$-Cut Reconfiguration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $k$-Coloring Reconfiguration is one of the most well-studied reconfiguration problems, which asks to transform a given proper $k$-coloring of a graph to another by repeatedly recoloring a single vertex. Its approximate version, Maxmin $k$-Cut Reconfiguration, is defined as an optimization problem of maximizing the minimum fraction of bichromatic edges during the transformation between (not necessarily proper) $k$-colorings. In this paper, we prove that the optimal approximation factor of this problem is $1 - \Theta\left(\frac{1}{k}\right)$ for every $k \ge 2$. Specifically, we show the $\mathsf{PSPACE}$-hardness of approximating the objective value within a factor of $1 - \frac{\varepsilon}{k}$ for some universal constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, whereas we present a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm that achieves the approximation factor of $1 - \frac{2}{k}$.
  To prove the hardness result, we develop a new probabilistic verifier that tests a ``striped'' pattern. Our polynomial-time algorithm is based on ``a random reconfiguration via a random solution,'' i.e., the transformation that goes through one random $k$-coloring.</description>

      <title>Every Graph is Essential to Large Treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for every graph $H$, there is a hereditary weakly sparse graph class $\mathcal C_H$ of unbounded treewidth such that the $H$-free (i.e., excluding $H$ as an induced subgraph) graphs of $\mathcal C_H$ have bounded treewidth. This refutes several conjectures and critically thwarts the quest for the unavoidable induced subgraphs in classes of unbounded treewidth, a wished-for counterpart of the Grid Minor theorem. We actually show a stronger result: For every positive integer $t$, there is a hereditary graph class $\mathcal C_t$ of unbounded treewidth such that for any graph $H$ of treewidth at most $t$, the $H$-free graphs of $\mathcal C_t$ have bounded treewidth. Our construction is a variant of so-called layered wheels. We also introduce a framework of abstract layered wheels, based on their most salient properties. In particular, we streamline and extend key lemmas previously shown on individual layered wheels. We believe that this should greatly help develop this topic, which appears to be a very strong yet underexploited source of counterexamples.</description>

      <title>On the order of the shortest solution sequences for the pebble motion problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph with $N$ vertices. Let $k$ be the number of vertices in a longest path of $G$ such that every vertex on the path is a cut vertex of $G$, and every intermediate vertex of the path is a degree-two vertex of $G$. Let $k$ be the number of vertices of such a longest path of $T$ that every vertex of the path is a cut vertex and that every intermediate vertex of the path is a degree-two vertex of $T$. Let $P=\{1,\ldots,n\}$ be a set of pebbles with $n+k &lt; N$. A configuration of $P$ on $G$ is defined as a function $f$ from $V(G)$ to $\{0, 1, \ldots, n \}$ with $|f^{-1}(i)| = 1$ for $1 \le i \le n$, where $f^{-1}(i)$ is a vertex occupied with the $i$th pebble for $1 \le i \le n$ and $f^{-1}(0)$ is a set of unoccupied vertices. A move is defined as shifting a pebble from a vertex to some unoccupied neighbor. The pebble motion problem on the pair $(G,P)$ is to decide whether a given configuration of pebbles is reachable from another by executing a sequence of moves. In this paper, we show that the length of the shortest solution sequence of the pebble motion problem on the pair $(G,P)$ is in $O(Nn + n^2 \log(\min\{n,k\}))$ if $G$ is a $N$-vertex tree, and it is in $O(N^2 + \frac{n^3}{N-n} + n^2 \log(\min\{n,N-n\}))$ if $G$ is a connected general $N$-vertex graph. We provide an algorithm that can obtain a solution sequence of lengths that satisfy these orders, with the same computational complexity as the order of the length.
