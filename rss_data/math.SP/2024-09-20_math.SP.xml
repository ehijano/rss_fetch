      <title>Twisted Bilayer Graphene in Commensurate Angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of ``magic angles" in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has spurred extensive research into its electronic properties. The primary tool for studying this thus far has been the famous Bistritzer-MacDonald model, which relies on several approximations. This work aims to build the first steps in studying magic angles without using this model. Thus, we study a model for TBG in AA stacking \emph{without} the approximations mentioned above in the continuum setting, using two copies of a potential with the symmetries of graphene, sharing a common origin and twisted with respect to each other. We describe the angles for which the two twisted lattices are commensurate and prove the existence of Dirac cones in the vertices of the Brillouin zone for such angles. Furthermore, we show that for small potentials, the slope of the Dirac cones is small for commensurate angles that are close to incommensurate angles. This work is the first to establish the existence of Dirac cones for twisted bilayer graphene in the continuum setting without relying on the above model. This work is the first in a series of works to build a more fundamental understanding of the phenomenon of magic angles.</description>

      <title>112 years of listening to Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1910, Hendrik Antoon Lorentz delved into the enigmatic Laplace eigenvalue equation, also known as the Helmholtz equation, pondering to what extent the geometry in which one solves the equation can be recovered from knowledge of the eigenvalues. Lorentz, inspired by physical and musical analogies, conjectured a fundamental relationship between eigenvalues, domain volume, and dimensionality. While his conjecture initially seemed insurmountable, Hermann Weyl's groundbreaking proof in 1912 illuminated the deep connection between eigenvalues and geometric properties. Over the ensuing 112 years, mathematicians and physicists have continued to decipher the intricate interplay between eigenvalues and geometry. From Weyl's law to Milnor's example of isospectral non-isometric flat tori, and Kac's inspiring question about hearing the shape of a drum, the field has witnessed remarkable progress, uncovering spectral invariants and advancing our understanding of geometric properties discernible through eigenvalues. We present an overview of this field amenable to both physicists and mathematicians.</description>

      <title>The ground state energy is not always convex in the number of electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide the first counter-example showing that the ground state energy of electrons in an external Coulomb potential is not always a convex function of the number of electrons. This property had been conjectured to hold for decades and it plays an important role in quantum chemistry. Our counter-example involves an external potential generated by six nuclei of small fractional charges, placed far away from each other. The ground state energy of 3 electrons is proved to be higher than the average of the energies for 2 and 4 electrons. In addition, we show that the nuclei can bind 2 or 4 electrons, but not 3. Although the conjecture remains open for real nuclei (of integer charges), our work sets some doubt on the validity of the energy convexity for general atoms and molecules.</description>
