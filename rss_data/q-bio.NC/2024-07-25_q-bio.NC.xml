      <title>Neural field equations with time-periodic external inputs and some applications to visual processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to present a mathematical framework for the study of flickering inputs in visual processing tasks. When combined with geometric patterns, these inputs influence and induce interesting psychophysical phenomena, such as the MacKay and the Billock-Tsou effects, where the subjects perceive specific afterimages typically modulated by the flickering frequency. Due to the symmetry-breaking structure of the inputs, classical bifurcation theory and multi-scale analysis techniques are not very effective in our context. We thus take an approach based on the input-output framework of control theory for Amari-type neural fields. This allows us to prove that, when driven by periodic inputs, the dynamics converge to a periodic state. Moreover, we study under which assumptions these nonlinear dynamics can be effectively linearised, and in this case we present a precise approximation of the integral kernel for short-range excitatory and long-range inhibitory neuronal interactions. Finally, for inputs concentrated at the center of the visual field with a flickering background, we directly relate the width of the illusory contours appearing in the afterimage with both the flickering frequency and the strength of the inhibition.</description>

      <title>Scale-free behavior of weight distributions of connectomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To determine the precise link between form and function, brain studies primarily concentrate on the anatomical wiring of the brain and its topological properties. In this work, we investigate the weighted degree and connection length distributions of the KKI-113 and KKI-18 human connectomes, the fruit fly, and of the mouse retina. We found that the node strength (weighted degree) distribution behavior differs depending on the considered scale. On the global scale, the distributions are found to follow a power-law behavior, with a roughly universal exponent close to 3. However, this behavior breaks at the local scale as the node strength distributions of the KKI-18 follow a stretched exponential, and the fly and mouse retina follow the log-normal distribution, respectively which are indicative of underlying random multiplicative processes and underpins non-locality of learning in a brain close to the critical state. However, for the case of the KKI-113 and the H01 human (1mm$^3$) datasets, the local weighted degree distributions follow an exponentially truncated power-law, which may hint at the fact that the critical learning mechanism may have manifested at the node level too.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning as a Robotics-Inspired Framework for Insect Navigation: From Spatial Representations to Neural Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01501v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bees are among the master navigators of the insect world. Despite impressive advances in robot navigation research, the performance of these insects is still unrivaled by any artificial system in terms of training efficiency and generalization capabilities, particularly considering the limited computational capacity. On the other hand, computational principles underlying these extraordinary feats are still only partially understood. The theoretical framework of reinforcement learning (RL) provides an ideal focal point to bring the two fields together for mutual benefit. In particular, we analyze and compare representations of space in robot and insect navigation models through the lens of RL, as the efficiency of insect navigation is likely rooted in an efficient and robust internal representation, linking retinotopic (egocentric) visual input with the geometry of the environment. While RL has long been at the core of robot navigation research, current computational theories of insect navigation are not commonly formulated within this framework, but largely as an associative learning process implemented in the insect brain, especially in the mushroom body (MB). Here we propose specific hypothetical components of the MB circuit that would enable the implementation of a certain class of relatively simple RL algorithms, capable of integrating distinct components of a navigation task, reminiscent of hierarchical RL models used in robot navigation. We discuss how current models of insect and robot navigation are exploring representations beyond classical, complete map-like representations, with spatial information being embedded in the respective latent representations to varying degrees.</description>

      <title>A principled framework to assess the information-theoretic fitness of brain functional sub-circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In systems and network neuroscience, many common practices in brain connectomic analysis are often not properly scrutinized. One such practice is mapping a predetermined set of sub-circuits, like functional networks (FNs), onto subjects' functional connectomes (FCs) without adequately assessing the information-theoretic appropriateness of the partition. Another practice that goes unchallenged is thresholding weighted FCs to remove spurious connections without justifying the chosen threshold. This paper leverages recent theoretical advances in Stochastic Block Models (SBMs) to formally define and quantify the information-theoretic fitness (e.g., prominence) of a predetermined set of FNs when mapped to individual FCs under different fMRI task conditions. Our framework allows for evaluating any combination of FC granularity, FN partition, and thresholding strategy, thereby optimizing these choices to preserve important topological features of the human brain connectomes. By applying to the Human Connectome Project with Schaefer parcellations at multiple levels of granularity, the framework showed that the common thresholding value of 0.25 was indeed information-theoretically valid for group-average FCs despite its previous lack of justification. Our results pave the way for the proper use of FNs and thresholding methods and provide insights for future research in individualized parcellations.</description>

      <title>Volume-optimal persistence homological scaffolds of hemodynamic networks covary with MEG theta-alpha aperiodic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher-order properties of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) induced connectivity have been shown to unravel many exclusive topological and dynamical insights beyond pairwise interactions. Nonetheless, whether these fMRI-induced higher-order properties play a role in disentangling other neuroimaging modalities' insights remains largely unexplored and poorly understood. In this work, by analyzing fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset using persistent homology, we discovered that the volume-optimal persistence homological scaffolds of fMRI-based functional connectomes exhibited conservative topological reconfigurations from the resting state to attentional task-positive state. Specifically, while reflecting the extent to which each cortical region contributed to functional cycles following different cognitive demands, these reconfigurations were constrained such that the spatial distribution of cavities in the connectome is relatively conserved. Most importantly, such level of contributions covaried with powers of aperiodic activities mostly within the theta-alpha (4-12 Hz) band measured by magnetoencephalography (MEG). This comprehensive result suggests that fMRI-induced hemodynamics and MEG theta-alpha aperiodic activities are governed by the same functional constraints specific to each cortical morpho-structure. Methodologically, our work paves the way toward an innovative computing paradigm in multimodal neuroimaging topological learning.</description>

      <title>A fast algorithm for All-Pairs-Shortest-Paths suitable for neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a directed graph of nodes and edges connecting them, a common problem is to find the shortest path between any two nodes. Here we show that the shortest path distances can be found by a simple matrix inversion: If the edges are given by the adjacency matrix $A_{ij}$ then with a suitably small value of $\gamma$ the shortest path distances are
  $$ D_{ij} = \operatorname{ceil} \left( \log_{\gamma} {\left[ {\left({\mathbf{I}}-\gamma {\mathbf{A}}\right)^{-1}} \right]}_{ij} \right)$$
  We derive several graph-theoretic bounds on the value of $\gamma$, and explore its useful range with numerics on different graph types. Even when the distance function is not globally accurate across the entire graph, it still works locally to instruct pursuit of the shortest path. In this mode, it also extends to weighted graphs with positive edge weights. For a wide range of dense graphs this distance function is computationally faster than the best available alternative. Finally we show that this method leads naturally to a neural network solution of the all-pairs-shortest-path problem.</description>

      <title>Interdependence of sodium and potassium gating variables in the Hodgkin-Huxley model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16711v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the relationship between sodium (Na$^+$) and potassium (K$^+$) gating variables in the 4-dimensional (4D) Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) electrophysiology model and reduce its complexity by deriving new 3D and 2D models that retain the original model's dynamic properties. The new 3D and 2D models are based on the relationship $h \simeq c - n$ between the gating variables $h$ and $n$ of the 4D HH model, where $c$ is a constant, which suggests an interdependence between the dynamics of Na$^+$ and K$^+$ transmembrane voltage-gated channels. We derive the corresponding cable equations for the three HH-type models and demonstrate that the action potential propagates along the axon at a speed described by $v(R, C_m) = \alpha / (C_m R^{\beta}) = \gamma D^{\beta}$, where $\alpha &gt; 0$, $0 &lt; \beta &lt; 1$, and $\gamma$ are constants independent of the local stimulus intensity, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient of the electric signal along the axon, $C_m$ is the axon transmembrane capacitance, and $R$ is the axon conducting resistivity. The width $w$ of the action potential spikes is inversely related to the resistivity of the axon, with $w = \alpha_2 / R^{\beta_2}$, where $\alpha_2 &gt; 0$ and $\beta_2 &gt; 0$.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Machine Learning Classification of Parkinsonian Disorders using Saccadic Eye Movements: A Development and Validation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discriminating between Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is difficult due to overlapping symptoms, especially early on. Saccades (rapid conjugate eye movements between fixation points) are affected by both diseases but conventional saccade analyses exhibit group level differences only. We hypothesized analyzing entire saccade raw time series waveforms would permit superior individual level discrimination between PD, PSP, and healthy controls (HC). 13,309 saccadic eye movements from 127 participants were analyzed using a novel, calibration-free waveform analysis and hierarchical machine learning framework. Individual saccades were classified based on which trained model could reconstruct each waveform with minimum error, indicating the most likely condition. A hierarchical classifier then predicted overall status (recently diagnosed and medication-naive 'de novo' PD, 'established' PD on antiparkinsonian medication, PSP, and healthy controls) by combining each participant's saccade results. This approach substantially outperformed conventional metrics, achieving high AUROCs distinguishing de novo PD from PSP (0.92-0.97), de novo PD from HC (0.72-0.89), and PSP from HC (0.90-0.95), while the conventional model showed limited performance (AUROC range: 0.45-0.75). This calibration-free waveform analysis sets a new standard for precise saccadic classification of PD, PSP, and HC, increasing potential for clinical adoption, remote monitoring, and screening.</description>
