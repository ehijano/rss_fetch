      <title>On Abstract Nonlinear Integro-Dynamic Equations in Time Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence of the asymptotically almost automorphic solution of the following type of abstract nonlinear integro-dynamic equation \begin{eqnarray*} y^{\Delta}(s) &amp;=&amp;Ay(s)+\mathcal{F}\left(s,y(s),\int\limits_{t_0}^{s}{\mathcal{H}(s,\tau,y(\tau))}\Delta\tau\right),~ s\in\mathbb{T}^k, y(0)&amp;=&amp;y_0 \end{eqnarray*} in the Banach space of continuous function on a time scale $\mathbb{T}$. We apply the Krasnoselskii fixed point theorem to show the existence of an almost automorphic solution of the above dynamic equation.</description>

      <title>Fractional-Diffraction-Optics Cauchy Problem: Resolvent-Function Solution of the Matrix Integral Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fractional diffraction optics theory has been elaborated using the Green function technique. The optics-fractional equation describing the diffraction X-ray scattering by imperfect crystals has been derived as the fractional matrix integral Fredholm--Volterra equation of the second kind. In the paper, to solve the Cauchy problems, the Liouville--Neumann-type series formalism has been used to build up the matrix Resolvent-function solution. In the case when the imperfect crystal-lattice elastic displacement field is the linear function $f({\bf R}) = a x+b$, $a, b = const,$ the explicit solution of the diffraction-optics Cauchy problem has been obtained and analyzed for arbitrary fractional-order-parameter $\alpha$, $\alpha\in (0, 1].$</description>

      <title>On some Properties of Generalized Tribonacci Spinors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spinors are used in physics quite extensively. The goal of this study is also the spinor structure lying in the basis of the quaternion algebra. In this paper, first, we have introduced spinors mathematically. Then, we have defined Tribonacci spinors using the generalized Tribonacci quaternions. Later, we have established the structure of algebra for these spinors. Finally, we have proved some important formulas such as Binet and Cassini-like formulas which are given for some series of numbers in mathematics for Tribonacci spinors.</description>

      <title>Token Space: A Category Theory Framework for AI Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Token Space framework, a novel mathematical construct designed to enhance the interpretability and effectiveness of deep learning models through the application of category theory. By establishing a categorical structure at the Token level, we provide a new lens through which AI computations can be understood, emphasizing the relationships between tokens, such as grouping, order, and parameter types. We explore the foundational methodologies of the Token Space, detailing its construction, the role of construction operators and initial categories, and its application in analyzing deep learning models, specifically focusing on attention mechanisms and Transformer architectures. The integration of category theory into AI research offers a unified framework to describe and analyze computational structures, enabling new research paths and development possibilities. Our investigation reveals that the Token Space framework not only facilitates a deeper theoretical understanding of deep learning models but also opens avenues for the design of more efficient, interpretable, and innovative models, illustrating the significant role of category theory in advancing computational models.</description>

      <title>From two simple problems to the connection of special points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both the USA TST 2008 and the ELMO Shortlist 2013 suggested two issues that are connected to fixed points. These problems provide a strong linkage between the various attributes of specific points in a triangle. In this article, we will first investigate various theorems concerning the fixed points that have been presented, and then we will demonstrate how those points are connected to a few triangle centers.</description>

      <title>Rules and Algorithms for Objective Construction of Fuzzy Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to present objective methods for constructing new fuzzy sets from known fuzzy or classical sets, defined over the elements of a finite universe's superstructure. The paper proposes rules for assigning membership functions to these new fuzzy sets, leading to two important findings. Firstly, the property concerning the cardinality of a power set in classical theory has been extended to the fuzzy setting, whereby the scalar cardinality of a fuzzy set $\tilde B$ defined on the power set of a finite universe of a fuzzy set $\tilde A$ satisfies $\text{card}(\tilde B)=2^{\text{card}(\tilde A)}$. Secondly, the novel algorithms allow for an arbitrary membership value to be objectively achieved and represented by a specific binary sequence.</description>

      <title>On The Complex Zeros of The Riemann Zeta Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04058</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.04058v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plotting $({\zeta},U(x,y),V(x,y),x,y,z)$ and numerical calculations show that ${\zeta}(s)=0$ finitely many times in the Interval $I$ with $k$ roots in the interval all of which are on the critical line which proves the Riemann Hypothesis in $I$. It is shown by using groups of intervals how to extend the proof of the Riemann Hypothesis in $I$ to intervals at infinity which extends the proof of the Riemann Hypothesis from the finite domain in the critical strip to the entire critical strip.</description>
