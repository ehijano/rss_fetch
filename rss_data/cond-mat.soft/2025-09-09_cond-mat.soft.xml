      <title>Wetting Interactions Between Porous Carbon Hosts and Liquid Sodium-Potassium Alloys Toward Their Use in Negative Electrodes of Alkali-Metal Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Batteries with liquid alkali-metal negative electrodes offer a route to compact, high-performance energy storage. Innovation in alkali-metal management, i.e., controlled storage, release and transport of liquid alkali metal, can enable simpler and cheaper cell designs. Porous carbons have emerged as potential host materials for liquid alkali metals. Here, we study the wetting interactions between porous carbon hosts and liquid sodium-potassium alloy (NaK) as a function of carbon host morphology and surface functionalization via X-ray computed tomography. While as-received carbon samples show no affinity towards NaK, heat-treated carbon is spontaneously infiltrated with NaK filling almost the entire pore volume. We explore how forced wetting partially fills pores of NaK-repellent hosts, showing large differences in pore filling based on the average pore size of the host material. In electrochemical discharge experiments, we show that both as-received and heat-treated carbon felt enable high areal capacities beyond 40 mAh cm-2. However, the heat-treated carbon shows ten times lower overpotential. Finally, we demonstrate how heat-treated carbon felt can enable capillary transport of NaK. In summary, this study elucidates important aspects of the interactions between liquid alkali metals and porous carbon hosts, generating insights into possible applications in liquid alkali-metal batteries.</description>

      <title>A topological approach to the Cahn-Hilliard equation and hyperuniform fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperuniform structures are disordered, correlated systems in which density fluctuations are suppressed at large scales. Such a property generalizes the concept of order in patterns and is relevant across diverse physical systems. We present a numerical characterization of hyperuniform scalar fields that leverages persistent homology. Topological features across different lengths are represented in persistence diagrams, while similarities or differences between patterns are quantified through Wasserstein distances between these diagrams. We apply this framework to numerical solutions of the Cahn-Hilliard equation, a canonical model for generating hyperuniform scalar fields. We validate the approach against known features of the Cahn-Hilliard equation, including its scaling properties, convergence to the sharp interface limit, and self-similarity of the solutions. We then generalize the approach by studying Gaussian random fields exhibiting different degrees and classes of hyperuniformity, showing how the proposed approach can be exploited to reconstruct global properties from local topological information. Overall, we show how hyperuniform characteristics systematically correlate with distributions of topological features in disordered correlated fields. We expect this analysis to be applicable to a wide range of scalar fields, particularly those involving interfaces and free boundaries.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Polymer Chemical Resistance to Organic Solvents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the chemical resistance of polymers to organic solvents is a longstanding challenge in materials science, with significant implications for sustainable materials design and industrial applications. Here, we address the need for interpretable and generalizable frameworks to understand and predict polymer chemical resistance beyond conventional solubility models. We systematically analyze a large dataset of polymer solvent combinations using a data-driven approach. Our study reveals that polymer crystallinity and density, as well as solvent polarity, are key factors governing chemical resistance, and that these trends are consistent with established theoretical models. These findings provide a foundation for rational screening and design of polymer materials with tailored chemical resistance, advancing both fundamental understanding and practical applications.</description>

      <title>How hydrodynamic interactions alter polymer stretching in turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic interactions (HI) between segments of a polymer have long been known to strongly affect polymer stretching in laminar viscometric flows. Yet the role of HI in fluctuating turbulent flows remains unclear. Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we examine the stretching dynamics of bead-spring chains with inter-bead HI, as they are transported in a homogeneous isotropic turbulent flow (within the ultra-dilute, one-way coupling regime). We find that HI-endowed chains exhibit a steeper coil-stretch transition as the elastic relaxation time is increased, i.e., HI cause less stretching of stiff polymers and more stretching of moderately to highly elastic polymers. The probability distribution function of the end-to-end extension is also modified, with HI significantly limiting the range of extensions over which a power-law range appears. On quantifying the repeated stretching and recoiling of chains by computing persistence time distributions, we find that HI delays migration between stretched and coiled states. These effects of HI, which are consistent with chains experiencing an effective conformation-dependent drag, are sensitive to the level of coarse-graining in the bead-spring model. Specifically, an HI-endowed dumbbell, which cannot form a physical coil, is unable to experience the hydrodynamic shielding effect of HI. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating an extension-dependent drag force in dumbbell-based simulations of turbulent polymer solutions. To develop and test such an augmented dumbbell model, we propose the use of a time-correlated Gaussian random flow, in which the turbulent stretching statistics are shown to be well-approximated.</description>

      <title>Self-Driving Laboratory Optimizes the Lower Critical Solution Temperature of Thermoresponsive Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To overcome the inherent inefficiencies of traditional trial-and-error materials discovery, the scientific community is increasingly developing autonomous laboratories that integrate data-driven decision-making into closed-loop experimental workflows. In this work, we realize this concept for thermoresponsive polymers by developing a low-cost, "frugal twin" platform for the optimization of the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM). Our system integrates robotic fluid-handling, on-line sensors, and Bayesian optimization (BO) that navigates the multi-component salt solution spaces to achieve user-specified LCST targets. The platform demonstrates convergence to target properties within a minimal number of experiments. It strategically explores the parameter space, learns from informative "off-target" results, and self-corrects to achieve the final targets. By providing an accessible and adaptable blueprint, this work lowers the barrier to entry for autonomous experimentation and accelerates the design and discovery of functional polymers.</description>

      <title>Metamaterials and Fluid Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the dynamic interactions between fluid flows and solid materials and structures-a field known as fluid-structure interaction -is central not only to established disciplines such as aerospace and naval engineering but also to emerging technologies such as energy harvesting, soft robotics, and biomedical devices. In recent years, the advent of metamaterials-rationally designed composites with properties beyond their constituents, often not found in conventional materials-has provided exciting opportunities for rethinking and redesigning fluid-structure interaction. The premise of engineering the internal structure of materials interfacing with fluid flows is opening a new horizon for precise and effective manipulation and control of coupled fluidic, acoustic, and elastodynamics responses. This review focuses on this relatively unexplored interdisciplinary theme with broad real-world technological significance. Key performance metrics, such as fuel consumption of transport systems, efficiency of renewable energy extraction, mitigation of noise emissions, and resilience to structural fatigue, depend on the control of interactions between flow, acoustic, and vibration mechanisms. Flow control, for example, which spans a wealth of regimes such as laminar, transitional, turbulent, and unsteady separated flows, is highly influenced by the ability to tailor fluid-structure interaction behavior. We survey and discuss theoretical frameworks that describe the interplay between fluids and elastic solids, with a focus on contemporary work and emerging concepts. The paper is organised into three main sections-flow-structure interactions, acoustic-structure interactions, and exotic metamaterial concepts with potential impact on fluid-structure interaction-and concludes with perspectives on current challenges and future directions in this rapidly expanding area of research.</description>

      <title>Self-similar rupture of thin films of power-law fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models that describe Newtonian liquid films evolving due to the competing effects of surface tension and attractive intermolecular or van der Waals forces are known to rupture in finite time in a self-similar manner. We extend the computation of similarity solutions to non-Newtonian power-law liquid films. The bifurcation diagram, indexed by power law exponent $n$, has a highly nontrivial structure with branches merging via a snaking bifurcation around $n=1$. A countably infinite number of solutions are also found in the extreme shear-thinning ($n\to 0$) limit, in which similarity solutions possess an exponentially small inner region. Numerical simulations are shown to be attracted to the single primary branch of similarity solutions.</description>

      <title>Diffusioosmosis of electrolyte solutions in uniformly charged channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the concentration of electrolyte solution varies along the channel the forces arise that drag the fluid toward the higher or lower concentration region inducing a flow termed diffusio-osmotic. This article investigates a flow that emerges in channels with constant density of surface charge {\sigma} and thin compared to their thickness electrostatic diffuse layers. An equation for the fluid flow rate Q is derived and used to describe analytically the flux of ions, and local potentials and concentrations. This equation, which allows to treat the diffusio-osmotic problems without tedious and time consuming computations, clarifies that the global flow rate is controlled only by the surface charge and concentration drop between the channel ends, and indicates that there always exist two different values of {\sigma} that correspond to a particular Q. Our theory provides a simple explanation of the directions of the fluid flow rate and ionic flux depending on the surface charge and diffusivity of ions, predicts a non-linear concentration distribution along the channel caused by convection, and relates it to the local potential changes by a compact formula. We also present and interpret the variations of the diffusio-osmotic velocity profiles and the apparent slip velocity along the channel and show that the latter is highly non-uniform and could even becomes alternating. The relevance of our results for diffusio-osmotic experiments and for some electrochemistry and membrane science issues is discussed briefly.</description>

      <title>Stockmayer Fluid with a Shifted Dipole: Interfacial Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the liquid-vapor interface in the shifted Stockmayer fluid using molecular dynamics simulations in the canonical ensemble. We study the role of the dipole moment strength and the degree of asymmmetry on equilibrium interfacial characteristics, including density profiles, polar order, nematic order, interfacial polarization, electric field, and electrostatic potential. In addition, we compute angular distribution functions across the interface to gain insight into how the dipole shift affects the molecular orientation. We find that the shift significantly effects angular distribution functions by altering the polar order while leaving the nematic order relatively unaffected, in comparison to the reference symmetric Stockmayer fluid. We find that these results are consistently explained using an image-dipole construction that has been previously applied to symmetric Stockmayer fluids but has never been extended to the shifted model. We find remarkable agreement between the simple theory and the simulations in the qualitative shape of the distribution functions for both the liquid and vapor phases in proximity to the interface. Unexpectedly, the spontaneous polarization at the interface, and therefore the generated electric field, changes sign as the dipole moment strength increases. This also leads to an inversion of the sign of the potential difference across the interface.</description>

      <title>Tree-frog-inspired osmocapillary adhesive bonding to diverse substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of conventional pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSA) critically relies on the wetting of the adhesive over the substrate. When the wetting is hindered by low surface-energy substrates or the presence of interfacial liquids, the adhesion is greatly compromised. Here, inspired by tree frogs that secrete mucus with surfactants to achieve good wetting over diverse dry and wet substrates, we explore a novel mechanism, osmocapillary adhesion, to use interfacial liquid modified by surfactant to wet diverse substrates and achieve robust reversible adhesion. We show that osmocapillary adhesives greatly outperform conventional PSAs over low-energy, moist, oily, and greasy substrates while achieving similar performance on high-energy surfaces.</description>

      <title>Tensorial Model of Chiral Smectic C Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a continuum tensorial model for chiral smectic C (SmC$^*$) liquid crystals using a tensor-valued order parameter $\mathbf{Q}$ to describe orientational order and a real-valued order parameter $\delta\rho$ to capture layer modulation. This model accounts for the coupled effects of nematic alignment, smectic layering, chirality and spontaneous polarisation inherent in SmC$^*$ systems. The model is validated through a series of numerical experiments -- helix, bistable switching, bookshelf and chevron, and defect in SmC$^*$. Our results highlight the model's capability to describe complex phenomena in SmC$^*$ liquid crystals, providing a robust foundation for further theoretical and applied studies on phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Packing, Phase Separation and Interface Compatibility in Reversibly Crosslinked Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vitrimers are a class of crosslinked polymer that are capable of undergoing bond exchange reactions, allowing structural reorganization while maintaining overall network integrity. Two key features that are particularly relevant when this vitrimer concept is used to compatibilize immiscible polymer blends are how they affect the (i) bulk polymer density and (ii) interfacial activity of the crosslink groups. To probe these issues, we model both a bulk polymer melt and a thin film of a polymer melt both with explicit small molecular crosslinkers, in the associative limit, i.e., when the number of crosslinks are fixed. We show that the bulk density and the distribution of stickers within a polymer matrix is strongly influenced by their size and interactions with the base polymer. Specifically, when the crosslinkers are chemically compatible with the base polymer, then the overall packing fraction increases, regardless of crosslinker size, while it decreases when crosslinkers are incompatible with the polymers. Similarly, the crosslinkers segregate preferentially to the polymer-air interface when they are incompatible with the polymer chains, leading to a reduction interfacial tension. Thus, these incompatible crosslinkers should help in affecting both the miscibility of polymer blends, and also their compatibility by creating copolymer structures at the interface. These results demonstrate the key role of crosslinker-polymer interactions and crosslinker size on the structural and interfacial properties of vitrimer melts.</description>

      <title>Ionic glass formers show an inverted relation between fragility and relaxation broadness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supercooled liquids undergo a rapid change in dynamics as they are cooled to their glass transition temperature and turn from a flowing liquid into an amorphous solid. Depending on how steeply the viscosity changes with temperature around the glass transition, glass formers are classified as strong or fragile. An empirical relation exists between the fragility of the liquid and the broadness of its relaxation spectrum. However, the microscopic origins of this correlation remain unclear and its generality has been debated\cite. Here, we demonstrate that this relationship is inverted in organic materials with ionic interactions. We introduce a novel class of materials consisting of highly charged hydrophobic polymers cross-linked via moderated ionic interactions, and show that these combine a strong glass transition with an unusually broad mechanical relaxation spectrum. By surveying a large variety of ionic liquids, polymerized ionic liquids, and ionomers, we show that all these charged materials follow a trend between fragility and relaxation broadness that is opposite to that of non-charged materials. This finding suggests a special role of long-ranged ionic interactions in vitrification and opens up a route toward developing new materials that combine the processability of strong glass formers with the mechanical dissipation of polymers.</description>

      <title>Boundary-shape driven transitions in vortex and oscillatory dynamics of confined epithelial cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the collective motion of epithelial cell populations is fundamental for understanding multicellular self-organization and for advancing tissue engineering. Under spatial confinement, cells are known to exhibit either vortex rotation or oscillatory motion depending on boundary geometry, but the mechanisms governing transitions between these states remain unclear. Here, we investigated the collective motion of MDCK cells confined within a doublet circular boundary, where the confinement aspect ratio, defined as the distance between the centers of two circles relative to their radius, can be tuned by varying the degree of overlap. When the overlap is large, cells form a stable vortex. Increasing the confinement aspect ratio destabilizes this vortex and induces oscillatory motion characterized by periodic reversals of migration direction, before ultimately transitioning into disordered dynamics. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we developed simulations of self-propelled particles incorporating local alignment (LA) and contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL). The model successfully reproduced the experimentally observed transitions from vortices to oscillatory motion and further revealed that an appropriate balance between LA and CIL is critical for stabilizing vortex pairs with velocity reversals. Our findings demonstrate that the confinement aspect ratio serves as a minimal control parameter governing transitions in the collective dynamics of epithelial monolayers.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Modeling and Predictive Control of Active Brownian Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active Brownian particles (ABPs) function as self-driving agents that display non-equilibrium behavior through their pairwise interactions which lead to phase separation and vortex patterns in both soft matter and living systems. A multiscale approach needs to link particle-level random motion to collective density evolution for proper management of these dynamic systems. Our research delivers a unified control system for ABP groups through particle-based simulation and spectral continuum modeling alongside model predictive control and deep learning forecasting. The N-particle Brownian dynamics simulations implement Weeks-Chandler-Andersen potential to model excluded-volume interactions while incorporating thermal noise and angular velocity modulation with wavelength $\lambda$. The forced advection-diffusion equation describes the coarse-grained density evolution which the FTCS spectral space solver solves. A new MPC approach uses complex-valued density states to minimize immediate tracking errors against sinusoidal spatial setpoints with actuator limits and control penalties. The hybrid deep neural network combines Conv1D and LSTM and multi-head attention to learn future density profiles from simulated snapshot sequences.</description>

      <title>Thermal Fluctuation Driven Structural Relaxation in Undeformed Glasses: Unraveling the Evolution of Mechanical Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glasses are mechanically rigid, still undergo structural relaxation which changes their properties and affects potential technological applications. Understanding the underlying physical processes is a problem of broad theoretical and practical interest. We investigate intermittent structural relaxation events or ``avalanches'' occurring inside glassy regime. Contrary to the more well-known avalanches due to shear, here they are induced by thermal fluctuations in undeformed glass. By analyzing changes in structural, mechanical, dynamical, topological and vibrational properties of the system, we provide a multi-faceted characterization of avalanches. Overall we find that the system softens due to avalanches. Further, we develop a formalism to extract local measures of non-Affine displacement and tensorial strain for thermal amorphous solids in absence of any external deformation. Our analysis highlights a key difference between two types of driving: while the shear deformation response is dominated by volume preserving deviatoric strain, changes in local density must be considered to model response of undeformed glass under thermal noise. The observations suggest the idea of Generalized Strain Transformation Zones (GSTZ), where coupled shear and volume-changing deformations govern thermally-mediated plasticity. Our work paves the way for a unified description of elasto-plastic response of (athermal) mechanically deformed and thermally driven undeformed glasses.</description>

      <title>A flat-mode perspective on the boson peak in amorphous solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The boson peak is a characteristic anomaly of amorphous solids broadly defined as a low-energy excess in the density of states and heat capacity compared to the textbook predictions of Debye theory. The origin of this anomaly has long been the subject of ongoing debate and remains a topic of active controversy. While remaining agnostic about the microscopic origin of the phenomenon, we propose that the boson peak (BP) may universally originate from a dispersionless, optic-like excitation, which we refer to as the 'flat mode'. We revisit both experimental and simulation data from the literature through this lens and conduct further simulations in 2D and 3D amorphous systems. These analyses collectively provide supporting evidence for this interpretation. Notably, if this is indeed the case, a striking analogy emerges with similar anomalies observed in crystalline materials, where the nonphononic flat mode is effectively replaced by anomalously low-energy optical phonons.</description>

      <title>Computational Insight into the Complexation of DNA-Functionalized Gold Nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring the stability of the AuNP-gene complex until it reaches the target sites is a crucial factor for the success of gene therapy. Though different AuNP sizes and AuNP-to-DNA ratios are investigated for specific therapeutic needs, their role on the stability and packaging of AuNP-DNA complex remains unclear. In this study, we employ all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the influence of cationic ligand-functionalized AuNP (CAuNP) size and CAuNP-to-DNA ratio on DNA wrapping and binding affinity. The obtained results show that single DNA interacting with smaller CAuNPs exhibit greater bending and wrapping due to their higher curvature. However, when two DNAs bind to smaller CAuNPs, electrostatic repulsion prevents the effective wrapping which leads the DNAs to twist from their original orientation. Such behaviour is not observed with larger CAuNPs since their increased size may mitigates repulsive forces. Further, the analysis on axial bending angle reveals that smaller AuNPs induce sharper DNA bending and larger AuNPs promote smoother bending. In addition, the Potential of Mean Force (PMF) analysis confirms a stronger DNA binding affinity for larger AuNPs with affinity decreasing when two DNAs attach to a single CAuNP. Our results from the DNA loading capacity calculations provide insights into the maximum number of DNA molecules that can be loaded onto CAuNPs of a given size. These findings offer key insights into optimizing the size of AuNP and DNA-to-AuNP ratios for the development of efficient gene delivery systems.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of Chain Exchange in Diblock Copolymer Micelles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanism of chain exchange in diblock copolymer micelles using two distinct yet complementary simulation techniques. First, enhanced sampling method is combined with coarse-grained molecular dynamics to compute a two-dimensional free energy surface for the chain expulsion process in the strong segregation regime. To facilitate chain expulsion, a distance-based collective variable is biased, and the end-to-end distance of the core block is also biased to ensure sufficient sampling of chain conformations. The free energy surface reveals a bimodal distribution of chain conformations along the effective reaction coordinate. The minimum free energy pathway qualitatively aligns with the Halperin-Alexander budding-like mechanism. The free energy barrier along this pathway is calculated for core block lengths ranging from $N_\textrm{core}=4$-$100$, and the barrier is shown to scale as $\beta\Delta F_\textrm{barr} \sim N_\textrm{core}^{2/3}$, consistent with the Halperin-Alexander prediction for a globular transition state. Notably, the free energy surface also reveals a nearly degenerate alternative pathway in which the chain escapes by extending out bead-by-bead, in agreement with previous simulations. We also study the case of a dense copolymer melt, where the core-block shrinks but does not collapse into a dry compact globule in the opposite phase. To examine the kinetic pathway, a simplified model is introduced in which a single chain escapes from a planar interface within a mean-field background. Forward flux sampling calculations yield a linear scaling of the barrier, $\beta\Delta F_\textrm{barr} \sim N_\textrm{core}$, in agreement with experimental observations and prior simulations. Moreover, analysis of successful escape trajectories highlights an extended chain conformation at the transition state.</description>

      <title>Topological Regularization for Force Prediction in Active Particle Suspension with EGNN and Persistent Homology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capturing the dynamics of active particles, i.e., small self-propelled agents that both deform and are deformed by a fluid in which they move is a formidable problem as it requires coupling fine scale hydrodynamics with large scale collective effects. So we present a multi-scale framework that combines the three learning-driven tools to learn in concert within one pipeline. We use high-resolution Lattice Boltzmann snapshots of fluid velocity and particle stresses in a periodic box as input to the learning pipeline. the second step takes the morphology and positions orientations of particles to predict pairwise interaction forces between them with a E(2)-equivariant graph neural network that necessarily respect flat symmetries. Then, a physics-informed neural network further updates these local estimates by summing over them with a stress data using Fourier feature mappings and residual blocks that is additionally regularized with a topological term (introduced by persistent homology) to penalize unrealistically tangled or spurious connections. In concert, these stages deliver an holistic highly-data driven full force network prediction empathizing on the physical underpinnings together with emerging multi-scale structure typical for active matter.</description>

      <title>Transitional patterns on a spherical surface: from scars to domain defects of mixed lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The system of mixed hexagonal and square lattices on a spherical surface is examined, with an emphasis on the exploration of the disclination patterns that form in the square-rich regime. To demonstrate the possible outcomes, the Hertzian potential energy is used as a model for pairwise molecular interactions, which is known to support coexistent hexagonal and square lattices. Through molecular dynamics simulations, we show that at least four different disclination morphologies arise in a square-rich background: triangular defect domains composed of hexagonal lattices arranged in a cubic formation, bridged cubic state, linear scar disclinations with no hexagon content, and open scar disclinations containing a significant amount of hexagonal lattice in the open regions. Order parameters are also introduced to highlight the significance of the bridged and open-scar disclinations, both being the new morphologies reported in this study. The fact that the bridged state is an energetically preferred one is further demonstrated by a separate elastic energy model, which confirms its prevalence over the unbridged cubic state.</description>

      <title>Shape of liquid meniscus in open cells of varying geometry: a combined study via simulation and experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaporative lithography in cells of arbitrary configuration allows for the creation of diverse particle deposition patterns due to the formation of a specific flow structure in the liquid caused by non-uniform evaporation. The latter in turn is determined by the shape of the liquid layer surface and the wetting menisci on the cell walls. Thus, predicting the shape of the wetting menisci can serve as a tool for controlling the process of creating desired particle deposition patterns and evaporation dynamics. Here, we propose a simple and sufficiently accurate methodology for determining the shape of the liquid meniscus in cells of arbitrary geometric shape, based on a combination of mathematical modeling and a series of experimental measurement techniques. The surface profiles of the liquid meniscus in cylindrical, square, and triangular cells were determined by measuring the change in the reflection angle of a laser beam from the free liquid surface while scanning from the cell wall to its center. The height of the wetting meniscus on the inner cell wall and the minimum liquid layer thickness at the center of the cell were measured by analyzing optical images and using a contact method, respectively. 3D meniscus profiles were obtained by numerically solving the Helmholtz equation. The boundary conditions and the unknown constant in the equation were determined based on experimental data obtained for several local points or cross-sections. A comparison of the simulated meniscus shapes and experimentally obtained local values showed satisfactory agreement, with an error of less than 14%.</description>

      <title>Emergent collective heat engines from neighborhood-dependent thermal reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05715v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze a class of heat engines composed of interacting units, in which the thermal reservoir is associated with the neighborhood surrounding each unit. These systems can be mapped onto stochastic opinion models and are characterized by collective behavior at low temperatures, as well as different types of phase transitions, marked by spontaneous symmetry breaking and classifications that depend on topology and neighborhood. For the case of contact with two thermal baths, equivalent to each unit having $k = 4$ nearest neighbors, the system can be tuned to operate at maximum power without sacrificing efficiency or increasing dissipation. These quantities are related by the general expression $ \beta_2 {\cal P} \eta_c =-J_4 \eta \sigma$ when the worksource stems from different interaction energies. The heat engine placed in contact with more than three reservoirs is more revealing, showing that the intermediate thermal reservoir can be conveniently adjusted to achieve the desired compromise between power, efficiency, and dissipation. The influence of lattice topology (regular and random-regular networks), its relationship with collective operation as well as the distinct ratios between the temperatures of the thermal baths, has also been investigated.</description>

      <title>The vortex comb: eliminating vortices from Bose-Einstein condensates using optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work we introduce and explore a technique for the efficient removal of vortices from an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate, through the application and subsequent removal of a one-dimensional optical lattice. We showcase a prototypical experimental realization of the technique that motivates a detailed theoretical study of vortex removal mechanisms. Through simulations of the condensate dynamics during application of the optical lattice, we also discover a vortex removal mechanism that arises in narrow, optical-lattice-induced atomic density channels for which the channel width is on the order of the nominal vortex core size and healing length. This mechanism involves the density profile typically associated with a vortex core spatially separating from the phase singularity associated with the vortex. By analyzing numerical experiments covering a wide range of variations of the optical lattice amplitude and fringe periodicity, we identify the existence of an optimal set of parameters that enables the efficient removal of all vortices from the condensate. This analysis paves the way for further studies aimed at understanding vortex dynamics in narrow channels, and adds to an experimental toolkit for working with vortices and controlling the dynamical states of condensates.</description>

      <title>Seeing new depths: Three-dimensional flow of a free-swimming alga</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A swimming microorganism stirs the surrounding fluid, creating a flow field that governs not only its locomotion and nutrient uptake, but also its interactions with other microorganisms and the environment. Despite its fundamental importance, capturing this flow field and unraveling its biological implications remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we report the first direct, time-resolved measurements of the three-dimensional (3D) flow field generated by a single, free-swimming microalga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a widely studied model organism for flagellar motility. Supported by hydrodynamic modeling and simulations, our measurements resolve how established two-dimensional (2D) flow features such as in-plane vortices and the stagnation point emerge from and shape the 3D structure of the algal flow. More importantly, we reveal unexpected low-Reynolds-number flow phenomena including micron-sized vortex rings and a periodic train of traveling vortices and uncover topological changes in the underlying fluid structure associated with the puller-to-pusher transition of an alga, substantially deepening our understanding of algal motility. Biologically, access to the complete 3D flow field enables rigorous quantification of the alga's energy expenditure, as well as its swimming and feeding efficiency, significantly improving the precision of these key physiological metrics. Taken together, our study demonstrate extraordinary vortex dynamics in inertialess flows and advances fundamental knowledge of microhydrodynamics and its influence on microbial behavior. The work establishes a powerful method for comprehensively mapping the fluid environment sculpted by the beating flagella of motile cells.</description>

      <title>Confinement and Activity-Driven Dynamics of Semiflexible Polymers in Motility Assays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of semiflexible polymers driven by motor proteins (MPs) in two-dimensional motility assays under harmonic confinement. Using a coarse-grained agent-based model that incorporates stochastic motor attachment, detachment, and force generation, we study how activity, filament rigidity, and confinement interact to control polymer behavior. We construct dynamical behavior maps as a function of P\'eclet number, motor processivity, and trap strength. We find a two-state transition from a trapped to a free polymer, with an intermediate coexistence region, and obtain a scaling relation for the critical P\'eclet number, which is supported by simulation data across a range of parameters. Polymer flexibility strongly influences confinement: flexible filaments are more easily trapped, while increasing rigidity destabilizes confinement. Processivity of MPs can also induce a change in the effective rigidity of the polymer and, therefore, influence confinement by the trap. Under moderate confinement and activity, we observe the emergence of stable spiral conformations. The center-of-mass dynamics is analyzed through the mean square displacement, showing diffusive, ballistic, and diffusive regimes that depend on the trap strength and activity. Additionally, time series analysis of the excess kurtosis shows the variation of the non-Gaussian fluctuations with trap strength and activity. Our results provide a minimal physical framework to understand the dynamic organization of active filaments under confinement, with relevance to in vitro motility assays, cytoskeletal filament manipulation by optical traps, and synthetic active polymer systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the formation of short-wavelength mesophases in a two-dimensional core-softened particle system. By proposing a series of specific ansatz for each relevant phase, we performed a variational analysis to obtain the ground-state phase diagram. Our results reveal a variety of cluster lattice phases with distinct cluster orientations, alongside traditional two-dimensional Bravais lattices such as square, triangular, oblique, and rectangular structures, as well as other non-Bravais arrangements including honeycomb and kagome phases. We characterize in detail the ground-state phase transitions and identify coexistence regions between competing phases, capturing both first-order and continuous transitions. In addition, we highlight the crucial role of the competing length scales introduced by the hard-core repulsion in shaping the rich landscape of mesophases, emphasizing the interplay between intra-cluster structure and inter-cluster organization. This study provides a systematic framework that could support future investigations of classical thermal melting behavior or quantum phase transitions in similar cluster-forming systems.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Phase Separation and Fractal Interfaces of Colloids in Active Liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase separation driven by nonequilibrium fluctuations is a hallmark of both living and synthetic active matter. Unlike equilibrium systems, where ordered states arise from the minimization of free energy, active systems are fueled by a constant injection of energy at the microscopic scale. The emergence of ordered phases in such driven systems challenges our conventional views of domain growth and interfacial structure. In this study, we investigate the coarsening of colloidal clusters in active liquids containing E. coli. Our experiments reveal that uniform dispersions of colloids and swimmers are inherently unstable, resulting in spontaneous phase separation characterized by fractal interfaces and unconventional kinetics. The correlation function of the order parameter displays dynamical scaling, with the size of colloidal domains growing as $t^{1/z}$, where $z \sim 4$, in contrast to the well-known growth laws for thermal systems with a conserved order parameter. Furthermore, the structure factor exhibits non-Porod behavior, indicating domains with fractal interfaces. This non-Porod behavior also manifests itself as a cusp singularity in the correlation function. We elucidate our experimental findings using a scalar field theory in which the nonequilibrium fluctuations arising from swimmer activity are modeled as spatio-temporally correlated noise. This coarse-grained model, which breaks time-reversal symmetry and detailed balance, successfully reproduces key experimental observations. Furthermore, it reveals a fluctuating microphase separation, where the initial domain growth, following $t^{1/4}$ scaling, is eventually arrested, thereby shedding new light on the microscopic origins of unconventional phase separation of colloids in active liquids.</description>

      <title>Permeability heterogeneity and bulk linear elasticity of displaced clay suspensions determine interfacial pattern morphologies in Hele-Shaw experiments</title>

Abstract: When a less viscous Newtonian fluid displaces an aging aqueous clay suspension in a confined space, a rich array of interfacial patterns emerges due to a predominantly viscous instability. In the present work, we controlled the mechanical properties of clay suspensions by incorporating additives and studied the interfacial instabilities that resulted when these suspensions were radially displaced by water in a Hele-Shaw cell. When the elasticity of clay was low, the interfacial dynamics exhibited features of nonlinear viscous fingering in heterogeneous media. By tuning the nature and content of additives that delay clay aging, we uncovered two novel propagation mechanisms: pattern growth \textit{via} skewering and zig-zag finger propagation. These patterns have hitherto never been observed in experiments with colloidal systems. For moderate clay elasticities, we demonstrate here that shear-thinning-induced flow anisotropy leads to the formation of dendrites with dominant side branches. As clay elasticity increases due to the incorporation of salts, the energy required to create fractures becomes smaller than that for system-wide yielding. This scenario is characterized by the emergence of viscoelastic fractures. Our work demonstrates that incorporating additives is an effective strategy to manipulate the onset and growth of interfacial instabilities during the confined displacement of clay by miscible Newtonian fluids.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis through folds: An end-loaded elastic with a lever arm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04729v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many physical systems can be modelled as parameter-dependent variational problems. In numerous cases, multiple equilibria co-exist, requiring the evaluation of their stability, and the monitoring of transitions between them. Generally, the stability characteristics of the equilibria change near folds in the parameter space. The direction of stability changes is embedded in a specific projection of the solutions, known as distinguished bifurcation diagrams. In this article, we identify such projections for variational problems characterized by fixed-free ends -- a class of problems frequently encountered in mechanics. Using these diagrams, we study an Elastica subject to an end load applied through a rigid lever arm. Several instances of snap-back instability are reported, along with their dependence on system parameters through numerical examples. These findings have potential applications in the design of soft robot arms and other actuator designs.</description>

      <title>Spatially Structured Flocking in a Proliferating Population of Self-Propelled Organisms without Explicit Alignment Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While it is well established that self-propelled particles with alignment interactions can exhibit orientational order, the impact of self-replication and annihilation, which are key characteristics in cellular systems, on spatiotemporal order remains poorly understood. To explore the interplay between self-propulsion and self-replication, we introduce the active Brownian bug (ABB) model, in which self-propelled agents undergo stochastic, density-dependent replication and constant-rate death. Despite the absence of alignment interactions, the system exhibits flocking behavior characterized by high orientational order, while maintaining ordered hexagonal arrays. This emergent order arises from stochastic birth and death processes, offering a novel mechanism for flocking in proliferating cellular populations.</description>

      <title>Nano-chemical cell-surface evaluation in photothermal spectroscopic imaging of antimicrobial interaction in model system Bacillus subtilis &amp; vancomycin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The power of photothermal spectroscopic imaging to visualize antimicrobial interaction on the surface of individual bacteria cells has been demonstrated on the model system Bacillus subtilis and vancomycin using mid-infrared photo-induced force microscopy (PiF-IR, also mid-IR PiFM). High-resolution PiF contrasts obtained by merging subsequent PiF-IR scans at two different illumination frequencies revealed chemical details of cell wall destruction after 30 and 60 min incubation with vancomycin with a spatial resolution of $\approx 5$ nm. This approach compensates local intensity variations induced by near-field coupling of the illuminating electric field with nanostructured surfaces, which appear in single-frequency contrasts in photothermal imaging methods, as shown by [Anindo et al., J. Phys. Chem C, 2025, 129, 4517]. Known spectral shifts associated with hydrogen bond formation between vancomycin and the N-acyl-D-Ala4-D-Ala5 termini in the peptidoglycan cell wall have been observed in chemometrics of PiF-IR spectra from treated and untreated Bacillus subtilis harvested after 30 min from the same experiment. Spectral signatures of the vancomyin interaction have been located in the piecrust of a progressing septum with $\approx 10$ nm resolution using PiF contrasts of three selected bands of a PiF-IR hyperspectral scan of an individual Bacillus subtilis cell harvested after 30 min incubation. Our results are complemented by a discussion of imaging artifacts and the influence of parameter settings supporting further development towards standardization in the application of PiF-IR for visualizing the chemical interaction of antibiotics on the surface of microbes with few nanometer resolution.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Ostwald ripening by chemical activity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase separation of biomolecular condensates promotes membrane-free compartmentalization in cells. The dynamics of these biocondensates is routinely regulated by energy-consuming processes. Here, we devise a theory pinpointing how active chemical reactions, interconverting molecules between phase-separating and inert forms, can drive faster condensate coarsening. We find that mass conservation limits droplet volume growth to being linear in time regardless of activity, resembling the passive Lifshitz-Slyozov law. However, if reactions are restricted to occur only outside droplets, the rate of Ostwald ripening can be increased by an arbitrarily large factor. Our theory is quantitatively supported by recent experiments on ripening in the presence of fueled interconversion reactions, under precisely the predicted conditions. We posit that the ability to induce rapid biocondensate coarsening can be advantageous in synthetic-biological contexts, e.g., as a regulator of metabolic channeling.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity and conservation laws in non-equilibrium systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that hyperuniformity, the suppression of density fluctuations at large length scales, emerges generically from the interplay between conservation laws and non-equilibrium driving. The underlying mechanism for this emergence is analogous to self-organized criticality. Based on this understanding, we introduce four non-equilibrium models that consistently demonstrate hyperuniformity. Furthermore, we show that systems with an arbitrary number of conserved mass multipole moments exhibit an arbitrary strong tunable hyperuniform scaling, with the structure factor following $S(k) \sim k^m$, where $m$ is set by the number of conserved multipoles. Finally, we find that hyperuniformity arising from a combination of conserved noise and partially conserved average motion is not robust against non-linear perturbations. These results highlight the central role of conservation laws in stabilizing hyperuniformity and reveal a unifying mechanism for its emergence in non-equilibrium systems.</description>
