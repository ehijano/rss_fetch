      <title>A new characterization for the distinguished boundaries of a few domains related to $\mu$-synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we provide an alternative way of describing the distinguished boundariesof symmetrized bidisc, tetrablock and pentablock. We show that each of these distinguished boundaries can be characterized as the union of orbits of two elements under their automorphism groups.</description>

      <title>On complex algebraic singularities of some genuinely nonlinear PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we highlight a new phenomenon of complex algebraic singularity formation for solutions of a large class of genuinely nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). We start from a unique Cauchy datum, which is holomorphic ramified around the smooth locus and is sufficiently singular. Then, we expect the existence of a solution which should be holomorphic ramified around the singular locus S defined by the vanishing of the discriminant of an algebraic equation. Notice, moreover, that the monodromy of the Cauchy datum is Abelian, whereas one of the solutions is non-Abelian. Moreover, the singular locus S depends on the Cauchy datum in contrast to the Leray principle (stated for linear problems only). This phenomenon is due to the fact that the PDE is genuinely nonlinear and that the Cauchy datum is sufficiently singular. First, we investigate the case of the inviscid Burgers equation. Later, we state a general conjecture that describes the expected phenomenon. We view this Conjecture as a working programme allowing us to develop interesting new Mathematics. We also state another Conjecture 2, which is a particular case of the general Conjecture but keeps all the flavour and difficulty of the subject. Then, we propose a new algorithm with a map F such that a fixed point of F would give a solution to the problem associated with Conjecture 2. Then, we perform convincing, elaborate numerical tests that suggest that a Banach norm should exist for which the mapping F should be a contraction so that the solution (with the above specific algebraic structure) should be unique. This work is a continuation of Leichtnam (1993).</description>

Abstract: We prove that compact Calabi--Yau varieties with certain isolated singularities are projective. In dimension 3 we do this by analysis, supposing given conifold metrics. In higher dimensions it follows more readily from Ohsawa's degenerate spectral sequence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an effective universality theorem of the Riemann zeta-function in short intervals $[T,T+H]$ with $T^{\frac{27}{82}}\le H\le T$ by following an effective multidimensional $\Omega$-result of Voronin. Furthermore, we also prove the results in short intervals $[T,T+H]$ with $T^\epsilon\le H\le T$ (for any fixed $\epsilon&gt;0$) under the assumption of the Riemann Hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Certain smooth real surfaces in $\mathbb{C}^2$ with singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04085</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.04085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under certain geometric condition, the surfaces in $\mathbb{C}^2$ with isolated CR singularity at the origin and with cubic lowest degree homogeneous term in its graph near the origin, can be reduced, up to biholomorphism of $\mathbb{C}^2$, to a one parameter family of the form \[ M_t:=\left\{(z,w)\in\mathbb{C}^2: w=z^2\overline{z}+tz\overline{z}^2+\dfrac{t^2}{3} \overline{z}^3+o(|z|^3)\right\},\;\; t\in (0,\infty) \] near the origin. We prove that $M_t$ is not locally polynomially convex if $t&lt;1$. The local hull contains a ball centred at the origin if $t&lt;\sqrt{3}/2$. We also prove that $M_t$ is locally polynomially convex for $t\geq\dfrac{\sqrt{15-\sqrt{33}}}{2\sqrt{2}}=1.076...$. We show that, for $\sqrt{3}/2\leq t&lt;1$, the local hull of $M_t$ contains a one parameter family of analytic discs passing through the origin. We also show that local polynomial convexity of the union of finitely many pairwise transverse totally-real submanifolds of $\mathbb{C}^n$ at the origin (their intersection) implies local polynomial convexity of the union of their sufficiently small $\mathscr{C}^1$-perturbation at their intersection, the origin. Some new results about the local polynomial convexity of the union of three totally-real planes are also reported.</description>

      <title>Approximations on Spirallike domains of $\mathbb{C}^{n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.11107v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we first show that any domain $\Om$ in $\cn(n \geq 2)$, which is spirallike with respect to a complete holomorphic globally asymptotic stable vector field $F$, is a Runge domain. Next, we prove an Anders\'{e}n-Lempert type approximation theorem: any biholomorphism $\Phi\colon \Om \to \Phi(\Om)$, with $\Phi(\Om)$ is Runge, can be approximated by automorphisms of $\mathbb{C}^{n}$ uniformly on compacts, in the following two cases.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item [(i)] The domain $\Om\subset\cn$ is a spirallike with respect to a linear vector field $A$, where $2\max\{\rl\lambda:\lambda\in\sigma(A)\}&lt;\min\{\rl\lambda:\lambda\in\sigma(A)\}$.
  \item [(ii)] The domain $\Om$ is spirallike with respect to complete globally exponentially stable vector field $F$, with a certain rate of the convergence of the flow of the vector field $F$ in $\Om $
  \end{itemize}
  We further show that, if $J(\Phi) \equiv 1$ (and $div(F)$ is constant in the situation (ii)) then the biholomorphism $\Phi\colon \Om \to \Phi(\Om)$ can be approximated by volume preserving automorphism of $\cn$ in both the cases mentioned above. As an application of our approximation results, we show that any Loewner PDE in a complete hyperbolic domain $\Om$ which satisfies (i) or (ii) mentioned above admits an essentially unique univalent solution with values in $\cn$. We also provide an example of a Hartogs domain in $\mathbb{C}^{2}$ which spirallike with respect to a complete holomorphic vector field $F(z_{1},z_{2})=(-2z_{1},-3z_{2}+z_{1}z_{2})$, but the domain is not spirallike with respect to any linear vector field. Some more examples are provided at the end of this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17337v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadrilaterals in the complex plane play a significant part in the theory of planar quasiconformal mappings. Motivated by the geometric definition of quasiconformality, we prove that every quadrilateral with modulus in an interval $[1/K, K]$, where $K&gt;1$, contains a disk lying in its interior, of radius depending only on the internal distances between the pairs of opposite sides of the quadrilateral and on $K$.</description>

      <title>A counterexample to parabolic dichotomies in holomorphic iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an example of a parabolic holomorphic self-map $f$ of the unit ball $\mathbb B^2\subset \mathbb C^2$ whose canonical Kobayashi hyperbolic semi-model is given by an elliptic automorphism of the disc $\mathbb D\subset \mathbb C$, which can be chosen to be different from the identity. As a consequence, in contrast to the one dimensional case, this provides a first example of a holomorphic self-map of the unit ball which has points with zero hyperbolic step and points with nonzero hyperbolic step, solving an open question and showing that parabolic dynamics in the ball $\\mathbb B^2$ is radically different from parabolic dynamics in the disc. The example is obtained via a geometric method, embedding the ball $\mathbb B^2$ as a domain $\Omega$ in the bidisc $\\mathbb D\times \mathbb{H}$ that is forward invariant and absorbing for the map $(z,w)\mapsto (e^{i\theta}z,w+1)$, where $\mathbb H\subset \mathbb C$ denotes the right half-plane. We also show that a complete Kobayashi hyperbolic domain $\Omega$ with such properties cannot be Gromov hyperbolic w.r.t. the Kobayashi distance (hence, it cannot be biholomorphic to $\\mathbb B^2$) if an additional quantitative geometric condition is satisfied.</description>

      <title>Equidistribution in Random Polynomials and the Systems of Random Holomorphic Sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14631v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article addresses an equidistribution problem concerning the zeros of systems of random holomorphic sections of positive line bundles on compact K\"{a}hler manifolds and random polynomials on $\mathbb{C}^{m}$ in the setting of a compact subset. For random polynomials, we consider non-orthonormal bases and we prove the equidistribution result which are more general than the previously acquired ones for non-discrete probability measures. More precisely, our result demonstrates that the equidistribution holds true even when the random coefficients in the basis representation are not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and moreover, they are not constrained to any particular probability distribution function. For random holomorphic sections, by extending the concept of a sequence of asymptotically Bernstein-Markov measures introduced by Levenberg, Bloom and Bayraktar in their recent paper to the setting of holomorphic line bundles over compact K\"{a}hler manifolds and using the variance estimation technique in another study of the author with Bojnik, we derive a global equidistribution theorem related to the zeros of systems of random holomorphic sections for large tensor powers of a fixed line bundle for any codimension $k$.</description>

      <title>The toral contractions and $\Gamma$-distinguished $\Gamma$-contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.08380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider distinguished varieties in the bidisc $\mathbb D^2$ and the symmetrized bidisc $\mathbb{G}_2$. A commuting pair of Hilbert space operators $(S,P)$ for which $\Gamma=\overline{\mathbb{G}}_2$ is a spectral set is called a \textit{$\Gamma$-contraction}. A commuting pair of contractions $(T_1,T_2)$ is said to be \textit{toral} if there is a toral polynomial $p\in \mathbb C[z_1,z_2]$ such that $p(T_1,T_2)=0$. Similarly, a $\Gamma$-contraction $(S,P)$ is called $\Gamma$-\textit{distinguished} if $(S,P)$ is annihilated by a $\Gamma$-distinguished polynomial in $\mathbb C[z_1,z_2]$. The main results af this article are the following: we find a necessary and sufficient condition such that a toral pair of contractions dilates to a toral pair of isometries. Also, we characterize all $\Gamma$-distinguished $\Gamma$-contractions that admit $\Gamma$-distinguished $\Gamma$-isometric dilations. We determine the distinguished boundary of a distinguished variety in $\mathbb D^2$ and $\mathbb G_2$. Then we prove that a pair of commuting contractions $(T_1,T_2)$ (or a $\Gamma$-contraction $(S,P)$) dilates to a toral pair of isometries (or a $\Gamma$-distinguished $\Gamma$-isometry) if and only if there is a toral polynomial (or $\Gamma$-distinguished polynomial) $p\in \mathbb C[z_1,z_2]$ such that $Z(p) \cap \overline{\mathbb D}^2$ (or $Z(p) \cap \overline{\mathbb G}_2$) is a complete spectral set for $(T_1,T_2)$ (or $(S,P)$). We provide several examples at places to show the contrasts between the theory of toral contractions and $\Gamma$-distinguished $\Gamma$-contractions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study various properties of the gradients of solutions to harmonic functions on Lipschitz surfaces. We improve an exponential bound of Naber and Valtorta on the size of the superlevel sets for the frequency function to a sharp quadratic bound in this setting using complex analytic tools. We also develop a propagation of smallness for gradients of harmonic functions, settling an open question in this setting. Finally, we extend the estimate on superlevel sets of the frequency to more general divergence-form elliptic PDEs with bounded drift terms at the cost of a subpolynomial factor.</description>

      <title>Herglotz's representation and Caratheodory's approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15568v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Herglotz's representation of holomorphic functions with positive real part and Carath\'eodory's theorem on approximation by inner functions are two well-known classical results in the theory of holomorphic functions on the unit disc. We show that they are equivalent.
  On a multi-connected domain $\Omega$, a version of Heglotz's representation is known. Carath\'eodory's approximation was not known. We formulate and prove it and then show that it is equivalent to the known form of Herglotz's representation. Additionally, it also enables us to prove a new Heglotz's representation in the style of Koranyi and Pukanszky. Of particular interest is the fact that the scaling technique of the disc is replaced by Carath\'eodory's approximation theorem while proving this new form of Herglotz's representation.
  Carath\'eodory's approximation theorem is also proved for matrix-valued functions on a multi-connected domain.</description>
