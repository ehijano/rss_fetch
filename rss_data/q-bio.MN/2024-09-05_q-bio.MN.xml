      <title>Exact first passage time distribution for second-order reactions in chemical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first passage time (FPT) is a generic measure that quantifies when a random quantity reaches a specific state. We consider the FTP distribution in nonlinear stochastic biochemical networks, where obtaining exact solutions of the distribution is a challenging problem. Even simple two-particle collisions cause strong nonlinearities that hinder the theoretical determination of the full FPT distribution. Previous research has either focused on analyzing the mean FPT, which provides limited information about a system, or has considered time-consuming stochastic simulations that do not clearly expose causal relationships between parameters and the system's dynamics. This paper presents the first exact theoretical solution of the full FPT distribution in a broad class of chemical reaction networks involving $A + B \rightarrow C$ type of second-order reactions. Our exact theoretical method outperforms stochastic simulations, in terms of computational efficiency, and deviates from approximate analytical solutions. Given the prevalence of bimolecular reactions in biochemical systems, our approach has the potential to enhance the understanding of real-world biochemical processes.</description>

      <title>Waveform distortion for temperature compensation and synchronization in circadian rhythms: An approach based on the renormalization group method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous biological processes accelerate as temperatures increase, but the period of circadian rhythms remains constant, known as temperature compensation, while synchronizing with the 24h light-dark cycle. We theoretically explores the possible relevance of waveform distortions in circadian gene-protein dynamics to the temperature compensation and synchronization. Our analysis of the Goodwin model provides a coherent explanation of most of temperature compensation hypotheses. Using the renormalization group method, we analytically demonstrate that the decreasing phase of circadian protein oscillations should lengthen with increasing temperature, leading to waveform distortions to maintain a stable period. This waveform-period correlation also occurs in other oscillators like Lotka-Volterra and van der Pol models. A reanalysis of known data nicely confirms our findings on waveform distortion and its impact on synchronization range. Thus we conclude that circadian rhythm waveforms are fundamental to both temperature compensation and synchronization.</description>

      <title>Relationship between Decimal Hill Coefficient, Intermediate Processes and Mesoscopic Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hill function is relevant for describing enzyme binding and other processes in gene regulatory networks. Despite its theoretical foundation, it is often empirically used as a useful fitting function. Theoretical predictions suggest that the Hill coefficient should be an integer. However, it is often assigned a decimal value. The deterministic approximation of binding processes leads to the derivation of the Hill function, which can be expanded around the fluctuation magnitude to derive mesoscopic corrections. This study establishes the relationships between intermediate processes and the decimal Hill coefficient through a direct relationship between the dissociation constants, both with and without fluctuations. This outcome contributes to a deeper understanding of the underlying processes associated with the decimal Hill coefficient while also enabling the prediction of an effective value of the Hill coefficient from the underlying mechanism. This procedure allows us to have a simplified effective description of complex systems.</description>
