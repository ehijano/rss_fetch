      <title>Dark Matter profiles of "in silico" galaxies: deep learning inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has the potential to improve the reconstruction of the dark matter profile of galaxies with respect to traditional methods, like rotation curves. We demonstrate on the simulation suite Illustris-TNG that a steerable equivariant convolutional neural network (CNN) is able to infer the dark matter profiles within and around individual galaxies from photometric and interferometric data, improving on a standard CNN. Within the in silico environment of the simulations, our architecture is able to capture the dark matter distribution within galaxies without a parametrization of the profile. We perform an interpretability analysis to understand the internal mechanisms of the trained model and the most important data features used to estimate the dark matter profiles. The equivariant CNN recovers the dark matter profile of galaxies within the stellar mass range $[10^{10} - 10^{12} ]$ $M_{\odot}$ with excellent precision and accuracy: the mean squared error is reduced by a factor of ~ 3 from its value under the training distribution, demonstrating that the network has learnt from the data features. While this holds within the controlled 'in silico' environment of the simulation, we argue that few additional steps are needed before this method can be reliably applied to galaxies in the real field observations.</description>

      <title>A Class of Markovian Self-Reinforcing Processes with Power-Law Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar flares, email exchanges, and many natural or social systems exhibit bursty dynamics, with periods of intense activity separated by long inactivity. These patterns often follow power- law distributions in inter-event intervals or event rates. Existing models typically capture only one of these features and rely on non-local memory, which complicates analysis and mechanistic interpretation. We introduce a novel self-reinforcing point process whose event rates are governed by local, Markovian nonlinear dynamics and post-event resets. The model generates power-law tails for both inter-event intervals and event rates over a broad range of exponents observed empirically across natural and human phenomena. Compared to non-local models such as Hawkes processes, our approach is mechanistically simpler, highly analytically tractable, and also easier to simulate. We provide methods for model fitting and validation, establishing this framework as a versatile foundation for the study of bursty phenomena.</description>

      <title>Hubble tension in an anisotropic Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the Hubble tension within an anisotropic cosmological framework by revisiting the Bianchi type-I model introduced in Le Delliou et al. 2020. Motivated by ongoing debates surrounding back-reaction effects and observed anomalies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), we investigate whether a departure from isotropy in the late Universe could reconcile the observed discrepancies in Hubble constant measurements. Using a Bayesian inference framework, we constrain the model parameters employing multiple nested sampling algorithms: bilby, PyMultiNest, and nessai. We perform the analysis under both uniform and Gaussian priors, allowing us to systematically assess the sensitivity of the inferred cosmological parameters to different prior assumptions. This dual-prior strategy balances agnostic parameter exploration with constraints informed by theory and observation. Our findings demonstrate the reliability of our inference pipeline across different samplers and emphasize the crucial role of prior selection in non-standard cosmological model testing. The results suggest that anisotropic models remain viable contenders in addressing current cosmological tensions: even though the present model does not show alleviation of the Hubble tension, the data points towards anisotropies. Future work may extend this methodology to more complex anisotropic scenarios and incorporate additional cosmological probes such as CMB polarization and gravitational wave standard sirens.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning Beyond the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning enables powerful cosmological inference but typically requires many high-fidelity simulations covering many cosmological models. Transfer learning offers a way to reduce the simulation cost by reusing knowledge across models. We show that pre-training on the standard model of cosmology, $\Lambda$CDM, and fine-tuning on various beyond-$\Lambda$CDM scenarios -- including massive neutrinos, modified gravity, and primordial non-Gaussianities -- can enable inference with significantly fewer beyond-$\Lambda$CDM simulations. However, we also show that negative transfer can occur when strong physical degeneracies exist between $\Lambda$CDM and beyond-$\Lambda$CDM parameters. We consider various transfer architectures, finding that including bottleneck structures provides the best performance. Our findings illustrate the opportunities and pitfalls of foundation-model approaches in physics: pre-training can accelerate inference, but may also hinder learning new physics.</description>

      <title>Time delay embeddings to characterize the timbre of musical instruments using Topological Data Analysis: a study on synthetic and real data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Timbre allows us to distinguish between sounds even when they share the same pitch and loudness, playing an important role in music, instrument recognition, and speech. Traditional approaches, such as frequency analysis or machine learning, often overlook subtle characteristics of sound. Topological Data Analysis (TDA) can capture complex patterns, but its application to timbre has been limited, partly because it is unclear how to represent sound effectively for TDA. In this study, we investigate how different time delay embeddings affect TDA results. Using both synthetic and real audio signals, we identify time delays that enhance the detection of harmonic structures. Our findings show that specific delays, related to fractions of the fundamental period, allow TDA to reveal key harmonic features and distinguish between integer and non-integer harmonics. The method is effective for synthetic and real musical instrument sounds and opens the way for future works, which could extend it to more complex sounds using higher-dimensional embeddings and additional persistence statistics.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Conditional Entropy for Diffusion Dynamics on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modeling of diffusion processes on graphs is the basis for many network science and machine learning approaches. Entropic measures of network-based diffusion have recently been employed to investigate the reversibility of these processes and the diversity of the modeled systems. While results about their steady state are well-known, very few exact results about their time evolution exist. Here, we introduce the conditional entropy of heat diffusion in graphs. We demonstrate that this entropic measure satisfies the first and second laws of thermodynamics, thereby providing a physical interpretation of diffusion dynamics on networks. We outline a mathematical framework that contextualizes diffusion and conditional entropy within the theories of continuous-time Markov chains and information theory. Furthermore, we obtain explicit results for its evolution on complete, path, and circulant graphs, as well as a mean-field approximation for Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs. We also obtain asymptotic results for general networks. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate several properties of conditional entropy for diffusion over random graphs, such as the Watts-Strogatz model.</description>

      <title>Dara: Automated multiple-hypothesis phase identification and refinement from powder X-ray diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a foundational technique for characterizing crystalline materials. However, the reliable interpretation of XRD patterns, particularly in multiphase systems, remains a manual and expertise-demanding task. As a characterization method that only provides structural information, multiple reference phases can often be fit to a single pattern, leading to potential misinterpretation when alternative solutions are overlooked. To ease humans' efforts and address the challenge, we introduce Dara (Data-driven Automated Rietveld Analysis), a framework designed to automate the robust identification and refinement of multiple phases from powder XRD data. Dara performs an exhaustive tree search over all plausible phase combinations within a given chemical space and validates each hypothesis using a robust Rietveld refinement routine (BGMN). Key features include structural database filtering, automatic clustering of isostructural phases during tree expansion, peak-matching-based scoring to identify promising phases for refinement. When ambiguity exists, Dara generates multiple hypothesis which can then be decided between by human experts or with further characteriztion tools. By enhancing the reliability and accuracy of phase identification, Dara enables scalable analysis of realistic complex XRD patterns and provides a foundation for integration into multimodal characterization workflows, moving toward fully self-driving materials discovery.</description>
