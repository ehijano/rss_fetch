      <title>Altruistic Ride Sharing: A Community-Driven Approach to Short-Distance Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urban mobility faces persistent challenges of congestion and fuel consumption, specifically when people choose a private, point-to-point commute option. Profit-driven ride-sharing platforms prioritize revenue over fairness and sustainability. This paper introduces Altruistic Ride-Sharing (ARS), a decentralized, peer-to-peer mobility framework where participants alternate between driver and rider roles based on altruism points rather than monetary incentives. The system integrates multi-agent reinforcement learning (MADDPG) for dynamic ride-matching, game-theoretic equilibrium guarantees for fairness, and a population model to sustain long-term balance. Using real-world New York City taxi data, we demonstrate that ARS reduces travel distance and emissions, increases vehicle utilization, and promotes equitable participation compared to both no-sharing and optimization-based baselines. These results establish ARS as a scalable, community-driven alternative to conventional ride-sharing, aligning individual behavior with collective urban sustainability goals.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Feature Detectors for Visual SLAM: A Comparative Study of FPGA vs GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feature detection is a common yet time-consuming module in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) implementations, which are increasingly deployed on power-constrained platforms, such as drones. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have been a popular accelerator for computer vision in general, and feature detection and SLAM in particular.
  On the other hand, System-on-Chips (SoCs) with integrated Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) are also widely available. This paper presents the first study of hardware-accelerated feature detectors considering a Visual SLAM (V-SLAM) pipeline. We offer new insights by comparing the best GPU-accelerated FAST, Harris, and SuperPoint implementations against the FPGA-accelerated counterparts on modern SoCs (Nvidia Jetson Orin and AMD Versal).
  The evaluation shows that when using a non-learning-based feature detector such as FAST and Harris, their GPU implementations, and the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM can achieve better run-time performance and energy efficiency than the FAST and Harris FPGA implementations as well as the FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM. However, when considering a learning-based detector such as SuperPoint, its FPGA implementation can achieve better run-time performance and energy efficiency (up to 3.1$\times$ and 1.4$\times$ improvements, respectively) than the GPU implementation. The FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM can also achieve comparable run-time performance compared to the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM, with better FPS in 2 out of 5 dataset sequences. When considering the accuracy, the results show that the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM is more accurate than the FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM in general. Last but not least, the use of hardware acceleration for feature detection could further improve the performance of the V-SLAM pipeline by having the global bundle adjustment module invoked less frequently without sacrificing accuracy.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Gate-Based Quantum Reservoir Computing on NISQ Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) offers a hardware-friendly approach to temporal learning, yet most studies target univariate signals and overlook near-term hardware constraints. This work introduces a gate-based QRC for multivariate time series (MTS-QRC) that pairs injection and memory qubits and uses a Trotterized nearest-neighbor transverse-field Ising evolution optimized for current device connectivity and depth. On Lorenz-63 and ENSO, the method achieves a mean square error (MSE) of 0.0087 and 0.0036, respectively, performing on par with classical reservoir computing on Lorenz and above learned RNNs on both, while NVAR and clustered ESN remain stronger on some settings. On IBM Heron R2, MTS-QRC sustains accuracy with realistic depths and, interestingly, outperforms a noiseless simulator on ENSO; singular value analysis indicates that device noise can concentrate variance in feature directions, acting as an implicit regularizer for linear readout in this regime. These findings support the practicality of gate-based QRC for MTS forecasting on NISQ hardware and motivate systematic studies on when and how hardware noise benefits QRC readouts.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Crypto-shopper: Knowledge and Preferences of Consumers Using Cryptocurrencies for Purchases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02911v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fast-growing cryptocurrency sector presents both challenges and opportunities for businesses and consumers alike. This study investigates the knowledge, expertise, and buying habits of people who shop using cryptocurrencies. Our survey of 516 participants shows that knowledge levels vary from beginners to experts. Interestingly, a segment of respondents, nearly 30%, showed high purchase frequency despite their limited knowledge. Regression analyses indicated that while domain knowledge plays a role, it only accounts for 11.6% of the factors affecting purchasing frequency. A K-means cluster analysis further segmented the respondents into three distinct groups, each having unique knowledge levels and purchasing tendencies. These results challenge the conventional idea linking extensive knowledge to increased cryptocurrency usage, suggesting other factors at play. Understanding this varying crypto-shopper demographic is pivotal for businesses, emphasizing the need for tailored strategies and user-friendly experiences. This study offers insights into current crypto-shopping behaviors and discusses future research exploring the broader impacts and potential shifts in the crypto-consumer landscape.</description>

      <title>LLM-Enabled In-Context Learning for Data Collection Scheduling in UAV-assisted Sensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being utilized in various private and commercial applications, e.g., traffic control, parcel delivery, and Search and Rescue (SAR) missions. Machine Learning (ML) methods used in UAV-Assisted Sensor Networks (UASNETs) and, especially, in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) face challenges such as complex and lengthy model training, gaps between simulation and reality, and low sampling efficiency, which conflict with the urgency of emergencies, such as SAR missions. In this paper, an In-Context Learning (ICL)-Data Collection Scheduling (ICLDC) system is proposed as an alternative to DRL in emergencies. The UAV collects sensory data and transmits it to a Large Language Model (LLM), which creates a task description in natural language. From this description, the UAV receives a data collection schedule that must be executed. A verifier ensures safe UAV operations by evaluating the schedules generated by the LLM and overriding unsafe schedules based on predefined rules. The system continuously adapts by incorporating feedback into the task descriptions and using this for future decisions. This method is tested against jailbreaking attacks, where the task description is manipulated to undermine network performance, highlighting the vulnerability of LLMs to such attacks. The proposed ICLDC significantly reduces cumulative packet loss compared to both the DQN and Maximum Channel Gain baselines. ICLDC presents a promising direction for intelligent scheduling and control in UASNETs.</description>

      <title>High-Parallel FPGA-Based Discrete Simulated Bifurcation for Large-Scale Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problems exhibit exponential complexity, making their resolution challenging. Simulated Adiabatic Bifurcation (aSB) is a quantum-inspired algorithm to obtain approximate solutions to largescale CO problems written in the Ising form. It explores the solution space by emulating the adiabatic evolution of a network of Kerr-nonlinear parametric oscillators (KPOs), where each oscillator represents a variable in the problem. The optimal solution corresponds to the ground state of this system. A key advantage of this approach is the possibility of updating multiple variables simultaneously, making it particularly suited for hardware implementation. To enhance solution quality and convergence speed, variations of the algorithm have been proposed in the literature, including ballistic (bSB), discrete (dSB), and thermal (HbSB) versions. In this work, we have comprehensively analyzed dSB, bSB, and HbSB using dedicated software models, evaluating the feasibility of using a fixed-point representation for hardware implementation. We then present an opensource hardware architecture implementing the dSB algorithm for Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The design allows users to adjust the degree of algorithmic parallelization based on their specific requirements. A proof-of-concept implementation that solves 256-variable problems was achieved on an AMD Kria KV260 SoM, a low-tier FPGA, validated using well-known max-cut and knapsack problems.</description>
