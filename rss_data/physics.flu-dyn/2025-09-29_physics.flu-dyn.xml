      <title>The Weakly-Nonlinear Admittance at Open Ends of Two- and Three-Dimensional Acoustic Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a weakly-nonlinear exit condition for open ends of acoustic waveguides without mean flow; to our knowledge this is the first time an acoustic open end has been analysed outside the linear regime. The resulting admittance boundary condition, and its weakly-nonlinear counterpart, extends recent weakly-nonlinear modelling of curved ducts (Jensen &amp; Brambley 2025, arXiv:2503.11536) to include open ends. We approximate free space by considering the open-ended duct to be enclosed within a much larger concentric duct; within the larger duct, the smaller duct exit is modelled as an acoustic discontinuity. Importantly, the superposition principle is unneeded, allowing the model to be applied in the nonlinear regime. The exit condition can be calculated without needing to solve the full problem in either the outer or inner ducts, making it numerically efficient. The exit condition is validated in the linear regime by comparison to Wiener-Hopf solutions of the duct end correction, and a novel nonlinear end correction is proposed; we find that both non-plane waves and nonlinearity cause the end correction to vary significantly from Rayleigh's classical 0.6 radii result. A number of numerical illustrations are then discussed, demonstrating nonlinear effects, sound radiating from curved ducts, sound radiating from an exponential horn (representative of brass instrument bells), and the harmonic effects of the open end on in-duct resonances. The model has potential applications to sound in woodwind and brass instruments.</description>

      <title>Self-avoiding fluid deformable surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a numerical method for fluid deformable surfaces governed by surface Stokes flow and Helfrich bending energy under active growth, aiming to model shape evolution of the epithelium in developmental processes. To prevent self-intersections, which commonly arise under large deformations or low enclosed volume to area ratios, we incorporate the nonlocal tangent-point energy to penalize non-embedded configurations. The resulting formulation is discretized using higher order surface finite elements, with a parallelizable assembly strategy for the nonlocal terms. To tailor mesh quality to the geometric evolution, we propose a curvature-adaptive mesh redistribution strategy that improves mesh resolution in regions of high curvature. Numerical examples include the discocyte-to-stomatocyte transition and the inversion of a sphere within a spherical confinement. Both demonstrate the robustness of the method in capturing large deformations, self-avoidance, symmetry-breaking and growth-induced morphology changes.</description>

      <title>Predicting the distribution of yield-stress fluids in branched pipe manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a one-dimensional network model to predict the steady-state distribution of yield-stress fluids in branched pipe manifolds under wall-slip conditions. The model accounts for major friction losses between junctions and incorporates wall slip through a power-law relation calibrated independently via capillary rheometry. Predictions from the model are validated against both bench-scale experiments and fully resolved computational fluid dynamics simulations, showing excellent agreement across a range of flow conditions. Our results demonstrate that wall slip strongly influences the uniformity of fluid distribution by modifying the relative resistance between outlet branches. Furthermore, we show that the problem can be inverted: measured distribution profiles can be used to estimate slip parameters, offering a practical method for slip characterisation without pressure measurement. This modelling framework is computationally inexpensive, robust, and adaptable to various network configurations, making it a valuable tool for the design and analysis of industrial manifold systems involving viscoplastic fluids.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of Kolmogorov Scaling and Modified Energy Transfer in Bubble-Laden Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of a dispersed bubble phase on forced homogeneous and isotropic turbulence using high-resolution high-performance simulations based on the lattice Boltzmann method. While the classical Kolmogorov energy cascade is largely preserved when considering the system as a whole, a phase-specific analysis reveals striking deviations from the classical turbulence scaling. In particular, the gas phase exhibits significant departures from Kolmogorov's predictions, whereas the continuous liquid phase retains a turbulence structure consistent with classical expectations up to 24% in gas volume fractions. These findings suggest that, despite the presence of a dispersed phase, the global energy transfer remains close to a universal behavior. At the same time, phase-specific interactions are shown to introduce modifications to the turbulent dynamics at small scales. In particular, the gas-phase exhibits a nearly flat spectrum at low wave numbers followed by a k^{-3} scaling at intermediate scales pointing to the presence of patterns of localized bursts uniformly distributed between two finite wavelengths.Our results aim at deepening the understanding of multiphase turbulence, particularly in the context of energy transfer mechanisms and phase interactions in bubble-laden flows. This study provides a framework for future investigations into the fundamental properties of multiphase turbulence and its implications for environmental, atmospheric, and industrial flows.</description>

      <title>Effect of Expansion Geometry on Turbulence in Axisymmetric Pipe Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of expansion geometry on the flow field and turbulence structure in axisymmetric pipe flows through comparative analysis of abrupt ($90^\circ$) and gradual ($45^\circ$) area expansions with an area ratio of 2.56 at step-height Reynolds numbers of 25000 and 35000. Utilizing refractive index-matched stereo Particle Image Velocimetry, we resolve the three-component velocity fields and extract turbulence statistics with high spatial fidelity. Both configurations exhibit full flow separation, recirculation, and shear layer development; however, the gradual expansion consistently yields elevated turbulence levels, broader shear layers, enhanced Reynolds stress anisotropy, and stronger out-of-plane fluctuations. In contrast, the abrupt expansion generates a secondary vortex that disrupts the return flow, reducing shear layer interaction and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) production. The governing mechanism is attributed to the geometry-induced modulation of the return flow. In the gradual case, the return flow remains attached to the sloped surface and impinges obliquely on the free-stream, generating a distributed region of high shear and sustained turbulence production leading to intensified TKE and anisotropy in the near-expansion region. The abrupt case confines this interaction, limiting turbulence generation spatially and structurally. These findings reconcile prior observations of increased pressure loss in sloped expansions and reveal the fundamental role of expansion slope in controlling turbulence generation and energy redistribution in separated flows. The observed trends suggest a generalizable mechanism relevant to a broader range of expansion angles and flow conditions.</description>

      <title>Quasi-geostrophic limiting dynamics and energetics of the LANS-$\alpha$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lagrangian-Averaged Navier-Stokes-$\alpha$ (LANS-$\alpha$) model, a turbulence closure scheme based on energy-conserving modifications to nonlinear advection, can produce more energetic simulations than standard models, leading to improved fidelity (e.g., in ocean models). However, comprehensive understanding of the mechanism driving this energetic enhancement has proven elusive. To address this gap, we derive the fast quasi-geostrophic limit of the three-dimensional, stably-stratified LANS-$\alpha$ equations. This provides both the slow, balanced flow and the leading-order fast wave dynamics. Analysis of these wave dynamics suggests that an explanation for the energetic enhancement lies in the dual role of the smoothing parameter itself: increasing $\alpha$ regularizes the dynamics and simultaneously generates a robust landscape of wave-wave resonant interactions. Direct numerical simulations show that $\alpha$ plays an analogous role to that of the Burger number ($Bu$) in governing the partition of energy between slow and fast modes -- and consequently, the timescale of geostrophic adjustment -- but with key differences. Increasing $\alpha$, regardless of the relative strengths of rotation and stratification, extends the lifetime of wave energy by delaying the dominance of the slow modes. We find that the creation of an energy pathway only involving fast waves is a universal outcome of the regularization across all values of $Bu$, contrasting with a disruption of slow-fast interactions that is most impactful only in the $Bu=1$ case. These insights unify the LANS-$\alpha$ model's characteristic energetic enhancement with, in some cases, its known numerical stiffness, identifying potential pathways to mitigate stability issues hindering the broader application of LANS-$\alpha$-type models.</description>

      <title>Down-scale marine hydrodynamic analysis at the Norwegian coast -- the NORA-SARAH open framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offshore wave studies often assume Gaussian processes and homogeneous wave fields. However, as waves approach the shoreline, complex coastal topo-bathymetry induces transformations such as shoaling, refraction, diffraction, reflection, and breaking, leading to increased nonlinearity and site-specific wave characteristics. This complexity necessitates detailed site-specific studies for coastal infrastructure design and blue economy planning. This work presents a downscaling procedure for analyzing wave-structure interactions from offshore metocean conditions. The open-access NORA3 and NORA10EI hindcast databases define offshore sea states, which are propagated to nearshore regions using the phase-averaged wave model SWAN. The outputs inform phase-resolving simulations with the fully nonlinear potential flow solver REEF3D::FNPF, incorporating an Arbitrary Eulerian-Lagrangian (ALE) method to compute wave forces via Morisons formulation and to screen for extreme events. Extreme wave loads are further examined using the fully viscous Navier-Stokes solver REEF3D::CFD. A one-way hydrodynamic coupling (HDC) between the potential flow and viscous solvers ensures accurate information transfer. The proposed NORA-SARAH framework, integrating NORA databases with SWAN, REEF3D, ALE, and HDC, offers a robust approach for complex coastal environments. A case study in Southern Norway demonstrates its advantages over traditional significant wave height (Hs)-based or phase-averaged modeling practices, highlighting the necessity of this downscaling method.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal coalescence-breakup dynamics in concentrated emulsions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense stabilized emulsions are mixtures of immiscible fluids where the high-volume fraction droplet dispersed phase is stabilized against coalescence by steric interactions. The production of emulsions involves high-shear flows and it is well known that at a critical volume fraction the emulsion loses stability, undergoing an extremely rapid process where the fluid components in the emulsion exchange roles. This process, called catastrophic phase inversion, which resembles in several respects a dynamical phase transition, has remained widely elusive from an experimental and theoretical point of view. In this work, we present state-of-the-art experimental and numerical data to support a dynamical-system framework capable of precisely highlighting the dynamics occurring in the system as it approaches the catastrophic phase inversion. Our study clearly highlights that at high volume fractions, dynamical changes in the emulsion morphology, due to coalescence and breakup of droplets, play a critical role in determining emulsion's rheology and stability. Additionally, we show that at approaching the critical volume fractions, the dynamics can be simplified as being controlled by the dynamics of a correlation length represented, in our systems, by the size of the largest droplet. This dynamics shares a close connection with non-reciprocal phase transition where two different physical mechanisms, coalescence and breakups, can get out of balance leading to large non-symmetric periodic excursions in phase space. We clarify the phenomenology observed and quantitatively explain the essential aspect of the highly complex dynamics of stabilized emulsions undergoing catastrophic phase inversion.</description>

      <title>Impact of Loss Weight and Model Complexity on Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Computational Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics Informed Neural Networks offer a mesh free framework for solving PDEs but are highly sensitive to loss weight selection. We propose two dimensional analysis based weighting schemes, one based on quantifiable terms, and another also incorporating unquantifiable terms for more balanced training. Benchmarks on heat conduction, convection diffusion, and lid driven cavity flows show that the second scheme consistently improves stability and accuracy over equal weighting. Notably, in high Peclet number convection diffusion, where traditional solvers fail, PINNs with our scheme achieve stable, accurate predictions, highlighting their robustness and generalizability in CFD problems.</description>

      <title>The stability of propagating plane inertial waves in rotating fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inertial waves transport energy and momentum in rotating fluids and are a major contributor to mixing and tidal dissipation in Earth's oceans, gaseous planets, and stellar interiors. However, their stability and breakdown mechanisms are not fully understood. We examine the linear stability and nonlinear breakdown of finite-amplitude propagating plane inertial waves using Floquet theory and direct numerical simulations. The Floquet analysis generalizes previous studies as it is valid for arbitrary perturbation wavelengths and primary wave amplitudes. We find that the wavenumber orientation of the most unstable perturbations depends strongly on the wave frequency and weakly on the wave amplitude. The most unstable perturbations have wavelengths that are small relative to the primary wave wavelength for low wave amplitudes, but become comparable for large wave amplitudes. We then use direct numerical simulations to follow the nonlinear breakdown of the wave and examine how the wave energy is either dissipated in a forward cascade or accumulated into long-lived geostrophic modes. Simulations reveal that the conversion efficiency into geostrophic modes increases with increasing wave amplitude, as expected for pumping of geostrophic modes by nearly-resonant triadic interactions. We also find that the conversion efficiency increases with decreasing primary wave frequency, which may be due to the more efficient coupling of quasi-2D waves to geostrophic modes. These results on the stability and breakdown of single plane inertial waves provides additional foundation for understanding the role of inertial waves in rotating turbulence, transport properties of inertial wave beams, and inertial wave propagation in more complex environments such as those with magnetic fields or shear flows.</description>

      <title>Fast summation of Stokes potentials using a new kernel-splitting in the DMK framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical Ewald methods for Coulomb and Stokes interactions rely on ``kernel-splitting," using decompositions based on Gaussians to divide the resulting potential into a near field and a far field component. Here, we show that a more efficient splitting for the scalar biharmonic Green's function can be derived using zeroth-order prolate spheroidal wave functions (PSWFs), which in turn yields new efficient splittings for the Stokeslet, stresslet, and elastic kernels, since these Green's tensors can all be derived from the biharmonic kernel. This benefits all fast summation methods based on kernel splitting, including FFT-based Ewald summation methods, that are suitable for uniform point distributions, and DMK-based methods that allow for nonuniform point distributions. The DMK (dual-space multilevel kernel-splitting) algorithm we develop here is fast, adaptive, and linear-scaling, both in free space and in a periodic cube. We demonstrate its performance with numerical examples in two and three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Neural Operators for Mathematical Modeling of Transient Fluid Flow in Subsurface Reservoir Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for modeling transient fluid flow in subsurface reservoir systems based on the developed neural operator architecture (TFNO-opt). Reservoir systems are complex dynamic objects with distributed parameters described by systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). Traditional numerical methods for modeling such systems, despite their high accuracy, are characterized by significant time costs for performing calculations, which limits their applicability in control and decision support problems. The proposed architecture (TFNO-opt) is based on Fourier neural operators, which allow approximating PDE solutions in infinite-dimensional functional spaces, providing invariance to discretization and the possibility of generalization to various implementations of equations. The developed modifications are aimed at increasing the accuracy and stability of the trained neural operator, which is especially important for control problems. These include adjustable internal time resolution of the integral Fourier operator, tensor decomposition of parameters in the spectral domain, use of the Sobolev norm in the error function, and separation of approximation errors and reconstruction of initial conditions for more accurate reproduction of physical processes. The effectiveness of the proposed improvements is confirmed by computational experiments. The practical significance is confirmed by computational experiments using the example of the problem of hydrodynamic modeling of an underground gas storage (UGS), where the acceleration of calculations by six orders of magnitude was achieved, compared to traditional methods. This opens up new opportunities for the effective control of complex reservoir systems.</description>

      <title>Reparameterizing 4DVAR with neural fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVAR) is a cornerstone of numerical weather prediction, but its cost function is difficult to optimize and computationally intensive. We propose a neural field-based reformulation in which the full spatiotemporal state is represented as a continuous function parameterized by a neural network. This reparameterization removes the time-sequential dependency of classical 4DVAR, enabling parallel-in-time optimization in parameter space. Physical constraints are incorporated directly through a physics-informed loss, simplifying implementation and reducing computational cost. We evaluate the method on the two-dimensional incompressible Navier--Stokes equations with Kolmogorov forcing. Compared to a baseline 4DVAR implementation, the neural reparameterized variants produce more stable initial condition estimates without spurious oscillations. Notably, unlike most machine learning-based approaches, our framework does not require access to ground-truth states or reanalysis data, broadening its applicability to settings with limited reference information.</description>

      <title>Micro-macro kinetic flux-vector splitting schemes for the multidimensional Boltzmann-ES-BGK equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kinetic Boltzmann equation models gas dynamics over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Simplified versions of the full Boltzmann collision operator, such as the classical Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook and the closely related Ellipsoidal-Statistical-BGK operators, can dramatically decrease the computational costs of numerical solving kinetic equations. Classical BGK yields incorrect transport coefficients (relative to the full Boltzmann collision operator) at low Knudsen numbers, whereas ES-BGK captures them correctly. In this work, we develop a finite volume method using a micro-macro decomposition of the distribution function, which requires a smaller velocity mesh relative to direct kinetic methods for low and intermediate Knudsen numbers. The macro portion of the model is a fluid model with a moment closure provided from the heat flux tensor calculated from the micro portion. The micro portion is obtained by applying to the original kinetic equation a projector into the orthogonal complement of the null space of the collision operator - this projector depends on the macro portion. In particular, we extend the technique of Bennoune, Lemou, and Mieussens [Uniformly stable schemes for the Boltzmann equation preserving the compressible Navier-Stokes asymptotics, J. Comput. Phys. (2008)] to two-space dimensions, the ES-BGK collision operator, and problems with reflecting wall boundary conditions. As it appears in both the micro and macro equations, the collision operator is handled via L-stable implicit time discretizations. At the same time, the remaining transport terms are computed via kinetic flux vector splitting (for macro) and upwind differencing (for micro). The resulting scheme is applied to various test cases in 1D and 2D. The 2D version of the code is parallelized via MPI, and we present weak and strong scaling studies with varying numbers of processors.</description>

      <title>Reversible GNS for Dissipative Fluids with Consistent Bidirectional Dynamics</title>

Abstract: Simulating physically plausible trajectories toward user-defined goals is a fundamental yet challenging task in fluid dynamics. While particle-based simulators can efficiently reproduce forward dynamics, inverse inference remains difficult, especially in dissipative systems where dynamics are irreversible and optimization-based solvers are slow, unstable, and often fail to converge. In this work, we introduce the Reversible Graph Network Simulator (R-GNS), a unified framework that enforces bidirectional consistency within a single graph architecture. Unlike prior neural simulators that approximate inverse dynamics by fitting backward data, R-GNS does not attempt to reverse the underlying physics. Instead, we propose a mathematically invertible design based on residual reversible message passing with shared parameters, coupling forward dynamics with inverse inference to deliver accurate predictions and efficient recovery of plausible initial states. Experiments on three dissipative benchmarks (Water-3D, WaterRamps, and WaterDrop) show that R-GNS achieves higher accuracy and consistency with only one quarter of the parameters, and performs inverse inference more than 100 times faster than optimization-based baselines. For forward simulation, R-GNS matches the speed of strong GNS baselines, while in goal-conditioned tasks it eliminates iterative optimization and achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups. On goal-conditioned tasks, R-GNS further demonstrates its ability to complex target shapes (e.g., characters "L" and "N") through vivid, physically consistent trajectories. To our knowledge, this is the first reversible framework that unifies forward and inverse simulation for dissipative fluid systems.</description>

      <title>Fast-Forward Lattice Boltzmann: Learning Kinetic Behaviour with Physics-Informed Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE), rooted in kinetic theory, provides a powerful framework for capturing complex flow behaviour by describing the evolution of single-particle distribution functions (PDFs). Despite its success, solving the LBE numerically remains computationally intensive due to strict time-step restrictions imposed by collision kernels. Here, we introduce a physics-informed neural operator framework for the LBE that enables prediction over large time horizons without step-by-step integration, effectively bypassing the need to explicitly solve the collision kernel. We incorporate intrinsic moment-matching constraints of the LBE, along with global equivariance of the full distribution field, enabling the model to capture the complex dynamics of the underlying kinetic system. Our framework is discretization-invariant, enabling models trained on coarse lattices to generalise to finer ones (kinetic super-resolution). In addition, it is agnostic to the specific form of the underlying collision model, which makes it naturally applicable across different kinetic datasets regardless of the governing dynamics. Our results demonstrate robustness across complex flow scenarios, including von Karman vortex shedding, ligament breakup, and bubble adhesion. This establishes a new data-driven pathway for modelling kinetic systems.</description>

      <title>Mathematical model of fluid front dynamics driven by porous media pumps</title>

Abstract: Air-permeable porous media hosts air within their pores. Upon removal from the interior of the material, these porous media have the tendency to reabsorb air from the surrounding, acting as a suction pump. Therefore, the technique used to convert porous media into a pump, consists of degassing the material to remove their air inside. The suction property when recovering the air, can be used to move a liquid through a microfluidic channel. Porous media pumps are very accurate devices to move liquids in a completely controlled way. {By studying the dynamics of the liquid front moved by these pumps, it is possible to extract characteristic properties of both the fluid and the porous material.} In this article, we have developed a theoretical mathematical model that precisely characterizes the dynamics of a liquid moved by a degassed porous media pump through a microchannel by comparing it with experimental data. {We have seen the differences between sealing the external surface of the pump so that it cannot absorb air from the outside, both mathematically and experimentally.} We have observed that, in all cases, the theory fits satisfactorily with the experiments, corroborating the validity of the model. The creation of microfluidic pumps using porous media can be a very useful tool in various fields due to its long operating time, small size and the fact that it operates without any external power source.</description>

      <title>Heat transfer modulation in Phase Change Materials via fin insertion</title>

Abstract: We leverage a large set of numerical simulations to study optimized geometrical configurations for Phase Change Materials (PCMs) cells. We consider a PCM cell as a square enclosure with a solid substance that undergoes melting under the effect of a heat source from one side and under the effects of buoyancy forces. Moreover, an additional source fin with prescribed length $l$ and height $h$ protrudes into the cell perpendicularly from the heat source. The fin prompts enhanced heat transfer and convection within the PCM cell, thus shortening (in comparison to a finless cell) the melting time $t_m$ needed for all the PCM material to melt and transit from the solid to the liquid phase. This improvement is systematically studied as a function of the fin geometrical details ($l$, $h$), as well as the Rayleigh number $\operatorname{Ra}$ -- encoding the importance of buoyancy forces with respect to diffusion/dissipation effects -- and the Stefan number $\operatorname{St}$ -- encoding the importance of sensible heat with respect to latent heat. Overall, our systematic study in terms of the free parameters $l$, $h$, $\operatorname{Ra}$ and $\operatorname{St}$ offers inspiring insights to optimize the structure of a PCM cell during its manufacturing process and suggests optimal operating conditions for such geometrical configurations.</description>

      <title>Modeling and simulation of inductionless magnetohydrodynamic free surface problems with unmatched densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new diffuse interface model for simulating an inductionless magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) free surface problem. By using the Onsager's variational principle and the laws of thermodynamics, we derive a thermodynamically consistent system that couples the Cahn--Hilliard equation modeling phase separation, the Navier--Stokes equations governing fluid motion, and a generalized Darcy's law accounting for electromagnetic effects. In contrast to existing diffuse interface MHD models, the proposed model can handle general material properties in practical engineering applications. Furthermore, through asymptotic arguments, we investigate the sharp interface limit, and then demonstrate that the classical sharp interface model can be recovered as the interface thickness approaches zero, theoretically validating the proposed diffuse interface model as an approximate approach. An efficient decoupled, linear, and charge-conservative finite element scheme is designed, and it significantly facilitates the large-scale and accurate numerical simulations involving large parameter ratios. Finally, we present several three-dimensional numerical experiments of magnetic damping effects on bubble dynamics for the demonstration of the capability of the proposed model and method in capturing complex MHD phenomena.</description>
