      <title>Interpreting Convolutional Neural Network Activation Maps with Hand-crafted Radiomics Features on Progression of Pediatric Craniopharyngioma after Irradiation Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are promising in predicting treatment outcome for pediatric craniopharyngioma while the decision mechanisms are difficult to interpret. We compared the activation maps of CNN with hand crafted radiomics features of a densely connected artificial neural network (ANN) to correlate with clinical decisions. Methods: A cohort of 100 pediatric craniopharyngioma patients were included. Binary tumor progression was classified by an ANN and CNN with input of T1w, T2w, and FLAIR MRI. Hand-crafted radiomic features were calculated from the MRI using the LifeX software and key features were selected by Group lasso regularization, comparing to the activation maps of CNN. We evaluated the radiomics models by accuracy, area under receiver operational curve (AUC), and confusion matrices. Results: The average accuracy of T1w, T2w, and FLAIR MRI was 0.85, 0.92, and 0.86 (ANOVA, F = 1.96, P = 0.18) with ANN; 0.83, 0.81, and 0.70 (ANOVA, F = 10.11, P = 0.003) with CNN. The average AUC of ANN was 0.91, 0.97, and 0.90; 0.86, 0.88, and 0.75 of CNN for the 3 MRI, respectively. The activation maps were correlated with tumor shape, min and max intensity, and texture features. Conclusions: The tumor progression for pediatric patients with craniopharyngioma achieved promising accuracy with ANN and CNN model. The activation maps extracted from different levels were interpreted with hand-crafted key features of ANN.</description>

      <title>Deep-learning-based Radiomics on Mitigating Post-treatment Obesity for Pediatric Craniopharyngioma Patients after Surgery and Proton Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: We developed an artificial neural network (ANN) combining radiomics with clinical and dosimetric features to predict the extent of body mass index (BMI) increase after surgery and proton therapy, with advantage of improved accuracy and integrated key feature selection. Methods and Materials: Uniform treatment protocol composing of limited surgery and proton radiotherapy was given to 84 pediatric craniopharyngioma patients (aged 1-20 years). Post-treatment obesity was classified into 3 groups (&lt;10%, 10-20%, and &gt;20%) based on the normalized BMI increase during a 5-year follow-up. We developed a densely connected 4-layer ANN with radiomics calculated from pre-surgery MRI (T1w, T2w, and FLAIR), combining clinical and dosimetric features as input. Accuracy, area under operative curve (AUC), and confusion matrices were compared with random forest (RF) models in a 5-fold cross-validation. The Group lasso regularization optimized a sparse connection to input neurons to identify key features from high-dimensional input. Results: Classification accuracy of the ANN reached above 0.9 for T1w, T2w, and FLAIR MRI. Confusion matrices showed high true positive rates of above 0.9 while the false positive rates were below 0.2. Approximately 10 key features selected for T1w, T2w, and FLAIR MRI, respectively. The ANN improved classification accuracy by 10% or 5% when compared to RF models without or with radiomic features. Conclusion: The ANN model improved classification accuracy on post-treatment obesity compared to conventional statistics models. The clinical features selected by Group lasso regularization confirmed our practical observation, while the additional radiomic and dosimetric features could serve as imaging markers and mitigation methods on post-treatment obesity for pediatric craniopharyngioma patients.</description>

      <title>4D Computational Ultrasound Imaging of Carotid Artery Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational ultrasound imaging (cUSi) with few elements and spatial field encoding can provide high-resolution volumetric B-mode imaging. In this work, we extend its application to 4D carotid artery (CA) flow imaging using a custom large-aperture 240-element matrix probe. We implemented a frequency band-based matched filtering strategy that balances resolution and contrast. The system's inherent imaging capabilities were evaluated and validated in flow phantom and human CA experiments. In the phantom study, 3D/4D power Doppler image and speckle-tracking analyses confirmed the system's ability to resolve flow structures and hemodynamics. In the human study, the CA bifurcation flow structure and its local pulsatile flow dynamics were successfully reconstructed. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using a large-footprint, few-element cUSi system for 4D CA flow assessment.</description>

      <title>Dynamic transitions for fast joint acquisition and reconstruction of CEST-Rex and T1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: This work proposes a method for the simultaneous estimation of the exchange-dependent relaxation rate Rex and the longitudinal relaxation time T1 from a single acquisition. Methods: A novel acquisition scheme was developed that combines CEST saturation with an inversion pulse and a Look-Locker readout to capture the magnetization evolution starting from the inverse transient Z-spectrum. The corresponding signal model, derived from the Bloch-McConnell equations, describes both the transient Z-spectrum and the Look-Locker dynamics. A model-based reconstruction approach is employed to jointly estimate Rex and T1. The proposed method was validated using a numerical phantom and benchmarked against conventional CEST and Look-Locker T1 mapping in phantom and in vivo on a clinical 3T scanner. Results: The joint estimation approach demonstrated strong agreement with ground truth and conventional methods across a wide range of T1 and CEST parameters. The acquisition time was reduced by 20-30% compared to standard CEST protocols, while providing higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in parameter maps. Conclusion: The proposed technique enables robust and efficient simultaneous quantification of CEST Rex and T1 in a single acquisition. It improves parameter map quality and reduces scan time, making it suitable for both phantom and in vivo imaging across a wide range of physiological conditions.</description>

      <title>Contour-informed inter-patient deformable registration of Head-and-Neck patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background and Purpose: Voxel-based analysis (VBA) helps to identify dose-sensitive regions by aligning individual dose distributions within a common coordinate system (CCS). Accurate deformable image registration (DIR) is essential for addressing anatomical variability across patients. To improve both global and region-specific alignment, we enhanced our in-house DIR algorithm (CPT-DIR) with contour-informed regularisations. We tested its performance for head-and-neck (HN) CT images.
  Materials and Methods: We developed and evaluated contour-informed CPT-DIR on 37 HN CTs, including 7 with ground-truth dose for warped dose validation. Bone contours were generated using TotalSegmentator, while other organs at risk (OARs) were manually delineated. Contour-based constraints, such as Dice Similarity, were integrated to enhance registration outcome. The global registration results were evaluated using MAE, SSIM and PSNR. Geometric accuracy and warped dose accuracy were assessed using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Dose-Organ Overlap (DOO). Constrained and unconstrained CPT-DIR were compared to B-spline.
  Results: CPT-DIR achieved superior accuracy with a MAE of 98.9\pm6.3 HU, lower than 179.1\pm17.8 HU for B-spline. Incorporating brainstem contours as regularisation improved the DSC from 0.604\pm0.116 to 0.878\pm0.017 and DOO from 0.430\pm0.117 to 0.753\pm0.043 for brainstem. Across all metrics, the enhanced CPT-DIR outperformed the B-spline, confirming its advantages in geometric accuracy.
  Conclusions: The integration of contour-informed regularisation in CPT-DIR improved DIR accuracy, particularly in dosimetrically relevant regions. This enhanced spatial alignment enabled more precise dose mapping for VBA and demonstrated strong potential for advancing reliable inter-patient dosimetric studies in HN radiotherapy.</description>

      <title>Motion simulation of radio-labeled cells in whole-body positron emission tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07709v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cell tracking is a subject of active research gathering great interest in medicine and biology. Positron emission tomography (PET) is well suited for tracking radio-labeled cells in vivo due to its exceptional sensitivity and whole-body capability. For validation, ground-truth data are desirable that realistically mimic the flow of cells in a clinical situation. This study develops a workflow (CeFloPS) for simulating moving radio-labeled cells in a human phantom. From the XCAT phantom, the blood vessels are reduced to nodal networks along which cells can move and distribute to organs and tissues. The movement is directed by the blood flow, which is calculated in each node using the Hagen-Pooiseuille equation and Kirchhoff's laws assuming laminar flow. Organs are voxelized and movement of cells from artery entry to vein exit is generated via a biased 3D random walk. The probabilities of cells moving or remaining in tissues are derived from rate constants of tracer kinetic-based compartment modeling. PET listmode data is generated using the Monte-Carlo simulation framework GATE based on the definition of a large-body PET scanner with cell paths as moving radioactive sources and the XCAT phantom providing attenuation data. From the flow simulation of 100,000 cells, 100 sample cells were further processed by GATE and listmode data was reconstructed into images for comparison. As demonstrated by comparisons of simulated and reconstructed cell distributions, CeFloPS is capable of simulating cell behavior in whole-body PET. It achieves this simulation in a way that is anatomically and physiologically reasonable, thereby providing valuable data for the development and validation of cell tracking algorithms.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of corneal and lens doses in nuclear medicine and impact of lead eyeglasses: a Monte Carlo simulation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: Research on eye lens dosimetry for radiation workers has increased after the 2012 ICRP118 update on eye lens dose limits. However, corneal dosimetry remains underexplored due to historical focus and measurement challenges. This study uses a high-resolution digital eye phantom in Monte Carlo simulations to estimate corneal and lens doses for nuclear medicine staff, with and without lead glasses. Method: The Monte Carlo code GATE (version 9.0) based on GEANT4 (version 10.6) was used to estimate and compare doses in a digital eye phantom, accounting for primary and scattered radiation from common radionuclides (F18, I131, Tc99m) with varying lead glass shielding (0 to 0.75 mm). Results: Across all radionuclides, the dose to the cornea was consistently higher than the dose to the lens. Notably, the ratio of corneal to lens dose increased with thicker lead glasses, indicating a greater dose reduction to the lens compared to the cornea. Conclusion: The findings show that corneal doses from all studied radionuclides exceeded lens doses. Although increasing lead glass thickness reduced both, the reduction was more significant for the lens, raising the cornea-to-lens dose ratio. This trend suggests that while thicker lead glasses enhance lens protection, their practicality may be limited due to diminishing returns and potential discomfort.

      <title>Non-invasive Reversible Software-based Configuration of a Clinically Used Linear Accelerator for Preclinical Electron FLASH Radiobiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Configuring clinical linear accelerators (linacs) for ultra-high dose rate (UHDR) electron experiments typically requires invasive hardware manipulation and/or irreversible manufacturer modifications, limiting broader implementation. We present an independently developed UHDR electron configuration of a clinical TrueBeam linac that allows reversible switching between preclinical UHDR and conventional (CONV) modes using only non-invasive software settings. UHDR mode was achieved via service mode software with RF and beam current settings typical of a photon beam, the photon target and monitor chamber retracted, and a clinically unused low-energy scattering foil inserted. An external AC current transformer (ACCT) for beam monitoring, anatomy-specific collimator, and sample holder were mounted on the accessory tray, with external ion chamber in solid water for exit dose monitoring. Percent depth dose (PDD) was measured for UHDR and CONV beams. Dose-per-pulse (DPP) was varied by adjusting gun voltage and quantified with radiochromic film at different source-to-surface distances (SSD). Beam profiles assessed dose uniformity and usable field size. Dose calibration was established between film, ACCT, and ion chamber, and day-to-day reproducibility was tested. PDD confirmed similar energies for UHDR (12.8MeV) and CONV (11.9MeV) beams with matching profiles through mouse thickness. Maximum DPP exceeded 0.5Gy, reaching ~1.5Gy for collimated in vivo setups and ~0.7Gy at extended SSD for tissue culture. Field flatness and symmetry were maintained, supporting organ-specific irradiations and up to 5cm fields for culture. Calibration showed strong linearity across detectors, and output variation was &lt;4%. We demonstrated accurate, reproducible UHDR delivery on a widely available clinical linac with no invasive hardware manipulation, enabling preclinical FLASH research on a clinical treatment machine.</description>
