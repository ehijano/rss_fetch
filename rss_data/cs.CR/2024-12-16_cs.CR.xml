      <title>Blockchain Data Analysis in the Era of Large-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain data analysis is essential for deriving insights, tracking transactions, identifying patterns, and ensuring the integrity and security of decentralized networks. It plays a key role in various areas, such as fraud detection, regulatory compliance, smart contract auditing, and decentralized finance (DeFi) risk management. However, existing blockchain data analysis tools face challenges, including data scarcity, the lack of generalizability, and the lack of reasoning capability.
  We believe large language models (LLMs) can mitigate these challenges; however, we have not seen papers discussing LLM integration in blockchain data analysis in a comprehensive and systematic way. This paper systematically explores potential techniques and design patterns in LLM-integrated blockchain data analysis. We also outline prospective research opportunities and challenges, emphasizing the need for further exploration in this promising field. This paper aims to benefit a diverse audience spanning academia, industry, and policy-making, offering valuable insights into the integration of LLMs in blockchain data analysis.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Driven Smishing Detection Framework for Mobile Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing reliance on smartphones for communication, financial transactions, and personal data management has made them prime targets for cyberattacks, particularly smishing, a sophisticated variant of phishing conducted via SMS. Despite the growing threat, traditional detection methods often struggle with the informal and evolving nature of SMS language, which includes abbreviations, slang, and short forms. This paper presents an enhanced content-based smishing detection framework that leverages advanced text normalization techniques to improve detection accuracy. By converting nonstandard text into its standardized form, the proposed model enhances the efficacy of machine learning classifiers, particularly the Naive Bayesian classifier, in distinguishing smishing messages from legitimate ones. Our experimental results, validated on a publicly available dataset, demonstrate a detection accuracy of 96.2%, with a low False Positive Rate of 3.87% and False Negative Rate of 2.85%. This approach significantly outperforms existing methodologies, providing a robust solution to the increasingly sophisticated threat of smishing in the mobile environment.</description>

      <title>A Practical Exercise in Adapting SIFT Using FHE Primitives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exercise in implementing Scale Invariant Feature Transform using CKKS Fully Homomorphic encryption quickly reveals some glaring limitations in the current FHE paradigm. These limitations include the lack of a standard comparison operator and certain operations that depend on it (like array max, histogram binning etc). We also observe that the existing solutions are either too low level or do not have proper abstractions to implement algorithms like SIFT. In this work, we demonstrate: 1. Methods of adapting regular code to the FHE setting. 2. Alternate implementations of standard algorithms (like array max, histogram binning, etc.) to reduce the multiplicative depth. 3. A novel method of using deferred computations to avoid performing expensive operations such as comparisons in the encrypted domain. Through this exercise, we hope this work acts as a practical guide on how one can adapt algorithms to FHE</description>

      <title>Private Synthetic Data Generation in Small Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protecting sensitive information on data streams is a critical challenge for modern systems. Current approaches to privacy in data streams follow two strategies. The first transforms the stream into a private sequence, enabling the use of non-private analyses but incurring high memory costs. The second uses compact data structures to create private summaries but restricts flexibility to predefined queries.
  To address these limitations, we propose $\textsf{PrivHP}$, a lightweight synthetic data generator that ensures differential privacy while being resource-efficient. $\textsf{PrivHP}$ generates private synthetic data that preserves the input stream's distribution, allowing flexible downstream analyses without additional privacy costs. It leverages a hierarchical decomposition of the domain, pruning low-frequency subdomains while preserving high-frequency ones in a privacy-preserving manner. To achieve memory efficiency in streaming contexts, $\textsf{PrivHP}$ uses private sketches to estimate subdomain frequencies without accessing the full dataset.
  $\textsf{PrivHP}$ is parameterized by a privacy budget $\varepsilon$, a pruning parameter $k$ and the sketch width $w$. It can process a dataset of size $n$ in $\mathcal{O}((w+k)\log (\varepsilon n))$ space, $\mathcal{O}(\log (\varepsilon n))$ update time, and outputs a private synthetic data generator in $\mathcal{O}(k\log k\log (\varepsilon n))$ time. Prior methods require $\Omega(n)$ space and construction time. Our evaluation uses the expected 1-Wasserstein distance between the sampler and the empirical distribution. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, we demonstrate that the additional cost in utility is inversely proportional to $k$ and $w$. This represents the first meaningful trade-off between performance and utility for private synthetic data generation.</description>

      <title>Empowering Patients for Disease Diagnosis and Clinical Treatment: A Smart Contract-Enabled Informed Consent Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital healthcare systems have revolutionized medical services, facilitating provider collaboration, enhancing diagnosis, and optimizing and improving treatments. They deliver superior quality, faster, reliable, and cost-effective services. Researchers are addressing pressing health challenges by integrating information technology, computing resources, and digital health records. However, digitizing healthcare introduces significant risks to patient data privacy and security, with the potential for unauthorized access to protected health information. Although patients can authorize data access through consent, there is a pressing need for mechanisms to ensure such given consent is informed and executed properly and timely. Patients deserve transparency and accountability regarding the access to their data: who access it, when, and under what circumstances. Current healthcare systems, often centralized, leave much to be desired in managing these concerns, leading to numerous security incidents. To address these issues, we propose a system based on blockchain and smart contracts for managing informed consent for accessing health records by the treatment team members, incorporating safeguards to verify that consent processes are correctly executed. Blockchain's inherent immutability ensures the integrity of consent. Smart contracts automatically execute agreements, enhancing accountability. They provide a robust framework for protecting patient privacy in the digital age. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed approach can be integrated easily with the existing healthcare systems without incurring financial and technological challenges.</description>

      <title>SCRUBD: Smart Contracts Reentrancy and Unhandled Exceptions Vulnerability Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart Contracts (SCs) handle transactions in the Ethereum blockchain worth millions of United States dollars, making them a lucrative target for attackers seeking to exploit vulnerabilities and steal funds. The Ethereum community has developed a rich set of tools to detect vulnerabilities in SCs, including reentrancy (RE) and unhandled exceptions (UX). A dataset of SCs labelled with vulnerabilities is needed to evaluate the tools' efficacy. Existing SC datasets with labelled vulnerabilities have limitations, such as covering only a limited range of vulnerability scenarios and containing incorrect labels. As a result, there is a lack of a standardized dataset to compare the performances of these tools. SCRUBD aims to fill this gap. We present a dataset of real-world SCs and synthesized SCs labelled with RE and UX. The real-world SC dataset is labelled through crowdsourcing, followed by manual inspection by an expert, and covers both RE and UX vulnerabilities. On the other hand, the synthesized dataset is carefully crafted to cover various RE scenarios only. Using SCRUBD we compared the performance of six popular vulnerability detection tools. Based on our study, we found that Slither outperforms other tools on a crowdsourced dataset in detecting RE vulnerabilities, while Sailfish outperforms other tools on a manually synthesized dataset for detecting RE. For UX vulnerabilities, Slither outperforms all other tools.</description>

      <title>From Allies to Adversaries: Manipulating LLM Tool-Calling through Adversarial Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tool-calling has changed Large Language Model (LLM) applications by integrating external tools, significantly enhancing their functionality across diverse tasks. However, this integration also introduces new security vulnerabilities, particularly in the tool scheduling mechanisms of LLM, which have not been extensively studied. To fill this gap, we present ToolCommander, a novel framework designed to exploit vulnerabilities in LLM tool-calling systems through adversarial tool injection. Our framework employs a well-designed two-stage attack strategy. Firstly, it injects malicious tools to collect user queries, then dynamically updates the injected tools based on the stolen information to enhance subsequent attacks. These stages enable ToolCommander to execute privacy theft, launch denial-of-service attacks, and even manipulate business competition by triggering unscheduled tool-calling. Notably, the ASR reaches 91.67% for privacy theft and hits 100% for denial-of-service and unscheduled tool calling in certain cases. Our work demonstrates that these vulnerabilities can lead to severe consequences beyond simple misuse of tool-calling systems, underscoring the urgent need for robust defensive strategies to secure LLM Tool-calling systems.</description>

      <title>ScaleOT: Privacy-utility-scalable Offsite-tuning with Dynamic LayerReplace and Selective Rank Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offsite-tuning is a privacy-preserving method for tuning large language models (LLMs) by sharing a lossy compressed emulator from the LLM owners with data owners for downstream task tuning. This approach protects the privacy of both the model and data owners. However, current offsite tuning methods often suffer from adaptation degradation, high computational costs, and limited protection strength due to uniformly dropping LLM layers or relying on expensive knowledge distillation. To address these issues, we propose ScaleOT, a novel privacy-utility-scalable offsite-tuning framework that effectively balances privacy and utility. ScaleOT introduces a novel layerwise lossy compression algorithm that uses reinforcement learning to obtain the importance of each layer. It employs lightweight networks, termed harmonizers, to replace the raw LLM layers. By combining important original LLM layers and harmonizers in different ratios, ScaleOT generates emulators tailored for optimal performance with various model scales for enhanced privacy protection. Additionally, we present a rank reduction method to further compress the original LLM layers, significantly enhancing privacy with negligible impact on utility. Comprehensive experiments show that ScaleOT can achieve nearly lossless offsite tuning performance compared with full fine-tuning while obtaining better model privacy.</description>

      <title>User Identity Protection in EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A brain-computer interface (BCI) establishes a direct communication pathway between the brain and an external device. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is the most popular input signal in BCIs, due to its convenience and low cost. Most research on EEG-based BCIs focuses on the accurate decoding of EEG signals; however, EEG signals also contain rich private information, e.g., user identity, emotion, and so on, which should be protected. This paper first exposes a serious privacy problem in EEG-based BCIs, i.e., the user identity in EEG data can be easily learned so that different sessions of EEG data from the same user can be associated together to more reliably mine private information. To address this issue, we further propose two approaches to convert the original EEG data into identity-unlearnable EEG data, i.e., removing the user identity information while maintaining the good performance on the primary BCI task. Experiments on seven EEG datasets from five different BCI paradigms showed that on average the generated identity-unlearnable EEG data can reduce the user identification accuracy from 70.01\% to at most 21.36\%, greatly facilitating user privacy protection in EEG-based BCIs.</description>

      <title>The PET Paradox: How Amazon Instrumentalises PETs in Sidewalk to Entrench Its Infrastructural Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent applications of Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) reveal a paradox. PETs aim to alleviate power asymmetries, but can actually entrench the infrastructural power of companies implementing them vis-\`a-vis other public and private organisations. We investigate whether and how this contradiction manifests with an empirical study of Amazon's cloud connectivity service called Sidewalk. In 2021, Amazon remotely updated Echo and Ring devices in consumers' homes, to transform them into Sidewalk "gateways". Compatible Internet of Things (IoT) devices, called "endpoints", can connect to an associated "Application Server" in Amazon Web Services (AWS) through these gateways. We find that Sidewalk is not just a connectivity service, but an extension of Amazon's cloud infrastructure as a software production environment for IoT manufacturers. PETs play a prominent role in this pursuit: we observe a two-faceted PET paradox. First, suppressing some information flows allows Amazon to promise narrow privacy guarantees to owners of Echo and Ring devices when "flipping" them into gateways. Once flipped, these gateways constitute a crowdsourced connectivity infrastructure that covers 90% of the US population and expands their AWS offerings. We show how novel information flows, enabled by Sidewalk connectivity, raise greater surveillance and competition concerns. Second, Amazon governs the implementation of these PETs, requiring manufacturers to adjust their device hardware, operating system and software; cloud use; factory lines; and organisational processes. Together, these changes turn manufacturers' endpoints into accessories of Amazon's computational infrastructure; further entrenching Amazon's infrastructural power. We argue that power analyses undergirding PET design should go beyond analysing information flows. We propose future steps for policy and tech research.</description>

      <title>Optimal Bounds for Private Minimum Spanning Trees via Input Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of privately releasing an approximate minimum spanning tree (MST). Given a graph $G = (V, E, \vec{W})$ where $V$ is a set of $n$ vertices, $E$ is a set of $m$ undirected edges, and $ \vec{W} \in \mathbb{R}^{|E|} $ is an edge-weight vector, our goal is to publish an approximate MST under edge-weight differential privacy, as introduced by Sealfon in PODS 2016, where $V$ and $E$ are considered public and the weight vector is private. Our neighboring relation is $\ell_\infty$-distance on weights: for a sensitivity parameter $\Delta_\infty$, graphs $ G = (V, E, \vec{W}) $ and $ G' = (V, E, \vec{W}') $ are neighboring if $\|\vec{W}-\vec{W}'\|_\infty \leq \Delta_\infty$.
  Existing private MST algorithms face a trade-off, sacrificing either computational efficiency or accuracy. We show that it is possible to get the best of both worlds: With a suitable random perturbation of the input that does not suffice to make the weight vector private, the result of any non-private MST algorithm will be private and achieves a state-of-the-art error guarantee.
  Furthermore, by establishing a connection to Private Top-k Selection [Steinke and Ullman, FOCS '17], we give the first privacy-utility trade-off lower bound for MST under approximate differential privacy, demonstrating that the error magnitude, $\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$, is optimal up to logarithmic factors. That is, our approach matches the time complexity of any non-private MST algorithm and at the same time achieves optimal error. We complement our theoretical treatment with experiments that confirm the practicality of our approach.</description>

      <title>AdvPrefix: An Objective for Nuanced LLM Jailbreaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many jailbreak attacks on large language models (LLMs) rely on a common objective: making the model respond with the prefix "Sure, here is (harmful request)". While straightforward, this objective has two limitations: limited control over model behaviors, often resulting in incomplete or unrealistic responses, and a rigid format that hinders optimization. To address these limitations, we introduce AdvPrefix, a new prefix-forcing objective that enables more nuanced control over model behavior while being easy to optimize. Our objective leverages model-dependent prefixes, automatically selected based on two criteria: high prefilling attack success rates and low negative log-likelihood. It can further simplify optimization by using multiple prefixes for a single user request. AdvPrefix can integrate seamlessly into existing jailbreak attacks to improve their performance for free. For example, simply replacing GCG attack's target prefixes with ours on Llama-3 improves nuanced attack success rates from 14% to 80%, suggesting that current alignment struggles to generalize to unseen prefixes. Our work demonstrates the importance of jailbreak objectives in achieving nuanced jailbreaks.</description>

      <title>Robust image classification with multi-modal large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, i.e., carefully crafted input samples that can cause models to make incorrect predictions with high confidence. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, adversarial training and detection-based defenses have been proposed to strengthen models in advance. However, most of these approaches focus on a single data modality, overlooking the relationships between visual patterns and textual descriptions of the input. In this paper, we propose a novel defense, Multi-Shield, designed to combine and complement these defenses with multi-modal information to further enhance their robustness. Multi-Shield leverages multi-modal large language models to detect adversarial examples and abstain from uncertain classifications when there is no alignment between textual and visual representations of the input. Extensive evaluations on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, using robust and non-robust image classification models, demonstrate that Multi-Shield can be easily integrated to detect and reject adversarial examples, outperforming the original defenses.</description>

      <title>The Correlated Gaussian Sparse Histogram Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of releasing a sparse histogram under $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy. The stability histogram independently adds noise from a Laplace or Gaussian distribution to the non-zero entries and removes those noisy counts below a threshold.
  Thereby, the introduction of new non-zero values between neighboring histograms is only revealed with probability at most $\delta$, and typically, the value of the threshold dominates the error of the mechanism. We consider the variant of the stability histogram with Gaussian noise.
  Recent works ([Joseph and Yu, COLT '24] and [Lebeda, SOSA '25]) reduced the error for private histograms using correlated Gaussian noise. However, these techniques can not be directly applied in the very sparse setting. Instead, we adopt Lebeda's technique and show that adding correlated noise to the non-zero counts only allows us to reduce the magnitude of noise when we have a sparsity bound. This, in turn, allows us to use a lower threshold by up to a factor of $1/2$ compared to the non-correlated noise mechanism. We then extend our mechanism to a setting without a known bound on sparsity. Additionally, we show that correlated noise can give a similar improvement for the more practical discrete Gaussian mechanism.</description>

      <title>secml-malware: Pentesting Windows Malware Classifiers with Adversarial EXEmples in Python</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.12848v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning has been increasingly used as a first line of defense for Windows malware detection. Recent work has however shown that learning-based malware detectors can be evaded by carefully-perturbed input malware samples, referred to as adversarial EXEmples, thus demanding for tools that can ease and automate the adversarial robustness evaluation of such detectors. To this end, we present secml-malware, the first Python library for computing adversarial attacks on Windows malware detectors. secml-malware implements state-of-the-art white-box and black-box attacks on Windows malware classifiers, by leveraging a set of feasible manipulations that can be applied to Windows programs while preserving their functionality. The library can be used to perform the penetration testing and assessment of the adversarial robustness of Windows malware detectors, and it can be easily extended to include novel attack strategies. Our library is available at https://github.com/pralab/secml_malware.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models to Detect npm Malicious Packages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12196v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing malicious code detection techniques demand the integration of multiple tools to detect different malware patterns, often suffering from high misclassification rates. Therefore, malicious code detection techniques could be enhanced by adopting advanced, more automated approaches to achieve high accuracy and a low misclassification rate. The goal of this study is to aid security analysts in detecting malicious packages by empirically studying the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting malicious code. We present SocketAI, a malicious code review workflow to detect malicious code. To evaluate the effectiveness of SocketAI, we leverage a benchmark dataset of 5,115 npm packages, of which 2,180 packages have malicious code. We conducted a baseline comparison of GPT-3 and GPT-4 models with the state-of-the-art CodeQL static analysis tool, using 39 custom CodeQL rules developed in prior research to detect malicious Javascript code. We also compare the effectiveness of static analysis as a pre-screener with SocketAI workflow, measuring the number of files that need to be analyzed. and the associated costs. Additionally, we performed a qualitative study to understand the types of malicious activities detected or missed by our workflow. Our baseline comparison demonstrates a 16% and 9% improvement over static analysis in precision and F1 scores, respectively. GPT-4 achieves higher accuracy with 99% precision and 97% F1 scores, while GPT-3 offers a more cost-effective balance at 91% precision and 94% F1 scores. Pre-screening files with a static analyzer reduces the number of files requiring LLM analysis by 77.9% and decreases costs by 60.9% for GPT-3 and 76.1% for GPT-4. Our qualitative analysis identified data theft, suspicious domain connection, and arbitrary code execution as the top detected malicious activities.</description>

      <title>MalMixer: Few-Shot Malware Classification with Retrieval-Augmented Semi-Supervised Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent growth and proliferation of malware has tested practitioners' ability to promptly classify new samples according to malware families. In contrast to labor-intensive reverse engineering efforts, machine learning approaches have demonstrated increased speed and accuracy. However, most existing deep-learning malware family classifiers must be calibrated using a large number of samples that are painstakingly manually analyzed before training. Furthermore, as novel malware samples arise that are beyond the scope of the training set, additional reverse engineering effort must be employed to update the training set. The sheer volume of new samples found in the wild creates substantial pressure on practitioners' ability to reverse engineer enough malware to adequately train modern classifiers. In this paper, we present MalMixer, a malware family classifier using semi-supervised learning that achieves high accuracy with sparse training data. We present a novel domain-knowledge-aware technique for augmenting malware feature representations, enhancing few-shot performance of semi-supervised malware family classification. We show that MalMixer achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot malware family classification settings. Our research confirms the feasibility and effectiveness of lightweight, domain-knowledge-aware feature augmentation methods and highlights the capabilities of similar semi-supervised classifiers in addressing malware classification issues.</description>

      <title>Inferentially-Private Private Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information disclosure can compromise privacy when revealed information is correlated with private information. We consider the notion of inferential privacy, which measures privacy leakage by bounding the inferential power a Bayesian adversary can gain by observing a released signal. Our goal is to devise an inferentially-private private information structure that maximizes the informativeness of the released signal, following the Blackwell ordering principle, while adhering to inferential privacy constraints. To achieve this, we devise an efficient release mechanism that achieves the inferentially-private Blackwell optimal private information structure for the setting where the private information is binary. Additionally, we propose a programming approach to compute the optimal structure for general cases given the utility function. The design of our mechanisms builds on our geometric characterization of the Blackwell-optimal disclosure mechanisms under privacy constraints, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>RTL-Breaker: Assessing the Security of LLMs against Backdoor Attacks on HDL Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential with code generation/completion tasks for hardware design. In fact, LLM-based hardware description language (HDL) code generation has enabled the industry to realize complex designs more quickly, reducing the time and effort required in the development cycle. However, the increased reliance on such automation introduces critical security risks. Notably, given that LLMs have to be trained on vast datasets of codes that are typically sourced from publicly available repositories (often without thorough validation), LLMs are susceptible to so-called data poisoning or backdoor attacks. Here, attackers inject malicious code for the training data, which can be carried over into the HDL code generated by LLMs. This threat vector can compromise the security and integrity of entire hardware systems. In this work, we propose RTL-Breaker, a novel backdoor attack framework on LLM-based HDL code generation. RTL-Breaker provides an in-depth analysis for essential aspects of this novel problem: 1) various trigger mechanisms versus their effectiveness for inserting malicious modifications, and 2) side-effects by backdoor attacks on code generation in general, i.e., impact on code quality. RTL-Breaker emphasizes the urgent need for more robust measures to safeguard against such attacks. Toward that end, we open-source our framework and all data.</description>

      <title>Balancing Confidentiality and Transparency for Blockchain-based Process-Aware Information Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blockchain enables novel, trustworthy Process-Aware Information Systems (PAISs) by enforcing the security, robustness, and traceability of operations. In particular, transparency ensures that all information exchanges are openly accessible, fostering trust within the system. Although this is a desirable property to enable notarization and auditing activities, it also represents a limitation for such cases where confidentiality is a requirement since interactions involve sensible data. Current solutions rely on obfuscation techniques or private infrastructures, hindering the enforcing capabilities of smart contracts and the public verifiability of transactions. Against this background, we propose CONFETTY, an architecture for blockchain-based PAISs aimed at preserving both confidentiality and transparency. Smart contracts enact, enforce and store public interactions, while attribute-based encryption techniques are adopted to specify access grants to confidential information. We assess the security of our solution through a systematic threat model analysis and assess its practical feasibility by gauging the performance of our implemented prototype in different scenarios from the literature.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Decentralized Optimization with Relay Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.10859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Security concerns in large-scale networked environments are becoming increasingly critical. To further improve the algorithm security from the design perspective of decentralized optimization algorithms, we introduce a new measure: Privacy Leakage Frequency (PLF), which reveals the relationship between communication and privacy leakage of algorithms, showing that lower PLF corresponds to lower privacy budgets. Based on such assertion, a novel differentially private decentralized primal--dual algorithm named DP-RECAL is proposed to take advantage of operator splitting method and relay communication mechanism to experience less PLF so as to reduce the overall privacy budget. To the best of our knowledge, compared with existing differentially private algorithms, DP-RECAL presents superior privacy performance and communication complexity. In addition, with uncoordinated network-independent stepsizes, we prove the convergence of DP-RECAL for general convex problems and establish a linear convergence rate under the metric subregularity. Evaluation analysis on least squares problem and numerical experiments on real-world datasets verify our theoretical results and demonstrate that DP-RECAL can defend some classical gradient leakage attacks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to transform, interpret, and comprehend vast quantities of heterogeneous data presents a significant opportunity to enhance data-driven care delivery. However, the sensitive nature of protected health information (PHI) raises valid concerns about data privacy and trust in remote LLM platforms. In addition, the cost associated with cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) services continues to impede widespread adoption. To address these challenges, we propose a shift in the LLM execution environment from opaque, centralized cloud providers to a decentralized and dynamic fog computing architecture. By executing open-weight LLMs in more trusted environments, such as the user's edge device or a fog layer within a local network, we aim to mitigate the privacy, trust, and financial challenges associated with cloud-based LLMs. We further present SpeziLLM, an open-source framework designed to facilitate rapid and seamless leveraging of different LLM execution layers and lowering barriers to LLM integration in digital health applications. We demonstrate SpeziLLM's broad applicability across six digital health applications, showcasing its versatility in various healthcare settings.</description>

      <title>Optimal Offline ORAM with Perfect Security via Simple Oblivious Priority Queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Oblivious RAM (ORAM) is a well-researched primitive to hide the memory access pattern of a RAM computation; it has a variety of applications in trusted computing, outsourced storage, and multiparty computation. In this paper, we study the so-called offline ORAM in which the sequence of memory access locations to be hidden is known in advance. Apart from their theoretical significance, offline ORAMs can be used to construct efficient oblivious algorithms.
  We obtain the first optimal offline ORAM with perfect security from oblivious priority queues via time-forward processing. For this, we present a simple construction of an oblivious priority queue with perfect security. Our construction achieves an asymptotically optimal (amortized) runtime of $\Theta(\log N)$ per operation for a capacity of $N$ elements and is of independent interest.
  Building on our construction, we additionally present efficient external-memory instantiations of our oblivious, perfectly-secure construction: For the cache-aware setting, we match the optimal I/O complexity of $\Theta(\frac{1}{B} \log \frac{N}{M})$ per operation (amortized), and for the cache-oblivious setting we achieve a near-optimal I/O complexity of $O(\frac{1}{B} \log \frac{N}{M} \log\log_M N)$ per operation (amortized).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The centralization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) poses significant challenges, including single points of failure, inherent biases, data privacy concerns, and scalability issues. These problems are especially prevalent in closed-source large language models (LLMs), where user data is collected and used without transparency. To mitigate these issues, blockchain-based decentralized AI (DeAI) has emerged as a promising solution. DeAI combines the strengths of both blockchain and AI technologies to enhance the transparency, security, decentralization, and trustworthiness of AI systems. However, a comprehensive understanding of state-of-the-art DeAI development, particularly for active industry solutions, is still lacking. In this work, we present a Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) for blockchain-based DeAI solutions. We propose a taxonomy to classify existing DeAI protocols based on the model lifecycle. Based on this taxonomy, we provide a structured way to clarify the landscape of DeAI protocols and identify their similarities and differences. We analyze the functionalities of blockchain in DeAI, investigating how blockchain features contribute to enhancing the security, transparency, and trustworthiness of AI processes, while also ensuring fair incentives for AI data and model contributors. In addition, we identify key insights and research gaps in developing DeAI protocols, highlighting several critical avenues for future research.</description>
