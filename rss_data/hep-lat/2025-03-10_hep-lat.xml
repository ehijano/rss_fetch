      <title>Critical endpoints of three-dimensional finite density SU(3) spin model with tensor renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram of the three-dimensional SU(3) spin model with finite chemical potential, which is an effective Polyakov loop model for finite density QCD, using the tensor renormalization group method. We successfully determine the location of the critical endpoints being free from the complex action problem in the standard Monte Carlo approach. The critical values of the parameters show the consistency with previous ones obtained by other analytic and numerical methods.</description>

      <title>The finite temperature ground state energy of the confining string in three-dimensional U(1) gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The three-dimensional U(1) gauge theory displays a peculiar form of confinement which does not fit in the standard paradigm of effective string theory. In this work, we report results of numerical computations of the ground state energy of the confining string in the lattice theory at finite temperature, which we compared with various theoretical predictions. We find markedly different behavior compared to non-Abelian theories. For small values of the bare coupling, far from the continuum, the results are well-described by the Nambu-Goto string. In an intermediate region, all known theoretical predictions are incompatible with the numerical data. For large bare coupling, close to the continuum, we find remarkable agreement with a formula recently derived by Aharony, Barel and Sheaffer.</description>

      <title>Status and outlook of quark flavour physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years there has been impressive progress in quark flavour physics, with current efforts tackling complicated quantities such as for example inclusive decays, decays to QCD-unstable final states and radiative decays. At the same time current lattice flavour physics results are receiving a lot of attention from outside the lattice community. This requires careful scrutiny, even for well explored quantities. In this plenary contribution I review the status of flavour physics observables and, in the context of heavy flavours, suggest possible benchmark quantities that could allow to better compare intermediate results. These can in turn be used to investigate the origin of existing (and possible future) tensions.</description>

      <title>Ising on $\mathbb{S}^2$ -- The Affine Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the recent construction~\cite{brower2024isingmodelmathbbs2} of the 2d Ising model on a triangulated sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$. Surprisingly, this led to a precise map of the lattice couplings to the target geometry in order to reach the conform field theory (CFT) in the continuum limit. For the integrable 2d Ising CFT, the map was found analytically~\cite{Brower_2023}. Here we conjecture how this might be generalized. The discrete geometry is implemented by the piecewise flat triangulation introduced by Regge in 1960 for the Einstein Hilbert action~\cite{Regge1961GeneralRW}. Then following our Ising example, we posit the existence of a smooth map of lattice couplings in affine parameters consistent with quantum correlators. A sequence of theoretical investigations and numerical simulations are recommended to test this conjecture. They begin with non-integrable CFT's -- the 2d $\phi^4$ theory on $\mathbb{S}^2$; the 3d Ising model on $\mathbb{S}^3$ and $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^2$; QED3 on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^{2} $ as an intermediate step to 4d non-Abelian lattice gauge theory on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$.</description>

      <title>An improved evaluation of the electroweak contribution to $(g-2)_\mu$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A precise evaluation of the electroweak contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon requires control over all aspects of the Standard Model, ranging from Higgs physics, over multi-loop computations for bosonic and (heavy-)fermion diagrams, to non-perturbative effects in the presence of light quarks. Currently, the dominant uncertainties arise from such hadronic effects in the vector-vector-axial-vector three-point function, an improved understanding of which has recently emerged in the context of hadronic light-by-light scattering. Profiting from these developments as well as new perturbative and non-perturbative input for the charm contribution, we obtain $a_\mu^\text{EW}=154.4(4)\times 10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>"Glueballs" in the Quantum Mechanics of three large massless Yang-Mills coupled Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a loop truncated Jevicki-Sakita effective collective field Hamiltonian to obtain, over a very large range of values of 't Hooft's coupling, and directly in the large N limit, the large N (planar) ground state energy, the planar ground state expectation values of invariant correlators, and the 1/N spectrum of the quantum mechanical system of three massless Yang-Mills coupled matrices. This captures the dynamics of the (residual) gauge invariant sector of the spatially reduced 3+1 dimensional pure Yang-Mills theory, in the large N limit. The large N loop space constraints are handled by the use of master variables. As is the case for two matrices, the method is highly efficient directly in the massless limit, and it reproduces to a very high precision the scaling dependence of physical quantities, determined by their dimensions, on the dimensionful 't Hooft coupling. We obtain the bound state masses of "glueballs", their quantum numbers and ensuing degeneracies.</description>

      <title>Are compact open-charm tetraquarks consistent with recent lattice results?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that the hypothesis that positive-parity charm meson resonances exhibit a compact tetraquark structure has some clear tension with recent lattice results for the $S$-wave $\pi D$ system for an SU(3) flavor symmetric setting. In particular, we show that such a diquark--anti-diquark tetraquark scenario would call for the presence of a state in the flavor $[{\mathbf{\overline{15}}}]$ representation, not seen in the lattice analysis. Moreover, we show that analogous lattice data in the axial-vector channel are even more sensitive to the internal structure of these very interesting states.</description>

      <title>Quantum gas microscopy of three-flavor Hubbard systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hubbard systems are paradigmatic realizations of strongly correlated many-body systems. Introducing additional species breaks the SU(2) symmetry of the Hubbard model and leads to a wide variety of novel exotic quantum phases. Three-component fermionic systems are at the heart of model systems for quantum chromodynamics where the three components reflect the three flavors. Here, we extend quantum gas microscopy to three-flavor Fermi lattice gases in the Hubbard regime. Relying on site- and flavor-resolved detection, we study the phase diagram of the three-flavor Hubbard model and find signatures of flavor-selective localization and selective pairing at temperatures down to the tunneling energy scale. Our measurements are compared with numerical linked-cluster expansion calculations. Further increase of phase space density may enable the observation of a novel pair Mott phase at half filling, and shows a path towards the study of color superfluidity and other aspects of quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>2025 update on $\varepsilon_K$ in the Standard Model with lattice QCD inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present theoretical results for the indirect CP violation parameter, $|\varepsilon_K|$ calculated directly from the standard model using lattice QCD inputs such as $\hat{B}_K$, $|V_{cb}|$, $|V_{us}|$, $|V_{ud}|$, $\xi_0$, $\xi_2$, $F_K$, and $m_c$ (charm quark mass). We find a strong tension in $|\varepsilon_K|$ at the $\approx 5\sigma$ ($5.2\sigma \sim 4.6\sigma$) level between the experimental value and the theoretical value calculated directly from the standard model using lattice QCD inputs. The standard model with lattice QCD inputs describes only 65\% of the experimental value of $|\varepsilon_K|$, and does not explain its remaining 35\%. We also find that this tension disappears when we use inclusive $|V_{cb}|$ which comes from the heavy quark expansion and QCD sum rules. This tension is highly correlated with the discrepancy between exclusive $|V_{cb}|$, and inclusive $|V_{cb}|$. We also present results for $|\varepsilon_K|$ obtained using the Brod-Gorbahn-Stamou (BGS) method of $u-t$ unitarity, which leads to even a stronger tension at the $5.5\sigma \sim 4.9\sigma$ level with lattice QCD inputs.</description>
