      <title>Modeling times to multiple events under informative censoring with C-vine copula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of times to nonterminal events of different types and their interrelation is a compelling area of interest. The primary challenge in analyzing such multivariate event times is the presence of informative censoring by the terminal event. While numerous statistical methods have been proposed for a single nonterminal event, i.e., semi-competing risks data, there remains a dearth of tools for analyzing times to multiple nonterminal events. These events involve more complex dependence structures between nonterminal and terminal events and between nonterminal events themselves. This paper introduces a novel modeling framework leveraging the vine copula to directly estimate the joint distribution of the multivariate times to nonterminal and terminal events. Unlike the few existing methods based on multivariate or nested copulas, our model excels in capturing the heterogeneous dependence between each pair of event times in terms of strength and structure. Furthermore, our model allows regression modeling for all the marginal distributions of times to nonterminal and terminal events, a feature lacking in existing methods. We propose a likelihood-based estimation and inference procedure, which can be implemented efficiently in sequential stages. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate the satisfactory finite-sample performance of our proposed stage-wise estimators and analytical variance estimators, as well as their superiority over existing methods. We apply our approach to data from a crowdfunding platform to investigate the relationship between creator-backer interactions of various types and a creator's lifetime on the platform.</description>

      <title>Bayesian computation with generative diffusion models by Multilevel Monte Carlo</title>

Abstract: Generative diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful strategy to perform stochastic sampling in Bayesian inverse problems, delivering remarkably accurate solutions for a wide range of challenging applications. However, diffusion models often require a large number of neural function evaluations per sample in order to deliver accurate posterior samples. As a result, using diffusion models as stochastic samplers for Monte Carlo integration in Bayesian computation can be highly computationally expensive, particularly in applications that require a substantial number of Monte Carlo samples for conducting uncertainty quantification analyses. This cost is especially high in large-scale inverse problems such as computational imaging, which rely on large neural networks that are expensive to evaluate. With quantitative imaging applications in mind, this paper presents a Multilevel Monte Carlo strategy that significantly reduces the cost of Bayesian computation with diffusion models. This is achieved by exploiting cost-accuracy trade-offs inherent to diffusion models to carefully couple models of different levels of accuracy in a manner that significantly reduces the overall cost of the calculation, without reducing the final accuracy. The proposed approach achieves a $4\times$-to-$8\times$ reduction in computational cost w.r.t. standard techniques across three benchmark imaging problems.</description>

      <title>Least squares variational inference</title>

Abstract: Variational inference consists in finding the best approximation of a target distribution within a certain family, where `best' means (typically) smallest Kullback-Leiber divergence. We show that, when the approximation family is exponential, the best approximation is the solution of a fixed-point equation. We introduce LSVI (Least-Squares Variational Inference), a Monte Carlo variant of the corresponding fixed-point recursion, where each iteration boils down to ordinary least squares regression and does not require computing gradients. We show that LSVI is equivalent to stochastic mirror descent; we use this insight to derive convergence guarantees. We introduce various ideas to improve LSVI further when the approximation family is Gaussian, leading to a $O(d^3)$ complexity in the dimension $d$ of the target in the full-covariance case, and a $O(d)$ complexity in the mean-field case. We show that LSVI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in a range of examples, while remaining gradient-free, that is, it does not require computing gradients.</description>

      <title>Local Geometry Determines Global Landscape in Low-rank Factorization for Synchronization</title>

Abstract: The orthogonal group synchronization problem, which focuses on recovering orthogonal group elements from their corrupted pairwise measurements, encompasses examples such as high-dimensional Kuramoto model on general signed networks, $\mathbb{Z}_2$-synchronization, community detection under stochastic block models, and orthogonal Procrustes problem. The semidefinite relaxation (SDR) has proven its power in solving this problem; however, its expensive computational costs impede its widespread practical applications. We consider the Burer-Monteiro factorization approach to the orthogonal group synchronization, an effective and scalable low-rank factorization to solve large scale SDPs. Despite the significant empirical successes of this factorization approach, it is still a challenging task to understand when the nonconvex optimization landscape is benign, i.e., the optimization landscape possesses only one local minimizer, which is also global. In this work, we demonstrate that if the degree of freedom within the factorization exceeds twice the condition number of the ``Laplacian" (certificate matrix) at the global minimizer, the optimization landscape is absent of spurious local minima. Our main theorem is purely algebraic and versatile, and it seamlessly applies to all the aforementioned examples: the nonconvex landscape remains benign under almost identical condition that enables the success of the SDR. Additionally, we illustrate that the Burer-Monteiro factorization is robust to ``monotone adversaries", mirroring the resilience of the SDR. In other words, introducing ``favorable" adversaries into the data will not result in the emergence of new spurious local minimizers.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Approach to Multi-Fiber Parameter Estimation and Uncertainty Quantification in Diffusion MRI</title>

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is the primary imaging modality used to study brain microstructure in vivo. Reliable and computationally efficient parameter inference for common dMRI biophysical models is a challenging inverse problem, due to factors such as variable dimensionalities (reflecting the unknown number of distinct white matter fiber populations in a voxel), low signal-to-noise ratios, and non-linear forward models. These challenges have led many existing methods to use biologically implausible simplified models to stabilize estimation, for instance, assuming shared microstructure across all fiber populations within a voxel. In this work, we introduce a novel sequential method for multi-fiber parameter inference that decomposes the task into a series of manageable subproblems. These subproblems are solved using deep neural networks tailored to problem-specific structure and symmetry, and trained via simulation. The resulting inference procedure is largely amortized, enabling scalable parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification across all model parameters. Simulation studies and real imaging data analysis using the Human Connectome Project (HCP) demonstrate the advantages of our method over standard alternatives. In the case of the standard model of diffusion, our results show that under HCP-like acquisition schemes, estimates for extra-cellular parallel diffusivity are highly uncertain, while those for the intra-cellular volume fraction can be estimated with relatively high precision.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Stability Selection and Inference on Selection Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21914</link>

Abstract: Stability selection is a versatile framework for structure estimation and variable selection in high-dimensional setting, primarily grounded in frequentist principles. In this paper, we propose an enhanced methodology that integrates Bayesian analysis to refine the inference of selection probabilities within the stability selection framework. Traditional approaches rely on selection frequencies for decision-making, often disregarding domain-specific knowledge. Our methodology uses prior information to derive posterior distributions of selection probabilities, thereby improving both inference and decision-making. We present a two-step process for engaging with domain experts, enabling statisticians to construct prior distributions informed by expert knowledge while allowing experts to control the weight of their input on the final results. Using posterior distributions, we offer Bayesian credible intervals to quantify uncertainty in the variable selection process. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the integration of prior knowledge reduces the variance of selection probabilities, thereby improving the stability of decision-making. Our approach preserves the versatility of stability selection and is suitable for a broad range of structure estimation challenges.</description>
