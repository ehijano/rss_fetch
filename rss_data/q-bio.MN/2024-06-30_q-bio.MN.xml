      <title>A Thermal Study of Terahertz Induced Protein Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proteins can be regarded as thermal nanosensors in an intra-body network. Upon being stimulated by Terahertz (THz) frequencies that match their vibrational modes, protein molecules experience resonant absorption and dissipate their energy as heat, undergoing a thermal process. This paper aims to analyze the effect of THz signaling on the protein heat dissipation mechanism. We therefore deploy a mathematical framework based on the heat diffusion model to characterize how proteins absorb THz-electromagnetic (EM) energy from the stimulating EM fields and subsequently release this energy as heat to their immediate surroundings. We also conduct a parametric study to explain the impact of the signal power, pulse duration, and interparticle distance on the protein thermal analysis. In addition, we demonstrate the relationship between the change in temperature and the opening probability of thermally-gated ion channels. Our results indicate that a controlled temperature change can be achieved in an intra-body environment by exciting protein particles at their resonant frequencies. We further verify our results numerically using COMSOL Multiphysics and introduce an experimental framework that assesses the effects of THz radiation on protein particles. We conclude that under controlled heating, protein molecules can serve as hotspots that impact thermally-gated ion channels. Through the presented work, we infer that the heating process can be engineered on different time and length scales by controlling the THz-EM signal input.</description>

      <title>Gene activity fully predicts transcriptional bursting dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transcription commonly occurs in bursts, with alternating productive (ON) and quiescent (OFF) periods, governing mRNA production rates. Yet, how transcription is regulated through bursting dynamics remains unresolved. Here, we conduct real-time measurements of endogenous transcriptional bursting with single-mRNA sensitivity. Leveraging the diverse transcriptional activities in early fly embryos, we uncover stringent relationships between bursting parameters. Specifically, we find that the durations of ON and OFF periods are linked. Regardless of the developmental stage or body-axis position, gene activity levels predict individual alleles' average ON and OFF periods. Lowly transcribing alleles predominantly modulate OFF periods (burst frequency), while highly transcribing alleles primarily tune ON periods (burst size). These relationships persist even under perturbations of cis-regulatory elements or trans-factors and account for bursting dynamics measured in other species. Our results suggest a novel mechanistic constraint governing bursting dynamics rather than a modular control of distinct parameters by distinct regulatory processes.</description>
