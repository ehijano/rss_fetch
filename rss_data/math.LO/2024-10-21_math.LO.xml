      <title>Dense ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain the consistency, relative to large cardinals, of the existence of dense ideals on every successor of a regular cardinal simultaneously. Using a consequent transfer principle, we show that in this model there is a $\sigma$-complete, $\aleph_1$-dense ideal on $\aleph_{n+1}$ for every $n &lt; \omega$, answering a question of Foreman.
  Using this construction we show the consistency of the existence of various irregular ultrafilters on $\omega_n$, the consistency of the Foreman-Laver reflection property for the chromatic number of graphs for all possible pairs of cardinals below $\aleph_\omega$, and the simultaneous consistency of the partition hypotheses $\mathrm{PH}_n(\omega_m)$ for $n &lt; m$.</description>

      <title>Small-dimensional normed barrelled spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that there is a normed barrelled space with dimension $\mathrm{non}(\mathcal M)$, which denotes the smallest cardinality of a non-meager subset of $\mathbb R$. Consequently, it is consistent with $\mathsf{ZFC}$ that there is a normed barrelled space with dimension $&lt;\!\mathfrak{c}$. This answers a question of S\'anchez Ruiz and Saxon.
  This is a special case of a more general theorem: for every infinite cardinal $\kappa$, every Banach space with density character $\kappa$ contains a barrelled subspace with dimension $\mathrm{cf}[\kappa]^\omega \cdot \mathrm{non}(\mathcal M)$.
  We also prove that if the dual of a Banach space does not contain $c_0$ or $\ell^p$ for any $p \geq 1$, then that spaces does not have a barrelled subspaces with dimension $&lt;\!\mathrm{cov}(\mathcal N)$, which denotes the smallest cardinality of a collection of Lebesgue null sets covering $\mathbb R$. In particular, it is consistent with $\mathsf{ZFC}$ that no classical Banach spaces contain barrelled subspaces with dimension $\mathfrak{b}$. This partly answers another question of S\'anchez Ruiz and Saxon.</description>

      <title>Apartness relations between propositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.03920v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify all apartness relations definable in propositional logics extending intuitionistic logic using Heyting algebra semantics. We show that every Heyting algebra which contains a non-trivial apartness term satisfies the weak law of excluded middle, and every Heyting algebra which contains a tight apartness term is in fact a Boolean algebra. This answers a question of E. Rijke regarding the correct notion of apartness for propositions, and yields a short classification of apartness terms that can occur in a Heyting algebra. We also show that Martin-L\"of Type Theory is not able to construct non-trivial apartness relations between propositions.</description>

      <title>Multi-representation associated to the numbering of a subbasis and formal inclusion relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit Dieter Spreen's notion of a representation associated to a numbered basis equipped with a strong inclusion relation. We show that by relaxing his requirements, we obtain different classically considered representations as subcases, including representations considered by Grubba, Weihrauch and Schr\"oder. We show that the use of an appropriate strong inclusion relation guarantees that the representation associated to a computable metric space seen as a topological space always coincides with the Cauchy representation. We also show how the use of a formal inclusion relation guarantees that when defining multi-representations on a set and on one of its subsets, the obtained multi-representations will be compatible, i.e. inclusion will be a computable map. The proposed definitions are also more robust under change of equivalent bases.</description>

      <title>Modal logics of almost sure validities in some classes of euclidean and transitive frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a class C of finite Kripke frames, we consider the uniform distribution on the frames from C with n states. A formula is almost surely valid in C if the probability that it is valid in a random C-frame with n states tends to 1 as n tends to infinity. The formulas that are almost surely valid in C form a normal modal logic. We find complete and sound axiomatizations for the logics of almost sure validities in the classes of finite frames defined by the logics K5, KD5, K45, KD45, K5B, S5, Grz.3, and GL.3.</description>

      <title>Constructive Interpolation and Concept-Based Beth Definability for Description Logics via Sequents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a constructive method applicable to a large number of description logics (DLs) for establishing the concept-based Beth definability property (CBP) based on sequent systems. Using the highly expressive DL RIQ as a case study, we introduce novel sequent calculi for RIQ-ontologies and show how certain interpolants can be computed from sequent calculus proofs, which permit the extraction of explicit definitions of implicitly definable concepts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first sequent-based approach to computing interpolants and definitions within the context of DLs, as well as the first proof that RIQ enjoys the CBP. Moreover, due to the modularity of our sequent systems, our results hold for restrictions of RIQ, and are applicable to other DLs by suitable modifications.</description>

      <title>Exponential sums equations and the Exponential Closedness conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is an expository paper aiming to introduce Zilber's Exponential Closedness conjecture to a general audience. Exponential Closedness predicts when (systems of) equations involving addition, multiplication, and exponentiation have solutions in the complex numbers. It is a natural statement at the boundary between complex geometry and algebraic geometry. While it is open in full generality, many special cases and variants have been proven in the last two decades.
  In the first part of the paper we give a proof of a special case of the conjecture, namely, we show that exponential sums in a single complex variable, such as $e^{\sqrt{2}z}+3i e^{5z}+\pi$, always have infinitely many zeroes. This follows from well-known results in the literature and can actually be proven by standard complex analytic tools. We present a proof, motivated by the ideas of Zilber and Gallinaro, which uses simplified versions of some ingredients of more advanced techniques in the area, thus allowing the reader to explore these advanced proofs on a simple example. Our approach uses only elementary techniques (from standard undergraduate algebra and complex analysis), and the proofs of some of the main ingredients appear to be new. Moreover, these ingredients come from various areas of mathematics, such as functional transcendence and complex geometry, and are a useful way of introducing some classical concepts in these areas to the reader.
  In the second part we explain the Exponential Closedness conjecture and discuss some known special cases, not least the so-called ``raising to powers'' case (due to Gallinaro) which generalises the above-mentioned result and whose proof uses advanced versions of the tools presented in the first part of the paper.</description>
