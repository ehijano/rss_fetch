      <title>Solar cosmic ray generation, Newtonian gravity, missing mass, dark energy, laboratory-based nuclear astrophysics, and all that</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Begun as part of a promotion of accelerator-based nuclear astrophysics, research toward this goal has shifted to cosmic ray production within the solar system. This has been motivated by the high quality of data collected recently by programs such as the International Space Station (ISS), by the fundamental importance of the topic, and by the unsatisfactory state of our understanding of the actual source of cosmic rays. A ``minor'' change in the Newtonian gravitational formulation converts solar production of high energy cosmic rays from ``impossible'' to ``likely'', without much disrupting the vast existent domain of well understood astronomical gravitational processes. This change enables the sun to ``capture'' protons of energy so high that they would, otherwise, escape the solar system. This change in Newton's gravitational formula would disrupt current cosmological understanding of missing mass and dark energy. With this changed understanding of gravity, it has been quite easy to produce a semi-quantitative understanding of the solar origin of cosmic rays up to energies at least as great as $10^6$\,GeV/nucleon that have by now been detected and measured so persuasively. A ``Double Slingshot'' mechanism is proposed according to which at least a substantial fraction of all cosmic rays could have begun their life within the solar system. Accelerator-based nuclear astrophysics is promoted, beginning with the functioning of an ``{\rm E}\&amp;{\rm M}'' storage ring for laboratory-based study of processes such as ${\rm 6LI} + {\rm 7Li} \rightarrow {\rm 13C} + \gamma$. Especially to be emphasized are experiments made possible by ''rear-end collisions'' between nuclear isotopes of two different types traveling simultaneously at different velocities in the same direction in the same storage ring. This amounts to ``studying nuclear physics in a moving frame of reference''.</description>

      <title>Charting the Luminosity Capabilities of the CERN Large Hadron Collider with Various Nuclear Species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN has been instrumental in recent advances in experimental high energy physics by colliding beams of protons and heavier nuclei at unprecedented energies. The present heavy-ion programme is based mainly on colliding lead nuclei. For future ion runs, there is strong interest to achieve a significantly higher integrated nucleon-nucleon luminosity, which might be achieved through collisions of species other than Pb. In this paper, we explore the nucleon-nucleon luminosity projections in the LHC for a selection of ion species ranging from He to Xe, and including Pb as reference. Alternative beam production schemes are investigated as a way to mitigate effects such as space charge that degrade the beam quality in the LHC injectors. In the most optimistic scenarios, we find up to about a factor~4 improvement in integrated nucleon-nucleon luminosity for a typical future one-month run, with respect to the present Pb programme. We also outline a future study programme and experiments to test the assumptions and refine the simulated projections put forward in this article.</description>

      <title>Knock Out Slow Extraction Using Betatron Sidebands at High Harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio frequency knock out resonant slow extraction is a standard method for extracting stored particle beams from synchrotrons by transverse excitation. Excitation signals comprising many betatron sidebands have shown to reduce intensity fluctuations of the extracted beam spill and are used at several facilities. In this contribution, the effect of individual sidebands at different harmonics on the spill quality is systematically studied. Particle tracking simulations show a clear correlation between the chosen excitation frequency, the spectrum of particle motion shortly before their extraction, and the spill quality. Experiments confirm these observations while highlighting the reduction of pile-up when using higher excitation frequencies. These insights have implications for an optimal design of excitation waveforms and hardware for knock out extraction systems.</description>

      <title>Multiphysics Analysis of Cryogenically Cooled Photocathode in a CW SRF Injector cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper evaluates the thermal regime of a cryogenically cooled copper photocathode integrated into a continuous-wave superconducting radio-frequency injector cavity with direct thermal contact. Such a photoinjector layout is being developed at DESY and has recently demonstrated a record-high 50 MV/m axial electric field in radio-frequency tests, marking an important milestone. To address the thermal effect of the picosecond excitation laser, we first develop a two-temperature model to describe the temperature of the emitting surface at cryogenic temperatures and solve it numerically. Subsequently, we present a one-temperature model of the bulk photocathode coupled with an electromagnetic model of the injector cavity. For the current injector design, we predict a negligible impact of the laser on the intrinsic quality factor of the cavity, identifying instead the cryogenic stability of the copper cathode as the primary operational limit. To overcome cooling challenges, we propose an improved configuration of the cathode plug. For the proposed geometry, the multiphysics analysis confirms stable performance at a nominal 2 W laser power, sufficient for 100 pC beams at 1 MHz under optimistic quantum efficiency assumptions. Operation at higher laser loads will benefit from further dedicated cryogenic analysis.</description>
