      <title>ChatGPT-Assisted Visualization of Atomic Orbitals: Understanding Symmetry, Mixed State, and Superposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For undergraduate students newly introduced to quantum mechanics, solving simple Schr\"{o}dinger equations is relatively straightforward. However, the more profound challenge lies in comprehending the underlying physical principles embedded in the solutions. During my academic experience, a recurring conceptual difficulty was understanding why only $s$ orbitals, and not others like $p$ orbitals, exhibit spherical symmetry. At first glance, this seems paradoxical, given that the potential energy function itself is spherically symmetric. Specifically, why do $p$ orbitals adopt a dumbbell shape instead of a spherical one? For a hydrogen atom with an electron in the $2p$ state, which specific $2p$ orbital does the electron occupy, and how do the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes in $2p_x$, $2p_y$, and $2p_z$ connect to the real spaces? Additionally, is the atom still spherically symmetric in such a state? These questions relate to core concepts of quantum mechanics concerning symmetry, mixed state, and superposition. This paper delves into these questions by investigating this specific case, utilizing the advanced visualization capabilities offered by ChatGPT. This paper underscores the importance of emerging AI tools in enhancing students' understanding of abstract principles.</description>
