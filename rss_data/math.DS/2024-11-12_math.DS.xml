      <title>On quantum ergodicity for higher dimensional cat maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study eigenfunction localization for higher dimensional cat maps, a popular model of quantum chaos. These maps are given by linear symplectic maps in ${\mathrm Sp}(2g,\mathbb Z)$, which we take to be ergodic.Under some natural assumptions, we show that there is a density one sequence of integers $N$ so that as $N$ tends to infinity along this sequence, all eigenfunctions of the quantized map at the inverse Planck constant $N$ are uniformly distributed. For the two-dimensional case ($g=1$), this was proved by P. Kurlberg and Z. Rudnick (2001). The higher dimensional case offers several new features and requires a completely different set of tools, including from additive combinatorics, in particular Bourgain's bound (2005) for Mordell sums, and a study of tensor product structures for the cat map.</description>

      <title>A classification of intrinsic ergodicity for recognisable random substitution systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of dynamical systems generated by random substitutions, which contains both intrinsically ergodic systems and instances with several measures of maximal entropy. In this class, we show that the measures of maximal entropy are classified by invariance under an appropriate symmetry relation. All measures of maximal entropy are fully supported and they are generally not Gibbs measures. We prove that there is a unique measure of maximal entropy if and only if an associated Markov chain is ergodic in inverse time. This Markov chain has finitely many states and all transition matrices are explicitly computable. Thereby, we obtain several sufficient conditions for intrinsic ergodicity that are easy to verify. A practical way to compute the topological entropy in terms of inflation words is extended from previous work to a more general geometric setting.</description>

      <title>Dichotomies uniform on subspaces and formulas for dichotomy spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we introduce a notion of dichotomy which generalizes the classical concept of exponential dichotomy and the recent notion of Bohl dichotomy. A key attribute is the discussion of the sets of subspaces of the state space on which the dichotomy estimates are uniform. Two main results are a dichotomy spectral theorem based on our notion of dichotomy which is uniform on subspaces and a formula for the dichotomy spectral intervals which is new for the Bohl dichotomy spectrum as well as for the classical exponential dichotomy spectrum.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Systems On Generalised Klein Bottles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a high dimensional generalisation of the standard Klein bottle, going beyond those considered previously. We address the problem of generating continuous scalar fields (distributions) and dynamical systems (flows) on such state spaces, which can provide a rich source of examples for future investigations. We consider a class of high dimensional dynamical systems that model distributed information processing within the human cortex, which may be capable of exhibiting some Klein bottle symmetries. We deploy topological data analytic methods in order to analyse their resulting dynamical behaviour, and suggesting future challenges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce stationary generalized Bratteli diagrams $B$ which are represented as the union of countably many classical Pascal-Bratteli diagrams. We describe all ergodic invariant measures on $B$. We show that there exist orders which produce no infinite minimal or maximal paths and the corresponding Vershik map is a homeomorphism. We also describe orders that generate uncountably many infinite minimal and uncountably many infinite maximal paths both on $B$ and on the classical Pascal-Bratteli diagram.</description>

      <title>Widespread neuronal chaos induced by slow oscillating currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the origin and onset of chaos in a mathematical model of an individual neuron, arising from the intricate interaction between 3D fast and 2D slow dynamics governing its intrinsic currents. Central to the chaotic dynamics are multiple homoclinic connections and bifurcations of saddle equilibria and periodic orbits. This neural model reveals a rich array of codimension-2 bifurcations, including Shilnikov-Hopf, Belyakov, Bautin, and Bogdanov-Takens points, which play a pivotal role in organizing the complex bifurcation structure of the parameter space. We explore various routes to chaos occurring at the intersections of quiescent, tonic-spiking, and bursting activity regimes within this space, and provide a thorough bifurcation analysis. Despite a high dimensionality of the model, its fast-slow dynamics allow a reduction to a one-dimensional return map, accurately capturing and explaining the complex dynamics of the neural model. Our approach integrates parameter continuation analysis, newly developed symbolic techniques, and Lyapunov exponents, collectively unveiling the intricate dynamical and bifurcation structures present in the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for almost every irreducible interval exchange transformation $T$ and for any vector $\omega$ in its associated central-stable space (with respect to the Kontsevich-Zorich cocycle) there exists a unique AIET, up to normalization of its domain, semi-conjugated to $T$ and whose log-slope vector equals $\omega$. This provides a partial answer to a question raised by S. Marmi, P. Moussa, and J.-C. Yoccoz.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the connectedness locus $\mathcal{N}$ for the family of iterated function systems of pairs of homogeneous affine-linear maps in the plane. We prove this set is regular closed (i.e., it is the closure of its interior) away from the diagonal, except possibly for isolated points, which we conjecture do not exist. We provide an overview of the "method of traps", introduced by Calegari et al. (2017), which lies at the heart of our proof.</description>

      <title>Stochastic parameterisation: the importance of nonlocality and memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic parameterisations deployed in models of the Earth system frequently invoke locality assumptions such as Markovianity or spatial locality. This work highlights the impact of such assumptions on predictive performance. Both in terms of short-term forecasting and the representation of long-term statistics, we find locality assumptions to be detrimental in idealised experiments. We show, however, that judicious choice of Markovian parameterisation can mitigate errors due to assuming Markovianity. We propose a simple modification to Markovian parameterisations, which yields significant improvements in predictive skill while reducing computational cost. We further note a divergence between parameterisations which perform best in short-term prediction and those which best represent time-invariant statistics, contradicting the popular concept of seamless prediction in Earth system modelling.</description>

      <title>Rigorous enclosure of Lyapunov exponents of stochastic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a powerful and general method to provide arbitrarily accurate rigorous upper and lower bounds for Lyapunov exponents of stochastic flows. Our approach is based on computer-assisted tools, the adjoint method and established results on the ergodicity of diffusion processes. We do not require any structural assumptions on the stochastic system and work under mild hypoellipticity conditions outside of perturbative regimes. Therefore, our method allows for the treatment of systems that were so far inaccessible from existing mathematical tools. We demonstrate our method to exhibit the chaotic nature of three non-Hamiltonian systems. Finally, we show that our approach is robust to continuation methods to produce bounds on Lyapunov exponents for large parameter regions.</description>

      <title>Events in Noise-Driven Oscillators: Markov Renewal Processes and the "Unruly" Breakdown of Phase-Reduction Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an extension to the standard reduction of oscillatory systems to a single phase variable. The standard reduction is often insufficient, particularly when the oscillations have variable amplitude and the magnitude of each oscillatory excursion plays a defining role in the impact of that oscillator on other systems, i.e. on its output. For instance, large excursions in bursting or mixed-mode neural oscillators may constitute events like action potentials, which trigger output to other neurons, while smaller, sub-threshold oscillations generate no output and therefore induce no coupling between neurons. Noise induces diffusion-like dynamics of the oscillator phase on top of its otherwise constant rate-of-change, resulting in the irregular occurrence of these output events. We model the events as corresponding to distinguished crossings of a Poincare section. Using a linearization of the noisy Poincare map and its description under phase-isostable coordinates, we determine the diffusion coefficient for the occurrence and timing of the events using Markov renewal theory. We show that for many oscillator models the corresponding point process can exhibit "unruly" diffusion: with increasing input noise strength the diffusion coefficient vastly increases compared to the standard phase reduction analysis, and, strikingly, it also decreases when the input noise strength is increased further. We provide a thorough analysis in the case of planar oscillators, which exhibit unruliness in a finite region of the natural parameter space. Our results in part explain the surprising synchronization behavior obtained in pulse-coupled, mixed-mode oscillators as they arise, e.g., in neural systems.</description>

      <title>Input-Driven Dynamics for Robust Memory Retrieval in Hopfield Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hopfield model provides a mathematically idealized yet insightful framework for understanding the mechanisms of memory storage and retrieval in the human brain. This model has inspired four decades of extensive research on learning and retrieval dynamics, capacity estimates, and sequential transitions among memories. Notably, the role and impact of external inputs has been largely underexplored, from their effects on neural dynamics to how they facilitate effective memory retrieval. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel dynamical system framework in which the external input directly influences the neural synapses and shapes the energy landscape of the Hopfield model. This plasticity-based mechanism provides a clear energetic interpretation of the memory retrieval process and proves effective at correctly classifying highly mixed inputs. Furthermore, we integrate this model within the framework of modern Hopfield architectures, using this connection to elucidate how current and past information are combined during the retrieval process. Finally, we embed both the classic and the new model in an environment disrupted by noise and compare their robustness during memory retrieval.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Online Smoother with Closed-Form Solutions and Information-Theoretic Lag Selection for Conditional Gaussian Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) combines partial observations with a dynamical model to improve state estimation. Filter-based DA uses only past and present data and is the prerequisite for real-time forecasts. Smoother-based DA exploits both past and future observations. It aims to fill in missing data, provide more accurate estimations, and develop high-quality datasets. However, the standard smoothing procedure requires using all historical state estimations, which is storage-demanding, especially for high-dimensional systems. This paper develops an adaptive-lag online smoother for a large class of complex dynamical systems with strong nonlinear and non-Gaussian features, which has important applications to many real-world problems. The adaptive lag allows the DA to utilize only observations within a nearby window, significantly reducing computational storage. Online lag adjustment is essential for tackling turbulent systems, where temporal autocorrelation varies significantly over time due to intermittency, extreme events, and nonlinearity. Based on the uncertainty reduction in the estimated state, an information criterion is developed to systematically determine the adaptive lag. Notably, the mathematical structure of these systems facilitates the use of closed analytic formulae to calculate the online smoother and the adaptive lag, avoiding empirical tunings as in ensemble-based DA methods. The adaptive online smoother is applied to studying three important scientific problems. First, it helps detect online causal relationships between state variables. Second, its advantage of computational storage is illustrated via Lagrangian DA, a high-dimensional nonlinear problem. Finally, the adaptive smoother advances online parameter estimation with partial observations, emphasizing the role of the observed extreme events in accelerating convergence.</description>

      <title>A Pole-Based Approach to Interpret Electromechanical Impedance Measurements in Structural Health Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over several decades, electromechanical impedance (EMI) measurements have been employed as a basis for structural health monitoring and damage detection. Traditionally, Root-mean-squared-deviation (RMSD) and Cross-correlation (XCORR) based metrics have been used to interpret EMI measurements for damage assessment. These tools, although helpful and widely used, were not designed with the idea to assess changes in EMI to underlying physical changes incurred by damage. The authors propose leveraging vector fitting (VF), a rational function approximation technique, to estimate the poles of the underlying system, and consequently, the modal parameters which have a physical connection to the underlying model of a system. Shifts in natural frequencies, as an effect of changes in the pole location, can be attributed to changes in a structure undergoing damage. With VF, tracking changes between measurements of damaged and pristine structures is physically more intuitive unlike when using traditional metrics, making it ideal for informed post-processing. Alternative methods to VF exist in the literature (e.g., Least Square Complex Frequency-domain (LSCF) estimation, adaptive Antoulas--Anderson (AAA), Rational Krylov Fitting (RKFIT)). The authors demonstrate that VF is better suited for EMI-based structural health monitoring for the following reasons: 1. VF is more accurate at high frequency, 2. VF estimates complex conjugate stable pole pairs, close to the actual poles of the system, and 3. VF can capture critical information missed by other approaches and present it in a condensed form. Thus, using the selected technique for interpreting high-frequency EMI measurements for structural health monitoring is proposed. A set of representative case studies is presented to show the benefits of VF for damage detection and diagnosis.</description>

      <title>When are dynamical systems learned from time series data statistically accurate?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional notions of generalization often fail to describe the ability of learned models to capture meaningful information from dynamical data. A neural network that learns complex dynamics with a small test error may still fail to reproduce its \emph{physical} behavior, including associated statistical moments and Lyapunov exponents. To address this gap, we propose an ergodic theoretic approach to generalization of complex dynamical models learned from time series data. Our main contribution is to define and analyze generalization of a broad suite of neural representations of classes of ergodic systems, including chaotic systems, in a way that captures emulating underlying invariant, physical measures. Our results provide theoretical justification for why regression methods for generators of dynamical systems (Neural ODEs) fail to generalize, and why their statistical accuracy improves upon adding Jacobian information during training. We verify our results on a number of ergodic chaotic systems and neural network parameterizations, including MLPs, ResNets, Fourier Neural layers, and RNNs.</description>

      <title>The joint translation spectrum and Manhattan manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define and study geometric versions of the Benoist limit cone and matrix joint spectrum, which we call the translation cone and the joint translation spectrum, respectively. These new notions allow us to generalize the study of embeddings into products of rank-one simple Lie groups and to compare group actions on different metric spaces, quasi-morphisms, Anosov representations and many other natural objects of study.
  We identify the joint translation spectrum with the image of the gradient function of a corresponding Manhattan manifold: a higher dimensional version of the well known and studied Manhattan curve. As a consequence we deduce many properties of the spectrum. For example we show that it is given by the closure of the set of all possible drift vectors associated to finitely supported, symmetric, admissible random walks on the associated group.</description>

      <title>Time-delayed Dynamic Mode Decomposition for families of periodic trajectories in Cislunar Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the development of the Lunar Gateway and Artemis missions has renewed interest in lunar exploration, including both manned and unmanned missions. This interest necessitates accurate initial orbit determination (IOD) and orbit prediction (OP) in this domain, which faces significant challenges such as severe nonlinearity, sensitivity to initial conditions, large state-space volume, and sparse, faint, and unreliable measurements. This paper explores the capability of data-driven Koopman operator-based approximations for OP in these scenarios. Three stable periodic trajectories from distinct cislunar families are analyzed. The analysis includes theoretical justification for using a linear time-invariant system as the data-driven surrogate. This theoretical framework is supported by experimental validation. Furthermore, the accuracy is assessed by comparing the spectral content captured to period estimates derived from the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and Poincare-like sections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a recently introduced model of mosquito dynamics that includes mating and progression through breeding, questing and egg-laying stages of mosquitoes using human and other vertebrate sources for blood meals. By exploiting a multiscale character of the model and recent results on their uniform-in-time asymptotics, we derive a simplified monotone model with the same long-term dynamics. Using the theory of monotone dynamical systems, we show that for a range of parameters, the latter displays Allee-type dynamics; that is, it has one extinction and two positive equilibria ordered with respect to the positive cone $\mathbb R_+^7$, with the extinction and the larger equilibrium being attractive and the middle one unstable. Using asymptotic analysis, we show that the original system also displays this pattern.</description>

      <title>An exact active sensing strategy for a class of bio-inspired systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a general class of translation-invariant systems with a specific category of output nonlinearities motivated by biological sensing. We show that no dynamic output feedback can stabilize this class of systems to an isolated equilibrium point. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we propose a simple control scheme that includes a low-amplitude periodic forcing function akin to so-called "active sensing" in biology, together with nonlinear output feedback. Our analysis shows that this approach leads to the emergence of an exponentially stable limit cycle. These findings offer a provably stable active sensing strategy and may thus help to rationalize the active sensing movements made by animals as they perform certain motor behaviors.</description>

      <title>Complexity measure of extreme events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complexity is an important metric for appropriate characterization of different classes of irregular signals, observed in the laboratory or in nature. The literature is already rich in the description of such measures using a variety of entropy and disequilibrium measures, separately or in combination. Chaotic signal was given prime importance in such studies while no such measure was proposed so far, how complex were the extreme events when compared to non-extreme chaos. We address here this question of complexity in extreme events and investigate if we can distinguish them from non-extreme chaotic signal. The normalized Shannon entropy in combination with disequlibrium is used for our study and it is able to distinguish between extreme chaos and non-extreme chaos and moreover, it depicts the transition points from periodic to extremes via Pomeau-Manneville intermittency and, from small amplitude to large amplitude chaos and its transition to extremes via interior crisis. We report a general trend of complexity against a system parameter that increases during a transition to extreme events, reaches a maximum, and then starts decreasing. We employ three models, a nonautonomous Lienard system, 2-dimensional Ikeda map and a 6-dimensional coupled Hindmarh-Rose system to validate our proposition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lagrange and Markov spectra $L$ and $M$ describe the best constants of Diophantine approximations for irrational numbers and binary quadratic forms. In 1880, A. Markov showed that the initial portions of these spectra coincide: indeed, $L\cap (0,3) = M\cap (0,3)$ is a discrete set of explicit quadratic irrationals accumulating only at $3$.
  In this article, we show that the statement above ceases to be true immediately after $3$: in particular, $L\cap (3,3+\varepsilon)\neq M\cap (3,3+\varepsilon)$ for all $\varepsilon&gt;0$, and thus $\inf(M\setminus L)=3$. In fact, we derive this result as a by-product of lower bounds on the Hausdorff dimension of $(M\setminus L)\cap (3,3+\varepsilon)$ implying that $\liminf\limits_{\varepsilon\to 0} \frac{\dim_H((M\setminus L)\cap(3,3+\varepsilon))}{\dim_H(M\cap (3,3+\varepsilon))}\geq \frac{1}{2}$ and, as it turns out, these bounds are obtained from the study of projections of Cartesian products of almost affine dynamical Cantor sets via an argument of probabilistic flavor based on Baker--W\"ustholz theorem on linear forms in logarithms of algebraic numbers.</description>

Abstract: Many paintings from the 19th century have exhibited signs of fading and discoloration, often linked to cadmium yellow, a pigment widely used by artists during that time. In this work, we develop a mathematical model of the cadmium sulfide photocatalytic reaction responsible for these damages. By employing non-local integral operators, we capture the interplay between chemical processes and environmental factors, offering a detailed representation of the degradation mechanisms. Furthermore, we present a second order positivity-preserving numerical method designed to accurately simulate the phenomenon and ensure reliable predictions across different scenarios, along with a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a general spectral gap theorem for actions of products of groups which may replace Kazhdan's property (T) in various situations. As a main application, we prove that a confined subgroup of an irreducible lattice in a higher rank semisimple Lie group is of finite index. This significantly strengthens the classical normal subgroup theorem of Margulis and removes the property (T) assumption from the recent counterpart result of Fraczyk and Gelander. We further show that any confined discrete subgroup of a higher rank semisimple Lie group satisfying a certain irreducibility condition is an irreducible lattice. This implies a variant of the Stuck-Zimmer conjecture under a strong irreducibility assumption of the action.</description>

      <title>Existence of arbitrary large numbers of non-$\mathbb R$-covered Anosov flows on hyperbolic $3$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to prove that, for every $n\in \mathbb N$, there exists a closed hyperbolic $3$-manifold $M$ which carries at least $n$ non-$\mathbb R$-covered Anosov flows, that are pairwise orbitally inequivalent. Due to a recent result by Fenley, such Anosov flows are quasi-geodesic. Hence, we get the existence of hyperbolic $3$-manifolds carrying many pairwise orbitally inequivalent quasi-geodesic Anosov flows. One of the main ingredients of our proof is a description of the clusters of lozenges that appear in the orbit spaces of the Anosov flows that we construct. The number of lozenges involved in each cluster, as well as the orientation-type of this cluster, provide powerful dynamical invariants allowing to prove that the flows are orbitally inequivalent. We believe that these dynamical invariants could be helpful in a much wider context.</description>

Abstract: We consider $C^2$ diffeomorphisms of a closed interval with only parabolic fixed points. We show that the maximal growth of the derivatives of the iterates of such a diffeomorphism is exactly quadratic provided it has a non-quadratical tangency to the identity at a fixed point that is topologically repelling on one side. Moreover, in absence of such fixed points, the maximal growth of the derivatives of the iterates is subquadratic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08079v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodic orbits and cycles, respectively, play a significant role in discrete- and continuous-time dynamical systems (i.e. maps and flows). To succinctly describe their shifts when the system is applied perturbation, the notions of functional and functional derivative are borrowed from functional analysis to consider the whole system as an argument of the geometric representation of the periodic orbit or cycle. The shifts of an orbit/trajectory and periodic orbit/cycle are analyzed and concluded as formulae for maps/flows, respectively. The theory shall be beneficial for analyzing sensitivity to perturbations, and optimizing and controlling various systems.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Markoff spectrum and the Lagrange spectrum on the Hecke group $\mathbf H_4$. They are identical with the Markoff and Lagrange spectra of the unit circle. The Markoff spectrum on $\mathbf H_4$ is also known as the Markoff spectrum of index 2 sublattices by Vulakh (1971) and the Markoff spectrum of 2-minimal forms or $C$-minimal forms by Schmidt (1976). They characterized the spectrum up to the first accumulation point, independently. After the first accumulation point, we show that both spectra have positive Hausdorff dimension. Then we find gaps in the spectra and give a bound of Hall's ray.</description>

Abstract: We prove the absolute winning property of weighted simultaneous inhomogeneous badly approximable vectors on non-degenerate analytic curves. This answers a question by Beresnevich, Nesharim, and Yang. In particular, our result is an inhomogeneous version of the main result in \cite{BNY22} by Beresnevich, Nesharim, and Yang. Also, the generality of the inhomogeneous part that we considered extends the previous result in \cite{ABV}. Moreover, our results even contribute to classical results, namely establishing the inhomogeneous Schmidt's conjecture in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01706v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A universal theory of linear instabilities in swirling flows, occurring in both natural settings and industrial applications, is formulated. The theory encompasses a wide range of open and confined flows, including spiral isothermal flows and baroclinic flows driven by radial temperature gradients and natural gravity in rotating fluids. By employing short-wavelength local analysis, the theory generalizes previous findings from numerical simulations and linear stability analyses of specific swirling flows, such as spiral Couette flow, spiral Poiseuille flow, and baroclinic Couette flow. A general criterion, extending and unifying existing criteria for instability to both centrifugal and shear-driven perturbations in swirling flows is derived, taking into account viscosity and thermal diffusion, and guiding experimental and numerical investigations in the otherwise inaccessible parameter regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22193v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present GoRINNs: numerical analysis-informed (shallow) neural networks for the solution of inverse problems of non-linear systems of conservation laws. GoRINNs is a hybrid/blended machine learning scheme based on high-resolution Godunov schemes for the solution of the Riemann problem in hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). In contrast to other existing machine learning methods that learn the numerical fluxes or just parameters of conservative Finite Volume methods, relying on deep neural networks (that may lead to poor approximations due to the computational complexity involved in their training), GoRINNs learn the closures of the conservation laws per se based on "intelligently" numerical-assisted shallow neural networks. Due to their structure, in particular, GoRINNs provide explainable, conservative schemes, that solve the inverse problem for hyperbolic PDEs, on the basis of approximate Riemann solvers that satisfy the Rankine-Hugoniot condition. The performance of GoRINNs is assessed via four benchmark problems, namely the Burgers', the Shallow Water, the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards and the Payne-Whitham traffic flow models. The solution profiles of these PDEs exhibit shock waves, rarefactions and/or contact discontinuities at finite times. We demonstrate that GoRINNs provide a very high accuracy both in the smooth and discontinuous regions.</description>

Abstract: This work presents a modification of the self-attention dynamics proposed by Geshkovski et al. (arXiv:2312.10794) to better reflect the practically relevant, causally masked attention used in transformer architectures for generative AI. This modification translates into an interacting particle system that cannot be interpreted as a mean-field gradient flow. Despite this loss of structure, we significantly strengthen the results of Geshkovski et al. (arXiv:2312.10794) in this context: While previous rigorous results focused on cases where all three matrices (Key, Query, and Value) were scaled identities, we prove asymptotic convergence to a single cluster for arbitrary key-query matrices and a value matrix equal to the identity. Additionally, we establish a connection to the classical R\'enyi parking problem from combinatorial geometry to make initial theoretical steps towards demonstrating the existence of meta-stable states.</description>
