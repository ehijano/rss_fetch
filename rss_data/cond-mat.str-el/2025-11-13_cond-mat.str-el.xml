      <title>Phonon Thermal Hall Effect: The Roles of Disorder, Annealing, and Metallic Contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phonon thermal Hall effect (THE) is a ubiquitous yet poorly understood phenomenon in insulators. Its microscopic origin remains debated, partly due to significant sample-dependent variations that hint at uncontrolled experimental parameters. Using SrTiO$_3$ as a model system, we identify disorder and uncontrolled strain as suppressors of a thermal Hall signal. Crystals with high thermal conductivity exhibit a substantial thermal Hall angle $\nabla T_y / \nabla T_x$ (up to 0.3\% at 9 T), whereas the effect is virtually absent in disordered samples. Crucially, annealing (in air atmosphere) these disordered samples partially restores the THE (approximately 0.1\% at 9 T) with little effect on the longitudinal thermal conductivity. This decoupling reveals that the amplitude of THE is not simply set by the phonon mean free path. Furthermore, measurements performed with metallic and insulating contacts yield identical results on the same sample. This definitively rules out parasitic signals as the effect's origin. Our work, by establishing the phonon THE as an intrinsic property of the crystal lattice and extremely sensitive to disorder, sharply constrains theoretical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Magnetization plateau and anisotropic magnetoresistance in the frustrated Kondo-lattice compound Ce3ScBi5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kondo metals with geometric frustration offer fertile ground for exploring exotic states of matter with a field-induced fractional magnetization platform and nonsaturating magnetoresistance. Herein, a Ce3ScBi5 single crystal with anti-Hf5Sn3Cu hexagonal structure was successfully synthesized via the bismuth self-flux method, leading to the formation of cerium cations arranged in a frustrated structure within a distorted kagome lattice. Magnetic measurements exhibit two distinct antiferromagnetic transitions at 4.1 and 5.9 K. Specifically, the occurrence of multiple metamagnetic transitions between magnetization plateaus is evidenced upon applying magnetic fields perpendicular to the c axis. Transport measurements highlight remarkable Kondo-lattice characteristics and anisotropic magnetoresistance in Ce3ScBi5. The anomalous Hall contributions are observed at low temperatures under critical fields, suggesting Fermi surface reconstruction in a subset of the metamagnetic transitions. We have constructed a temperature-field phase diagram to provide comprehensive information on the complex magnetic structures arising from competitive interactions. Our work establishes Ce3ScBi5 and related materials as a unique platform for exploring low-dimensional quantum fluctuations in bulk crystals, and analyzes the critical role of geometric frustration in Kondo and Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida physical frameworks.</description>

      <title>Stability Frontiers and Mixed-dimensional physics in the Kagome Intermetallics Ln3ScBi5 (Ln = La-Nd, Sm)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-dimensional physics provides profound insights into strongly correlated interactions, leading to enhanced quantum effects and the emergence of exotic quantum states. The Ln3ScBi5 family stands out as a chemically versatile kagome platform with mixed low-dimensional structural framework and tunable physical properties. Our research initiates with a comprehensive evaluation of the currently known Ln3ScBi5 (Ln = La-Nd, Sm) materials, providing a robust methodology for assessing their stability frontiers within this system. Focusing on Pr3ScBi5, we investigate the influence of the zigzag chains of quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) motifs and the distorted kagome layers of quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) networks in the mixed-dimensional structure on the intricate magnetic ground states and unique spin fluctuations. Our study reveals that the noncollinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) moments of Pr3+ ions are confined within the Q2D kagome planes, displaying minimal in-plane anisotropy. In contrast, a strong AFM coupling is observed within the Q1D zigzag chains, significantly constraining spin motion. Notably, the magnetic frustration is partially the consequence of coupling to conduction electrons via the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya Yosida (RKKY) interaction, highlighting a promising framework for future investigations into mixed-dimensional frustration in Ln3ScBi5 systems.</description>

      <title>Infinite-component $BF$ field theory: Nexus of fracton order, Toeplitz braiding, and non-Hermitian amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the recent study of Toeplitz braiding by Li et al. [Phys. Rev. B 110, 205108 (2024)], we introduce \textit{infinite-component} $BF$ (i$BF$) theories by stacking topological $BF$ theories along a fourth ($w$) spatial direction and coupling them in a translationally invariant manner. The i$BF$ framework captures the low-energy physics of 4D fracton topological orders in which both particle and loop excitations exhibit restricted mobility along the stacking direction, and their particle-loop braiding statistics are encoded in asymmetric, integer-valued Toeplitz $K$ matrices. We identify a novel form of particle-loop braiding, termed \textit{Toeplitz braiding}, originating from boundary zero singular modes (ZSMs) of the $K$ matrix. In the thermodynamic limit, nontrivial braiding phases persist even when the particle and loop reside on opposite 3D boundaries, as the boundary ZSMs dominate the nonvanishing off-diagonal elements of $K^{-1}$ and govern boundary-driven braiding behavior. Analytical and numerical studies of i$BF$ theories with Hatano-Nelson-type and non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-type Toeplitz $K$ matrices confirm the correspondence between ZSMs and Toeplitz braiding. The i$BF$ construction thus forges a bridge between strongly correlated topological field theory and noninteracting non-Hermitian physics, where ZSMs underlie the non-Hermitian amplification effect. Possible extensions include 3-loop and Borromean-rings Toeplitz braiding induced by twisted topological terms, generalized entanglement renormalization, and foliation structures within i$BF$ theories. An intriguing analogy to the scenario of parallel universes is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Probing the Critical Behavior of a Sign-Problematic Model with Monte Carlo Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sign-problematic generalized Baxter-Wu (GBW) model with asymmetric complex couplings is mapped onto a one-dimensional quantum model. Utilizing the model's exactly known critical properties, we study the relation between the conventional and the modified average signs and the phase transitions in the GBW model. We find that the average sign develops a negative peak near the critical point, but it is not a unique indicator of phase transition, as similar features can appear in non-critical regions. While the average modified sign provides a viable probe for the phase transition, the practical effectiveness of this method is limited by the exponential scaling of computational cost with the system's volume. We propose that the universal properties of the original model can be investigated through simulating the related reference model, based on the universality assumption. Using finite-size scaling analysis based on Monte Carlo simulations, we confirm the validity of this method, which thereby provides a novel framework for investigating phase transitions in systems plagued by the sign problem.</description>

      <title>Accelerating two-dimensional tensor network optimization by preconditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit gradient-based optimization for infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS), a tensor network ansatz for simulating many-body quantum systems. This approach is hindered by two major challenges: the high computational cost of evaluating energies and gradients, and an ill-conditioned optimization landscape that slows convergence. To reduce the number of optimization steps, we introduce an efficient preconditioner derived from the leading term of the metric tensor. We benchmark our method against standard optimization techniques on the Heisenberg and Kitaev models, demonstrating substantial improvements in overall computational efficiency. Our approach is broadly applicable across various contraction schemes, unit cell sizes, and Hamiltonians, highlighting the potential of preconditioned optimization to advance tensor network algorithms for strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Quasi-linear magnetoresistance and paramagnetic singularity in Hypervalent Bismuthide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials featuring hypervalent bismuth motifs have generated immense interest due to their extraordinary electronic structure and exotic quantum transport. In this study, we synthesized high-quality single crystals of La3ScBi5 characterized by one-dimensional hypervalent bismuth chains and performed a systematic investigation of the magnetoresistive behavior and quantum oscillations. The metallic La3ScBi5 exhibits a low-temperature plateau of electrical resistivity and quasi-linear positive magnetoresistance, with anisotropic magnetoresistive behaviors suggesting the presence of anisotropic Fermi surfaces. This distinctive transport phenomenon is perfectly elucidated by first-principles calculations utilizing the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory. Furthermore, the nonlinear Hall resistivity pointed towards a multiband electronic structure, characterized by the coexistence of electron and hole carriers, which is further supported by our first-principles calculations. Angle-dependent de Haas-van Alphen oscillations are crucial for further elucidating its Fermiology and topological characteristics. Intriguingly, magnetization measurements unveiled a notable paramagnetic singularity at low fields, which might suggest the nontrivial nature of the surface states. Our findings underscore the interplay between transport phenomena and the unique electronic structure of hypervalent bismuthide La3ScBi5, opening avenues for exploring novel electronic applications.</description>

      <title>Evidence for spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry at a non-conformal quantum critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present evidence for the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry in a nearest-neighbour interacting spin-1 chain tuned to a quantum critical point at $T=0$ between two XY quasi-long-range order phases differing by the spontaneous breaking of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. Despite the one-dimensional nature of the system, which typically prevents such a continuous symmetry breaking due to the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem, the presence of a Berry phase term in the quantum model allows us to observe, using matrix product state methods, a finite perpendicular magnetization. Moreover, the quasi-long-range decay of the correlation function becomes truly long-range order, and the dynamical structure factor displays a characteristic Bragg peak together with sharp gapless modes. Our results imply the quantum phase transition has an anomalous dimension of $\eta \simeq 1$ together with the dynamical critical exponent $z\simeq 3/2$, known from the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class in one dimension. We perform a perturbative renormalization group calculation about the upper critical dimension $d_c=2$ that we could close at second loop order. We find an interacting fixed point with critical exponents distinct from the Ising ones. Together, our findings suggest the nature of the fixed point to be non-perturbative. We propose a field-theory that we believe to improve the quantitative results.</description>

      <title>Emergent long-tail dynamics in driven magnets with dynamical frustration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we show that dynamical frustration can spontaneously emerge in frustration-free magnetic systems under periodic driving. Specifically, we consider a classical spin system and demonstrate the emergence of spin-ice physics when drive-induced heating is well suppressed. In particular, we focus on the dynamics of magnetic monopole excitations, which, in sharp contrast to their equilibrium counterparts, exhibit a non-ergodic stochastic random-walk process with long-tailed, power-law distributed waiting times, where the power-law exponent is tunable by the system's effective temperature. Heating is accelerated at intermediate driving frequencies, and the system eventually heats up to an infinite-temperature state. However, the heating time is extremely sensitive to different initial-state realizations and also follows a long-tailed power-law distribution. We show that a drive-induced short-range attractive interaction between monopoles is responsible for the long-tailed distributions observed in both monopole and heating dynamics.</description>

      <title>The parent state in kagome metals and superconductors: Chiral-nematic Fermi liquid state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kagome metals and superconductors hosting rich correlated and topological electronic states have captivated quantum materials research. These states are triggered by an unconventional chiral charge density wave (CDW) wherein a chiral superconductivity emerges at low temperatures, yet the origin of this chiral CDW order, the parent state, is unresolved. Here, we report the discovery of a parent chiral-nematic Fermi liquid state in kagome metals and superconductors. We use spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to study Ti-doped CsV3Sb5 where the CDW is suppressed, and find that multiorbital Fermi surfaces break all mirror reflections and exhibit handedness. We observe the chiral low-energy quasiparticle dispersions, providing direct evidence for a chiral-nematic electronic structure. We further observe the direct transition from the parent state to a chiral-nematic superconducting state. Moreover, in the samples with chiral CDW, we also observe the residual chiral-nematic QPI features, demonstrating that the CDW-triggered exotic states descend from the chiral-nematic Fermi liquid. Our findings not only provide a plausible chiral-nematic parent state, but also establish a new conceptual framework for exploring the emergence and consequences of such exotic quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Interferometric Braiding of Anyons in Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent control and braiding of anyons remain central challenges in realizing topologically protected quantum operations. We propose a Ramsey interferometry protocol to directly access the geometric phases associated with anyons in fractional Chern insulators. Our approach employs impurities with individually addressable internal states that bind to the anyons, allowing their adiabatic motion and exchange under full spatial control. By combining Ramsey and spin-echo sequences, the protocol isolates the Aharonov-Bohm and exchange contributions to the total geometric phase, providing an unambiguous probe of anyonic statistics. Our scheme can potentially be implemented in cold-atom quantum simulators as well as in van der Waals heterostructures. Complementary finite-size simulations in non-interacting Chern insulators quantify the system sizes required to faithfully extract geometric phases, highlighting the role of edge effects. Our results establish impurity-based interferometry as a feasible route toward direct anyon braiding experiments in quantum simulators and lay the groundwork for future explorations of non-Abelian braiding and topological quantum control.</description>

      <title>Impact of Electron Correlations on Infinite-Layer Cuprates and Nickelates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization of unconventional superconductivity involves a balance of interaction strengths. Precise determination of correlation strength across different material families is therefore important. Here, we present a combined X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) study of infinite-layer PrNiO$_2$ and SrCuO$_2$ that enables fair comparison of their interaction strengths. For both compounds, we study the orbital and magnetic excitations and extract their dispersions along high-symmetry directions. Using a single-band Hubbard model and including higher-order exchange interactions, we derive the correlation factor $U/t$ for both compounds. A key finding is that despite a smaller Coulomb repulsion $U$, PrNiO$_2$ exhibits a correlation strength that is 20% stronger than that of its isostructural cuprate counterpart SrCuO$_2$. This indicates that a moderation of the correlation strength may further optimize superconductivity in nickelates.</description>

      <title>Universal Behavior in Entanglement Entropy Reveals Quantum Criticality and Underlying Symmetry Breaking</title>

Abstract: Entanglement plays a key role in quantum physics, but how much information it can extract from many-body systems is still an open question, particularly regarding quantum criticalities and emergent symmetries. In this work, we systematically study the entanglement entropy (EE) and derivative entanglement entropy (DEE) near quantum phase transitions in various quantum many-body systems. A one-parameter scaling relation between the DEE and system size at the critical point has been derived for the first time, which successfully obtains the critical exponent via data collapse. Furthermore, we find that the EE peaks at the (emergent) symmetry enhanced first-order transition, reflecting higher symmetry breaking. This work provides a new paradigm for quantum many-body research from the perspective of EE and DEE.</description>

      <title>Finite-momentum pairing and superlattice superconductivity in valley-imbalanced rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent experimental discovery of superconductivity emerging from a time-reversal symmetry-breaking normal state in tetralayer rhombohedral graphene, we here investigate superconducting instabilities in this system. We classify the possible pairing instabilities, including states with commensurate and incommensurate center of mass momenta. As rotational symmetry is broken in the latter type of pairing states, their momentum-space structure is most naturally characterized by a `valley-independent Chern number', measuring the relative chirality between the normal and superconducting state. We further demonstrate that superconductivity can condense at multiple incommensurate momenta simultaneously, leading to the spontaneous formation of a translational-symmetry-breaking superlattice superconductor. Studying multiple different pairing mechanisms and varying the degree of spin and valley polarization in the normal state, we compare the energetics of these superconductors. Our results demonstrate that valley-imbalanced rhombohedral tetralayer graphene can give rise to rich superconducting phenomenologies.</description>

      <title>Cavity-induced coherent magnetization and polaritons in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets feature antiparallel spin sublattices with $d$-, $g$-, or $i$-wave spin order, yielding nonrelativistic spin splitting without net magnetization. We show that embedding a two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnet in a driven optical cavity induces a finite, tunable magnetization. Coherent photon driving couples selectively to electronic sublattices, and the resulting altermagnets' symmetry-broken spin texture yields a pronounced steady-state spin imbalance -- coherent magnetization -- absent in conventional antiferromagnets for the same lattice configuration. A mean-field Lindblad analysis reveals the dominance of quadratic over linear couplings. In the strong-coupling regime, distinct polariton signatures emerge in the steady state of induced magnetization. This work demonstrates cavity control of altermagnets for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Temperley-Lieb integrable models and fusion categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that every fusion category containing a non-invertible, self-dual object $a$ gives rise to an integrable anyonic chain whose Hamiltonian density satisfies the Temperley-Lieb algebra. This spin chain arises by considering the projection onto the identity channel in the fusion process $a\otimes a$. We relate these models to Pasquier's construction of ADE lattice models. We then exploit the underlying Temperley-Lieb structure to discuss the spectrum of these models and argue that these models are gapped when the quantum dimension of $a$ is greater than 2. We show that for fusion categories where the dimension is close to 2, such as the Fib$\times$Fib and Haagerup fusion categories, the finite size effects are large and they can obscure the numerical analysis of the gap.</description>

      <title>Uncovering field-induced magnetic phase transition by direct observation of the crystal electric-field splitting in a rare-earth magnetic insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An indispensable step toward understanding magnetic interactions in rare-earth magnets is to determine the spatially anisotropic single-ion properties set by crystal electric field (CEF) physics. The CEF Hamiltonian yields a discrete energy spectrum governed by a set of parameters reflecting the local site symmetry of the magnetic ion. However, experimentally determining these parameters, especially for ones at low-symmetry sites remains highly challenging. In this work, we directly measure the CEF level splittings of CsErSe2 under magnetic fields using optical spectroscopy. This enables us to determine the CEF parameters and to predict the metamagnetic-like transition arising from a level-crossing in the ground state. We also identify a level-crossing in the first excited state that leads to a non-monotonic Zeeman splitting, which strongly influences the temperature and field dependence of the magnetization. Our results highlight the capacity of single-ion physics to drive rich and unanticipated phenomena in rare-earth magnetic insulators under applied magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Doped resonating-valence-bond states: Robustness of the spin-ice phases in three-dimensional Rydberg arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00836</link>

Abstract: Rydberg blockade effect provides a convenient platform for simulating locally constrained many-body systems, such as quantum dimer models and quantum loop models, especially their novel phases like topological orders and gapless quantum spin ice (QSI) phases. To discuss the possible phase diagram containing different QSIs in three-dimensional (3D) Rydberg arrays, we have constructed an extended Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) Hamiltonian with equal weight superposition ground state in different fillings at the RK point. Therefore, the perfect QSIs with fixed local dimer filling and their monomer-doped states can be simulated directly by Monte Carlo sampling. Using single-mode approximation, the excitations of dimers and monomers have also been explored in different fillings. We find that, in the thermodynamical limit, even doping a small amount of monomers can disrupt the topological structure and lead to the existence of off-diagonal long-range order. However, in a finite size (as in cold-atom experiment), the property of QSI will be kept in a certain region like a crossover after doping. The phase diagram containing different QSIs and off-diagonal order phases is proposed.</description>

      <title>Controllable and Non-Dissipative Inertial Dynamics of Skyrmion in a Bosonic Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been understood in the past a decade or two that the dynamics of spin or magnetization in ultrafast regime necessarily involves inertial term that reflects the reluctance to follow abrupt or sudden change in the spin or magnetization orientation. The role of inertial spin dynamics in governing the motion of Skyrmion, a topological spin texture, is elucidated. Using nonequilibrium Green's function Keldysh formalism, an equation of motion is derived in terms of collective coordinates for a Skyrmion coupled via a ``minimal coupling'' to a bath of harmonic oscillators of frequency $\omega$, modeling an optical phonon-like bosonic bath with its nearly-flat energy spectrum, and a coupling to the phonon energy density that dominates under resonance condition at the optical phonon frequency. A deterministic and non-dissipative dynamics equation of motion is obtained with an explicit mass term for the Skyrmion emerging due to the coupling, even within rigid Skyrmion picture. This results in a cyclotronic motion of Skyrmion, with a frequency that can go ultrafast, depending on that of the oscillator. Controlling the oscillator frequency can therefore guide the Skyrmion dynamics. Our theory bridges inertial dynamics and topology in magnetism and opens a pathway to ultrafast control of topological spin textures.</description>

      <title>High to low temperature: $O(N)$ model at large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14872v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $O(N)$ vector model for scalars with quartic interaction at large $N$ on $S^1\times S^2$ without the singlet constraint. The non-trivial fixed point of the model is described by a thermal mass satisfying the gap equation at large $N$. We obtain the free energy and the energy density for the model as a series at low temperature in units of the radius of the sphere. We show these results agree with the Borel-Pad\'{e} extrapolations of the high temperature expansions of the free energy and energy density obtained in our previous work. This agreement validates both the expansions and demonstrates that low temperature expansions obtained here correspond to the same solution of the gap equation studied earlier at high temperature. We obtain the ratio of the free energy of the theory at the non-trivial fixed point to that of the Gaussian theory at all values of temperature. This ratio begins at $4/5$ when the temperature is infinity, decreases to a minimum value of $0.760753$, then increases and approaches unity as the temperature is decreased.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Sum Rule from Higher-Form Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17317v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove an entanglement sum rule for $(d-1)$-dimensional quantum lattice models with finite abelian higher-form symmetries, obtained by minimally coupling a sector on $p$-simplices carrying a $p$-form $G$ symmetry to a sector on $(p+1)$-simplices carrying the dual $(d-p-2)$-form $\widehat G$ symmetry (with $\widehat G$ being the Pontryagin dual of $G$). The coupling is introduced by conjugation with a symmetry-preserving operator $\mathcal{U}$ that dresses symmetry-invariant operators with appropriate Wilson operators. Our main result concerns symmetric eigenstates of the coupled model that arise by acting with $\mathcal{U}$ on direct-product symmetric eigenstates of the decoupled model: provided a topological criterion formulated via the Mayer--Vietoris sequence holds for the chosen bipartition, $\mathcal{U}$ factorizes across the cut when acting on the symmetric state, and the entanglement entropy equals the sum of the entropies of the two sectors. This framework explains and generalizes known examples in fermion-$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory, identifies when topology obstructs the sum rule, and provides a procedure to construct new examples by gauging higher-form symmetries.</description>

      <title>Large deviations in the many-body localization transition: The case of the random-field XXZ chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effect of rare system-wide resonances in the many-body localization (MBL) transition has recently attracted significant attention. They are expected to play a prominent role in the stability of the MBL phase, prompting the development of new theoretical frameworks to properly account for their statistical weight. We employ a method based on an analogy with mean-field disordered glassy systems to characterize the statistics of transmission amplitudes between distant many-body configurations in Hilbert space, and apply it to the random-field XXZ spin chain. By introducing a Lagrange multiplier, which formally plays the role of an effective temperature controlling the influence of extreme outliers in the heavy-tailed distribution of propagators, we identify three distinct regimes: (i) an ergodic phase with uniform spreading in Hilbert space, (ii) an intermediate regime where delocalization is driven by rare, disorder-dependent long-range resonances, and (iii) a robust MBL phase where such resonances cannot destabilize localization. We derive a finite-size phase diagram in the disorder--interaction plane both in the spin and in the Anderson basis that quantitatively agrees with recent numerical results based on real-space spin-spin correlation functions. We further demonstrate that even infinitesimal interactions can destroy the Anderson insulator at finite disorder, with the critical disorder remaining finite down to small interaction strengths. By visualizing resonant transmission pathways on the Hilbert space graph, we provide a complementary perspective to real-space and spectral probes, revealing how the destabilization of the MBL phase at finite sizes stems from the emergence of resonant paths that become progressively rarer and shorter-ranged deep in the localized phase.</description>

      <title>A Remarkable Application of Zassenhaus Formula to Strongly Correlated Electron Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Zassenhaus decomposition for the exponential of the sum of two non-commuting operators, simplifies drastically when these operators satisfy a simple condition, called the no-mixed adjoint property. An important application to a Unitary Coupled Cluster method for strongly correlated electron systems is presented. This ansatz requires no Trotterization and is exact on a quantum computer with a finite number of Givens gate equals to the number of free parameters. The formulas obtained in this work also shed light on why and when optimization after Trotterization gives exact solutions in disentangled forms of unitary coupled cluster.</description>
