      <title>The Intrinsic Flattening of Extragalactic Stellar Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly inclined (edge-on) disk galaxies offer the unique perspective to constrain their intrinsic flattening, $c/a$, where $c$ and $a$ are respectively the vertical and long radial axes of the disk measured at suitable stellar densities. The ratio $c/a$ is a necessary quantity in the assessment of galaxy inclinations, three-dimensional structural reconstructions, total masses, as well as a constraint to galaxy formation models. 3.6 micron maps of 133 edge-on spiral galaxies from the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S4G) and its early-type galaxy extension are used to revisit the assessment of $c/a$ free from dust extinction and away from the influence of a stellar bulge. We present a simple definition of $c/a$ and explore trends with other galactic physical parameters: total stellar mass, concentration index, total HI mass, mass of the central mass concentration, circular velocity, model-dependent scales, as well as Hubble type. Other than a dependence on early/late Hubble types, and a related trend with light concentration, no other parameters were found to correlate with the intrinsic flattening of spiral galaxies. The latter is mostly constant with $\langle c/a \rangle$ = 0.124 $\pm$ 0.001 (stat) $\pm$ 0.033 (intrinsic/systematic) and greater for earlier types.</description>

      <title>Broad-Line AGN at $3.5&lt;z&lt;6$: The Black Hole Mass Function and a Connection with Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a sample of 50 H-alpha detected broad-line active galactic nuclei (BLAGN) at redshifts 3.5&lt;z&lt;6.8 using data from the CEERS and RUBIES surveys. We select these sources directly from JWST/NIRSpec G395M/F290LP spectra. We use a multi-step pre-selection and a Bayesian fitting procedure to ensure a high-quality sample of sources with broad Balmer lines and narrow forbidden lines. We compute rest-frame ultraviolet and optical spectral slopes for these objects, and determine that 10 BLAGN in our sample are also little red dots (LRDs). These LRD BLAGN, when examined in aggregate, show broader H-alpha line profiles and a higher fraction of broad-to-narrow component H-alpha emission than non-LRD BLAGN. Moreover, we find that ~66% of these objects are intrinsically reddened (beta (optical)&gt;0), independent of the contributions of emission lines to the broadband photometry. We construct the black hole (BH) mass function at 3.5&lt;z&lt;6 after computing robust observational and line detection completeness corrections. This BH mass function shows broad agreement with both recent JWST/NIRSpec and JWST/NIRCam WFSS based BH mass functions, though we extend these earlier results to log(M(BH)/M(sun)) &lt; 7. The derived BH mass function is consistent with a variety of theoretical models, indicating that the observed abundance of black holes in the early universe is not discrepant with physically-motivated predictions. The BH mass function shape resembles a largely featureless power-law, suggesting that any signature from black-hole seeding has been lost by redshift z~5-6. Finally, we compute the BLAGN UV luminosity function and find good agreement with JWST-detected BLAGN samples from recent works, finding that BLAGN hosts constitute &lt;10% of the total observed UV luminosity at all but the brightest luminosities.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black hole feedback quenches disc galaxies and suppresses bar formation in TNG50</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulation TNG50 to study the relationship between black hole feedback, the presence of stellar bars, and star formation quenching in Milky Way-like disc galaxies. Of our sample of 198 discs, about 63 per cent develop stellar bars that last until z=0. After the formation of their bars, the majority of these galaxies develop persistent 3-15 kpc wide holes in the centres of their gas discs. Tracking their evolution from z=4 to 0, we demonstrate that barred galaxies tend to form within dark matter haloes that become centrally disc dominated early on (and are thus unstable to bar formation) whereas unbarred galaxies do not; barred galaxies also host central black holes that grow more rapidly than those of unbarred galaxies. As a result, most barred galaxies eventually experience kinetic wind feedback that operates when the mass of the central supermassive black hole exceeds $M_{BH} &gt; 10^8 M_{\odot}$. This feedback ejects gas from the central disc into the circumgalactic medium and rapidly quenches barred galaxies of their central star formation. If kinetic black hole feedback occurs in an unbarred disc it suppresses subsequent star formation and inhibits its growth, stabilising the disc against future bar formation. Consequently, most barred galaxies develop black hole-driven gas holes, though a gas hole alone does not guarantee the presence of a stellar bar. This subtle relationship between black hole feedback, cold gas disc morphology, and stellar bars may provide constraints on subgrid physics models for supermassive black hole feedback.</description>

      <title>No evidence for a significant evolution of $M_{\bullet}$-$M_*$ relation up to z$\sim$4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, tight correlations between black hole masses ($M_\bullet$) and their host galaxy properties have been firmly established at low-$z$ ($z&lt;1$), indicating coevolution of supermassive black holes and galaxies. However, the situation at high-$z$, especially beyond cosmic noon ($z\gtrsim2.5$), is controversial. With a combination of \emph{JWST} NIRCam/wide field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) from FRESCO, CONGRESS and deep multi-band NIRCam/image data from JADES in the GOODS fields, we study the black hole to galaxy mass relation at z$\sim$1--4. After identifying 18 broad-line active galactic nuclei (BL AGNs) at $0.9&lt;z&lt;3.6$ (with 8 at $z&gt;2.5$) from the WFSS data, we measure their black hole masses based on broad near-infrared lines (Pa $\alpha$, Pa $\beta$, and He\,I $\lambda$10833\,\AA), and constrain their stellar masses ($M_{*}$) from AGN-galaxy image decomposition or SED decomposition. Taking account of the observational biases, the intrinsic scatter of the $M_{\bullet}-M_{*}$ relation, and the errors in mass measurements, we find no significant difference in the $M_{\bullet}/M_{*}$ ratio for 2.5 $&lt; $ z $ &lt;$ 3.6 compared to that at lower redshifts ($1 &lt; z &lt; 2.5$), suggesting no evolution of the $M_{\bullet} - M_{*}$ relation up to z$\sim$4.</description>

      <title>On the implausible physical implications of a claimed lensed neutral hydrogen detection at redshift z = 1.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Square Kilometre Array mid-frequency array will enable high-redshift detections of neutral hydrogen (HI) emission in galaxies, providing important constraints on the evolution of cold gas in galaxies over cosmic time. Strong gravitational lensing will push back the HI emission frontier towards cosmic noon ($z\sim2$), as has been done for all prominent spectral lines in the interstellar medium of galaxies. Chakraborty &amp; Roy (2023, MNRAS, 519, 4074) report a $z=1.3$ HI emission detection towards the well-modelled, galaxy-scale gravitational lens, SDSS J0826+5630. We carry out HI source modelling of the system and find that their claimed HI magnification, $\mu_{\rm HI} = 29 \pm 6$, requires an HI disk radius of $\lesssim 1.5$ kpc, which implies an implausible mean HI surface mass density in excess of $\Sigma_{\rm HI} &gt; 2000$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$. This is several orders of magnitude above the highest measured peak values $(\Sigma_{\rm HI} \sim 10 \, {\rm M}_\odot\,{\rm pc}^{-2})$, above which HI is converted into molecular hydrogen. Our re-analysis requires this to be the highest HI mass galaxy known (M$_{\rm HI}~\sim 10^{11}$M$_\odot$), as well as strongly lensed, the latter having a typical probability of order 1 in 10$^{3-4}$. We conclude that the claimed detection is spurious.</description>

      <title>Optical intraday variability analysis for the BL Lacertae object 1ES 1426+42.8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation data of blazar 1ES 1426 + 42.8 were obtained using the 1.02 m optical telescope of Yunnan Observatories during $2021$ to $2023$. Intraday variability (IDV) is detected on seven nights. We use the turbulent model to investigate the mechanism of IDV in 1ES 1426 + 42.8. The fitting light curves match the actual IDV curves well. Using this model, we obtain the parameters such as the size of turbulent cells and the width of pulses in the jet. A possible short-lived Quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) of $58.55 \pm 8.09$ minutes was detected on April 26, 2022 whose light curve exhibits eight cycles at $&gt;3\sigma$ global significance and confirmed by several different techniques. Through a more detailed analysis of the light curve of this night, we find that the period is shortened from 54.23 minutes ($4\sigma$) to 29.71 minutes ($3\sigma$). The possible QPO and period shortening phenomenon are best explained by the processes of magnetic reconnections.</description>

      <title>A Post-Starburst Pathway to Forming Massive Galaxies and Their Black Holes at z&gt;6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the rapid formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early universe requires an understanding of how stellar mass grows in the host galaxies. Here, we perform an analysis of rest-frame optical spectra and imaging from JWST of two quasar host galaxies at z&gt;6 which exhibit Balmer absorption lines. These features in the stellar continuum indicate a lack of young stars, similar to low-redshift post-starburst galaxies whose star formation was recently quenched. We find that the stellar mass (log(M_* / M_sun) &gt; 10.6) of each quasar host grew in a starburst episode at redshift 7 or 8. One of the targets exhibits little ongoing star formation, as evidenced by the photometric signature of the Balmer break and a lack of spatially resolved H-alpha emission, placing it well below the star formation main sequence at z = 6. The other galaxy is transitioning to a quiescent phase; together, the two galaxies represent the most distant massive post-starburst galaxies known. The maturity of these two galaxies is further supported by the stellar velocity dispersions of their host galaxies, placing them slightly above the upper end of the local M_BH - sigma_* relation. The properties of our two post-starburst galaxies, each hosting an active SMBH with log(M_BH / M_sun) &gt; 9, suggests that black holes played a major role in shaping the formation of the first massive galaxies in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Galactic Distribution of Supernovae and OB Associations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We update and extend a previous model by Higdon and Lingenfelter for the longitudinal profile of the N\,II intensity in the Galactic plane. The model is based on four logarithmic spiral arms, to which features like the Local Arm and local sources are added. Connecting then the N\,II to the H\,II emission, we use this model to determine the average spatial distribution of OBassociations in the Milky Way. Combined with a stellar mass and cluster distribution function, the model predicts the average spatial and temporal distribution of core-collapse supernovae in the Milky Way. In addition to this average population, we account for supernovae from observed OB associations, providing thereby a more accurate description of the nearby Galaxy. The complete model is made publicly available in the python code SNOB.</description>

      <title>ALMACAL XII. Data characterisation and products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ALMACAL survey is based on a database of reprocessed ALMA calibration scans suitable for scientific analysis, observed as part of regular PI observations. We present all the data accumulated from the start of ALMA operations until May 2022 for 1047 calibrator fields across the southern sky spanning ALMA Bands 3 to 10 (~ 84 - 950 GHz), so-called ALMACAL-22. Encompassing over 1000 square arcmin and accumulating over 2000 hours of integration time, ALMACAL is not only one of the largest ALMA surveys to date, but it continues to grow with each new scientific observation. We outline the methods for processing and imaging a subset of the highest-quality data ('pruned sample'). Using deconvolution techniques within the visibility data (uv plane), we created data cubes as the final product for further scientific analysis. We describe the properties and shortcomings of ALMACAL and compare its area and sensitivity with other sub-millimetre surveys. Notably, ALMACAL overcomes limitations of previous sub-millimetre surveys, such as small sky coverage and the effects of cosmic variance. Moreover, we discuss the improvements introduced by the latest version of this dataset that will enhance our understanding of dusty star-forming galaxies, extragalactic absorption lines, active galactic nucleus physics, and ultimately the evolution of molecular gas.</description>

      <title>A new analytic approach to infer the cosmic-ray ionization rate in hot molecular cores from HCO$^+$, N$_2$H$^+$, and CO observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic-ray ionization rate ($\zeta_2$) is one of the key parameters in star formation, since it regulates the chemical and dynamical evolution of molecular clouds by ionizing molecules and determining the coupling between the magnetic field and gas. However, measurements of $\zeta_2$ in dense clouds (e.g., $n_{\rm H} \geq 10^4$ cm$^{-3}$) are difficult and sensitive to the model assumptions. The aim is to find a convenient analytic approach that can be used in high-mass star-forming regions (HMSFRs), especially for warm gas environments such as hot molecular cores (HMCs). We propose a new analytic approach to calculate $\zeta_2$ through HCO$^+$, N$_2$H$^+$, and CO measurements. Our method gives a good approximation, to within $50$\%, of $\zeta_2$ in dense and warm gas (e.g., $n_{\rm H} \geq 10^4$ cm$^{-3}$, $T = 50, 100$ K) for $A_{\rm V} \geq 4$ mag and $t \geq 2\times10^4$ yr at Solar metallicity. The analytic approach gives better results for higher densities. However, it starts to underestimate the CRIR at low metallicity ($Z = 0.1Z_\odot$) and high CRIR ($\zeta_2 \geq 3\times10^{-15}$ s$^{-1}$). By applying our method to the OMC-2 FIR4 envelope and the L1157-B1 shock region, we find $\zeta_2$ values of $(1.0\pm0.3)\times10^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$ and $(2.2\pm0.4)\times10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$, consistent with those previously reported. We calculate $\zeta_2$ toward a total of 82 samples in HMSFRs, finding that the average value of $\zeta_2$ toward all HMC samples ($\zeta_2$ = (7.4$\pm$5.0)$\times$10$^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$) is more than an order of magnitude higher than the theoretical prediction of cosmic-ray attenuation models, favoring the scenario that locally accelerated cosmic rays in embedded protostars should be responsible for the observed high $\zeta_2$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational chemistry plays a relevant role in many astrochemical research fields, either by complementing experimental measurements or by deriving parameters difficult to be reproduced by laboratories. While the role of computational spectroscopy in assisting new observations in space is described, the core of the chapter is the investigation of the collisional radiative transfer and the bimolecular reactive processes occurring in the gas-phase conditions of the interstellar medium, using as a guide the contributions presented by the authors at the "Second Italian National Congress on Proto(-planetary) Astrochemistry", held in Trieste in September 2023. In particular, the need for accurate datasets of collisional coefficients to model molecular abundances will be discussed. Then, the role of quantum chemistry in the investigation of interstellar-relevant potential energy surfaces will be described, focusing on accurate thermodynamic quantities for the estimate of rate coefficients.</description>

Abstract: Single-dish observations suggest that the abundances of organic species in star-forming regions of the outer Galaxy, characterised by sub-Solar metallicities, are comparable to those found in the local Galaxy. To understand this counter-intuitive result, and avoid misleading interpretation due to beam dilution effects at such large distances, spatially resolved molecular emission maps are needed to link correctly measured abundances and local physical properties. We observed several organic molecules with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array towards WB89-671, the source with the largest Galactocentric distance (23.4~kpc) of the project "CHEMical complexity in star-forming regions of the OUTer Galaxy" (CHEMOUT), at a resolution of 15000~au. We compared the observed molecular abundances with chemical model predictions. We detected emission of c-C3H2, C4H, CH3OH, H2CO, HCO, H13CO+, HCS+, CS, HN13C, and SO. The emission morphology is complex, extended, and different in each tracer. The most intense emission in H13CO+, H2CO and c-C3H2 arises from two millimeter continuum, infrared-bright cores. The most intense CH3OH and SO emission arises predominantly from the part of the filament with no continuum sources. The narrow linewidths across the filament indicate quiescent gas, despite the two embedded protostars. Derived molecular column densities are comparable with those in local star-forming regions, and suggest anti-correlation between hydrocarbons, ions, HCO, and H2CO on one side, and CH3OH and SO on the other. Static chemical models that best match the observed column densities favour low energetic conditions, expected at large Galactocentric radii, but carbon elemental abundances 3 times higher than that derived extrapolating the [C/H] Galactocentric gradient at 23~kpc. This would indicate a flatter [C/H] trend at large Galactocentric radii, in line with a flat abundance of organics.</description>

      <title>Helical randomization of magnetized Galactic plasmas: from magnetorotational disc dynamo to the Faraday rotation sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown, using results of numerical simulations and galactic observations that the transition from deterministic chaos to hard turbulence in the Galactic magnetized plasmas (global and those generated in the internal accretion disk in the high-energy surrounding of a supermassive black hole at the Galactic center) happens through a randomization process. The notion of distributed chaos has been used to describe the randomization process. The randomization can be quantified with the main parameter of the distributed chaos which in turn can be related to magnetic helicity or its dissipation rate. The magnetic fields can impose their level of randomization on the electron density. Results of the numerical simulations of the Galactic dynamos: the inner disk's ones (based on the magnetorotational instability) and global ones, are in good agreement with this approach, as well as with the results obtained using observations of the Faraday rotation sky.</description>

      <title>Properties of the Lower Segment of M31's North West Stream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a kinematic and spectroscopic analysis of 40 red giant branch stars, in 9 fields, exquisitely delineating the lower segment of the North West Stream (NW-K2), which extends for $\sim$80 kpc from the centre of the Andromeda galaxy. We measure the stream's systemic velocity as -439.3$^{+4.1}_{-3.8}$ km/s with a velocity dispersion = 16.4$^{+5.6}_{-3.8}$ km/s that is in keeping with its progenitor being a dwarf galaxy. We find no detectable velocity gradient along the stream. We determine $-$1.3$\pm$0.1 $\le$ &lt;[Fe/H]$_{\rm spec}$&gt; $\le$ $-$1.2$\pm$0.8 but find no metallicity gradient along the stream. We are able to plausibly associate NW-K2 with the globular clusters PandAS-04, PandAS-09, PAndAS-10, PAndAS-11, PandAS-12 but not with PandAS-13 or PandAS-15 which we find to be superimposed on the stream but not kinematically associated with it.</description>

      <title>One Stream or Two -- Exploring Andromeda's North West Stream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results of our dynamical stream modelling for the North West Stream in the outer halo of the Andromeda galaxy (M31). Comprising two main segments, the North West Stream was thought to be a single structured arching around M31. However, recent evidence suggests that it is two separate, unrelated, streams. To test this hypothesis we use observational data from 6 fields associated with the upper segment of the North West Stream together with 8 fields and 5 globular clusters associated with the lower segment to constrain model orbits. We fit both segments of the stream using a fixed potential model for M31 and an orbit integrator to compare orbits with the observed streams. We measure the central tracks and predict proper motions for for the upper segment (lower segment) finding ${\mu^*_{\alpha}}$ = 0.078$^{+0.015}_{-0.012}$ (0.085$^{+0.001}_{-0.002}$) mas/yr and ${\mu_{\delta}}$ = $-$0.05$^{+0.008}_{-0.009}$ ($-$0.095$^{+0.003}_{-0.005}$) mas/yr. Our results support the hypothesis that the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Andromeda XXVII is the progenitor of the upper segment of the North West Stream and that the upper and lower segments do not comprise a single structure. We propose that the upper segment, which appears to be on an infall trajectory with M31, be renamed the "Andromeda XXVII Stream" and the lower segment, also apparently infalling towards M31, retain the name "North West Stream".</description>

      <title>Genesis-Metallicity: Universal Non-Parametric Gas-Phase Metallicity Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce genesis-metallicity, a gas-phase metallicity measurement python software employing the direct and strong-line methods depending on the available oxygen lines. The non-parametric strong-line estimator is calibrated based on a kernel density estimate in the 4-dimensional space of O2 = [O II]$\lambda\lambda 3727,29$/H$\beta$; O3 = [O III]$\lambda 5007$/H$\beta$; H$\beta$ equivalent width EW(H$\beta$); and gas-phase metallicity $12 + \log$(O/H). We use a calibration sample of 1551 galaxies at $0 &lt; z &lt; 10$, with direct-method metallicity measurements compiled from the JWST/NIRSpec and ground-based observations. In particular, we report 145 new NIRSpec direct-method metallicity measurements at $z &gt; 1$. We show that the O2, O3, and EW(H$\beta$) measurements are sufficient for a gas-phase metallicity estimate that is more accurate than 0.09 dex. Our calibration is universal, meaning that its accuracy does not depend on the target redshift. Furthermore, the direct-method module employs a non-parametric $t_e$(O II) electron temperature estimator based on a kernel density estimate in the 5-dimensional space of O2, O3, EW(H$\beta$), $t_e$(O II), and $t_e$(O III). This $t_e$(O II) estimator is calibrated based on 1001 spectra with [O III]$\lambda 4363$ and [O II]$\lambda\lambda 7320,30$ detections, notably reporting 30 new NIRSpec detections of the [O II]$\lambda\lambda 7320,30$ doublet. We make genesis-metallicity and its calibration data publicly available and commit to keeping both up-to-date in light of the incoming data.</description>

      <title>Bayesian evidence for uncorrected gain factors in Galactic synchrotron template maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 408 MHz Haslam map is widely used as a low-frequency anchor for the intensity and morphology of Galactic synchrotron emission. Multi-frequency, multi-experiment fits show evidence of spatial variation and curvature in the synchrotron frequency spectrum, but there are also poorly-understood gain factors between experiments. We perform a Bayesian model comparison across a range of scenarios, using fits that include recent spectroscopic observations at $\sim 1$~GHz by MeerKAT. A large uncorrected gain factor of about 60\% in the Haslam data is strongly preferred, partly undermining its use as a reference template.</description>

      <title>JWST imaging of the closest globular clusters -- IV. Chemistry, luminosity, and mass functions of the lowest-mass members in the NIRISS parallel fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present observations of the two closest globular clusters, NGC 6121 and NGC 6397, taken with the NIRISS detector of JWST. The combination of our new JWST data with archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images allows us to compute proper motions, disentangle cluster members from field objects, and probe the main sequence (MS) of the clusters down to &lt;0.1 $M_\odot$ as well as the brighter part of the white-dwarf sequence. We show that theoretical isochrones fall short in modeling the low-mass MS and discuss possible explanations for the observed discrepancies. Our analysis suggests that the lowest-mass members of both clusters are significantly more metal-rich and oxygen-poor than their higher-mass counterparts. It is unclear whether the difference is caused by a genuine mass-dependent chemical heterogeneity, low-temperature atmospheric processes altering the observed abundances, or systematic shortcomings in the models. We computed the present-day local luminosity and mass functions of the two clusters; our data reveal a strong flattening of the mass function indicative of a significant preferential loss of low-mass stars in agreement with previous dynamical models for these two clusters. We have made our NIRISS astro-photometric catalogs and stacked images publicly available to the community.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic signatures of black hole clusters in the center of super-Eddington galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of active galaxies are fed by accretion disks that radiate from the infrared or optical to the X-ray bands. Several types of objects can orbit SMBHs, including massive stars, neutron stars, clouds from the broad- and narrow-line regions, and X-ray binaries. Isolated black holes with a stellar origin (BHs of $\sim10\,M_{\odot}$) should also be present in large numbers within the central parsec of the galaxies. These BHs are expected to form a cluster around the SMBH as a result of the enhanced star formation rate in the inner galactic region and the BH migration caused by gravitational dynamical friction. However, except for occasional microlensing effects on background stars or gravitational waves from binary BH mergers, the presence of a BH population is hard to verify. In this paper, we explore the possibility of detecting electromagnetic signatures of a central cluster of BHs when the accretion rate onto the central SMBH is greater than the Eddington rate. In these supercritical systems, the accretion disk launches powerful winds that interact with the objects orbiting the SMBH. Isolated BHs can capture matter from this dense wind, leading to the formation of small accretion disks around them. If jets are produced in these "single" microquasars, they could be sites of particle acceleration to relativistic energies. These particles in turn are expected to cool by various radiative processes. Therefore, the wind of the SMBH might illuminate the BHs through the production of both thermal and nonthermal radiation. We conclude that, under these circumstances, a cluster of isolated BHs could be detected at X-rays (with Chandra and XMM-Newton) and radio wavelengths (e.g., with the Very Large Array and the Square Kilometer Array) in the center of nearby super-Eddington galaxies.</description>

      <title>Earth's Mesosphere During Possible Encounters With Massive Interstellar Clouds 2 and 7 Million Years Ago</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our solar system's path has recently been shown to potentially intersect dense interstellar clouds 2 and 7 million years ago: the Local Lynx of Cold Cloud and the edge of the Local Bubble. These clouds compressed the heliosphere, directly exposing Earth to the interstellar medium. Previous studies that examined climate effects of these encounters argued for an induced ice age due to the formation of global noctilucent clouds (NLCs). Here, we revisit such studies with a modern 2D atmospheric chemistry model using parameters of global heliospheric magnetohydrodynamic models as input. We show that NLCs remain confined to polar latitudes and short seasonal lifetimes during these dense cloud crossings lasting $\sim10^5$ years. Polar mesospheric ozone becomes significantly depleted, but the total ozone column broadly increases. Furthermore, we show that the densest NLCs lessen the amount of sunlight reaching the surface instantaneously by up to 7% while halving outgoing longwave radiation.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Bow-Shock Nebula around the Z Cam-type Cataclysmic Variable SY Cancri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the serendipitous discovery of a bow-shock nebula around the cataclysmic variable (CV) SY Cancri. In addition, SY Cnc lies near the edge of a faint Halpha-emitting nebula with a diameter of about 15'. The orientation of the bow shock is consistent with the direction of SY Cnc's proper motion. Nebulae are extremely rare around CVs, apart from those known to have undergone classical-nova (CN) outbursts; bow shocks and off-center nebulae are even more unusual. Nevertheless, the properties of SY Cnc and its nebulosity are strikingly similar to those of V341 Ara, another CV that is also associated with a bow shock and is likewise off-center with respect to its faint Halpha nebula. Both stars are binaries with optically thick accretion disks, belonging to the classes of Z Cam CVs or nova-like variables. We discuss three scenarios to explain the properties of the nebulae. They may have resulted from chance encounters with interstellar gas clouds, with the stars leaving in their wakes material that is recombining after being photoionized by UV radiation from the CVs. Alternatively, the large nebulae could be ejecta from unobserved CN outbursts in the recent past, which have been decelerated through collisions with the interstellar medium (ISM), while the stars continue to snowplow through the gas. Or the faint Halpha nebulae may be ambient ISM that was shock-ionized by a CN outburst in the past and is now recombining.</description>

Abstract: Black hole demographics in different environments is critical in view of recent results on massive-stars binarity, and of the multi-messenger detectability of compact objects mergers. But the identification and characterization of non-interacting black holes is elusive, especially in the sparse field stellar population. A candidate non-interactive black hole (BH)+red giant (RG) binary system, 2MASSJ05215658+4359220, was identified by Thompson et al.(2019). We obtained Astrosat/UVIT Far-Ultraviolet (FUV) imaging and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) UV-optical imaging and spectroscopy of the source, to test possible scenarios for the optically-elusive companion. HST/STIS spectra from about 1,600 to 10,230Ang are best fit by the combination of two stellar sources, a red giant with Teff=4250 (uncertainty 150K), logg=2.0, Radius_RG=27.8Rsun (assuming a single-temperature atmosphere), and a subgiant companion with Teff=6,000K, Radius_comp=2.7Rsun, or Teff=5,270K, Radius_comp=4.2Rsun using models with one-tenth or one-third solar metallicity respectively, logg=3.0, extinction E(B-V)=0.50(uncertainty 0.2), adopting the DR3 Gaia distance D=2,463pc (uncertainty 120pc). No FUV data existed prior to our programs. STIS spectra give an upper limit of 10e-17ergs cm-2 s-1 Ang-1 shortward of 2300Ang; an upper limit of &gt;25.7ABmag was obtained in two UVIT FUV broad-bands. The non-detection of FUV flux rules out a compact companion such as a hot WD. The STIS spectrum shows strong MgII lambda2800Ang emission, typical of chromospherically active red giants. The masses inferred by comparison with evolutionary tracks, about 1 Msun for the red giant and between 1.1 and 1.6Msun for the subgiant companion, suggest past mass transfer, although the red giant currently does not fill its Roche lobe. WFC3 imaging in F218W, F275W, F336W, F475W, and F606W shows an unresolved source in all filters.</description>

      <title>A Geodetic and Astrometric VLBI Experiment at 22/43/88/132 GHz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extending geodetic and astrometric Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations from traditional centimeter wavebands to millimeter wavebands offers numerous scientific potentials and benefits. However, it was considered quite challenging due to various factors, including the increased effects of atmospheric opacity and turbulence at millimeter wavelengths. Here, we present the results of the first geodetic-mode VLBI experiment, simultaneously observing 82 sources at 22/43/88/132 GHz (K/Q/W/D bands) using the Korean VLBI Network (KVN). We introduced the frequency phase transfer (FPT) method to geodetic VLBI analysis, an approach for calibrating atmospheric phase fluctuations at higher frequencies by transferring phase solutions from lower frequencies. With a 2-minute scan, FPT improved the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of most fringes, some by over 100%, thereby enhancing the detection rate of weak sources at millimeter wavebands. Additionally, FPT reduced systematic errors in group delay and delay rate, with the weighted root-mean-squares (WRMS) of the post-fitting residuals decreasing from 25.0 ps to 20.5 ps at the W band and from 39.3 ps to 27.6 ps at the D band. There were no notable differences observed in calibrating atmospheric phase fluctuations at the K band (WRMS = 12.4 ps) and Q band (WRMS = 11.8 ps) with the KVN baselines. This experiment demonstrated that the millimeter waveband can be used for geodetic and astrometric applications with high precision.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the detectability of Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) emission from galaxies at the onset of cosmic reionization, aiming to understand the conditions necessary for detecting high-redshift sources like JADES-GS-z13-1-LA at $z=13$. By integrating galaxy formation models with detailed intergalactic medium (IGM) reionization simulations, we construct high-redshift galaxy catalogs to model intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ profiles and assess their transmission through the IGM. For a galaxy with $M_{\rm UV}\sim -18.5$ like JADES-GS-z13-1-LA, our fiducial model predicts a Ly$\alpha$ transmission of ${\sim}13$% and there is a probability of observing Ly$\alpha$ emission with an equivalent width &gt;40A of up to 10%. We also explore how variations in the UV ionizing escape fraction, dependent on host halo mass, impact Ly$\alpha$ detectability. Our findings reveal that reionization morphology significantly influences detection chances -- models where reionization is driven by low-mass galaxies can boost the detection probability to as much as 12%, while those driven by massive galaxies tend to reduce ionized regions around faint emitters, limiting their detectability. This study underscores the importance of reionization morphology in interpreting high-redshift Ly$\alpha$ observations.</description>

Abstract: The physical processes that establish the morphological evolution and the structural diversity of galaxies are key unknowns in extragalactic astrophysics. Here we report the finding of the morphologically-mature galaxy JADES-GS+53.18343-27.79097, which existed within the first 700 million years of the Universe's history. This star-forming galaxy with a stellar mass of 400 million solar masses consists of three components, a highly-compact core with a half-light radius of less than 100 pc, an actively star-forming disc with a radius of about 400 pc, and a star-forming clump, which all show distinctive star-formation histories. The central stellar mass density of this galaxy is within a factor of two of the most massive present-day ellipticals, while being globally 1000 times less massive. The radial profile of the specific star-formation rate is rising toward the outskirts. This evidence suggests the first detection of inside-out growth of a galaxy as a proto-bulge and a star-forming disc in the Epoch of Reionization.</description>

      <title>Signatures of gas flows-II: Connecting the kinematics of the multiphase circumgalactic medium to galaxy rotation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multiphase CGM hosts critical processes that affect galaxy evolution such as accretion and outflows. We searched for evidence of these phenomena by using the EW co-rotation fraction ($f_{\rm EWcorot}$) to study the kinematic connection between the multiphase CGM and host galaxy rotation. We examined CGM absorption from HST/COS (including, but not limited to, SiII, CII, SiIII, CIII, and OVI) within $21\leq D\leq~276$ kpc of 27 galaxies. We find the median $f_{\rm EWcorot}$ for all ions is consistent within errors and the $f_{\rm EWcorot}$ increases with increasing N(HI). The $f_{\rm EWcorot}$ of lower ionization gas decreases with increasing $D/R_{\rm vir}$ while OVI and HI are consistent with being flat. The $f_{\rm EWcorot}$ varies minimally as a function of azimuthal angle and is similar for all ions at a fixed azimuthal angle. The larger number of OVI detections enabled us to investigate where the majority of co-rotating gas is found. Highly co-rotating OVI primarily resides along the galaxies' major axis. Looking at the $f_{\rm EWcorot}$ as a function of ionization potential (${d{f_{\rm EWcorot}}}/{d{(eV)}}$), we find a stronger co-rotation signature for lower-ionization gas. There are suggestions of a connection between the CGM metallicity and major axis co-rotation where low-ionization gas with higher $f_{\rm EWcorot}$ exhibits lower metallicity and may trace large-scale filamentary inflows. Higher ionization gas with higher $f_{\rm EWcorot}$ exhibits higher metallicity and may instead trace co-planar recycled gas accretion. Our results stress the importance of comparing absorption originating from a range of ionization phases to differentiate between various gas flow scenarios.</description>

Abstract: In this chapter, we delve into the formation and primary characteristics of two significant components within galaxy clusters: the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) and the intracluster light (ICL). Drawing upon recent and pertinent studies in the field, we explore the mechanisms driving their growth from high redshift to the present day, i.e., mergers and stellar stripping. Mergers between satellite galaxies and the BCGs account for a significant amount of ICL, as well as stellar stripping which is responsible for the formation of the bulk of it. We also examine how these formation mechanisms are intertwined with the dynamical state of their host clusters, suggesting their potential utility as luminous tracers of dark matter.</description>

      <title>RMS asymmetry: a robust metric of galaxy shapes in images with varied depth and resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural disturbances, such as galaxy mergers or instabilities, are key candidates for driving galaxy evolution, so it is important to detect and quantify galaxies hosting these disturbances spanning a range of masses, environments, and cosmic times. Traditionally, this is done by quantifying the asymmetry of a galaxy as part of the concentration-asymmetry-smoothness system, $A_{\rm{CAS}}$, and selecting galaxies above a certain threshold as merger candidates. However, in this work, we show that $A_{\rm{CAS}}$, is extremely dependent on imaging properties -- both resolution and depth -- and thus defining a single $A_{\rm{CAS}}$ threshold is impossible. We analyze an alternative root-mean-squared asymmetry, $A_{\rm{RMS}}$, and show that it is independent of noise down to the average SNR per pixel of 1. However, both metrics depend on the resolution. We argue that asymmetry is, by design, always a scale-dependent measurement, and it is essential to define an asymmetry at a given physical resolution, where the limit should be defined by the size of the smallest features one wishes to detect. We measure asymmetry of a set of $z\approx0.1$ galaxies observed with HST, HSC, and SDSS, and show that after matching the resolution of all images to 200 pc, we are able to obtain consistent $A_{\rm{RMS, 200pc}}$ measurements with all three instruments despite the vast differences in the original resolution or depth. We recommend that future studies use $A_{\rm{RMS, x pc}}$ measurement when evaluating asymmetry, where $x$ is defined by the physical size of the features of interest, and is kept consistent across the dataset, especially when the redshift or image properties of galaxies in the dataset vary.</description>

      <title>The Lyman Alpha Reference Sample XV. Relating Ionised Gas Kinematics with Lyman-$\alpha$ observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gas kinematics affect the radiative transfer and escape of hydrogen Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) emission from galaxies. We investigate this interplay empirically by relating the ionised gas kinematics of 42 galaxies in the extended Ly$\alpha$ Reference Sample with their Ly$\alpha$ escape fractions, $f_\rm{esc}$, Ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths, $\rm{EW}_\rm{Ly\alpha}$, and Ly$\alpha$ luminosities, $L_\rm{Ly\alpha}$. To this aim we use PMAS integral-field spectroscopic observations of the Balmer-$\alpha$ line. We calculate shearing velocities, $v_\rm{shear}$, and intrinsic velocity dispersions, $\sigma_0^\rm{obs}$ (empirically corrected for beam-smearing effects), as global kinematical measures for each galaxy. The sample is characterised by highly turbulent motions and more than half of the sample shows dispersion dominated kinematics. We uncover clear trends between Ly$\alpha$ observables and global kinematical statistics. We discuss statistically the importance of $v_\rm{shear}$, $\sigma_0^\rm{obs}$, and $v_\rm{shear}/\sigma_0^\rm{obs}$ for regulating the Ly$\alpha$ observables in comparison to other galaxy parameters. It emerges that $\sigma_0^\rm{obs}$ is the dominating parameter for $\rm{EW}_\rm{Ly\alpha}$ and that is as important as nebular extinction, gas covering fraction, and ionising photon production efficiency in regulating $f_\rm{esc}$. A simple scenario where the starburst age is simultaneously regulating turbulence, $\rm{EW}_\rm{Ly\alpha}$, and $f_\rm{esc}$ does not find support by our observations. However, we show that the small scale distribution of dust appears to be influenced by turbulence in some galaxies. In support of our observational result we discuss how turbulence is theoretically expected to play a significant role in modulating $f_\rm{esc}$.

      <title>Gravitational waves from mergers of Population III binary black holes: roles played by two evolution channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) signal from binary black hole (BBH) mergers is a promising probe of Population III (Pop III) stars. To fully unleash the power of the GW probe, one important step is to understand the relative importance and features of different BBH evolution channels. We model two channels, isolated binary stellar evolution (IBSE) and nuclear star cluster-dynamical hardening (NSC-DH), in one theoretical framework based on the semi-analytical code A-SLOTH, under various assumptions on Pop III initial mass function (IMF), initial binary statistics and high-$z$ nuclear star clusters (NSCs). The NSC-DH channel contributes $\sim 8-95\%$ of Pop III BBH mergers across cosmic history, with higher contributions achieved by initially wider binary stars, more top-heavy IMFs, and more abundant high-$z$ NSCs. The dimensionless stochastic GW background (SGWB) produced by Pop III BBH mergers has peak values $\Omega^{\rm peak}_{\rm GW}\sim 10^{-11}-8\times 10^{-11}$ around observer-frame frequencies $\nu\sim 10-100\ \rm Hz$. The Pop III contribution can be a non-negligible ($\sim 2-32\%$) component in the total SGWB at $\nu\lesssim 10\ \rm Hz$. The estimated detection rates of Pop III BBH mergers by the Einstein Telescope are $\sim 6-230\ \rm yr^{-1}$ and $\sim 30-1230\ \rm yr^{-1}$ for the NSC-DH and IBSE channels, respectively. Pop III BBH mergers in NSCs are more massive than those from IBSE, so they dominate the Pop III SGWB below $20$ Hz in most cases. Besides, the detection rate of Pop III BBH mergers involving at least one intermediate-mass BH above $100\ \rm M_\odot$ by the Einstein Telescope is $\sim 0.5-200\ \rm yr^{-1}$ in NSCs but remains below $0.1\ \rm yr^{-1}$ for IBSE.</description>

      <title>Witnessing an extreme, highly efficient galaxy formation mode with resolved Ly$\alpha$ and LyC emission</title>

Abstract: J1316+2614 at z=3.613 is the UV-brightest ($M_{UV}$ = -24.7) and strongest Lyman continuum (LyC, $f_{esc}^{LyC} \approx$ 90%) emitting star-forming galaxy known, showing also signatures of inflowing gas from its blue-dominated Ly$\alpha$ profile. Here, we present high-resolution imaging with the HST and VLT of the LyC, Ly$\alpha$, rest-UV, and optical emission of J1316+2614. Detailed analysis of the LyC and UV light distributions reveals compact yet resolved profiles, with LyC and UV morphologies showing identical half-light radii of $\simeq$ 220 pc. The continuum-subtracted Ly$\alpha$ emission reveals an extended filamentary structure of $\simeq$ 6.0 kpc oriented south-north with only weak/residual flux within the stellar core, suggesting a Ly$\alpha$ "hole". J1316+2614 presents remarkably high SFR and stellar mass surface densities of log($\Sigma_{SFR}$ [$M_{\odot}$/yr/kpc^2]) = 3.47$\pm$0.11 and log($\Sigma_{M}$ [$M_{\odot}$/pc^2]) = 4.20$\pm$0.06, respectively, which are among the highest observed in star-forming galaxies. Our findings indicate that J1316+2614 is a powerful, young, and compact starburst, leaking significant LyC photons due to the lack of gas and dust within the starburst. We explore the conditions for gas expulsion using a simple energetic balance and find that, given the strong binding force in J1316+2614, a high star formation efficiency ($\epsilon_{SF} \geq 0.7$) is necessary to remove the gas and explain its exposed nature. Our results thus suggest a close link between high $\epsilon_{SF}$ and high $f_{esc}^{LyC}$. This high efficiency can also naturally explain the remarkably high SFR, UV-luminosity, and efficient mass growth of J1316+2614, where at least 62% of its mass formed in the last 6 Myr. J1316+2614 may exemplify an intense, feedback-free starburst with a high $\epsilon_{SF}$, similar to those proposed for UV-bright galaxies at high redshifts. (ABRIDGED)</description>

      <title>The Lower Limit of Dynamical Black Hole Masses Detectable in Virgo Compact Stellar Systems Using the JWST/NIRSpec IFU</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to observational challenges, the mass function of black holes (BH) at lower masses is poorly constrained in the local universe. Understanding the occupation fraction of BHs in low-mass galaxies is crucial for constraining the origins of supermassive BH seeds. Compact stellar systems (CSSs), including ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) and compact elliptical galaxies (cEs), are potential intermediate-mass BH hosts. Despite the difficulties posed by their limited spheres of influence, stellar dynamical modeling has been effective in estimating central BH masses in CSSs. Some CSSs may harbor a BH constituting up to 20% of their host stellar mass, while others might not have a central BH. In support of our ongoing efforts to determine the BH masses in select CSSs in the Virgo cluster using JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations and orbit-superposition dynamical models, we create mock kinematic data mimicking the characteristics of observed cEs/UCDs in the Virgo cluster with different BH masses. We then construct a series of dynamical models using the orbit-superposition code FORSTAND and explore the accuracy of recovering the BH mass. We find that the mass of BHs comprising 1% or more of the total host stellar mass can be accurately determined through kinematic maps featuring higher-order velocity moments. We also assess how BH mass measurement is affected by deprojection methods, regularization factors, anisotropy parameters, orbit initial conditions, the absence of higher-order velocity moments, spatial resolution, and the signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

      <title>A galactic outflow traced by its extended Mg II emission out to a $\sim30$ kpc radius in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field with MUSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16067v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a rare Mg II $\lambda$$\lambda$ 2796, 2803 doublet emission halo around a star forming galaxy with $\log (M_\star$/M$_\odot) = 10.3 \pm 0.3$ at $z=0.737$ in deep (9.94 h) VLT/MUSE data from the MUSE-HUDF mosaic. While the central region prominently displays an absorption-dominated Mg II doublet, characterized by discernible P-Cyg features, our examination reveals a remarkably extended Mg II emission, spanning approximately $\sim30$ kpc from the central galaxy. We introduce a simple outflow radiative transfer modeling scheme based on the Sobolev approximation, and we employ a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) fitting to find the best-fitting parameters that match our data. The model reproduces several key features of the observed Mg II halo and allows us to constrain the kinematics and geometry of the outflowing gas. Our data are consistent with a biconical wind whose velocity increases with radius, pointing nearly towards the observer, with an opening angle of $59\pm4^{\circ}$ In general, we find that our outflow model performs better in the inner regions of the galactic wind ($\lesssim 10$ kpc $\approx 6$ half-light radii), reaching a velocity of $\sim120$ km s$^{-1}$ at 10 kpc from the central galaxy. However, discrepancies between the data and the model in the outer regions suggest the possible influence of additional mechanisms, such as inflows, satellite interactions, or turbulence, which might significantly shape the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of galaxies at larger impact parameters. This analysis underscores the complexity of galactic outflows and encourages further exploration of the processes governing the dynamics of galactic winds through spatially resolved studies of the CGM.</description>

      <title>Mapping and characterizing magnetic fields in the Rho Ophiuchus-A molecular cloud with SOFIA/HAWC$+$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (abridged) Together with gravity, turbulence, and stellar feedback, magnetic fields (B-fields) are thought to play a critical role in the evolution of molecular clouds and star formation processes. We aim to map the morphology and measure the strength of B-fields of the nearby molecular cloud, rho Ophiuchus-A ($\rho$ Oph-A), and then to understand the role of B-fields in regulating star formation and shaping the cloud. We have analyzed the far-infrared (FIR) polarization of thermal dust emission observed by SOFIA/HAWC$+$ at 89 and 154 $\mu$m toward the densest part of $\rho$ Oph-A, which is irradiated by the nearby B3/4 star, Oph-S1. The cloud exhibits well-ordered B-fields with magnetic orientations mainly perpendicular to the ridge of the cloud toward the densest region and B-field strengths are in the range of 0.2-2.5 mG, using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. The B-fields are strongest at the densest part of the cloud, which is associated with the starless core SM1, and decreases toward the outskirts of the cloud. By calculating the map of the mass-to-flux ratio, Alfv\'en Mach number, and plasma $\beta$ parameter in $\rho$ Oph-A, we find that the cloud is predominantly magnetically sub-critical, sub-Alfv\'enic, which implies that the cloud is supported by strong B-fields that dominate over gravity, turbulence, and thermal gas energy. Measured B-field strengths at two densest subregions using other methods that account for the compressible mode are relatively lower than that measured with the DCF method but do not significantly change our conclusions on the roles of B-fields relative to gravity and turbulence on star formation. A virial analysis suggests that the cloud is gravitationally unbound. We find that B-fields are sufficiently strong to support the cloud against radiative feedback and to regulate the shape of the cloud.</description>

Abstract: We explore the co-evolution of dark matter halos, their central galaxies, and central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) using the IllustrisTNG (TNG) simulation. We find that the evolutionary histories of individual galaxies in the $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_*$ plane can be decomposed into four distinct phases, separated by three transition points. We identify the driving processes of galaxy evolution within each phase and derive the conditions necessary and sufficient for transitions to subsequent phases. The first phase is dominated by star formation, with its duration primarily determined by the mass of the SMBH seed and the surrounding gas environment. The second phase is characterized by rapid SMBH growth, and the transition to the next phase occurs when the thermal-mode feedback of active galactic nucleus (AGN) can unbind gas from the galaxy. The third phase involves self-regulation of the SMBH, and the transition to the quenched phase occurs when the kinetic-mode feedback of AGN counterbalances gas cooling within the subhalo. The final phase is dominated by mergers. We investigate the use of scaling relations among different mass components and evolutionary phases to understand processes implemented in TNG and other simulations, and discuss how current and forthcoming observations can be used to constrain models.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Lensing of Spherically Symmetric Black Holes in Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15760v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational lensing of supermassive black holes surrounded by dark matter halo has attracted a great number of interests in recent years. However, many studies employed simplified dark matter density models, which makes it very hard to give a precise prediction on the dark matter effects in real astrophysical galaxies. In this work, to more accurately describe the distribution of dark matter in real astrophysical galaxies, we study the gravitational lensing of black holes in astrophysical dark matter halo models (Beta, Burkert, Brownstein, and Moore). The deflection angle is obtained using a generalized Gibbons-Werner approach. The visual angular positions and the Einstein rings are also calculated by adopting the gravitational lens equation. Specifically, we choose the supermassive black holes in Milky Way Galaxy, Andromeda galaxy (M31), Virgo galaxy (M87), and ESO138-G014 galaxy as examples, including the corresponding fitted value of dark matter halos. The results suggest that the dark matter halo described by the Beta model has non-negligible influences on the gravitational deflection angle and gravitational lensing observations. However, the Burkert, Brownstein, and Moore models have relatively small influences on angular position of images and the Einstein ring.</description>

      <title>Witt's hyperbola is both predicted and observed to pass close to the lensing galaxies in quadruple quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a rectangular hyperbola is constructed from the image positions of a quadruply lensed quasar, as proposed by Witt (1996), it passes very close to the the lensing galaxy. The median measured perpendicular offset between the observed light center of the lens and Witt's hyperbola is 0.013" for a sample for 39 systems lensed by a relatively isolated galaxy. The family of lens models adopted by Witt predicts that the lens lies on the hyperbola, but its position in not used for its construction. The median offset corresponds to roughly 1% of the Einstein ring radius, and suggests that the centers of the lensing potential are close to the light centers of the lens. By putting a restrictive prior on the perpendicular distance to Witt's hyperbola (or on the distance between the galaxy and the potential), one reduces by one the dimensionality of a model space when fitting data. Taking the brightest pixel of a lensing galaxy as its center avoids a shortcoming of using the average light center for a constraint.</description>

      <title>Late-end reionization with ATON-HE: towards constraints from Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters observed with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new suite of late-end reionization simulations performed with ATON-HE, a revised version of the GPU-based radiative transfer code ATON that includes helium. The simulations are able to reproduce the Ly$\alpha$ flux distribution of the E-XQR-30 sample of QSO absorption spectra at $5 \lesssim z \lesssim 6.2$, and show that a large variety of reionization models are consistent with these data. We explore a range of variations in source models and in the early-stage evolution of reionization. Our fiducial reionization history has a midpoint of reionization at $z = 6.5$, but we also explore an `Early' reionization history with a midpoint at $z = 7.5$ and an `Extremely Early' reionization history with a midpoint at $z = 9.5$. Haloes massive enough to host observed Ly$\alpha$ emitters are highly biased. The fraction of such haloes embedded in ionized bubbles that are large enough to allow high Ly$\alpha$ transmission becomes close to unity much before the volume filling factor of ionized regions. For our fiducial reionization history this happens at $z = 8$, probably too late to be consistent with the detection by JWST of abundant Ly$\alpha$ emission out to $z = 11$. A reionization history in our `Early' model or perhaps even our `Extremely Early' model may be required, suggesting a Thomson scattering optical depth in tension with that reported by Planck, but consistent with recent suggestions of a significantly higher value.</description>

      <title>Prospects for detection of ultra high frequency gravitational waves from hyperbolic encounters with resonant cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this brief note, we pursue the systematic investigation of possible gravitational wave sources in the gigahertz band. We focus on hyperbolic encounters of light black holes and evaluate precisely the expected signal when accounting for the detailed characteristics of haloscope experiments. Considering the GraHal setup as a benchmark, we insist on the correct signal-to-noise ratio expression taking into account the appropriate timescales. The associated maximum distance - of the order of a few hundreds of astronomical units - at which an event can be detected is calculated for optimal, sub-optimal, and general trajectories.</description>
