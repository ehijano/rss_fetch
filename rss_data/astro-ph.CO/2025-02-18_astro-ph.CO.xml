      <title>No evidence for dynamical dark energy from DESI and SN data: a symbolic regression analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey (DESI), combined with data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernovae (SNe), challenge the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm. They indicate a potential evolution in the dark energy equation of state (EoS), $w(z)$, as suggested by analyses that employ parametric models. In this paper, we use a model-independent approach known as high performance symbolic regression (PySR) to reconstruct $w(z)$ directly from observational data, allowing us to bypass prior assumptions about the underlying cosmological model. Our findings confirm that the DESI data alone agree with the $\Lambda$CDM model ($w(z) = -1$) at the redshift range considered. Notably, this agreement improves slightly when we exclude the data point at $z = 0.51$. Additionally, we observe similar conclusions when combining the DESI data with existing compilations of SNe distance measurements, such as Pantheon+ and the Dark Energy Survey Supernova 5-Year, regardless of the absolute magnitude prior values used. Therefore, these results suggest that it is premature to claim any statistically significant evidence for a dynamical EoS or deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM model based on the current DESI data, either alone or in combination with supernova measurements.</description>

      <title>Constraining Statistical Isotropy using 21cm Power Spectrum and Bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cosmological Principle states that the universe is statistically isotropic and homogeneous on large length scales, typically $\gtrsim 70$Mpc. A detection of significant deviation would help us falsify the simplest models of inflation. In this regard, there are potential indications of departures from this principle, e.g., observations from WMAP and Planck show signs of a preferred direction in the temperature fluctuations known as hemispherical asymmetry in CMB. Phenomenologically, this has been studied using a dipole modulation model. In addition to this, a number of possible mechanisms have been proposed in the literature to explain this anomaly. Some of these scenarios generate dipolar asymmetry or predict quadrupolar asymmetry in the primordial power spectrum of curvature perturbations. In this paper, we study both these asymmetries. To fulfill the objective, we employ 21cm intensity mapping technique post during post-reionization era, i.e., $z\lesssim 7$. We apply Fisher formalism to constrain dipolar and quadrupolar anisotropy parameters using both 21cm power and bispectra and give forecasts for three intensity mapping surveys: SKA-Mid, HIRAX and PUMA. Although 21cm intensity mapping is a very promising cosmological probe, the signals are severely affected by foregrounds. To mitigate the foreground effects, we use foreground avoidance approach. For the interferometer mode of operation, we also include the wedge effect. From our analysis, we find that PUMA, on account of its high redshift range is able to constrain both dipolar and quadrupolar parameters to better than $\sim 10^{-3}$ for redshifts $z \gtrsim 1$. This is one order of magnitude better constraints as compared to those provided by the latest CMB surveys. We also find that as compared to power spectrum, the constraining power of bispectrum is more sensitive towards foregrounds.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave lensing: probing Fuzzy Dark Matter with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing is a universal phenomenon: it affects both gravitational waves (GWs) and electromagnetic signals travelling through the gravitational field of a massive object. In this work, we explore the prospects of observing lensed GW signals from the mergers of massive black holes, lensed by dark matter halos composed of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM), which form dense cores known as solitons. We focus on wave optics phenomena, where frequency-dependent signatures can be observed in the weak lensing regime (i.e. single-image). Our results show that lensing diffraction signatures differ for low-mass halos in FDM, and can reveal the presence of a solitonic core. Furthermore, we demonstrate that FDM and cold dark matter profiles can be distinguished in GW signals from binary massive black hole mergers, which will be observed by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. However, the dense solitonic core does not substantially enhance the detectability of FDM halos at large source-lens offsets, relative to standard cold dark matter. Our analysis confirms FDM halos as a promising signature of dark matter on GW observations</description>

      <title>Spinning spectral sirens: Robust cosmological measurement using mass-spin correlations in the binary black hole population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from compact binary mergers provide a direct measurement of luminosity distance, which, in combination with redshift information, serves as a cosmological probe. In order to statistically infer merger redshifts, the ``spectral standard siren" method relies on features, such as peaks, dips or breaks, in the compact object mass spectrum, which get redshifted in the detector-frame relative to the source-frame. However, if the source-frame location of these features evolves over cosmic time, the spectral siren measurement may be biased. Some features, such as the edges of the pair-instability supernova mass gap, may be more stable than others. We point out that binary black hole (BBH) spins, which are not redshifted in the detector-frame, provide a natural way to identify robust mass scales for spectral siren cosmology. For example, there is recent evidence for a mass scale in the BBH population that separates slowly spinning from more rapidly spinning BBH mergers, consistent with the lower edge of the pair instability gap. Applying our method to data from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's third transient catalog, we demonstrate how to isolate this mass scale and produce a robust ``spinning spectral siren" measurement of the Hubble constant: $H_0 = 85^{+99}_{-67}\,\rm{km}\, \rm{s}^{-1} \rm{Mpc}^{-1}$, or $H_0 =80^{+60}_{-46}\,\rm{km}\, \rm{s}^{-1} \rm{Mpc}^{-1}$ when combined with other mass features, such as the $\sim35\,M_\odot$ peak. We consider the possibility that the source-frame location of the $\sim35\,M_\odot$ peak evolves with redshift, and show that information from black hole spin can be used to mitigate the associated bias for self-calibrating spectral sirens.</description>

      <title>CSST Cosmological Emulator I: Matter Power Spectrum Emulation with one percent accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the near future, the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) will obtain unprecedented imaging and spectroscopic data. The statistical errors in the cosmological parameter constraints will be reduced significantly. The corresponding theoretical tools must meet the percent-level accuracy required to extract as much cosmological information as possible from the observations. We present the \texttt{CSST Emulator} to provide nonlinear power spectrum predictions in the eight cosmological parameter space $\Omega_\mathrm{cb},\Omega_\mathrm{b},H_{0},n_{s},A_{s},w_{0}, w_{a}$, and $m_\nu$. It is constructed based on the \textsc{Kun} simulation suite, consisting of 129 high-resolution simulations with box size $L=1\,h^{-1} {\rm Gpc}$ and evolving $3072^3$ particles. The determinations of parameter ranges, sampling method, and emulation strategy in the whole construction have been optimized exquisitely. This enables our prediction for $k\leq 10\,h {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $z\leq 2.0$ to reach $1\%$ accuracy validated through internal and external simulations. We also compare our results with recent \texttt{BACCO}, \texttt{EuclidEmulator2}, and \texttt{Mira-Titan IV} emulators, which demonstrate the \texttt{CSST Emulator}'s excellent performance across a wide cosmological parameter range in the nonlinear regime. \texttt{CSST Emulator} is publicly released at https://github.com/czymh/csstemu, and provides a fundamental theoretical tool for accurate cosmological inference with future CSST observations.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Hubble Constant with a Simulated Full Covariance Matrix Using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubble parameter, $H(z)$, plays a crucial role in understanding the expansion history of the universe and constraining the Hubble constant, $\mathrm{H}_0$. The Cosmic Chronometers (CC) method provides an independent approach to measuring $H(z)$, but existing studies either neglect off-diagonal elements in the covariance matrix or use an incomplete covariance matrix, limiting the accuracy of $\mathrm{H}_0$ constraints. To address this, we use a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) to simulate the full $33 \times 33$ covariance matrix based on a previously proposed $15 \times 15$ covariance matrix. We find that two key hyperparameters, epochs and batch size, significantly affect the simulation and introduce two criteria for selecting optimal values. Using the simulated covariance matrix, we constrain $\mathrm{H}_0$ via two independent methods: EMCEE and Gaussian Process. Our results show that different hyperparameter selection criteria lead to variations in the chosen combinations but have little impact on the final constrained $\mathrm{H}_0$. However, different epochs and batch size settings do affect the results. Incorporating the simulated covariance matrix increases the uncertainty in $\mathrm{H}_0$ compared to using no covariance matrix or only the proposed $15 \times 15$ covariance matrix. The comparison between EMCEE and GP suggests that the constraint method itself also influences the final $\mathrm{H}_0$. These findings highlight the importance of properly modeling covariance in CC-based $\mathrm{H}_0$ constraints.</description>

      <title>CSST Large Scale Structure Analysis Pipeline: III. Emission-line Redshift Measurement for Slitless Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The China Space Station Telescope (CSST) is a forthcoming space-based optical telescope designed to co-orbit with the Chinese Space Station. With a planned slitless spectroscopic survey spanning a broad wavelength range of $255-1000$nm and an average spectral resolution exceeding 200, the CSST holds significant potential for cosmic large-scale structure analysis. In this study, we focus on redshift determinations from slitless spectra through emission line analysis within the CSST framework. Our tailored redshift measurement process involves identifying emission lines in one-dimensional slitless spectra, aligning observed wavelengths with their rest-frame counterparts from prominent galaxy emissions, and calculating wavelength shifts to determine redshifts accurately. To validate our redshift measurement algorithm, we leverage simulated spectra generated by the CSST emulator for slitless spectroscopy. The outcomes demonstrate a remarkable redshift completeness exceeding 95 per cent for emission line galaxies (ELGs), alongside a purity surpassing 85 per cent. The redshift uncertainty remains impressively below than $\sim 0.001$. Notably, when concentrating on galaxies with more than three matched emission lines, the completeness of ELGs and the purity of measurable galaxies can reach 98 per cent and 97 per cent, respectively. Furthermore, we explore the influence of parameters like magnitude, spectral signal-to-noise ratio, and redshift on redshift completeness and purity. The discussion also delves into redshift degeneracies stemming from emission-line matching confusion. Our developed redshift measurement process will be applied to extensive simulated datasets and forthcoming CSST slitless spectroscopic observations for further cosmological and extragalactic analyses.</description>

      <title>A solution to the Hubble tension with self-interacting ultralight dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that oscillations of self-interacting ultralight dark matter with a characteristic energy scale $ \tilde{m} \simeq 1~eV $ naturally act as an extra radiation component just before the recombination era, decreasing the sound horizon radius of the photon-baryon fluid. This reduction leads to an increase in the present-day Hubble parameter, potentially resolving the Hubble tension without the need for exotic matter or energy. The required mass and quartic self-interaction coupling are consistent with current astronomical constraints, including the relic dark matter density. This model could also reduce the $S_8$ tension often associated with other early-time solutions.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of EMCEE, Gaussian Process, and Masked Autoregressive Flow in Constraining the Hubble Constant Using Cosmic Chronometers Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubble constant ($\mathrm{H}_0$) is essential for understanding the universe's evolution. Different methods, such as Affine Invariant Markov chain Monte Carlo Ensemble sampler (EMCEE), Gaussian Process (GP), and Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF), are used to constrain $\mathrm{H}_0$ using $H(z)$ data. However, these methods produce varying $\mathrm{H}_0$ values when applied to the same dataset. To investigate these differences, we compare the methods based on their sensitivity to individual data points and their accuracy in constraining $\mathrm{H}_0$. We introduce Multiple Random Sampling Analysis (MRSA) to assess their sensitivity to individual data points. Our findings reveal that GP is more sensitive to individual data points than both MAF and EMCEE, with MAF being more sensitive than EMCEE. Sensitivity also depends on redshift: EMCEE and GP are more sensitive to $H(z)$ at higher redshifts, while MAF is more sensitive at lower redshifts. For accuracy assessment, we simulate $H_{\mathrm{sim}}(z_{\mathrm{sim}})$ datasets with a prior $\mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{0prior}}$. Comparing the constrained $\mathrm{H_{0sim}}$ values with $\mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{0prior}}$ shows that EMCEE is the most accurate, followed by MAF, with GP being the least accurate, regardless of the simulation method.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Reconstruction of Non-Gaussian Initial Conditions from Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a machine learning approach to reconstructing the cosmological initial conditions from late-time dark matter halo number density fields in redshift space, with the goal of improving sensitivity to cosmological parameters, and in particular primordial non-Gaussianity. Using an U-Net architecture, our model achieves a cross-correlation accuracy of 44% for scales out to $k = 0.4 \text{ h}/\text{Mpc}$ between reconstructed and true initial conditions of Quijote 1 Gpc$^3$ simulation boxes with an average halo number density of $\bar{n} = 4\times 10^{-4}$ (h/Mpc)$^{3}$ in the tracer field at $z=0$ . We demonstrate that our reconstruction is likely to be optimal for this setup and that it is highly effective at reducing redshift-space distortions. Using a Fisher analysis, we show that reconstruction improves cosmological parameter constraints derived from the power spectrum and bispectrum. By combining the power spectrum monopole, quadrupole, and bispectrum monopole up to $k_{\rm{max}} = 0.52 \text{ h}/\text{Mpc}$, our joint analysis of pre- and post-reconstructed fields from the Quijote simulation suite finds improved marginalized errors on all cosmological parameters. In particular, reconstruction improves constraints on $f_{\rm{NL}}$ by factors of 1.33, 1.88, and 1.57 for local, equilateral, and orthogonal shapes. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of reconstruction in decoupling modes, mitigating redshift-space distortions and maximizing information on cosmology. The results provide important insights into the amount of cosmological information that can be extracted from small scales, and can potentially be used to complement standard analysis of observational data, upon further development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is always more evident that the kinematics of galaxies provide us with unique information on the Nature of the dark particles and on the properties of the galaxy Dark Matter (DM) halos. However, in investigating this topic, we have to be very careful about certain issues related to the assumptions that we take or to the practices that we follow. Here, we critically discuss such issues, that, today, result of fundamental importance, in that we have realized that the Nature of the DM will be not provided by The Theory but, has to be inferred by reverse engineering the observational scenario.</description>

      <title>Reionization and its sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reionization represents an important phase in the history of our Universe when ultraviolet radiation from the first luminous sources, primarily stars and accreting black holes, ionized the neutral hydrogen atoms in the intergalactic medium (IGM). This process follows the ``Dark Ages'', a period with no luminous sources, and is initiated by the formation of the first sources, marking the ``Cosmic Dawn''. Reionization proceeds through multiple stages: initially, ionized bubbles form around galaxies, then expand and overlap across the IGM, culminating in a fully ionized state, with neutral hydrogen remaining only in dense regions. Understanding reionization involves a diverse range of physical concepts, from large-scale structure formation and star formation to radiation propagation through the IGM. Observationally, reionization can be explored using the cosmic microwave background (CMB), Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption, high-redshift galaxy surveys, and emerging 21~cm experiments, which together offer invaluable insights into this transformative epoch.</description>

      <title>The sinusoidal valley: a recipe for high peaks in the scalar and induced tensor spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adding a sine-type interaction to inflationary models with two fields can evoke a classical trajectory with many turns in field space. Under conditions we discuss, the enhancement of the spectrum of adiabatic fluctuations resulting from each turn adds up. A special range of scales away from the CMB-constrained region can then be enhanced by several orders of magnitude, allowing for interesting phenomenological possibilities, such as induced gravitational waves or primordial black holes. A localized version of this interaction can also be used as an add-on to conventional inflationary models, thus allowing the injection of the large peak in their power spectra. The intuition and the conclusions drawn from this simple model remain relevant for more complicated applications that usually include extra terms that obscure the simplicity of the mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafaint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) are ideal for studying dark matter (DM) due to minimal baryonic effects. UFD observations suggest cored DM profiles. We find that the core radius -- stellar mass scaling predicted by fuzzy dark matter (FDM) is at $6.1\sigma$ tension with UFD observations. Combining observations from 27 UFDs, the required FDM mass $m_a = 3.2_{-0.6}^{+0.8}\times 10^{-21}\,{\rm eV}$ is also in conflict with existing Lyman-$\alpha$ bounds. Our results suggest that FDM cannot provide a consistent explanation for DM cores and imply $m_a &gt; 2.2\times 10^{-21}\,{\rm eV}$ at to $2\sigma$ CL.</description>

      <title>3D Vortices and rotating solitons in ultralight dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the formation and the dynamics of vortex lines in rotating scalar dark matter halos, focusing on models with quartic repulsive self-interactions. In the nonrelativistic regime, vortex lines and their lattices arise from the Gross-Pitaevskii equation of motion, as for superfluids and Bose-Einstein condensates studied in laboratory experiments. Indeed, in such systems vorticity is supported by the singularities of the phase of the scalar field, which leads to a discrete set of quantized vortices amid a curl-free velocity background. In the continuum limit where the number of vortex lines becomes very large, we find that the equilibrium solution is a rotating soliton that obeys a solid-body rotation, with an oblate density profile aligned with the direction of the total spin. This configuration is dynamically stable provided the rotational energy is smaller than the self-interaction and gravitational energies. Using numerical simulations in the Thomas-Fermi regime, with stochastic initial conditions for a spherical halo with a specific averaged density profile and angular momentum, we find that a rotating soliton always emerges dynamically, within a few dynamical times, and that a network of vortex lines aligned with the total spin fills its oblate profile. These vertical vortex lines form a regular lattice in the equatorial plane, in agreement with the analytical predictions of uniform vortex density and solid-body rotation. These vortex lines might further extend between halos to form the backbone of spinning cosmic filaments.</description>

      <title>The role of the counterterms in the conservation of superhorizon curvature perturbations at one loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, several papers have claimed that superhorizon curvature perturbations are not conserved at the one-loop level in single-field inflation models if there is a transient ultra-slow-roll period. In this work, we point out that the contributions from the counterterms were overlooked in the recent papers. We show that the counterterm contributions play a crucial role in canceling the one-loop power spectrum of superhorizon curvature perturbations in the comoving gauge.</description>

      <title>Deviations from the von Laue Condition: Implications for the On-Shell Lagrangian of Particles and Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to the von Laue condition, the volume integral of the proper pressure inside isolated particles with a fixed structure and finite mass vanishes in the Minkowski limit of general relativity. In this work, we consider a simple illustrative example: non-standard static global monopoles with finite energy, for which the von Laue condition is satisfied when the proper pressure is integrated over the whole space. We demonstrate, however, that the absolute value of this integral, when calculated up to a finite distance from the center of the global monopole, generally deviates from zero, and that this deviation is bounded by the energy located outside the specified volume (under the assumption of the dominant energy condition). Furthermore, we find that the maximum deviation from unity of the ratio between the volume averages of the on-shell Lagrangian and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor cannot exceed three times the outer energy fraction. Additionally, we show that, as long as the dominant energy condition holds, these constraints generally apply to real particles with fixed structure and finite mass. We discuss the implications of this result in the context of stable atomic nuclei. Specifically, we argue that, except in extremely dense environments with energy densities comparable to that of an atomic nucleus (e.g., inside neutron stars), the volume average of the aforementioned ratio for atomic nuclei should remain extremely close to unity. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for the form of the on-shell Lagrangian of real fluids. This is often a crucial element for accurately describing fluid dynamics in the presence of non-minimal couplings to other matter fields or gravity.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic power-law inflation for the S\'aez-Ballester theory non-minimally coupled to a vector field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we would like to examine whether the S\'aez-Ballester theory admits stable and attractive Bianchi type I inflationary solutions in the presence of a non-minimal coupling between scalar and vector fields such as $f^2(\phi)F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$. As a result, such a solution will be shown to exist within this theory for a suitable setup of fields. However, the corresponding tensor-to-scalar ratio of this solution turns out to be higher than the latest observational value of the Planck satellite (Planck 2018) due to the fact that $c_s$, the corresponding speed of sound of scalar perturbations of the S\'aez-Ballester theory, turns out to be one. This result indicates an important hint that the speed of sound, $c_s$, could play an important role in making the corresponding non-canonical anisotropic inflation cosmologically viable in the light of the Planck 2018 data. To be more specific, we will point out that any modifications of the S\'aez-Ballester theory having $c_s \sim 0.1$ will have a great potential to be highly consistent with the Planck 2018 data.</description>

      <title>The Halo Occupation Distribution Modeling of the X-ray-selected AGNs at 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 2.6 in the COSMOS field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conducted precise measurements of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) clustering at $z\sim1$ and $z\sim2$ by measuring the two-point cross-correlation function (CCF) between galaxies and X-ray-selected AGNs, and the two-point auto-correlation function (ACF) of galaxies in the COSMOS field to interpret the CCF results. The galaxy sample was selected from the COSMOS2015 catalog, while the AGN sample was chosen from the {\sl Chandra} COSMOS-Legacy survey catalog. For the AGN samples at $z\sim1$ and $z\sim2$, we calculated AGN bias values of $b=1.16\ (1.16;1.31)$ and $b=2.95\ (2.30;3.55)$, respectively. These values correspond to typical host dark matter halo (DMH) masses of log$(M_{\rm typ}/M_{\odot})=11.82\ (11.82;12.12)$ and log$(M_{\rm typ}/M_{\odot})=12.80\ (12.38;13.06)$, respectively. Subsequently, we performed Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) modeling of X-ray-selected AGNs using the CCF and ACF of galaxies. We have found a significant satellite AGN population at $z\sim 1$ all over the DMH mass ($M_{\rm DMH}$) range occupied by AGNs. While $z\sim 2$ AGNs in our sample are associated with higher mass DMHs and smaller satellite fractions. The HOD analysis suggests a marginal tendency of increasing satellite slope with redshift, but larger samples are needed to confirm this with sufficient statistical significance. We find that the best-fit values of satellite slope in both redshift bins are greater than 0, suggesting tendencies of increasing satellite AGN number with $M_{\rm DMH}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a pedagogical introduction to non-particle dark matter, focused on primordial black holes (PBHs), black holes that may form in the early Universe from large overdensities. First, we outline the key properties of PBHs and how they meet the requirements to be a dark matter candidate. We then overview how PBHs can form, in particular from the collapse of large density perturbations generated by inflation (a proposed period of accelerated expansion in the early Universe). Next, we describe how PBHs can be probed by observations. Finally, we conclude with a summary focused on the key open questions in the field.</description>

      <title>Determination of Hubble constant from Megamaser Cosmology Project using Profile Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Megamaser Cosmology Project inferred a value for the Hubble constant given by $H_0=73.9 \pm 3.0 $ km/sec/Mpc. This value was obtained using Bayesian inference by marginalizing over six nuisance parameters, corresponding to the velocities of the megamaser galaxy systems. We obtain an independent estimate of the Hubble constant with the same data using frequentist inference. For this purpose, we use profile likelihood to dispense with the aforementioned nuisance parameters. The frequentist estimate of the Hubble constant is given by $H_0=73.5^{+3.0}_{-2.9}$ km/sec/Mpc and agrees with the Bayesian estimate to within $0.2\sigma$, and both approaches also produce consistent confidence/credible intervals. Therefore, this analysis provides a proof of principle application of profile likelihood in dealing with nuisance parameters in Cosmology, which is complementary to Bayesian analysis.</description>

      <title>Insights from leptohadronic modelling of the brightest blazar flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The blazar 3C 454.3 experienced a major flare in November 2010 making it the brightest $\gamma$-ray source in the sky of the Fermi-LAT. We obtain seven daily consecutive spectral-energy distributions (SEDs) of the flare in the infra-red, optical, ultra-violet, X-ray and $\gamma$-ray bands with publicly available data. We simulate the physical conditions in the blazar and show that the observed SEDs are well reproduced in the framework of a "standing feature" where the position of the emitting region is almost stationary, located beyond the outer radius of the broad-line region and into which fresh blobs of relativistically moving magnetized plasma are continuously injected. Meanwhile, a model with a single "moving blob" does not describe the data well. We obtain a robust upper limit to the amount of high-energy protons in the jet of 3C 454.3 from the electromagnetic SED. We construct a neutrino light curve of 3C 454.3 and estimate the expected neutrino yield at energies $\geq 100$ TeV for 3C 454.3 to be up to $6 \times 10^{-3}$ $\nu_{\mu}$ per year. Finally, we extrapolate our model findings to the light curves of all Fermi-LAT flat-spectrum radio quasars. We find that next-generation neutrino telescopes are expected to detect approximately one multimessenger ($\gamma + \nu_{\mu}$) flare per year from bright blazars with neutrino peak energy in the hundreds TeV -- hundreds PeV energy range and show that the electromagnetic flare peak can precede the neutrino arrival by months to years.</description>

      <title>pylevin: efficient numerical integration of integrals containing up to three Bessel functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrals involving highly oscillatory Bessel functions are notoriously challenging to compute using conventional integration techniques. While several methods are available, they predominantly cater to integrals with at most a single Bessel function, resulting in specialised yet highly optimised solutions. Here we present pylevin, a Python package to efficiently compute integrals containing up to three Bessel functions of arbitrary order and arguments. The implementation makes use of Levin's method and allows for accurate and fast integration of these highly oscillatory integrals. In benchmarking pylevin against existing software for single Bessel function integrals, we find its speed comparable, usually within a factor of two, to specialised packages such as FFTLog. Furthermore, when dealing with integrals containing two or three Bessel functions, pylevin delivers performance up to four orders of magnitude faster than standard adaptive quadrature methods, while also exhibiting better stability for large Bessel function arguments. pylevin is available from source via github or directly from PyPi.</description>

      <title>Sampling the full hierarchical population posterior distribution in gravitational-wave astronomy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a full sampling of the hierarchical population posterior distribution of merging black holes using current gravitational-wave data. We directly tackle the the most relevant intrinsic parameter space made of the binary parameters (masses, spin magnitudes, spin directions, redshift) of all the events entering the GWTC-3 LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA catalog, as well as the hyperparameters of the underlying population of sources. This results in a parameter space of about 500 dimensions, in contrast with current investigations where the targeted dimensionality is drastically reduced by marginalizing over all single-event parameters. In particular, we have direct access to (i) population parameters, (ii) population-informed single-event parameters, and (iii) correlations between these two sets of parameters. Our implementation relies on modern probabilistic programming languages and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, with a continuous interpolation of single-event posterior probabilities. Sampling the full hierarchical problem is feasible, as demonstrated here, and advantageous as it removes some (but not all) of the Monte Carlo integrations that enter the likelihood together with the related variances.</description>

      <title>On the relation between cosmological redshift and fine structure constant variation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.01417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Almost a century ago, Hubble discovered the cosmological redshift of extragalactic objects. The Friedmann-Lema{\^\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric was presented as a solution of Einstein's field equations for a homogeneous and isotropic universe. The metric includes a time-dependent factor $a(t)$, intended to explain the cosmological redshift. By contrast, for the Eintein's static universe ($a=1$), no reasonable redshift explanation was found. In this work, the Cosmic Time Physics (CTP) theoretical framework is developed. CTP moves the explanation of cosmological redshift from general relativity to electromagnetism domain. We show that the vacuum electric permittivity $\epsilon_0$ and the vacuum magnetic permeability $\mu_0$ can vary inversely one each other over cosmic time, maintaining the speed of light $c$ constant, while conducting the change on the vacuum impedance $Z_0$ and on the fine structure constant $\alpha$. This variation downscales the atomic energy levels with cosmic backtime, redshifting the wavelength and frequency exactly in the same manner they are observed, while maintaining the atomic quantification relations. Note that the increase on $\alpha$ with cosmic time has gone unnoticed experimentally so far since the search is performed on rest-frame (de-redshiftted signals), in spite of the manifestation of such variation is precisely the redshift. The application of CTP to general relativity drive to an angular-redshift relation $d_A(z)$ as a function of the age of the universe $t_0$ and its curvature $R_0$. As a first approximation, we show that CTP $d_A(z)$ is able to reproduce the LCDM $d_A(z)$ curve with $R_0=1800$ Mpc and $t_0=15.57$ Gly. Finally, the Friedmann equations without scale factor ($a=1$) are used to derive the requirements for the stability of CTP universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a methodology to measure the cosmological spatial curvature by employing the deviation from statistical isotropy due to the Alcock-Paczy\'nski effect of large scale galaxy clustering. This approach has a higher degree of model independence than most other proposed methods, being independent of calibration of standard candles, rulers, or clocks, of the power spectrum shape (and thus also of the pre-recombination physics), of the galaxy bias, of the theory of gravity, of the dark energy model and of the background cosmology in general. We find that a combined DESI-Euclid galaxy survey can achieve $\Delta \Omega_{k0}=0.057$ at 1$\sigma$ C.L. in the redshift range $z&lt;2$ by combining power-spectrum and bispectrum measurements.</description>

Abstract: Voids are dominant features of the cosmic web. We revisit the cosmological information content of voids and connect void properties with the parameters of the background universe. We combine analytical results with a suite of large n-body realizations of large-scale structure in the quasilinear regime to measure the central density and radial outflow of voids. These properties, estimated from multiple voids that span a range of redshifts, provide estimates of the Hubble parameter, $\Omega_M$ and $\Omega_\Lambda$. The analysis assumes access to the full phase-space distribution of mass within voids, a dataset that is not currently observable. The observable properties of the largest void in the universe may also test models. The suite of large n-body realizations enables construction of lightcones reaching ~3,000 $h^{-1}$Mpc. Based on these lightcones, we show that large voids similar to those observed are expected in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Optimal Neural Summarisation for Full-Field Weak Lensing Cosmological Implicit Inference</title>

Abstract: Traditionally, weak lensing cosmological surveys have been analyzed using summary statistics motivated by their analytically tractable likelihoods, or by their ability to access higher-order information, at the cost of requiring Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) approaches. While informative, these statistics are neither designed nor guaranteed to be statistically sufficient. With the rise of deep learning, it becomes possible to create summary statistics optimized to extract the full data information. We compare different neural summarization strategies proposed in the weak lensing literature, to assess which loss functions lead to theoretically optimal summary statistics to perform full-field inference. In doing so, we aim to provide guidelines and insights to the community to help guide future neural-based inference analyses. We design an experimental setup to isolate the impact of the loss function used to train neural networks. We have developed the sbi_lens JAX package, which implements an automatically differentiable lognormal wCDM LSST-Y10 weak lensing simulator. The explicit full-field posterior obtained using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler gives us a ground truth to which to compare different compression strategies. We provide theoretical insight into the loss functions used in the literature and show that some do not necessarily lead to sufficient statistics (e.g. Mean Square Error (MSE)), while those motivated by information theory (e.g. Variational Mutual Information Maximization (VMIM)) can. Our numerical experiments confirm these insights and show, in our simulated wCDM scenario, that the Figure of Merit (FoM) of an analysis using neural summaries optimized under VMIM achieves 100% of the reference Omega_c - sigma_8 full-field FoM, while an analysis using neural summaries trained under MSE achieves only 81% of the same reference FoM.</description>

Abstract: The interplay between cosmology and strongly coupled dynamics can yield transient spectral features that vanish at late times, but which may leave behind phenomenological signatures in the spectrum of primordial fluctuations. Of particular interest are strongly coupled extensions of the standard model featuring approximate conformal invariance. In flat space, the spectral density for a scalar operator in a conformal field theory is characterized by a continuum with scaling law governed by the dimension of the operator, and is otherwise featureless. AdS/CFT arguments suggest that for large $N$, in an inflationary background with Hubble rate $H$, this continuum is gapped. We demonstrate that there can be additional peak structures that become sharp and particle-like at phenomenologically interesting regions in parameter space, and we estimate their contribution to cosmological observables. We find phenomena that are potentially observable in future experiments that are unique to these models, including displaced oscillatory features in the squeezed limit of the bi-spectrum. These particles can be either fundamental, and localized to a UV brane, or composite at the Hubble scale, $H$, and bound to a horizon in the bulk of the 5D geometry. We comment on how stabilization of conformal symmetry breaking vacua can be correlated with these spectral features and their phenomenology.</description>

      <title>On a model of variable curvature that mimics the observed Universe acceleration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new model based on General Relativity in where a subtle change of curvature at late times is able to produce the observed Universe acceleration and an oscillating behavior in the effective equation of state. This model aims to test the cosmological principle, by introducing a slight modification in the traditional FLRW metric, through a non-constant curvature parameter. This model is defined by a smooth step-like function with a slight transition between two curvature values, fulfilling the premise that the derivative of this curvature parameter is preserved as approximately zero, $\dot{\kappa}\approx0$. To test our model, we implemented a MCMC likelihood analysis using Cosmic Chronometers and Type Ia supernovae data in order to constrain the free parameters of the model and reconstruct $H(z)$, $q(z)$, $w_{eff}(z)$, also comparing the results with the $\Lambda$CDM model. The main result is that this model provides an alternative to the acceleration of the Universe without the need of a dark energy component. In particular, it gives an equivalent phase transition at $z \sim 0.5$, while obtaining the same fraction of matter density, similar to what is expected for the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Remarkably, it also predicts a slight decelerated state at $z=0$ in agreement with diverse Dark Energy parameterizations. We conclude that the behavior of our proposed model points towards a new and intriguing way to investigate slight violations to the cosmological principle, in particular the case of inhomogenities during low phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of high-frequency gravitational waves from graviton bremsstrahlung by the decay of inflaton: case with polynomial potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the generation of high-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) through graviton bremsstrahlung during the decay of inflaton in the post-inflationary universe, focusing on scenarios with a polynomial inflaton potential. Two main reheating channels are considered: decays into bosons (spin 0) and fermions (spin $\frac{1}{2}$). We compute the resulting GW spectra from three-body decays, where the inflaton decays into a pair of daughter particles and a graviton. We numerically compute the GW spectra for various polynomial exponents by employing two distinct approaches: one treating the inflaton as a collection of rest particles and the other treating it as a coherently oscillating classical field. In the former approach, only gravitons with energies below half the inflaton mass are produced, while the latter allows for the production of gravitons with arbitrarily high energies when the potential exponent is 4 or greater. This difference arises because the inflaton's oscillations are no longer described by a single harmonic mode but instead consist of infinitely many harmonic modes with different frequencies. As a result, the GW spectrum exhibits multiple peaks, with these peaks being less pronounced for higher powers of the potential. We also examine the dependence of the GW spectrum on the coupling constant between the inflaton and daughter particles. Our findings suggest that future GW detectors targeting GWs in the GHz band, such as resonant cavities, may have the capability to detect these signals, offering potential insights into the reheating phase of the early universe.</description>

      <title>A semi-analytic estimate for the effective sound speed counterterm in the EFTofLSS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) has found tremendous success as a perturbative framework for the evolution of large scale structure, and it is now routinely used to compare theoretical predictions against cosmological observations. The model for the total matter field includes one nuisance parameter at 1-loop order, the effective sound speed, which can be extracted by matching the EFT to full N-body simulations. In this work we first leverage the Layzer-Irvine cosmic energy equation to show that the equation of state can be exactly computed with knowledge of the fully nonlinear power spectrum. When augmented with separate universe methods, we show one can estimate the effective sound speed. This estimate is in good agreement with simulation results, with errors at the few tens of percent level. We apply our method to investigate the cosmology dependence of the effective sound speed and to shed light on what cosmic structures shape its value.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Mean Free Path of HI Ionizing Photons at $3.2\leq z\leq4.6$ with DESI Y1 Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15838v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mean free path of ionizing photons ($\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}^{912}$) in the intergalactic medium (IGM) is a crucial quantity in modelling the ionization state of IGM and the extragalactic ultraviolet background (EUVB), and is widely used in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies and reionization. We construct the largest quasar spectrum dataset to date -- 12,595 $\mathrm{S/N}&gt;3$ spectra -- using the Y1 observation of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) to make the most precise model-independent measurement of the mean free path at $3.2\leq z\leq 4.6$. By stacking the spectra in 17 redshift bins and modelling the Lyman continuum profile, we get a redshift evolution $\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}^{912}\propto(1+z)^{-4.27}$ at $2\leq z\leq 5$, which is much shallower than previous estimate $\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}^{912}\propto(1+z)^{-5.4}$. We then explore the sources of systematic bias, including the choice of intrinsic quasar continuum, the consideration of Lyman series opacity and Lyman limit opacity evolution and the definition of $\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}^{912}$. Combining our results with estimates of $\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}^{912}$ at higher redshifts, we conclude at high confidence that the evolution in $\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}^{912}$ steepens at $z \approx 5$. We interpret this inflection as the transition from the end of HI reionization to a fully ionized plasma which characterizes the intergalactic medium of the past $\sim10$ billion years.</description>

      <title>Practical photonic band gap structures for high frequency axion haloscopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current and future searches for dark matter axions, based on their resonant conversion to photons in a magnetic field, span many orders of magnitude. A major impediment to designing resonators at the high end of this range, 5 GHz and above, is the proliferation of TE modes, which overwhelm and hybridize with the TM010 mode to which the axion couples, making the search impossible. We demonstrate that a photonic band gap structure can be designed that completely suppresses the TE spectrum, even reducing the number of lattice periods to two or one, and violating perfect lattice symmetry. This allows tunable resonators to be designed in a convenient, volumetrically efficient circular geometry thus enabling future searches in the post-inflation axion mass range.</description>

      <title>Compressed 'CMB-lite' Likelihoods Using Automatic Differentiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The compression of multi-frequency cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectrum measurements into a series of foreground-marginalised CMB-only band powers allows for the construction of faster and more easily interpretable 'lite' likelihoods. However, obtaining the compressed data vector is computationally expensive and yields a covariance matrix with sampling noise. In this work, we present an implementation of the CMB-lite framework relying on automatic differentiation. The technique presented reduces the computational cost of the lite likelihood construction to one minimisation and one Hessian evaluation, which run on a personal computer in about a minute. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of this procedure by applying it to the differentiable SPT-3G 2018 TT/TE/EE likelihood from the candl library. We find good agreement between the marginalised posteriors of cosmological parameters yielded by the resulting lite likelihood and the reference multi-frequency version for all cosmological models tested; the best-fit values shift by $&lt;0.1\,\sigma$, where $\sigma$ is the width of the multi-frequency posterior, and the inferred parameter error bars match to within $&lt;10\%$. We publicly release the SPT-3G 2018 TT/TE/EE lite likelihood and a python notebook showing its construction at https://github.com/Lbalkenhol/candl .</description>

      <title>Exploring cosmological imprints of phantom crossing with dynamical dark energy in Horndeski gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the current era of precision cosmology, the persistence of cosmological tensions, most notably the Hubble tension and the $S_8$ tension, challenges the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. To reconcile these tensions via late-time modifications to expansion history, various features such as phantom crossing in the dark energy equation of state, a negative energy density at high redshifts, etc., are favoured. However, these scenarios cannot be realized within the framework of GR without introducing ghost or gradient instabilities. In this work, we investigate a dynamical dark energy scenario within the framework of Horndeski gravity, incorporating nonminimal coupling to gravity and self-interactions. We highlight that the model can exhibit novel features like phantom crossing and negative dark energy densities at high redshifts without introducing any instabilities. For this specific Horndeski model, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the background evolution along with the effects on perturbations, examining observables like growth rate, matter and CMB power spectrum. To check the consistency of the model with the observational data, we employ MCMC analysis using BAO/$f\sigma_8$, Supernovae, and CMB data. While the model does not outperform the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework in a combined likelihood analysis, there remains a preference for non-zero values of the model parameters within the data. This suggests that dynamical dark energy scenarios, particularly those with non-minimal couplings, merit further exploration as promising alternatives to GR, offering rich phenomenology that can be tested against a broader range of current and upcoming observational datasets.</description>

      <title>Interference in Fuzzy Dark Matter Filaments: Idealised Models and Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fuzzy (wave) dark matter (FDM), the dynamical model underlying an ultralight bosonic dark matter species, produces a rich set of non-gravitational signatures that distinguishes it markedly from the phenomenologically related warm (particle) dark matter (WDM) scenario. The emergence of extended interference fringes hosted by cosmic filaments is one such phenomenon reported by cosmological simulations, and a detailed understanding of such may strengthen existing limits on the boson mass but also break the degeneracy with WDM, and provide a unique fingerprint of interference in cosmology. In this paper, we provide initial steps towards this goal. In particular, we show in a bottom-up approach, how the presence of interference in an idealised filament population can lead to a non-suppressive feature in the matter power spectrum -- an observation supported by fully-cosmological FDM simulations. To this end, we build on a theoretically motivated and numerically observed steady-state approximation for filaments and express the equilibrium dynamics of such in an expansion of FDM eigenstates. We optimise the size of the expansion by incorporating classical phase-space information. Ellipsoidal collapse considerations are used to construct a fuzzy filament mass function which, together with the reconstructed FDM wave function, allow us to efficiently compute the one-filament power spectrum. We showcase our non-perturbative interference model for a selection of boson masses and confirm our approach is able to produce the matter power boost observed in fully-cosmological FDM simulations. More precisely, we find an excess in correlation between the spatial scale associated with the FDM ground state and the quantum pressure scale. We speculate about applications of this effect in data analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive comparison of different Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods, evaluating their performance on both standard test problems and cosmological parameter estimation. Our analysis includes traditional Metropolis-Hastings MCMC, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), slice sampling, nested sampling as implemented in dynesty, and PolyChord. We examine samplers through multiple metrics including runtime, memory usage, effective sample size, and parameter accuracy, testing their scaling with dimension and response to different probability distributions. While all samplers perform well with simple Gaussian distributions, we find that HMC and nested sampling show advantages for more complex distributions typical of cosmological problems. Traditional MCMC and slice sampling become less efficient in higher dimensions, while nested methods maintain accuracy but at higher computational cost. In cosmological applications using BAO data, we observe similar patterns, with particular challenges arising from parameter degeneracies and poorly constrained parameters.</description>

Abstract: We show that the superhorizon-limit curvature perturbations are conserved at one-loop level in single-field inflation models with a transient non-slow-roll period. We take the spatially-flat gauge, where the backreaction plays a crucial role for the conservation of superhorizon curvature perturbations unless the counter terms are tuned. We calculate the backreaction with the in-in formalism. In addition, we explicitly show the renormalization of the UV divergences with the counter terms.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from First-Order Phase Transition in the xSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supercooled first-order phase transition (FOPT) can lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). This scenario imposes stringent requirements on the profile of the effective potential. In this work, we use the singlet extended Standard Model (xSM) as a benchmark model to investigate this possibility at the electroweak scale. The PBHs formed during a supercooled FOPT have a narrow mass distribution around the mass of Earth. This distribution is closely tied to the temperature at which the PBHs form, corresponding to the FOPT at the electroweak scale. This scenario can be probed with microlensing experiments, space-based gravitational wave detectors, and collider experiments. Remarkably, the future space-based gravitational wave detector LISA will hold the potential to either confirm this PBH scenario in the xSM or completely rule it out for extremely small total dark matter fraction made of PBHs, down to $f_{\rm PBH}&gt; 10^{-300}$. Interestingly, our findings suggest that PBHs within the xSM framework may align with observations of the six ultrashort timescale events reported by the OGLE microlensing experiment.</description>

      <title>GA-NIFS: Multi-phase analysis of a star-forming galaxy at $z \sim 5.5$</title>

Abstract: In this study, we present a detailed multiphase analysis of HZ4, a main-sequence star-forming galaxy at z ~ 5.5, known for being a turbulent rotating disk and having a detection of a [CII] outflow in the ALMA observations. We exploit JWST/NIRSpec observations in the integral field spectroscopy mode with low- and high-spectral resolution that allow us for the first time to spatially resolve the rest-frame UV and optical emission of the galaxy to investigate the galaxy properties. In particular, the high-resolution dataset allows us to study the kinematics of the ionized gas phase, and the conditions of the interstellar medium, such as the excitation mechanism, dust attenuation, and metallicity. The lower-spectral resolution observations allow us to study the continuum emission and infer the stellar populations' ages and properties. Our findings suggest that HZ4 is a galaxy merger rather than a rotating disk as previously inferred from lower resolution [CII] data. The merger is associated with an extended broad, blueshifted emission, potentially indicative of an outflow originating from a region of intense star formation and extending up to 4 kpc. In light of these new observations we reanalyzed the ALMA data to compare the multiphase gas properties. If we interpret the broad components seen in [CII] and [OIII]$\lambda$5007\.A as outflows, the neutral and ionized components are co-spatial, the mass loading factor of the ionized phase is significantly lower than that of the neutral phase, aligning with trends observed in multi-phase systems at lower redshifts. Nonetheless, additional observations and larger statistical samples are essential to determine the role of mergers and outflows in the early Universe and to clarify the origin of the broad emission components observed in this system.</description>

      <title>Dipolar fluence distribution of statistically isotropic FERMI gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigated the large-angle distribution of the gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) from the updated FERMI/GBM catalog to probe the statistical isotropy of these astrophysical transient events. We also studied the angular distribution of the GRB fluence as a way to explore whether this radiative feature shows some preferred direction on the sky that suggest their origin. Our model-independent approach performed a directional analysis of the updated FERMI/GBM catalog. The statistical significance of our results is obtained by comparison with a large set of statistically isotropic samples of cosmic objects, with the same features of the FERMI data. Our analyses confirm that the angular distribution of the FERMIGRB is statistically isotropic on the celestial sphere. Moreover, analyzing the directional distribution of the FERMIGRB fluence, that is, the median GRB fluence in a set of directions that scans the celestial sphere, we found that this astrophysical property exhibits a net dipolar structure with a directional preference for latitudes near the Galactic plane. However, additional studies show that this directional preference is not correlated with the Milky Way Galactic plane, which suggests that the GRB dataset, and its fluence dipolar structure, are extra-Galactic in origin. Interestingly, the analyses of the BATSE Channel 4 fluence data, that is, those GRBs from BATSE with energy $&gt;$ 300 keV, reveal that its dipole direction is very well aligned with the cosmic microwave background dipole.</description>

      <title>Gravitational radiation from binary systems in Unimodular gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02909v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unimodular gravity (UG) is classically considered identical to General Relativity (GR). However, due to restricted diffeomorphism symmetry, the Bianchi identites do not lead to the conservation of energy-momentum tensor. Thus, the conservation of energy-momentum tensor needs to be separately assumed in order to reconcile with GR. Relaxing this assumption, one finds that the conservation violation can lead to differences with GR, which can be subsequently examined in astrophysical and cosmological scenarios. To this end, we examine the predictions of UG in the context of binary systems emitting gravitational radiation. Primarily, we show how the field equations involve a diffusion function which quantifies the measure of non-conservation. Due to this violation, the dispersion relation is modified. Incorporating these changes, we provide an expression for the energy loss by the binaries, which reduces to Peters-Mathews result in the GR limit. Using binary pulsar data, we constrain the theory parameter $\zeta$ (which signifies non-conservation) by determining the rate of orbital decay. The strongest constrain on $\zeta$ comes out to be $\vert \zeta \vert \leq 5\times 10^{-4}$ which is better by an order of magnitude than an existing equivalent constraint coming from the tidal deformability of the neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Fading Light, Fierce Winds: JWST Snapshot of a Sub-Eddington Quasar at Cosmic Dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The majority of most luminous quasars during the epoch of reionization accrete near or above the Eddington limit, marking the vigorous growth of primitive supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, their subsequent evolution and environmental impact remain poorly characterized. We present JWST/NIRSpec prism IFU observations of HSC J2239+0207, a low-luminosity quasar at $z\sim6.25$ likely in a late stage of mass assembly with an overmassive SMBH relative to its host galaxy. Using H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$ broad emission lines, we estimate an SMBH mass $M_{\rm BH}\sim3\times10^8~M_{\odot}$ and confirm its sub-Eddington accretion at $\lambda_{\rm Edd}\sim0.4$. Strong FeII emission and a proximity zone of typical size suggest a metal-rich, highly evolved system. In the far-UV, this quasar presents strong broad-absorption-line features, indicative of high-velocity winds ($\nu\sim10^4~{\rm km/s}$). Meanwhile, minimal dust reddening is inferred from the quasar continuum and broad-line Balmer decrement, suggesting little dust along the polar direction. Most interestingly, we identify a gas companion $\sim$5 kpc from the quasar with a high [OIII]/H$\beta$ ratio ($\gtrsim10$), likely representing outflowing gas blown away by AGN feedback. These results highlight HSC J2239+0207 as a likely fading quasar in transition, providing rare insights into SMBH evolution, AGN feedback, and AGN-galaxy interactions in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Secluded and Catalyzed Annihilation Dark Matter with Fermi-LAT and Planck Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a dark matter (DM) model with a complex scalar charged under a hidden gauge symmetry, denoted as $U(1)_D$. The scalar field is the DM candidate while the $U(1)_D$ gauge field $A'$ plays the role of a mediator, which connects the dark sector to the standard model (SM) sector via a tiny kinetic mixing. We find that both the secluded and catalyzed annihilation scenarios can be realized in this model. The phenomenology of DM, including relic density, indirect detection (Fermi-LAT), and CMB (Planck) constraints, is discussed. We also extend our discussion to DM with other spins, including Dirac fermion and vector boson. Our analysis is carried out in two models, denoted as $U(1)_D \times U(1)_Y$ and $U(1)_D \times U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$, with the former corresponding to $A'$ kinetically mixing with the $U(1)_Y$ gauge field $B$ and the latter corresponding to $A'$ mixing with the $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge field $Z'$. We find that, in previous studies, the indirect detection limits were overly restrictive because they only considered the simplified $2\mathrm{DM} \to 2\mathrm{SM}$ annihilation channel. In contrast, by performing a complete calculation of the gamma-ray and CMB constraints from the process $2\mathrm{DM} \to 2A' \to 4\mathrm{SM}$ in the models we consider, we observe weaker constraints in both the $U(1)_D \times U(1)_Y$ and $U(1)_D \times U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ models, with the $U(1)_D \times U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ model being subject to the weakest constraints overall since it involves less hadronic decay processes.</description>

      <title>The Spectrum of Global Axion Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The post-inflationary Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry breaking scenario provides a unique opportunity to pinpoint the QCD axion dark matter mass, which is a crucial input for laboratory experiments that are designed for probing specific mass ranges. Predicting their mass requires a precise knowledge of how axions are produced from the decay of topological defects in the early Universe that are inevitably formed.
  In this contribution, we present recent results on the analysis of the spectrum of axions radiated from global strings based on large scale numerical simulations of the cosmological evolution of the PQ field on a static lattice.
  We highlight several systematic effects that have been overlooked in previous works, such as the dependence on the initial conditions, contaminations due to oscillations in the spectrum, and discretisation effects; some of which could explain the discrepancy in the current literature.
  Taking these uncertainties into account and performing the extrapolation to cosmologically relevant string tensions, we find that the dark matter mass is predicted to be in the range of $95\,\mu\text{eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 450 \, \mu\text{eV}$, which will be probed by some of the next generation direct detection experiments.</description>
