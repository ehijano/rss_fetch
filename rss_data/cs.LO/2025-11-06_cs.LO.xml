      <title>FATE: A Formal Benchmark Series for Frontier Algebra of Multiple Difficulty Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02872v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in formal theorem proving, particularly on contest-based mathematical benchmarks like the IMO. However, these contests do not reflect the depth, breadth, and abstraction of modern mathematical research. To bridge this gap, we introduce FATE (Formal Algebra Theorem Evaluation), a new benchmark series in formal algebra designed to chart a course toward advanced mathematical reasoning. We present two new components, FATE-H and FATE-X, each with 100 problems in abstract and commutative algebra. The FATE series spans a difficulty spectrum from undergraduate exercises to problems exceeding PhD qualifying exams. Notably, FATE-X is the first formal benchmark to surpass both PhD-level exam difficulty and the coverage of the Mathlib library. Our evaluations of state-of-the-art LLM provers on this new benchmark reveal a stark performance gap compared to contest math: the best model achieves only 3% (pass@64) accuracy on FATE-H and 0% on FATE-X. Our two-stage evaluation reveals that models' natural-language reasoning is notably more accurate than their ability to formalize this reasoning. We systematically classify the common errors that arise during this formalization process. Furthermore, a comparative study shows that a specialized prover can exhibit less effective reflection than general-purpose models, reducing its accuracy at the natural-language stage. We believe FATE provides a robust and challenging benchmark that establishes essential checkpoints on the path toward research-level formal mathematical reasoning.</description>

      <title>Kuroda's Translation for Higher-Order Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1951, Kuroda defined an embedding of classical first-order logic into intuitionistic logic, such that a formula and its translation are equivalent in classical logic. Recently, Brown and Rizkallah extended this translation to higher-order logic, but did not prove the classical equivalence, and showed that the embedding fails in the presence of functional extensionality. We prove that functional extensionality and propositional extensionality are sufficient to derive the classical equivalence between a higher-order formula and its translation. We emphasize a condition under which Kuroda's translation works with functional extensionality.</description>

      <title>A Proof-Theoretic Approach to the Semantics of Classical Linear Logic (Technical Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08349v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear logic (LL) is a resource-aware, abstract logic programming language that refines both classical and intuitionistic logic. Linear logic semantics is typically presented in one of two ways: by associating each formula with the set of all contexts that can be used to prove it (e.g. phase semantics) or by assigning meaning directly to proofs (e.g. coherence spaces).
  This work proposes a different perspective on assigning meaning to proofs by adopting a proof-theoretic perspective. More specifically, we employ base-extension semantics (BeS) to characterise proofs through the notion of base support.
  Recent developments have shown that BeS is powerful enough to capture proof-theoretic notions in structurally rich logics such as intuitionistic linear logic. In this paper, we extend this framework to the classical case, presenting a proof-theoretic approach to the semantics of the multiplicative-additive fragment of linear logic (MALL).</description>

      <title>Forward and Backward Simulations for Partially Observable Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08437v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data refinement is the standard extension of a refinement relation from programs to datatypes (i.e. a behavioural subtyping relation). Forward/backward simulations provide a tractable method for establishing data refinement, and have been thoroughly studied for nondeterministic programs. However, for standard models of mixed probability and nondeterminism, ordinary assignment statements may not commute with (variable-disjoint) program fragments. This (1) invalidates a key assumption underlying the soundness of simulations, and (2) prevents modelling probabilistic datatypes with encapsulated state.
  We introduce a weakest precondition semantics for Kuifje$_\sqcap$, a language for partially observable Markov decision processes, using so-called loss (function) transformers. We prove soundness of forward/backward simulations in this richer setting, modulo healthiness conditions with a remarkable duality: forward simulations cannot leak information, and backward simulations cannot exploit leaked information.</description>

      <title>A Unified Formal Theory on the Logical Limits of Symbol Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper synthesizes a series of formal proofs to construct a unified theory on the logical limits of the Symbol Grounding Problem. We demonstrate through a four-stage argument that meaning within a formal system must arise from a process that is external, dynamic, and non-algorithmic. First, we prove that any purely symbolic system, devoid of external connections, cannot internally establish a consistent foundation for meaning due to self-referential paradoxes. Second, we extend this limitation to systems with any finite, static set of pre-established meanings, proving they are inherently incomplete. Third, we demonstrate that the grounding process is logically incomplete; specifically, the 'act' of connecting internal symbols to novel, emergent external meanings cannot be a product of logical inference within the system but must be an axiomatic, meta-level update. Finally, we prove that any attempt to automate this update process using a fixed, external "judgment" algorithm will inevitably construct a larger, yet equally incomplete, symbolic system. Together, these conclusions formally establish that the grounding of meaning is a necessarily open-ended, non-algorithmic process, revealing a fundamental, G\"odel-style limitation for any self-contained intelligent system.</description>

      <title>A Foundational Theory of Quantitative Abstraction: Adjunctions, Duality, and Logic for Probabilistic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analysis and control of stochastic dynamical systems rely on probabilistic models such as (continuous-space) Markov decision processes, but large or continuous state spaces make exact analysis intractable and call for principled quantitative abstraction. This work develops a unified theory of such abstraction by integrating category theory, coalgebra, quantitative logic, and optimal transport, centred on a canonical $\varepsilon$-quotient of the behavioral pseudo-metric with a universal property: among all abstractions that collapse behavioral differences below $\varepsilon$, it is the most detailed, and every other abstraction achieving the same discounted value-loss guarantee factors uniquely through it. Categorically, a quotient functor $Q_\varepsilon$ from a category of probabilistic systems to a category of metric specifications admits, via the Special Adjoint Functor Theorem, a right adjoint $R_\varepsilon$, yielding an adjunction $Q_\varepsilon \dashv R_\varepsilon$ that formalizes a duality between abstraction and realization; logically, a quantitative modal $\mu$-calculus with separate reward and transition modalities is shown, for a broad class of systems, to be expressively complete for the behavioral pseudo-metric, with a countable fully abstract fragment suitable for computation. The theory is developed coalgebraically over Polish spaces and the Giry monad and validated on finite-state models using optimal-transport solvers, with experiments corroborating the predicted contraction properties and structural stability and aligning with the theoretical value-loss bounds, thereby providing a rigorous foundation for quantitative state abstraction and representation learning in probabilistic domains.</description>

      <title>The Skolem Problem in rings of positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Skolem Problem is decidable in finitely generated commutative rings of positive characteristic. More precisely, we show that there exists an algorithm which, given a finite presentation of a (unitary) commutative ring $\mathcal{R} = \mathbb{Z}_{/T}[X_1, \ldots, X_n]/I$ of characteristic $T &gt; 0$, and a linear recurrence sequence $(\gamma_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \in \mathcal{R}^{\mathbb{N}}$, determines whether $(\gamma_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ contains a zero term. Our proof is based on two recent results: Dong and Shafrir (2025) on the solution set of S-unit equations over $p^e$-torsion modules, and Karimov, Luca, Nieuwveld, Ouaknine, and Worrell (2025) on solving linear equations over powers of two multiplicatively independent numbers. Our result implies, moreover, that the zero set of a linear recurrence sequence over a ring of characteristic $T = p_1^{e_1} \cdots p_k^{e_k}$ is effectively a finite union of $p_i$-normal sets in the sense of Derksen (2007).</description>

      <title>A note reviewing Turing's 1936</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0497</link>
      <description>arXiv:1308.0497v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By closely rereading the original Turing's 1936 article, we can gain insight about that it is based on the claim to have defined a number which is not computable, arguing that there can be no machine computing the diagonal on the enumeration of the computable sequences. This article provides a careful analysis of Turing's original argument, demonstrating that it cannot be regarded as a conclusive proof. Furthermore, it shows that there is no evidence supporting the existence of a defined number that is not computable.</description>

      <title>Universal Proof Theory, TACL 2022 Lecture Notes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10888v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These lecture notes survey the emerging area of Universal Proof Theory, which investigates general questions about the existence, equivalence, and characterization of good proof systems for broad classes of logics. In particular, the notes concentrate on the existence problem: for which logics do there exist proof systems satisfying desirable meta-properties (e.g. cut elimination, analyticity, termination)? After a brief historical and conceptual introduction, we survey different flavours of proof theory (Hilbert systems, natural deduction, sequent calculi) in the context of classical, intuitionistic, modal, and substructural logics. We then develop a general method for obtaining positive and negative existence results, based on interpolation and uniform interpolation techniques, and apply it to a range of logics (intermediate, modal, non-normal, conditional, and substructural). We also discuss variations of the method. As these are lecture notes, proofs are often sketched or omitted, with pointers to papers containing the full proofs. The survey thus aims to chart the scope and challenges of Universal Proof Theory for future work.</description>
