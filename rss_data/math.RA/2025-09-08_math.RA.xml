      <title>Regularity and $\mathsf{K}_0$-Regularity under Finiteness Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this work is to investigate various notions of regularity from the perspective of finiteness conditions, with the ultimate goal of identifying broad classes of rings that are $\mathsf{K}_0$-regular. In this direction, we revisit the classical concepts of coherence and von Neumann regularity, and establish new characterizations. We then focus on the study of \emph{$n$-coherent regular rings}, recently introduced in [31], and analyze their $\mathsf{K}$-theoretic behavior. Finally, we present applications illustrating how these approaches provide examples of $\mathsf{K}_0$-regular rings.</description>

      <title>The approach of cluster symmetry to Diophantine equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02005v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to employ a cluster-theoretic approach to provide a class of Diophantine equations whose solutions can be obtained by starting from initial solutions through mutations.
  We establish a novel framework bridging cluster theory and Diophantine equations through the lens of cluster symmetry. On the one hand, we give the necessary and sufficient condition for Laurent polynomials to remain invariant under a given cluster symmetric map. On the other hand, we construct a discriminant algorithm to determine whether a given Laurent polynomial has cluster symmetry and whether it can be realized in a generalized cluster algebra.
  As applications of this framework, we solve Markov-cluster equations, describe three classes of invariant Laurent polynomial rings, resolve two questions posed by Gyoda and Matsushita, and lastly give two MATLAB programs about our main theorems.</description>

      <title>Virtually Gorenstein algebras of infinite dominant dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by understanding the Nakayama conjecture which states that algebras of infinite dominant dimension should be self-injective, we study self-orthogonal modules with virtually Gorenstein endomorphism algebras and prove the following result: Given a finitely generated, self-orthogonal module over an Artin algebra with an orthogonal condition on its Nakayama translation, if its endomorphism algebra is virtually Gorenstein, then the module is projective. As a consequence, we re-obtain a recent result: the Nakayama conjecture holds true for the class of strongly Morita, virtually Gorenstein algebras. Finally, we show that virtually Gorenstein algebras can be constructed from Frobenius extensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the $\tau$-Hochschild (co)homology of a finite dimensional associative algebra $\Lambda$ by means of the higher Auslander-Reiten translate of O. Iyama. We show that the global dimension of $\Lambda$, Happel's question and Han's conjecture are related to the $\tau$-Hochschild (co)homology.</description>

      <title>Restricted graph Lie algebras in even characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate restricted Lie algebras arising as analogues of (twisted) right-angled Artin groups and right-angled Coxeter groups over fields of characteristic two. These algebras are defined via quadratic relations determined by decorated graphs. We compute their cohomology rings with trivial coefficients and uncover phenomena specific to characteristic two: unlike in zero/odd characteristics, where quadratically defined ordinary and restricted Lie algebras have equivalent cohomology theories, the characteristic two case exhibits dependence on the base field. In particular, we prove that the ground field being the prime field $\mathbb F_2$ characterizes when a Lie-theoretic analogue of the twisted Droms theorem holds. Generalizations of graph Lie algebras are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum group deformations and quantum $ R $-(co)matrices vs. Quantum Duality Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15096v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we describe the effect on quantum groups -- namely, both QUEA's and QFSHA's -- of deformations by twist and by 2-cocycles, showing how such deformations affect the semiclassical limit. As a second, more important task, we discuss how these deformation procedures can be "stretched" to a new extent, via a formal variation of the original recipes, using "polar twists" and "polar 2-cocycles". These recipes seemingly should make no sense at all, yet we prove that they actually work, thus providing well-defined, more general deformation procedures. Later on, we explain the underlying reason that motivates such a result in light of the "Quantum Duality Principle", through which every "polar twist/2-cocycle" for a given quantum group can be seen as a standard twist/2-cocycle for another quantum group, associated to the original one via the appropriate Drinfeld functor. As a third task, we consider standard constructions involving $R$-(co)matrices in the general theory of Hopf algebras. First we adapt them to quantum groups, then we show that they extend to the case of "polar $R$-(co)matrices", and finally we discuss how these constructions interact with the Quantum Duality Principle. As a byproduct, this yields new special symmetries (isomorphisms) for the underlying pair of dual Poisson (formal) groups that one gets by specialization.</description>

      <title>Bilinear maps having Jordan product property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study symmetric continuous bilinear maps $V$ on a C$^*$-algebra $A$ that have the Jordan product property at a fixed element $z\in A$. We show that, whenever $A$ is a finite direct sum or a $c_0$-sum of infinite simple von Neumann algebras, such a map $V$ has the square-zero property. Then, it is proved that $V(a,b)=T(a\circ b)$ for some bounded linear map $T$ on $A$. As a consequence, Jordan homomorphisms and derivations at $z\in A$ are characterized.</description>

      <title>Totally Disconnected (non-metric) Gelfand Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize those algebras over a disconnected uniformly complete topological field which are representable as algebras of continuous functions on compact topological spaces, generalizing thus Gelfand duality for non-archimedean normed fields (Van der Put theorem). More generally, we establish for any topological field F a (dual) adjunction between the category of compact F-Tychonoff spaces and a natural category of commutative F-algebras, which becomes a duality for fields satisfying the Stone-Weierstrass theorem. To obtain these results we do not utilize analytic tools, but the canonical group uniformity of the field and intrinsic properties of the algebras.</description>
