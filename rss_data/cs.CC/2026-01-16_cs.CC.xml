      <title>Correspondences in computational and dynamical complexity II: forcing complex reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An algebraic telic problem is a decision problem in $\textsf{NP}_\mathbb{R}$ formalizing finite-time reachability questions for one-dimensional dynamical systems. We prove that the existence of "natural" mapping reductions between algebraic telic problems coming from distinct dynamical systems implies the two dynamical systems exhibit similar behavior (in a precise sense). As a consequence, we obtain explicit barriers for algorithms solving algebraic telic problems coming from complex dynamical systems, such as those with positive topological entropy. For example, some telic problems cannot be decided by uniform arithmetic circuit families with only $+$ and $\times$ gates.</description>

      <title>Optimal Proximity Gap for Folded Reed--Solomon Codes via Subspace Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A collection of sets satisfies a $(\delta,\varepsilon)$-proximity gap with respect to some property if for every set in the collection, either (i) all members of the set are $\delta$-close to the property in (relative) Hamming distance, or (ii) only a small $\varepsilon$-fraction of members are $\delta$-close to the property.
  In a seminal work, Ben-Sasson \textit{et al.}\ showed that the collection of affine subspaces exhibits a $(\delta,\varepsilon)$-proximity gap with respect to the property of being Reed--Solomon (RS) codewords with $\delta$ up to the so-called Johnson bound for list decoding. Their technique relies on the Guruswami--Sudan list decoding algorithm for RS codes, which is guaranteed to work in the Johnson bound regime.
  Folded Reed--Solomon (FRS) codes are known to achieve the optimal list decoding radius $\delta$, a regime known as capacity. Moreover, a rich line of list decoding algorithms was developed for FRS codes. It is then natural to ask if FRS codes can be shown to exhibit an analogous $(\delta,\varepsilon)$-proximity gap, but up to the so-called optimal capacity regime. We answer this question in the affirmative (and the framework naturally applies more generally to suitable subspace-design codes).
  An additional motivation to understand proximity gaps for FRS codes is the recent results [BCDZ'25] showing that they exhibit properties similar to random linear codes, which were previously shown to be related to properties of RS codes with random evaluation points in [LMS'25], as well as codes over constant-size alphabet based on AEL [JS'25].</description>

      <title>Constant-Depth Unitary Preparation of Dicke States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dicke states serve as a critical resource in quantum metrology, communication, and computation. However, unitary preparation of Dicke states is limited to logarithmic depth in standard circuit models and existing constant-depth protocols require measurement and feed-forward. In this work, we present the first unitary, constant-depth protocols for exact Dicke state preparation. We overcome the logarithmic-depth barrier by moving beyond the standard circuit model and leveraging global interactions (native to architectures such as neutral atoms and trapped ions). Specifically, utilizing unbounded CZ gates (i.e. within the QAC$^0$ circuit class), we offer circuits for exact computation of constant-weight Dicke states, using polynomial ancillae, and approximation of weight-1 Dicke states (i.e. $W$ states), using only constant ancillae. Granted additional access to the quantum FAN-OUT operation (i.e. upgrading to the QAC$_f^0$ circuit class), we also achieve exact preparation of arbitrary-weight Dicke states, with polynomial ancillae. These protocols distinguish the constant-depth capabilities of quantum architectures based on connectivity and offer a novel path toward resolving a long-standing quantum complexity conjecture.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuit complexity and unsupervised machine learning of topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the close relationship between Kolmogorov complexity and unsupervised machine learning, we explore quantum circuit complexity, an important concept in quantum computation and quantum information science, as a pivot to understand and to build interpretable and efficient unsupervised machine learning for topological order in quantum many-body systems. We argue that Nielsen's quantum circuit complexity represents an intrinsic topological distance between topological quantum many-body phases of matter, and as such plays a central role in interpretable manifold learning of topological order. To span a bridge from conceptual power to practical applicability, we present two theorems that connect Nielsen's quantum circuit complexity for the quantum path planning between two arbitrary quantum many-body states with quantum Fisher complexity (Bures distance) and entanglement generation, respectively. Leveraging these connections, fidelity-based and entanglement-based similarity measures or kernels, which are more practical for implementation, are formulated. Using the two proposed distance measures, unsupervised manifold learning of quantum phases of the bond-alternating XXZ spin chain, the ground state of Kitaev's toric code and random product states, is conducted, demonstrating their superior performance. Moreover, we find that the entanglement-based approach, which captures the long-range structure of quantum entanglement of topological orders, is more robust to local Haar random noises. Relations with classical shadow tomography and shadow kernel learning are also discussed, where the latter can be naturally understood from our approach. Our results establish connections between key concepts and tools of quantum circuit computation, quantum complexity, quantum metrology, and machine learning of topological quantum order.</description>
