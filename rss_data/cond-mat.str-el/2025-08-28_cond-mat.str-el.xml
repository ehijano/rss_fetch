      <title>No-go theorem for single time-reversal invariant symmetry-protected Dirac fermions in 3+1d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a general method, known as anomaly-matching, to derive new no-go theorems of fermionic lattice models. For our main result, we show that time-reversal invariant 3+1d lattice systems (such as Dirac and Weyl semimetals) can never admit a lone low-energy symmetry-protected Dirac fermion (or node), i.e., it must always come in higher muliplets or be fine-tuned. This theorem holds for both non-interacting and interacting systems as long as the electromagnetic $U(1)_{V,{\rm UV}}$ symmetry is a normal subgroup of the microscopic symmetry group $G_{\mathrm{UV}}$; a condition that is ubiquitous in physical $U(1)_{V,{\rm UV}}$ preserving lattice models. To show that our theorems are tight, we also explore both well-known and new systems that are converses of the no-go theorem, obtained by forfeiting certain assumptions such as a broken time-reversal symmetry (magnetic Weyl semimetal), a non-compact non-on-site $U(1)$ (almost local Dirac node model), no-symmetry protection (fine-tuned Dirac semimetal), or multiple low-energy Dirac nodes (time-reversal invariant Weyl and Dirac semimetals). We will also explicitly demonstrate that, while this theorem strictly prohibits single time-reversal invariant symmetry-protected Dirac node, it does allow for other odd numbers of Dirac nodes under certain circumstances, such as three Dirac nodes in the Fu-Kane-Mele diamond lattice model. This is akin to the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem for an odd number of differently-charged chiral fermions, whose lattice realizations are allowed if certain anomaly cancellation conditions are met.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics in a split Hilbert space: Quantum impurity at the edge of a one-dimensional superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a thermodynamic description of a single magnetic impurity at the edge of a superconducting wire. The impurity exhibits four phases $\unicode{x2014}$ Kondo, Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) I and II, and local moment $\unicode{x2014}$ a phase diagram richer than in the gapless case, contrary to the expectation that the effects of impurities in gapped hosts are less consequential. We derive the impurity contribution to free energy $F_{\rm imp}(T)$ and entropy in each phase: in Kondo phase, the entropy flows monotonically from $\ln 2$ (UV) to 0 (IR) with critical exponents same as that of the conventional Kondo model; in YSR phases, thermal activation of a midgap bound state produces entropy overshoots above $\ln 2$, saturating to $\ln 2$ at high $T$ and approaching either 0 or $\ln 2$ at low $T$ depending on whether impurity is screened or not; in the local-moment phase the impurity remains effectively decoupled, with entropy near $\ln 2$, with some intermediate-temperature features that progressively fade as $\delta \to 0$. These behaviors, including the entropy overshoots in the YSR and local-moment phases, stem from a splitting of the Hilbert space into distinct excitation towers: one in the Kondo phase, two in YSR~I, and three in YSR~II and the local-moment phase. Resolving these tower structures and thereby going beyond conventional TBA yields closed-form analytic expressions for the impurity contribution to the free energy and entropy across the entire phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics in a split Hilbert space: Quantum impurity at the edge of the Heisenberg chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the isotropic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain with a single edge-coupled impurity of arbitrary exchange strength $J$. The model exhibits four impurity phases. For antiferromagnetic couplings ($J&gt;0$): a \textit{Kondo phase} at weak $J$, where the impurity is screened by many-body excitations and the impurity entropy decreases monotonically from $\ln 2$ at $T \to \infty$ to $0$ at $T\to 0$; and an \textit{antiferromagnetic bound-mode (ABM) phase} at strong $J$, where the impurity screened by an exponentially localized bound mode drives $S_{\mathrm{imp}}(T)$ nonmonotonically, with undershoots below zero at intermediate temperatures, while tending to $\ln 2$ as $T \to \infty$ and to $0$ as $T \to 0$. For ferromagnetic couplings ($J&lt;0$): a local-moment (LM) phase at weak $|J|$, where the impurity remains unscreened with $S_{\mathrm{imp}}\to \ln 2$ as $T \to 0$ but exhibits shallow undershoots at intermediate scales; and a \textit{ferromagnetic bound-mode (FBM) phase} at strong $|J|$, where $S_{\mathrm{imp}}=\ln 2$ in both UV and IR limits, yet develops an intermediate-temperature undershoot. We provide an analytic understanding of this behavior, showing that the undershoots originate from the fractionalization of the Hilbert space into several towers of states: for antiferromagnetic couplings this occurs only at strong $J$, driven by boundary-localized bound modes, while for ferromagnetic couplings undershoots occur for all $J&lt;0$, becoming deeper with increasing $|J|$ and vanishing as $J\to 0^{-}$. These bound modes screen the impurity. Incorporating the bound modes and edge states provides a complete analytic understanding of this phenomenon and yields closed expressions for the impurity contribution to free energy and entropy that are valid across all phases. These are checked and found to be in excellent agreement with tensor network and exact diagonalization results.</description>

      <title>Charge current and phase diagram of the disordered open longer-range Kitaev chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the disorder averaged dc conductance in the non-equilibrium steady state that sets in between a longer-range Kitaev chain and a metallic lead connected to an external reservoir, as a function of the system parameters and of the disorder strength. From our results, we map out the phase diagram of the disordered chain for different types of disorder and discuss the corresponding effects of the interplay between topology and disorder in the system. To do so, we set up a combined analytical and numerical approach, which is potentially amenable of straightforward generalizations to other disordered topological systems.</description>

      <title>Majorana Diagrammatics for Quantum Spin-1/2 Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A diagrammatic formalism for lattices of 1/2 is developed. It is based on an unconstrained mapping between spin and Majorana operators. This allows the use of standard tools of diagrammatic quantum many-body theory without requiring projections. We derive, in particular, the Feynman rules for the expansion around a color-preserving mean-field theory. We then present the numerical results obtained by computing the corrections up to second order for the Heisenberg model in one and two dimensions, showing that perturbative corrections are not only numerically important, but also qualitatively improve the results of mean-field theory. These results pave the way for the use of Majorana diagrammatic tools in theoretical and numerical studies of quantum spin systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-origin driven giant planar Hall effect in topological antiferromagnet EuAl2Si2 with tunable spin texture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In topological materials, the planar Hall effect (PHE) is often regarded as a hallmark of profound quantum phenomena-most notably the Adler-Bell-Jackiw chiral anomaly and Berry curvature-rendering it an indispensable tool for deciphering the topological essence of emergent phases. In this study, we delve into the PHE and anisotropic magnetoresistance in the recently discovered layered topological antiferromagnet EuAl2Si2. Our analysis of the robust PHE signal (~3.8 {\mu}{\Omega} cm at 2 K and 8 T) unveils a distinct interplay of mechanisms. While Berry curvature plays a minor role, the dominant contributions stem from classical orbital MR in the field-induced ferromagnetic state and field-suppressed spin fluctuations in the paramagnetic regime. These insights not only position EuAl2Si2-with its highly tunable spin texture-as an exemplary system for probing the intricate coupling between spin configurations and band topology in magnetotransport but also pave the way for designing novel materials with tailored PHE responses, highlighting significant application prospects in quantum sensing, spintronic devices, and topologically protected electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Accurate calculation of light rare-earth magnetic anisotropy with density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) has long struggled to treat light rare-earth magnetism. We show that this difficulty arises from an overestimate of the $4f$ charge asphericity, and thus the magnetic anisotropy energy, due to the inadequacy of single Slater-determinant representations. We propose an effective solution by combining constrained DFT+U with crystal field theory and a systematic many-body correction to the charge asphericity. We confirm the validity of this combination on TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ and TbCo$_5$, and then show how the many-body correction adjusts the calculated magnetic anisotropy energy of SmCo$_5$ to match experiment. Our method is an efficient DFT-based approach to address light-rare-earth magnetism.</description>

      <title>Theory of superconductivity and mass enhancement near CDW critical point based on Bethe-Salpeter equation method: application to cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, charge-channel orders in strongly correlated metals have attracted great attention. Famous examples are the electronic nematic orders in cuprates and iron-based superconductors, and Star-of-David order in kagome metals. Critical phenomena and unconventional superconductivity arising from fluctuations of such charge-channel orders are central issues today; however, the essential role is played by the vertex corrections, which are the many-body effects that are dropped in conventional mean-field type approximations. To solve this difficulty, in this study, we propose the Bethe-Salpeter equation theory to evaluate electron-electron interactions in two dimensional Hubbard models. This method satisfies the criteria of the Baym-Kadanoff conserving approximation. Here, we find that an attractive interaction in the charge channel emerges from the Aslamazov-Larkin vertex corrections that describe the interference processes among spin fluctuations. Applying this method to the square-lattice Hubbard model, we reveal that the cooperation of attractive charge fluctuations and repulsive spin fluctuations yields high-$T_c$ $d$-wave superconductivity together with enhanced effective mass. These results naturally explain the phase diagram of cuprate superconductors, where strong-coupling $d$-wave superconductivity appears near the charge-order quantum critical point. The theory can also be applied to multi-orbital Hubbard models, like iron-based and nickelate superconductors, suggesting broad potential for future applications.</description>

      <title>Multiband Superconductivity and High Critical Current Density in Entropy Stabilized Nb0.25Ta0.25Ti0.25Zr0.25</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High and medium-entropy superconductors with significant intrinsic disorder are a fascinating class of superconductors. Their combination of robust structural integrity, superior mechanical properties, and exceptional irradiation tolerance makes them promising candidates for use in advanced superconducting technologies. Herein, we present a comprehensive theoretical and experimental investigation on the superconductivity of equiatomic entropy-stabilized Nb0.25Ta0.25Ti0.25Zr0.25. The material shows bulk superconductivity (transition temperature = 8K) with a high upper critical field of 11.94T. Interestingly, both the electronic band structure and specific heat data point toward unconventional multiband superconductivity. Our ab initio calculations reveal Dirac-like band crossings close to the Fermi level, with certain degeneracies persisting even in the presence of spin-orbit coupling, suggesting a possible interplay between topological electronic states and the observed unconventional superconductivity. Remarkably, the critical current density exceeds the benchmark of 10^5 A/cm2, surpassing all previously reported as-cast entropy-stabilized superconductors. This high critical current density is likely attributed to strong flux pinning at the grain boundaries, facilitated by extreme intrinsic lattice distortion. Taken together, the demonstrated dynamical stability, excellent metallicity, potential to host unconventional superconductivity, and exceptionally high critical current density highlight the potential of entropy-stabilized alloys as a platform for exploring the confluence of disorder, topology, and unconventional superconductivity.</description>

      <title>One Rudolf Peierls' surprise: the quantum-to-classical transition in the context of solid-state physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In solid state physics, it is an unsaid (tacit) assumption that the Bloch theorem is applicable to a crystal lattice even if it is of the macroscopic dimensions, provided periodicity is maintained. However, in a realistic situation, electrons in a periodic potential of ions constitute an open quantum system and are subjected to decoherence and dissipation. A natural question arises: up to what distances electrons in a periodic potential can be considered as constituting an effective closed quantum system? And what is the cause of decoherence? To answer some of these questions, the seminal theory of Ovchinnikov and Erikhman of decoherence due to ionic motion is revisited and an oversight of the authors is corrected. Correct conditions for decoherence to occur are worked out. Length scale up to which the motion of ions remains coherent is also calculated. Finally, a realistic physical picture is discussed.</description>

      <title>Partial Anyon Condensation in the Color Code: A Hamiltonian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice Hamiltonians, which can be tuned between different topological phases, are known as important tools for understanding physical mechanism behind topological phase transitions. In this paper, we introduce a perturbed Color Code Hamiltonian with a rich phase structure which can be well matched to the mechanism of anyon condensation in the Color Code. We consider Color Code model defined on a three-colorable hexagonal lattice and add Ising interactions between spins corresponding to edges of the lattice. We show that Ising interactions play the role of physical factor for condensing anyons in the Color Code. In particular, corresponding to three different colors of edges in the hexagonal lattice, we consider three different coupling parameters. Then, we are able to condense anyons with different colors by tuning power of Ising interactions in the corresponding edges. In particular, we explicitly show that condensation of one type of anyons in the Color Code leads to a phase transition to the Toric Code state. On the other hand, by condensing two types of anyons, we observe a phase transition to a modified version of the Toric Code where partial set of anyons in the Toric Code are condensed and we call it a partially topological phase. Our main method for derivation of the above results is based on a suitable basis transformation on the main Hamiltonian in the sense that our model is mapped onto three decoupled transverse-field Ising models, corresponding to the three colors. We use the above mapping to analyze behavior of string order parameters as non-local indicators of topological order. We introduce three string order parameters that can well characterize different phases of the model. Specifically we give a simple description of the partially condensed phase by using string order parameters.</description>

      <title>Excitonic skin effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that strong interactions combined with band-dependent imaginary vector potentials give rise to boundary localization of particle-hole pairs, which we term the excitonic skin effect. In a bilayer system with layer-specific gain/loss and an in-plane magnetic field, excitons experience a net imaginary vector potential, resulting in directional amplification of particle-hole pairs. Including nearest-neighbor interactions leads to a non-Hermitian bosonic Kitaev model, where the pairing effects grow exponentially with the size of the system, revealing a unique form of critical skin effect in interacting systems. Our framework applies to both atomic and electronic platforms and is directly testable in current experiments. These results also provide a route to explore non-Hermitian analogs of tensor gauge fields.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Origin of Domain Wall Reconfiguration Dynamics in a Quantum Material via Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how quantum materials relax from metastable states poses a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics. In the layered dichalcogenide 1T-TaS$_2$, domain-wall-rich polaronic textures evolve toward a uniform ground state through reconfiguration events that exhibit a crossover from thermally activated to temperature-independent behavior-indicative of quantum tunneling. Here, we employ quantum simulation of a two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) with longitudinal bias to uncover the microscopic processes underlying this relaxation. Using a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we map the TFIM to a hardcore boson model, revealing that single-polaron tunneling events, rather than collective multi-particle transitions, dominate domain wall motion. A scaling analysis of reconfiguration rates across varying transverse fields $h_x$ shows collapse when temperature is rescaled as $T \to h_x^n T$ with $n \approx 1.2$, confirming the dominance of first- and second-order single-particle processes. This enables us to reconstruct a microscopic relaxation pathway consisting of cyclical polaron leakage followed by cascades of tunneling events. Our results establish quantum simulation as a powerful tool for inferring real-space mechanisms in strongly correlated systems and demonstrate a concrete strategy for bridging effective spin models with the non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically study the open quantum system dynamics (in the Trotterized limit) of integrable quantum circuits in the presence of onsite dephasing noise with a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ impurity interacting at the edge. Using a combination of Bethe Ansatz (BA) and exact diagonalization (ED), we study the dynamics of both the bulk and the impurity for the XXX (Heisenberg) and the XX qubit chains in the presence and absence of bulk noise. In the absence of noise, we show that the impurity exhibits two distinct phases, the bound mode phase where the impurity keeps oscillating in time, and the Kondo phase where it decays with Kondo time $t_K$. Turning on the bulk dephasing noise, we find for the two models that in the long time limit in both regimes the quantum Zeno effect takes place where the dynamics of the impurity magnetization slows down as the noise strength $\gamma$ increases. The impurity magnetization in the bound mode regime shows the opposite effect, decaying faster as the noise strength increases for short times ($t \ll 1/\gamma$). We show that the bulk KPZ dynamics of the XXX model is converted to diffusive dynamics as in the XX case studied before by V. Alba, driving both systems to the Zeno effect for the impurity in the long time limit.</description>

      <title>Revealing the anisotropic charge-density-wave order of TiSe$_2$ through high harmonic generation</title>

Abstract: Titanium diselenide (TiSe$_{2}$) is a transition-metal dichalcogenide material that undergoes a charge-density-wave (CDW) transition at $T_{c}\approx 200\,\mathrm{K}$. In a recent experiment [I. Tyulnev {\it et al.}, Commun. Mater. 6, 152 (2025)], the high harmonic generation (HHG) spectra of this material has been studied, which exhibits asymmetric behavior with respect to the polarization angle of the incident light and provides a new perspective to the CDW phase transition. In this work, we work out a theoretical explanation for the experimentally observed behavior of HHG spectra. We propose a simplified phenomenological mean-field model for this material, based on which the HHG spectra is calculated through the time-dependent Schr{\" o}dinger equation. This model correctly describes the measured intensity distribution of the third-, fifth-, and seventh-order harmonic generation as a function of polarization direction and reveals a strong asymmetry due to the anisotropic CDW order in the low temperature phase. Our work provides a basis for applying high harmonic spectroscopy to reveal a new perspective on the nature of CDW orders.</description>

      <title>Twisted gauging and topological sectors in (2+1)d abelian lattice gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a two-dimensional quantum lattice model with an abelian gauge theory interpretation, we investigate a duality operation that amounts to gauging its invertible 1-form symmetry, followed by gauging the resulting 0-form symmetry in a twisted way via a choice of discrete torsion. Using tensor networks, we introduce explicit lattice realisations of the so-called condensation defects, which are obtained by gauging the 1-form symmetry along submanifolds of spacetime, and employ the same calculus to realise the duality operators. By leveraging these tensor network operators, we compute the non-trivial interplay between symmetry-twisted boundary conditions and charge sectors under the duality operation, enabling us to construct isometries relating the dual Hamiltonians. Whenever a lattice gauge theory is left invariant under the duality operation, we explore the possibility of promoting the self-duality to an internal symmetry. We argue that this results in a symmetry structure that encodes the 2-representations of a 2-group.</description>

      <title>Pressure suppresses the density wave order in kagome metal LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dancing tins pair up,
  But compressing the framework
  Thwarts the displacements.
  The density waves that develop in kagome metals ScV$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$ and LuNb$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$ at low temperature appear to arise from under-filled atomic columns within a V-Sn or Nb-Sn scaffolding. Compressing this network with applied pressure in ScV$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$ suppressed the structural transition temperature by constraining atomic rattling and inhibiting the shifts that define the structural modulation. We predicted that the density wave transition in LuNb$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$ at 68 K would be suppressed by pressure as well. In this brief study, we examine the pressure dependence of the density wave transition by measuring resistance vs temperature up to 2.26 GPa. We found the transition temperature is smoothly depressed and disappears around 1.9 GPa. This result not only addresses our prediction, but strengthens the rattling chains origin of structural instabilities in the HfFe$_{6}$Ge$_{6}$-type kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Viscoelastic tensor and hydrodynamics of altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20523v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the viscoelasticity tensor for altermagnets and formulate the corresponding hydrodynamic equations. The anisotropy of altermagnetic Fermi surfaces allows for additional terms in the viscoelasticity tensor and is manifested in transport properties, including electron and spin flows in a channel and nonlocal responses. In the channel geometry, the altermagnetic spin splitting leads to nontrivial spin density and spin current. Like the electric current, the spin current acquires a Poiseuille profile for no-slip boundary conditions. In nonlocal responses, the altermagnetic anisotropy affects current streamlines and electric potential distributions in the viscous regime. Our results provide signatures of the hydrodynamic transport regime in altermagnets, potentially facilitating its experimental studies and discovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantization of particle transport lies at the heart of topological physics. In Thouless pumps - dimensionally reduced versions of the integer quantum Hall effect - quantization is dictated by the integer winding of single-band Wannier states. Here, we show that repulsive interactions can drive a transition from an integer- to a fractional-quantized Thouless pump (at fixed integer filling) by stabilizing a crystal of multi-band Wannier states, each with fractional winding. We numerically illustrate the concept in few-particle systems, and show that a dynamical Hartree-Fock ansatz can quantitatively reproduce the pumping phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Light-Wave Engineering for Selective Polarization of a Single $\mathbf{Q}$ Valley in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07213v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The selective control of specific momentum valleys lies at the core of valleytronics, a field that has thus far focused primarily on the $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{K'}$ valleys in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). However, direct optical access to other low-lying yet conventionally inaccessible valleys such as the sixfold degenerate $\mathbf{Q}$ valleys has remained an outstanding challenge, fundamentally limiting the exploitation of the full valley degree of freedom for information processing. Here, we theoretically introduce an emergent light-wave valley selection rule that enables deterministic and high fidelity excitation of any single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley in monolayer TMDs. By coherently combining a circularly polarized pump pulse with a linearly polarized driver pulse, we engineer distinct quantum pathways that unambiguously excited electrons into a targeted $\mathbf{Q}$ valley, completely decoupled from the conventional $\mathbf{K}/\mathbf{K'}$ valleys. This all-optical scheme achieves near-unity ($\sim$100\%) valley polarization across an exceptionally broad ultrafast window, from the terahertz ($10^{12}$~Hz) to petahertz ($10^{15}$~Hz) regimes, enabling single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley polarization on femtosecond timescales. Our findings establish a new paradigm of light-wave quantum metrology in valleytronics, unlocking the $\mathbf{Q}$-valley subspace for scalable multi-state valley information processing.</description>

      <title>Generalized Charges, Part II: Non-Invertible Symmetries and the Symmetry TFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17159v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a d-dimensional quantum field theory (QFT) $\mathfrak{T}$, with a generalized symmetry $\mathcal{S}$, which may or may not be invertible. We study the action of $\mathcal{S}$ on generalized or $q$-charges, i.e. $q$-dimensional operators. The main result of this paper is that $q$-charges are characterized in terms of the topological defects of the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) of $\mathcal{S}$, also known as the ``Sandwich Construction''. The SymTFT is a $(d+1)$-dimensional topological field theory, which encodes the symmetry $\mathcal{S}$ and the physical theory in terms of its boundary conditions. Our proposal applies quite generally to any finite symmetry $\mathcal{S}$, including non-invertible, categorical symmetries. Mathematically, the topological defects of the SymTFT form the Drinfeld Center of the symmetry category $\mathcal{S}$. Applied to invertible symmetries, we recover the result of Part I of this series of papers. After providing general arguments for the identification of $q$-charges with the topological defects of the SymTFT, we develop this program in detail for QFTs in 2d (for general fusion category symmetries) and 3d (for fusion 2-category symmetries).</description>

      <title>Resonant Edelstein and inverse-Edelstein effects, charge-to-spin conversion, and spin pumping from chiral-spin modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling in systems with broken inversion symmetry gives rise to the Edelstein effect, which is the spin polarization induced by an electric field or current, and the inverse-Edelstein effect (also known as the spin-galvanic effect), which is the electric current induced by an oscillatory magnetic field or spin polarization. At the same time, an interplay between spin-orbit coupling and electron-electron interaction leads to a special type of collective excitations -- chiral-spin modes -- which are oscillations of spin polarization in the absence of a magnetic field. As a result, both Edelstein and inverse-Edelstein effects exhibit resonances at the frequencies of chiral-spin collective modes. Here, we present a detailed study of the effect of electron correlation on the resonances in Edelstein and inverse-Edelstein effects in a single-valley two-dimensional electron gas and in a multi-valley Dirac system with proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling. While the chiral-spin modes involve both in-plane and out-of-plane oscillations of spins, we show that only the in-plane modes are responsible for the above resonances. In the multi-valley system, electron correlation splits the in-plane modes into two. We study the spectral weight distribution between the two modes over a large parameter space of intra- and inter-valley interactions. Finally, we demonstrate that using the chiral-spin modes one can get a resonant enhancement of charge-to-spin conversion and gain a directional control of the injected spins in the spin-pumping process, both of which are relevant to spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The competition between bulk color superconductivity and the localized screening of a heavy quark impurity, analogous to the Kondo effect, leads to a rich spectrum of phenomena in dense quark matter. We investigate this competition at the edge of a superconducting quark bulk, where both the superconducting gap and the Kondo scale are dynamically generated in a tractable toy model. Utilizing the exact Bethe Ansatz method, we elucidate the resulting boundary physics. We identify distinct regimes characterized by either multi-particle Kondo screening or an unscreened local moment. Crucially, we also uncover a novel intermediate phase featuring impurity screening through a single-particle bound state formed within the superconducting gap. The toy model presented in this work highlights the complex interplay between dynamically generated bulk properties and boundary impurities in extreme QCD environments, offering potential insights into phenomena occurring in heavy-ion collisions and compact stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Layered transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) HfTe2 is a topological semimetal candidate with increasing attentions recently. The map of the Fermi surface is of interest and importance to understand its properties. Here we present a study of Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations and planar Hall effect (PHE) in HfTe2. The single crystals grown by flux method show the largest unsaturated magnetoresistance (MR) effect of 1.1*104 % at 14 T and 2 K. The angle-resolved SdH oscillations reveal that the Fermi surface consists of three pockets with different anisotropy. In addition, we observe PHE and anisotropic MR (AMR) effect in the material for a wide temperature range. The effective mass, carrier density and quantum transport mobility are quantified in the system, and the Berry phase is discussed. Our work provides crucial insights into the electronic structure and the Fermi surface of the semimetal.</description>
