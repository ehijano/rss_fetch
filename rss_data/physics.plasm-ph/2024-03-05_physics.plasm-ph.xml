      <title>Broadening of the Divertor Heat Flux Profile in High Confinement Tokamak Fusion Plasmas with Edge Pedestals Limited by Turbulence in DIII-D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-machine empirical scaling predicts an extremely narrow heat exhaust layer in future high magnetic field tokamaks, leading to disastrous material erosion. In the experiments presented, the width of this exhaust layer is nearly doubled by using actuators to increase turbulent transport in the plasma edge. This is achieved in low collisionality, high confinement edge pedestals with their gradients limited by turbulent transport instead of large-scale, coherent instabilities. The exhaust heat flux profile width and divertor leg diffusive spreading both double as a high frequency band of fluctuations propagating in the electron diamagnetic direction doubles in amplitude. The results are quantitatively reproduced in comprehensive electromagnetic XGC particle-in-cell simulations which show the heat flux carried by electrons emerges to broaden the heat flux profile.</description>

      <title>When should PIC simulations be applied to atmospheric pressure plasmas? Impact of correlation heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are used to test when the particle-in-cell (PIC) method applies to atmospheric pressure plasmas. It is found that PIC applies only when the plasma density and macroparticle weight are sufficiently small because of two effects associated with correlation heating. The first is the physical effect of disorder-induced heating (DIH). This occurs if the plasma density is large enough that a species (typically ions) is strongly correlated in the sense that the Coulomb coupling parameter exceeds one. In this situation, DIH causes ions to rapidly heat following ionization. PIC is not well suited to capture DIH because doing so requires using a macroparticle weight of one and a grid that well resolves the physical interparticle spacing. These criteria render PIC intractable for macroscale domains. The second effect is a numerical error due to Artificial Correlation Heating (ACH). ACH is like DIH in that it is caused by the Coulomb repulsion between particles, but differs in that it is a numerical effect caused by a macroparticle weight larger than one. Like DIH, it is associated with strong correlations. However, here the macroparticle coupling strength is found to scale as $\Gamma w^{2/3}$, where $\Gamma$ is the physical coupling strength and $w$ is the macroparticle weight. So even if the physical coupling strength of a species is small, as is expected for electrons in atmospheric pressure plasmas, a sufficiently large macroparticle weight can cause the macroparticles to be strongly coupled and therefore heat due to ACH. Furthermore, it is shown that simulations in reduced dimensions exacerbate these issues.</description>

      <title>A spectroscopic investigation of thermal instability for cylindrical equilibria with background flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flows are omnipresent and govern the dynamics of plasma. Solar tornadoes are a class of apparently rotating prominences, that might be formed by thermal instability. In spectroscopic studies on thermal instability background flow is commonly neglected. We here determine the effect of background flow on thermal instability in cylindrical magnetic field configurations as the influence of various parameters on the MHD spectrum. We investigate discrete thermal modes. In an analytical study, we extend upon the literature by including a generic background flow in a cylindrical coordinate system. The non-adiabatic MHD equations are linearised, Fourier-analysed, and are examined to understand how a background flow changes the continua. An approximate expression for discrete thermal modes is derived using a WKB analysis. The analytical results are then verified for a benchmark equilibrium using the eigenvalue code Legolas. The eigenfunctions of discrete thermal modes are visualised in 2D and 3D. The thermal continuum is Doppler-shifted due to the background flow, just like the slow and Alfv\'en continua. Discrete modes are altered because the governing equations contain flow-related terms. An approximate expression to predict the appearance of discrete thermal modes based on the equilibrium parameters is derived. All analytical expressions match the numerical results. The distribution of the density perturbations of the discrete thermal modes is not a singular condensation. 3D visualisation of the total velocity field shows that the helical field is heavily influenced by the radial velocity perturbation. We derived analytic expressions for non-adiabatic MHD modes of a cylindrical equilibrium with background flow and verified them using a coronal equilibrium. However, the equations are valid for and can be applied in other astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Rapid cooling of the in-plane motion of two-dimensional ion crystals in a Penning trap to millikelvin temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a highly feasible technique with no experimental overhead to rapidly cool the in-plane degrees of freedom of large two-dimensional ion crystals in Penning traps. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our approach enables the in-plane modes to cool down to a temperature of around 1 mK in less than 10 ms. Our technique relies on near-resonant coupling of the poorly cooled in-plane motions and the efficiently cooled out-of-plane motions, and is achieved without introducing additional potentials. The rapid cooling enabled by our approach is in contrast to typical operating conditions, where our simulations of the laser cooling dynamics suggest that the ion crystal's in-plane motion cools very slowly on a timescale of several hundreds of milliseconds, a rate likely slower than experimental heating rates. Our work sets the stage for sub-Doppler laser cooling of the planar motion, and more robust and versatile quantum simulation and quantum sensing experiments with two-dimensional crystals in Penning traps.</description>
