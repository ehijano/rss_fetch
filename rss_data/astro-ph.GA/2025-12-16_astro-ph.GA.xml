      <title>Eccentric Binaries Accreting from Thin Disks: Orbital Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circumbinary disks crucially affect the orbital and electromagnetic properties of binary systems across the universe, from stars in our galactic neighborhood to supermassive black hole binaries formed as the result of tumultuous galactic mergers. Previous simulations have focused nearly exclusively on thick accretion disks, appropriate for studying stellar binaries, and have found encouraging agreement with observations thereof. We present herein the first systematic study of eccentric binary systems accreting from thin disks, focusing on binary orbital evolution. Our main results are that (1) thinner disk not only drive binaries to rapidly inspiral, but also excite binary eccentricities at much higher rates; (2) while thick disks may drive binaries to a stable fixed point of $e\approx0.425$, thinner disks pump binary eccentricities to $e\gtrsim0.6$; (3) the range of near-zero eccentricities that are damped towards zero depends on both disk thickness and viscosity, thinner disks and those with $\alpha$ viscosities driving binaries towards circularity over a much narrower range of eccentricities. These differences follow largely from the effects of pressure support on accretion streams and shocks within the inner regions of the accretion flow. Our results suggest that accreting binary black holes should have high eccentricities well into the frequency range probed by pulsar timing arrays and space-based gravitational wave interferometers, affecting the spectrum and isotropy of the gravitational wave background. Our results also suggest that circumbinary disks may play an important role in shaping the orbits of close binary stars, but much less so those of wider binaries.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Milky Way Circumnuclear Disk: Rosettes and Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Milky Way Galactic Center hosts a $\sim4\times10^{6}\,M_\odot$ supermassive black hole (SMBH), Sgr A*. The dominant structures in its immediate vicinity are the nuclear star cluster (NSC), whose enclosed mass at 2 pc is approximately half that of the SMBH, and the circumnuclear disk/ring (CND), which extends between $\sim0.5$ pc and $\sim3$ pc from Sgr A* and is the largest reservoir of molecular gas in this region. Existing models of the CND commonly use one circular orbit to describe the motion of its gas. Here, we explore a much broader range of models. In the combined potential of Sgr A* and the NSC, we consider non-Keplerian rosette orbits as well as a circular disk, which is formed using a finely-spaced set of concentric rings. For both systems, we test various inner/outer radii, inclinations, and position angles, sampling a total of $\sim3.3 \times 10^{5}$ models. We then conduct mock observations of all models to construct velocity maps, which we compare with HCN ($J=1{-}0$) observations of the CND. We find that the best-fitting model is a circular disk with inner and outer radii of 1.0 pc and 2.9 pc, an inclination of $i=60^{\circ}$, and a position angle of $\text{PA} = 35^{\circ}.$</description>

      <title>Cosmic Duets I. High-spatial resolution spectroscopy of dual and lensed AGN with MUSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first-year results of the MUSE Large Program "Cosmic Duets", aimed at obtaining adaptive-optics assisted MUSE observations with an angular resolution of 0.1"-0.2", providing integral-field spectroscopy of sub-arcsec separation dual and lensed active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidates. These observations reveal previously unexplored properties of dual and lensed systems, key to understanding galaxy evolution, black hole mergers, and strong-lensing modeling. Targets were selected using the Gaia Multi-Peak (GMP) technique, which identifies pairs of point-like sources with separations below 0.8" in the Gaia catalog. MUSE spatially resolved spectroscopy provides redshifts, ionization diagnostics, and absorption systems along the line of sight. We report results for 30 GMP-selected targets at z=0.5-3.5. All systems show at least two spatially resolved components. Nineteen objects are confirmed as AGN multiplets, including 6 dual AGN, 10 doubly-lensed quasars, and 3 quadruply-lensed systems, while the remaining 11 correspond to alignments with foreground stars. Among spectroscopically confirmed dual AGN in the literature, 24 pairs have separations below 7 kpc, and our sample accounts for 25% of them. We study dual and lensed AGN distributions as a function of redshift, magnitude, and projected separation, and find that bright systems (J&lt;16.5) are dominated by lensed quasars, whereas the fraction of dual AGN increases at fainter magnitudes. This first-year sample demonstrates the high efficiency of GMP pre-selection combined with MUSE spectroscopy. The full program, targeting 150 systems, will enable statistical studies of dual AGN incidence and detailed constraints on mass distribution in strong-lensing galaxies.</description>

      <title>The MeerKLASS UHF On-the-Fly Continuum Survey -- Data Release I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first public data release (DR1) from the interferometric component of the MeerKAT Large Area Synoptic Survey (MeerKLASS) UHF survey, a legacy program demonstrating a novel on-the-fly (OTF) mapping technique. This release is based on 12 hours of early science observations covering approximately 800 deg$^2$ of the southern sky. We describe the data processing pipeline developed to calibrate and image these fast-scanning observations, producing high-fidelity continuum images at a central frequency of 816 MHz. The resulting mosaic reaches an RMS sensitivity of $\sim$35 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ in its deepest regions, with a typical angular resolution of $\sim32'' \times 17''$. In these images, we identify $95483$ radio sources. We validate the catalogue through cross-matching with external surveys, confirming sub-arcsecond astrometric accuracy and a robust flux density scale. We compute the differential source counts, finding excellent agreement with existing measurements and validating our end-to-end processing. The success of this pilot study serves as a crucial proof of concept for the OTF observing strategy, and the public release of the images and source catalogue provides a valuable resource for a wide range of astrophysical studies. This work paves the way for the full MeerKLASS OTF survey and future large-area survey projects with the SKA.</description>

      <title>High-Redshift Galaxy Candidates at z &gt; 6 as Revealed by JWST Observations of MACS0647</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalog of 57 high-redshift $z&gt;6$ galaxy candidates, including 14 spectroscopic confirmations ($z = 6.10$ -- 9.25), 2 Little Red Dots ($z = 4.77$, 5.81), and 2 interlopers ($z = 3.23$, 3.72), based on \JWST\ NIRCam imaging (7 filters), NIRSpec spectroscopy (PRISM and G395H), and archival \HST\ imaging (17 filters) of the strong lensing galaxy cluster MACS0647. Our highest redshift confirmation ($z = 9.25$) is an Extremely Blue Galaxy (presented in~\citealt{Yanagisawa2024}), and here we identify a spectral turnover likely due to damped Lyman-$\alpha$. We identify an overdensity of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts $z = 6.1$, confirming the $z \sim 6$ overdensity identified in \HST\ images. In one of these galaxies, our high-resolution G395H spectroscopy reveals two spatially resolved components with a velocity difference of $\sim$90 km/s; if these components are gravitationally bound, this would imply a dynamical mass on the order of $\sim 10^8\ M_\odot$ given their projected separation. We present spectral line fluxes, widths, and derived physical properties, including stellar masses ($10^8 - 10^9 \ \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) and metallicities ($10\% - 40\% \ \mathrm{Z}_{\odot}$) for our spectroscopic sample. We note half of our NIRSpec data was obtained with standard 3-slitlet nods and half was obtained with single slitlets yielding similar results, demonstrating the power to observe more sources on a densely packed NIRSpec MSA.</description>

      <title>NGDEEP: A New Non-Parametric Measure of Local Star-Formation and Attenuation at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new non-parametric technique to quantify the spatially-resolved relationship between the local star-formation rate (SFR) and dust attenuation. We then apply it to 14 star-forming galaxies at $1.0&lt;z&lt;2.5$ using JWST/NIRISS slitless spectroscopy from the NGDEEP survey. First, we construct spatially resolved ($\sim$1~kpc per pixel) Balmer decrement ($H\alpha/H\beta$) maps of these galaxies and derive their corresponding dust attenuation and intrinsic SFR maps. We then rank-order the map pixels by attenuation and construct a cumulative distribution curve of the total SFR as a function of increasing attenuation. We define $\mathrm{A}^{\mathrm{SFR}}_{10\%}$, $\mathrm{A}^{\mathrm{SFR}}_{50\%}$, and $\mathrm{A}^{\mathrm{SFR}}_{90\%}$ as the dust attenuation levels behind which 10\%, 50\%, and 90\% of the total integrated SFR is screened, respectively. These metrics quantify the probability that a given star-forming region lies behind a given level of attenuation. Across the full sample, 50\% of the local star formation occurs behind an attenuation of 3.41 mag or higher ($\mathrm{A}^{\mathrm{SFR}}_{50\%}$). This indicates that the bulk of star formation in these galaxies is significantly attenuated by dust. The value of $\mathrm{A}^{\mathrm{SFR}}_{10\%}$ equals 1.45 for the average profile, indicating that even the least attenuated star-forming regions are still highly attenuated. The globally measured attenuation more closely matches $\mathrm{A}^{\mathrm{SFR}}_{10\%}$ than $\mathrm{A}^{\mathrm{SFR}}_{50\%}$. This suggests that the global value is weighted toward the least dust-obscured star-forming regions and significantly underestimates the typical attenuation a star-forming region encounters. Our results demonstrate a new approach for understanding the extremely dusty local conditions of the star-forming interstellar medium in SF galaxies at cosmic noon.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Half-Light Radius for the Tucana Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new measurement of the half-light radius of the Tucana Dwarf galaxy, based on the combination of wider, deeper imaging conducted as part of the Local Volume Complete Cluster Survey (LoVoCCS) and HST archival images. We obtain a stellar density profile within the Tucana Dwarf field based on elliptical fitting. After background subtraction, we fit a S\'ersic profile to the density profile to obtain the half-light radius. We measure the half-light radius to be $0.89_{-0.02}^{+0.06}$ arcmin, corresponding to a value of $R_{e} = 225.7_{-5.5}^{+14.4}$ pc (95% CL). Given the wider-field observations from LoVoCCS used in this analysis, our measurement of the half-light radius represents a $\sim 10 \%$ increased value from the previous results.</description>

      <title>AGN X-ray Reflection Spectroscopy with ML MYTORUS:Neural Posterior Estimation with Training on Observation-Driven Parameter Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray spectroscopy of active galactic nuclei (AGN) reveals key information about circumnuclear geometry. Many AGN show a narrow Fe K-alpha line at 6.4 keV and associated Compton-scattered continua, produced by primary continuum scattering in cold, neutral material far from the central supermassive black hole. We present a novel approach based on Simulation-Based Inference with Neural Posterior Estimation (SBI-NPE) to train a machine-learning (ML) model using NuSTAR spectral fitting results from the literature, adopting the physically motivated MYTORUS-decoupled model, which separates line-of-sight and global equivalent hydrogen column densities (NH_Z and NH_S). To overcome limitations of traditional frequentist fitting such as local minima, limited automation, reproducibility, and computational cost, we employ normalizing flows and autoregressive networks to learn flexible posterior distributions from simulated spectra. From 34 NuSTAR spectral fits, we generate 34,000 synthetic spectra using uniform and Gaussian parameter distributions, showing that the latter is more strongly observationally driven. The network is trained to infer four MYTORUS parameters: NH_Z, NH_S, the photon index Gamma, and the relative normalization AS. Mutual information analysis identifies optimal spectral regions and motivates the inclusion of redshift, exposure time, and Galactic absorption. The observation-based grid significantly outperforms uniform sampling, achieving predictive accuracies above 90 percent for NH_S and AS, 89 percent for NH_Z, and 82 percent for Gamma within one sigma, with a joint accuracy of 70 percent for all parameters. We publicly release ML MYTORUS with a web interface enabling fast, reproducible inference from NuSTAR spectra. An application to NGC 4388 illustrates the promise of this approach.</description>

      <title>First mapping of prebiotic molecule CH2NH in a pre-stellar core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first spatially resolved map of methanimine CH2NH in the prestellar core L1544 using the IRAM 30m telescope. The 2$_{0,2}$-1$_{0,1}$ line at 127 GHz was mapped with 20" resolution ($\sim$2800 au), revealing extended CH2NH emission across the core. The peak line intensity coincides with the well-known c-C3H2 peak, while the integrated intensity peaks between the HNCO and dust continuum peaks due to broader linewidths in the latter region. Column densities of CH2NH are $\sim$(0.5-1.4$\times$)10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, corresponding to fractional abundances of $5\times10^{-11}$-$1\times10^{-10}$, with a trend decreasing from the southern, carbon-chain rich region to the dust and HNCO peak in the north. Comparison with complementary molecular maps and the gas-grain chemical model of Sipil\"a et al. suggests that neutral-neutral gas-phase reactions and dissociative recombination dominate in the outer carbon-chain shell. This study demonstrates that CH2NH, a simple nitrogen- and carbon-bearing molecule previously detected with pointed observations in other cold cores, is present and spatially extended in the evolved pre-stellar core L1544. This indicates that prebiotic nitrogen-carbon chemistry continues efficiently up to the onset of gravitational collapse, providing key constraints for astrochemical models and the early stages of chemical complexity leading to amino acids.</description>

      <title>Exploiting light coherence in astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT) effect, discovered in the 1950s and further developed in the 1960s, was originally used to estimate stellar angular diameters through intensity correlations measured by spatially separated detectors. Further developments started from HBT experiments to exploit quantum bunching of photons in incoherent light sources played foundational role in the development of quantum optics.
  When the two detectors in an HBT experiment are co-located, typically implemented using a beam splitter, a zero-baseline intensity correlation is obtained, which after deconvolution of the detector response function, yields the temporal component of the second-order coherence function. Unlike spatial correlations, this function is independent of the source brightness distribution, or its size, giving direct insight into the properties of the source's emission process itself - photon statistics. Along with photometric and spectral information, the second order coherence function can be used to constrain the emission mechanisms and discriminate between thermal, synchrotron, bremsstrahlung and stimulated emission processes. Evolution of the emission processes would likewise drive changes in the second order coherence. Light coherence information along with multi-wavelength observations, can become a complementary "messenger", carrying internal information about the astronomical source.</description>

      <title>THRILS -- The High-(Redshift+Ionization) Line Search: Program Description &amp; Redshift Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To date, many spectroscopic confirmations of z&gt;7 galaxies have been obtained using JWST/NIRSpec prism observations, with most of their physical properties inferred from these observations and corresponding imaging. What is needed are higher-resolution spectra at deeper depths to study these sources in detail. We present The High-(Redshift+Ionization) Line Search (THRILS) program: deep (&gt;8 hr) observations in two pointings of JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectroscopy to 1) probe high ionization spectral features in z&gt;8 galaxies that are indicative of top-heavy initial mass functions or growing massive black holes, 2) search for accreting supermassive black holes in typical galaxies at z~4-9 through broad Balmer line emission, and 3) probe the stellar-mass growth histories of massive galaxies. We include spectroscopic redshift measurements for 89 sources from the THRILS data, as well as a detection threshold for the full and half depth integration times of the program.</description>

      <title>Reconnection-Driven Turbulent Fluctuations in the Magnetically Dominated Collisionless Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental plasma process that converts magnetic energy into bulk flow energy, thermal energy, and nonthermal particle acceleration. Despite its importance, the statistical properties of the turbulent fluctuations generated by collisionless reconnection, which are essential for understanding how this energy conversion proceeds, remain poorly understood. Here, we employ large-scale 3D particle-in-cell simulations to investigate the turbulence characteristics of velocity and magnetic field fluctuations generated by collisionless reconnection in a magnetically dominated plasma. We characterize their statistical properties by computing structure functions along different directions within the reconnection layer. We find that the square root of the second-order velocity structure function follows a power-law scaling with a slope near $\sim1/3$ at intermediate to large scales, consistent with Kolmogorov-like turbulence, a behavior robust along the inflow, outflow, and guide-field directions. The square root of the second-order magnetic structure function consistently exhibits a steeper slope, in the range $\sim 0.6 - 0.8$. The presence of a finite guide field does not systematically modify the slope of the velocity fluctuations, while it progressively steepens the scaling of the magnetic fluctuations in the guide-field and inflow directions. We also measure higher-order structure functions, which reveal strong magnetic intermittency along the outflow direction and weaker intermittency in the inflow and guide-field directions. In addition, the local anisotropies of both velocity and magnetic field fluctuations are greater for stronger guide fields. These results provide a first systematic characterization of the multiscale nature of turbulence in collisionless reconnection layers, with important implications for plasma heating and particle acceleration.</description>

      <title>Mode Energy Partition in Partially Ionized Compressible MHD Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how neutral-ion collisional damping modifies the spectral properties and energy partition of compressible MHD turbulence using a suite of 3D two-fluid simulations. By systematically varying the neutral-ion coupling strength and decomposing the turbulent velocity field into Alfv\'en, slow, and fast modes, we quantify how each mode responds to the transition from strong to weak coupling. In the strong-coupling regime, the Alfv\'en and slow modes follow nearly Kolmogorov $k^{-5/3}$ spectra and dominate the kinetic energy budget, while fast modes exhibit a steeper spectrum and contribute $\sim$10\% of the total energy. As the coupling weakens and neutral-ion damping becomes significant, all mode spectra steepen, with the Alfv\'en mode approaching a dissipation-dominated $k^{-4}$ spectrum. The slow-mode energy fraction increases substantially toward small scales, reaching up to $\sim$70\% near the damping scale, whereas the Alfv\'en-mode fraction decreases correspondingly. In contrast, the fast-mode energy fraction remains largely insensitive to coupling strength. These results demonstrate that partial ionization not only steepens the turbulent spectra but also reshapes the mode energy distribution, enhancing the relative importance of the slow mode while suppressing Alfv\'en mode in the damping regime. Our findings have important implications for turbulence-driven processes in the partially ionized interstellar medium, including cosmic-ray transport and acceleration.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Orbital Dynamics of Globular Clusters in the Central Region of the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The regularity/chaoticity of orbits of 45 globular clusters in the central region of the Galaxy with a radius of 3.5 kpc, which are subject to the greatest influence of the elongated rotating bar, is analyzed. Various methods of analysis are used, namely, the methods of calculating the maximum characteristic Lyapunov exponents (MCLE), MEGNO (Mean Exponential Growth factor of Nearby Orbits), the Poincar\'e section method, the frequency method based on calculating fundamental frequencies, and a new method is proposed based on calculating the orbit amplitude spectrum as a function of time and calculating the entropy of the amplitude spectrum as a measure of orbital chaos. Bimodality is found in the histogram of the distribution of positive Lyapunov exponents calculated in the classical version, without renormalizing the shadow orbit, which allows implementing a probabilistic method for GC classification, which is also a new approach. To construct the orbits of globular clusters, we used the gravitational potential model with a bar in the form of a triaxial ellipsoid. The following bar parameters were adopted: mass $10^{10} M_\odot$, length of the semi-major axis 5 kpc, angle of rotation of the bar axis 25$^o$, rotation velocity 40 km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$. To form the 6D-phase space required for integrating the orbits, we used the most accurate astrometric data to date from the Gaia satellite (EDR3), as well as new refined average distances to globular clusters. Globular clusters with regular and chaotic dynamics were classified.</description>

Abstract: The EROS project (Exp\'erience de Recherche d'Objets Sombres) carried out photometric surveys of dense stellar fields towards the Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC), the Galactic Bulge and Galactic spiral arms, over the period 1990-2003. The main goal of the experiment was to search for the Galactic Dark Matter in the form of massive compact objects (machos), through the gravitational microlensing effect. The historical record of the flux variations of the monitored stars by EROS-2 will be a unique asset for time domain astronomy and to complement current and future searches of transient sources. We describe the set of light curves obtained by EROS-2 program over the years 1996 to 2003, monitoring more than 86 million stars, which is publicly released through the Centre de Donn\'ees de Strasbourg (CDS). The numbers of light curves in this data set are 28.7 and 4.0 million in LMC, respectively SMC, 42.9 million in the Galactic Bulge and 10.4 million towards the Galactic spiral arms, with several hundred measurements for each object. Data from EROS-1 is also being released. The object catalog and light curves and images are accessible through the CDS portal. This will be useful for checking the past behavior of newly discovered variable objects.</description>

      <title>CAPOS: The bulge Cluster APOgee Survey XI. Unraveling the chemical composition of the bulge globular cluster NGC 6304</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. With CAPOS, we can mitigate the observational difficulties limiting access to bulge globular clusters in the optical and investigate them in more detail in the near-IR. Aims. To perform a rigorous abundance analysis of the metal-rich bulge globular cluster NGC 6304, in order to determine its detailed chemical composition and identify multiple populations. Methods. We analyzed APOGEE-2 near-IR spectra of 27 giant members. The abundances of 17 elements (C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, and Ce) were derived using the BACCHUS code, using atmospheric parameters from both ASPCAP and photometry (Gaia and 2MASS). Results. We derived $[{\rm Fe/H}] = -0.45\pm0.05$ using the ASPCAP parameters, and $[{\rm Fe/H}] = -0.45\pm0.08$ when using photometric parameters, with no evidence of an intrinsic metallicity spread. NGC 6304 shows $[\alpha/{\rm Fe}]_{\rm spec} = 0.24\pm0.07$ and $[\alpha/{\rm Fe}]_{\rm phot} = 0.23\pm0.08$. We find a significant spread in $[{\rm N/Fe}]$, with $\sigma_{\rm spec} = 0.54$ and $\sigma_{\rm phot} = 0.46$, along with a C-N anticorrelation. Furthermore, we detect a correlation of Ce with both N and Al, consistent with patterns observed in some metal-rich bulge globular clusters. Conclusions. We find a significant star-to-star variation in Na, but a minimal variation in O. The absence of the Mg-Al anticorrelation supports the evidence that the MgAl cycle is not active in globular clusters at high metallicity. The observed correlation between Ce and both N and Al suggests that the enrichment of these elements may be driven by asymptotic giant branch stars, positioning Ce as an element involved in multiple populations in metal-rich globular clusters. We find that abundances are consistent with those of bulge field stars of similar metallicity, suggesting a similar origin and chemical evolution.</description>

      <title>An Extremely-red, UV-bright, and Extended Galaxy at z~6 in PRIMER/UDS: An Early Massive Galaxy Caught Quenching after an Obscured Starburst?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST continues to reveal an astonishing number of massive quiescent galaxies at $z&gt;4$, with number densities $\gtrsim10\times$ higher than model predictions. NIRSpec spectra imply that many of these systems underwent intense starburst episodes (SFR$\,\gtrsim300M_\odot$/yr), though direct evidence of such starbursts in the Gyr largely comes from exceptionally rare dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) selected in the far-infrared. Here, we report the discovery of an extremely red ($\beta=-0.6$) yet UV-bright (F115W = 26.0 mag) $z\sim6$ star-forming system selected as a Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) over $\approx$500 arcmin$^2$ of deep NIRCam imaging. This galaxy (UDS_43065) shows photometric colors implying a prominent Balmer break and strong H$\alpha$ emission, consistent with a dramatic burst of star formation (SFR$\,\approx\,500-1000\,M_\odot$/yr) occurring 5-10 Myr ago that formed 20-40% of its total stellar mass ($\approx1.5\times10^{10}M_\odot$) with little activity since. This galaxy is one of only two objects with $M_\ast&gt;10^{10}M_\odot$ across our full sample of 813 $z\sim6$ star-forming LBGs, and the only galaxy with a confident extremely-red UV slope ($\beta&gt;-1$). UDS_43065 is clearly resolved yet compact in F444W ($r_e=400\pm10$ pc) indicating a very high stellar mass surface density of log$(\Sigma_\mathrm{eff}/(M_\odot\,\mathrm{kpc}^{-2}))=10.25\pm0.13$ comparable to quenched $z\sim2-7$ galaxies. If the inferred star formation history (SFH) of UDS_43065 is corroborated with further observations, this object would seemingly represent a rarely-seen transitional phase between massive DSFGs and passive systems in the first Gyr, helping resolve the puzzling abundance of early massive quenched galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Merian Survey: A Statistical Census of Bright Satellites of Milky Way Analogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a statistical census of bright, star-forming satellite galaxies around Milky Way (MW) analogs using the first data release of the Merian Survey. Our sample consists of 393 MW analogs with stellar masses $10^{10.5} &lt; M_{\star, \rm host} &lt; 10^{10.9} M_\odot$ at redshifts $0.07 &lt; z &lt; 0.09$, all central galaxies of their own dark matter halos. Using photometric selection -- including magnitude, color, angular size, photometric redshift, and size-mass cuts -- we identify 793 satellite candidates around these 393 hosts. Our selection leverages two medium-band filters targeting H$\alpha$ and [O \textsc{iii}] emission, enabling a nearly complete sample of star-forming, Magellanic Clouds-like satellites with $M_{\star, \rm sat} \gtrsim 10^{8} M_\odot$. We find that $\sim80\%$ of hosts have 0-3 massive satellites, and $13\pm4\%$ have two satellites (similar to the MW). Satellite abundance correlates with total stellar mass, and we provide significantly improved statistics for the most massive satellites at $\log_{10}[M_{\star, \rm sat}/M_{\odot}] \gtrsim 10$. The completeness-corrected radial distribution is less centrally concentrated than an NFW profile. In contrast, the Milky Way satellites are more centrally concentrated than the 50\% richest Merian systems, but are broadly consistent with the 50\% most centrally concentrated Merian systems. Our results highlight the power of medium-band photometry for satellite identification and provide a key benchmark for studying satellite quenching, environmental effects, and hierarchical galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>Kinematics of H I and O VI Absorbers: Insights into the Turbulence Driver of the Multiphase Circumgalactic Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate large-scale gas kinematics in the multiphase circumgalactic medium (CGM) using the observed correlation between line width and column density for H I and O VI absorbers. Leveraging extensive public galaxy survey data at $z\lesssim0.1$, we construct a new galaxy sample based on the availability of background QSOs with far-ultraviolet spectra from the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE). By combining this FUSE-galaxy sample with literature collections, we find that H I absorbers exhibit a clear inverse correlation between Doppler width and column density over nearly five orders of magnitude in $N_{\rm HI}$, from $N_{\rm HI} \approx 10^{13}\rm~{cm^{-2}}$ to $N_{\rm HI} \approx 10^{18}\rm~{cm^{-2}}$, while O VI absorption follows a positive correlation across $N_{\rm OVI}\approx 3\times10^{13}$-$10^{15}\rm~{cm^{-2}}$. We develop a model framework to interpret these contrasting trends and show that H I absorbers are best described as systems of approximately constant total column density ($N_{\rm H}$), whereas O VI traces regions of roughly constant spatial density ($n_{\rm H}$ and $n_{\rm OVI}$). Under the latter scenario, the observed $b_{\rm OVI}$-$N_{\rm OVI}$ relation maps directly to a velocity-size relation consistent with a Kolmogorov-like turbulent spectrum. Together, these findings reveal a coherent physical picture in which H I and O VI trace a continuous turbulent cascade spanning more than five orders of magnitude in spatial scale-from cool, photoionized clumps to warm, highly ionized halo gas--with accretion in the halo outskirts likely driving the turbulent energy injection that sustains the multiphase CGM.</description>

      <title>DREAMS.II. Galaxy Demographics from Direct Te-Based Metallicities at z~2-10: Tracing the Evolution of the Mass-Metallicity and Fundamental Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the statistics of line ratios and direct Te-based metallicities from JWST medium-resolution spectra of 292 galaxies at z=2-10, combining DREAMS observations with those of JADES and CEERS. To remove systematics caused by stellar mass (M*) and star formation rate (SFR), we construct stacked spectra binned by redshift within fixed M* and SFR ranges, as well as across the full ranges. We find that the [OII]3727/Hb ratio drops by a factor of five from z~3 to 8 at fixed M* and SFR, in contrast to the nearly constant [OIII]5007/Hb ratio. We derive metallicities via the direct Te method using the [OIII]4363 line, and identify that high-z galaxies lie on the low-metallicity end of the anti-correlation between ionization parameter and metallicity at z~0. Photoionization modeling demonstrates that the redshift evolution, where metallicity decreases and ionization parameter increases, self-consistently explains the observed line ratios. We then examine the mass-metallicity (MZ) and fundamental (MZ-SFR) relations. Including additional galaxies at z~10-12, we find that the MZ relation monotonically decreases from z~3 to 10 at fixed M*, while the MZ-SFR relation shows a significant decline at z&gt;8. Based on the ChemicalUniverseMachine model, this evolutionary trend can be explained by enhanced gas inflow (outflow) by a factor of ~5 (~1.7) at z&gt;8.</description>

      <title>A New Catalog of Head Tail Radio Galaxies from the VLA FIRST Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The head--tail (HT) morphology of radio galaxies is seen for a class of radio sources where the primary lobes are being bent in the intercluster weather due to strong interactions between the radio jets and their respective intracluster medium. A systematic search has been carried out for new HT radio galaxies from the Very Large Array Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters survey database at $1400\,\mathrm{MHz}$. Here, we present a catalog of 717 new HT sources, among which 287 are narrow-angle tail (NAT) sources whose opening angle between the two lobes is less than $90^\circ$, and 430 are wide-angle tail (WAT) whose opening angle between the two lobes is greater than $90^\circ$. NAT radio sources are characterized by tails bent in a narrow ``V''-like shape; the jet bending in the case of WAT radio galaxies are such that the WATs exhibit wide ``C''-like morphologies. Optical counterparts are found for 359 HT sources. We report HT sources with luminosity ranges $10^{38} \lesssim L_{1.4\,\mathrm{GHz}} \lesssim 10^{45}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ and redshifts up to 2.01. The various physical properties of these HT sources are mentioned here. Some statistical studies have been done for this large number of newly discovered HT sources.</description>

      <title>Simulating the spatial distributions of gas- and ice-phase molecules in galaxies: a new method and preliminary results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations have revealed significant variations in the abundances of gas- and ice-phase molecules in galaxies with different luminosities and types. In order to discuss the physical origins of these variations, we incorporate gas- and dust-phase interstellar chemistry into galaxy-scale simulations with various baryonic physics including dust formation, evolution, and destruction, all of which are essential for the calculations of 400 interstellar molecule species. The new simulations can accordingly predict the abundances of gas- and ice-phase molecular species such as H_2O and CO_2 ice within individual molecular gas cloud of galaxies based on gas density and temperature, dust temperature (T_dust), elemental abundances (e.g., CHNOPS), UV radiation strength (F_UV), and cosmic ray ionisation rate (zeta_CR) within the clouds. Since this is the first of the series of papers, we describe the details of the new simulations and present the preliminary results focused on the spatial distributions of H_2O, CO, CO_2, and CH_3OH ice species in a disk galaxy similar to the Milky Way. We particularly discuss how T_dust and gas-phase elemental abundances can control the spatial distributions of the above molecules in galaxies. We briefly discuss the total amount of H_2O and CO_2 ices and radial distributions of PN and PO molecules in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Ages of Stars with Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical clocks, based on age-sensitive stellar abundance ratios, offer a powerful and scalable approach to reconstruct the formation history of the Milky Way. This white paper outlines how wide-field, high-resolution spectroscopy can transform chemical clocks into precise and broadly applicable stellar age estimators when combined with astrometry and asteroseismology. We summarize the current limitations, including calibration across Galactic environments and the impact of internal stellar evolution, and define the observational requirements needed to overcome them. The Wide-field Spectroscopic Telescope (WST), with its large field of view, high multiplex, and broad wavelength coverage at high spectral resolution, is uniquely suited to deliver the homogeneous datasets required to map the age structure of the Galaxy at unprecedented scale. Such a capability will enable decisive progress in Galactic archaeology and stellar evolution studies.</description>

Abstract: Dust is an important tracer of the structure of interstellar clouds, as well as a central factor in the thermal balance and chemistry of the clouds. Our knowledge of the dust properties is nevertheless incomplete, especially regarding the dense star-forming clouds. The aim is to study dust evolution in the Orion Molecular Cloud 3 (OMC-3) and how uncertainty regarding dust properties affects estimates of the radiation field and the cloud mass. We constructed three-dimensional radiative transfer (RT) models to fit the far-infrared (FIR) observations of dust emission in the OMC-3 field and used near-infrared (NIR) extinction measurements as additional constraints. We examined fits to the dense star-forming filaments and to the surrounding cloud, including some tests with spatial dust property variations.The 160-250 $\mu$m observations of dust emission could be fitted moderately well with any of the dust models tested, but few models are consistent with the measured NIR extinction. The best match to observations is found with dust models such as the THEMIS model of large porous grains, with or without ice mantles, and with mean grain sizes up to ~ 0.3$\mu$m. The flattening of the NIR extinction curve excludes larger grain sizes, except possibly in the central ridge. Compared to models of lower column density clouds, the results were relatively insensitive to the line-of-sight (LOS) cloud size and the spectral shape of the heating radiation field. In addition, the effect of embedded stars remained very localised in OMC-3. The results suggest that the dust in the OMC-3 region is evolved with a grain of average size $a$=0.1-0.3 $\mu$m, potentially with ice mantles.</description>

      <title>Non-detection of J1407b in ALMA Band 7 Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on ALMA Band 7 continuum observations towards the star 1SWASP J140747.93-394542.6 taken in mid 2024. These observations were a follow-up of a previous detection of an emission source in the J1407 field of view at an unexpected position in 2017. Proper motion analysis indicated that if this were the object responsible for the 2007 eclipse of J1407, it would be detectable at a new position, but still within an ALMA field of view in 2024. Here we present the non-detection of emission in the ALMA field of view (to a 1{\sigma} upper limit of 17.5 {\mu}Jy),at both the 2017 position, and the position expected from proper motions. We place upper limits on a source at the proper motion corrected expected location in this 2024 data, and rule out the possibility of a dusty object being responsible for the 2007 eclipse</description>

      <title>APOGEE physical properties of globular cluster tidal tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent model prediction claimed that exists a correlation between the formation scenarios of globular clusters, i.e., whether they formed in situ, or in dark matter halos that were accreted into the Milky way, with some properties of their tidal tails, particularly, their widths ($w$), their dispersion in the z-component of the angular momentum ($\sigma$$_{\rm L_z}$ ), and in the line-of-sight ($\sigma$$_{\rm V_{LOS}}$) and tangential ($\sigma$$_{\rm V_{Tan}}$) velocities. I exploited the APOGEE DR17 data base and selected highly confident tidal tails members of 17 Milky Way globular clusters, for which the above four properties were computed for the first time. From all possible paired property combinations, I found that $\sigma$$_{\rm V_{LOS}}$ and $\sigma$$_{\rm V_{Tan}}$ resulted to be highly correlated, nearly to the identity relationship. This observation-based correlation resulted to be in an overall very good agreement with that arising from the aforementioned predictions. Additionally, when the four analyzed properties are linked to the accretion groups of the Milky way to which the globular clusters are meant to be associated, I found kinematically cold and hot tidal tails pertaining to globular clusters distributed in all the considered accretion groups. This outcome could be an evidence that globular clusters form in galaxies within a wide variety of dark matter halos, with different masses and profiles.</description>

      <title>Tidally Perturbed, Rotating Stellar Systems: Asynchronous Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new three-parameter family of self-consistent equilibrium models for quasi-relaxed stellar systems that are subject to the combined action of external tides and rigid internal rotation. These models provide an idealised description of globular clusters that rotate asynchronously with respect to their orbital motion around a host galaxy. Model construction proceeds by extension of the truncated King models, using a newly defined asynchronicity parameter to couple the tidal and rotational perturbations. The method of matched asymptotic expansion is used to derive a global solution to the free boundary problem posed by the corresponding set of Poisson-Laplace equations. We explore the relevant parameter space and outline the intrinsic properties of the resulting models, both structural and kinematic. Their triaxial configuration, characterised by extension in the direction of the galactic centre and flattening toward the orbital plane, is found to depart further from spherical symmetry for larger values of the asynchronicity parameter. We hope that these simplified analytical models serve as useful tools for investigating the interplay of tidal and rotational effects, providing an equilibrium description that complements, and may serve as a basis for, more realistic numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>HALO I: Photometric continuum reverberation mapping of Fairall~9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the origin of inter-band continuum time delays in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) to study the structure and properties of their accretion disks. We aim to measure the inter-band continuum time delays through photometric monitoring of Seyfert galaxy Fairall~9 to construct the lag-spectrum. Additionally, we explain the observed features in the Fairall~9 lag-spectrum and discuss the potential drivers behind them, based on our newly collected data from the Obserwatorium Cerro Murphy (OCM) telescope. We initiated a long-term, continuous AGN photometric monitoring program in 2024, titled 'Hubble constant constraints through AGN Light curve Observations' (HALO) using intermediate and broad band filters. Here, we present the first results from HALO, focusing on photometric light curves and continuum time-delay measurements for Fairall~9. To complement these observations and extend the wavelength coverage of the lag-spectrum, we also reanalyzed archival Swift light curves and spectroscopic data available in the literature. Using HALO and Swift light curves, we measured inter-band continuum delays to construct the lag-spectrum of Fairall~9. Excess lags appear in the $u$ and $U$ bands (Balmer continuum contamination) and in the $I$ band (Paschen jump/dust emission from the torus). Overall, the lag-spectrum deviates significantly from standard disk model predictions. We find that inter-band delays deviate from the power-law, $\tau_{\lambda} \propto \lambda^{\beta}$ due to BLR scattering, reprocessing, and dust contributions at longer wavelengths. Power-law fits are therefore not well suited for characterizing the nature of the time delays.</description>

      <title>Standardizing reverberation-mapped H$\beta$ active galactic nuclei using time-averaged radius$-$luminosity relations with 5100\,\AA\,, broad H$\beta$, and narrow \OIII\ luminosities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been studied as alternate probes in cosmology due to their large and stable luminosities and broad redshift range. Previously it was shown that higher-redshift AGN that were reverberation-mapped (RM) using broad Mg\,\textsc{ii} and C\,\textsc{iv} lines are standardizable and yield weak cosmological constraints that are consistent with those from better-established probes. In contrast, lower-redshift AGN that were reverberation-mapped using the broad H$\beta$ line exhibited tensions with the standard cosmological model, in particular they preferred currently decelerating cosmological expansion. Here we study the standardizability of a homogeneous RM H$\beta$ sample of $\sim 100$ AGN (over redshifts $0.00308 \leq z \leq 0.8429$), whose H$\beta$ time delays and three luminosity tracers (at 5100\,\AA\,, broad H$\beta$, and narrow [O\,\textsc{iii}]) are averaged over several epochs. We find that this averaged sample is standardizable using three $R-L$ relations. While for luminosities corresponding to 5100\,\AA\, and the broad H$\beta$ line the cosmological constraints prefer currently decelerating cosmological expansion, the cosmological parameters for the narrow [O\,\textsc{iii}] luminosity are more consistent with those from better-established probes and they are in agreement with currently accelerating cosmological expansion. This demonstrates for the first time that narrow-line region [O\,\textsc{iii}] can be utilized for AGN standardization and cosmological constraints. Selecting proper photoionizing flux proxies for the broad-line region is thus crucial in studies of RM AGN standardizability.</description>

      <title>Super-resolving Herschel -- a deep learning based deconvolution and denoising technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) dominate the far-infrared and sub-millimetre number counts, but single-dish surveys suffer from poor angular resolution, complicating mult-wavelength counterpart identification. Prior-driven deblending techniques require extensive fine-tuning and struggle to process large fields. This work aims to develop a fast, reliable deep-learning based deconvolution and denoising super-resolution (SR) technique. We employ a transformer neural network to improve the resolution of Herschel/SPIRE 500 $\mu$m observations by a factor 4.5, using Spitzer/MIPS 24$\mu$m and Herschel/SPIRE 250, 350, 500$\mu$m images. Trained on SIDES and SHARK simulations, we injected instrumental noise into the input simulated images, while keeping the target images noise-free to enhance de-noising capabilities of our method.
  We evaluated the performance on simulated test sets and real JCMT/SCUBA-2 450 $\mu$m observations in the COSMOS field which have superior resolution compared to Herschel. Our SR method achieves an inference time of $1s/deg^2$ on consumer GPUs, much faster than traditional deblending techniques. Using the simulation test sets, we show that fluxes of the extracted sources from the super-resolved image are accurate to within 5% for sources with an intrinsic flux $\gtrsim$ 8 mJy, which is a substantial improvement compared to blind extraction on the native images. Astrometric error is low ($\lesssim$ 1" vs 12" pixel scale). Reliability is $\gtrsim$ 90% for sources $&gt;$3 mJy and $&gt;$90% of sources with intrinsic fluxes $\gtrsim5$ mJy are recovered. Applied to real 500 $\mu$m observations, fluxes of the extracted sources from the super-resolved map agree well with SCUBA-2 measured fluxes for sources $\geq$10 mJy. Our technique enables SR over hundreds of $deg^2$ without the need for fine-tuning, facilitating statistical analysis of DSFGs.</description>

      <title>ALMA view on the nature of the compact VLA continuum sources in the massive young stellar object G25.65+1.05</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents high-resolution ALMA observations of the massive young stellar object G25.65+1.05, which is known to host water maser super flares. To investigate the nature of compact continuum sources that have been previously identified in this region, we analyzed 1.3 mm dust continuum and molecular line emission. The central millimeter peak MM1 coincides with the centimeter source VLA 2, has a complex molecular spectrum, and is identified as a hot molecular core. Molecular emission of SiO and CH3CN in the vicinity of MM1 reveals kinematics consistent with wide-angle outflow structures and a possible rotating disk in the source. VLA sources 1A, 1B, and 3 are lacking compact millimeter counterparts and trace shocked regions where the outflow interacts with the surrounding material. In particular, VLA 1A, the site of H2O maser super flares, is interpreted as a shock interface that exhibits developed turbulent movements seen in the SiO molecular line. The observed turbulence creates conditions required for H2O maser action, directly linking the nature of VLA 1A to the origin of the H2O maser super flares.</description>

      <title>The PAU Survey: Uncovering the connection between intrinsic and observed galaxy properties using symbolic regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating stellar masses for billions of galaxies in upcoming surveys requires methods that are both accurate and computationally efficient. We present a new approach using symbolic regression trained on a simulation to derive simple, explicit mathematical expressions that estimate galaxy stellar masses from basic observables: photometry and redshift. Using a mock catalogue from the GALFORM semi-analytical model that reproduces the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS), we show that a linear combination of just four observables -- minimally processed $u$- and $i$- band magnitudes, observed $(g-r)$ colour, and redshift -- can recover stellar masses with accuracy comparable to traditional spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, but with negligible computational cost. Our expressions can be evaluated instantaneously for millions of galaxies, making them ideal for next-generation surveys like LSST and Euclid. When observational errors are included, symbolic regression achieves a similar accuracy to deep neural networks while maintaining transparency. Validation against CIGALE SED fitting on PAUS data shows agreement within 0.13 dex for galaxies with $M_{*} &gt; 10^8 M_{\odot}$. We demonstrate that the stellar mass function can be recovered at $z &lt; 0.5$, though with distortions at the extremes: the high-mass end is overestimated by a factor of $\sim 3$ at $10^{11.5} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$ due to scatter. Our approach offers a fast, transparent alternative to traditional methods without sacrificing accuracy for the bulk of the galaxy population.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Measuring Black Hole Masses using TDEs with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) provide an opportunity to study supermassive black holes that are otherwise quiescent. The Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time will be capable of discovering thousands of TDEs each year, allowing for a dramatic increase in the number of discovered TDEs. The optical light curves from TDEs can be used to model the physical parameters of the black hole and disrupted star, but the sampling and photometric uncertainty of the real data will couple with model degeneracies to limit our ability to recover these parameters. In this work, we aim to model the impact of the Rubin survey strategy on simulated TDE light curves to quantify the typical errors in the recovered parameters. Black hole masses $5.5&lt; \log M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot &lt; 8.2$ can be recovered with typical errors of 0.26 dex, with early coverage removing large outliers. Recovery of the mass of the disrupted star is difficult, limited by the degeneracy with the accretion efficiency. Only 57\% of the cases have accurate recovery of whether the events are full or partial, so we caution the use this method to assess whether TDEs are partially or fully disrupted systems. Black hole mass measurements obtained from Rubin observations of TDEs will provide powerful constraints on the black hole mass function, black hole -- galaxy co-evolution, and the population of black hole spins, though continued work to understand the origin of TDE observables and how the TDE rate varies among galaxies will be necessarily to fully utilize the upcoming rich data set from Rubin.</description>

      <title>The excess of molecular hydrogen in chemical networks without oxygen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the presence of a systematic excess in the molecular hydrogen fraction ($f_{\mathrm{H2}} = 2 \, n_{\mathrm{H2}}/n_{\mathrm{H}}$) in studies that use a reduced chemistry network to calculate $f_{\mathrm{H2}}$ of gas with a non-zero metal mass fraction. This is common practice in simulations of galaxy formation in which following the non-equilibrium abundances of additional elements is computationally expensive. We define the $\mathrm{H}_2$ excess as the shift in density of the \ion{H}{I}-$\mathrm{H}_2$ transition in the reduced network compared to the full chemical network (30 elements). The strength of the $\mathrm{H}_2$ excess generally increases both with temperature and metallicity, is largely independent of the radiation field strength, and persists across a large range of assumed shielding column densities. For warm gas, with $T\approx1000~\mathrm{K}$, the HI-$\mathrm{H}_2$ transition is shifted by up to 1 dex to lower densities in primordial chemistry networks already for extremely low metallicities ($Z\geq 10^{-4}\,\mathrm{Z}_{\odot}$). We confirm our earlier findings that missing reactions with oxygen are largely responsible for this $\mathrm{H}_2$ excess. A reduced chemical network of hydrogen, helium, and oxygen recovers the molecular hydrogen fractions from a full network and we therefore recommend to include destruction of molecular hydrogen by oxygen in a minimal chemical network for accurate molecular hydrogen abundances.</description>

      <title>Identification of periodicities with arbitrary shapes in AGN light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive black hole binaries are expected to be observable as periodic AGN in time-domain photometric surveys. Periodicities may originate from different physical processes, including the intermittent gas feeding of the black holes caused by the time-varying non-axisymmetric binary potential, the Doppler boosting of the flux emitted by individual accretion discs bound to the orbiting BHs, and the gravitational lensing of the accretion disc of one black hole due to the presence of the other. Only the Doppler boost scenario applied to circular binaries with non-modulated accretion predicts a sinusoidal light curve, while in the general case, binary signals are expected to show more complex periodic patterns. Current searches for massive black hole binaries rely on techniques tailored to quasi-sinusoidal light curves, but fail to identify the more complex periodicities predicted. We present an alternative method that leverages Gaussian processes, making use of a generic periodic kernel flexible enough for the identification of arbitrary periodicities in unevenly sampled light curves with realistic quasar noise. We demonstrate that it outperforms previously proposed strategies in identifying general periodicities by analysing mock light curves with different baselines. Specifically, we find that our analysis can detect non-sinusoidal periodicities (e.g., sawtooth-shaped) and retrieves a higher fraction of true periodicities when compared to periodogram analysis or Gaussian processes analysis with less flexible periodic kernels. Furthermore, by comparing the retrieved fraction of periodicities between mock PTF light curves and mock LSST light curves, we find that our analysis is most sensitive to the number of observed cycles. The application of this analysis has the potential to greatly increase the scientific return of current and upcoming large time-domain photometric surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate optical variability across multiple timescales in a sample of radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert~1 (RL-NLSy1) galaxies, including $\gamma$-ray detected, $\gamma$-ray undetected, and non-jetted systems along with a comparison set of highly polarised core-dominated quasars (HPQs). Using Zwicky Transient Facility light curves, we measure fractional variability ($F_{\rm var}$) and rest-frame structure functions (SFs) to test whether short-term jet-linked variability is reflected in long-term behaviour. $\gamma$-ray detected RL-NLSy1s and HPQs show steeply rising SFs, revealing strong long-term coherence despite modest $F_{\rm var}$, consistent with Doppler-boosted synchrotron emission from relativistic jets. Non-jetted RL-NLSy1s exhibit the highest $F_{\rm var}$ but plateauing SFs, indicative of stochastic, disc-driven fluctuations lacking long-term coherence. $\gamma$-ray undetected RL-NLSy1s show the lowest $F_{\rm var}$ and nearly flat SFs, consistent with weak or absent jet activity across all timescales. Colour-magnitude trends show that jet-dominated sources exhibit redder-when-brighter behaviour, whereas disc-dominated systems exhibit bluer-when-brighter trends. These results show that SF-derived temporal coherence, rather than variability amplitude alone, is a promising diagnostic of jet dominance and orientation, offering a framework for interpreting AGN variability in forthcoming time-domain surveys.</description>

      <title>ESO Expanding Horizons White Paper: Electromagnetic characterisation of millihertz gravitational-wave sources in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The millihertz band is densely populated by continuous gravitational-wave signals from Galactic compact binaries, dominated by double white dwarfs (DWDs; binaries of two white dwarfs) with contributions from systems containing neutron stars and black holes (Amaro-Seoane et al. 2023). As these binaries inspiral due to gravitational-wave radiation, they can reach contact and begin mass transfer in the millihertz band. Gravitational-wave detectors like LISA will survey such compact binaries across the Milky Way, yielding samples numbering in the tens of thousands, with essentially complete sensitivity to orbital periods shorter than ~10-20 min (e.g. Lamberts et al. 2019). Assessing the nature of the binary components - and deriving masses, temperatures and compositions - requires systematic electromagnetic characterisation that breaks gravitational-wave degeneracies and enables full atmospheric and orbital solutions. At present, no dedicated facility or coordinated survey is planned to deliver electromagnetic follow-up at the scale necessary to maximise the science return of the millihertz gravitational-wave data; this white paper discusses the need and requirements of such a capability.</description>

      <title>Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM): Projected rotational velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM) survey is an ESO large programme designed to obtain multi-epoch spectroscopy for 929 massive stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). It will provide binary fractions and orbital configurations of binary systems, and search for dormant black-hole binary candidates (OB+BH). Here we present projected rotational velocities (vsini) of all sources and, using the multiplicity properties presented in previous papers, we derive the vsini distributions of apparent single stars, single lined spectroscopic (SB1) binaries, and SB2 systems. We identify a locus in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram where rotational velocities decrease significantly; we interpret this feature as broadly corresponding to the terminal-age main sequence. The main sequence cohort is distinguished by a broad range of vsini values, but with a strong peak in the distribution in the range 30-60 km/s, close to the resolution limit of 30 km/s. Sources in this low vsini peak are distributed throughout the main sequence, and are also present in the SB1 sample, though less prominent than in the single star distribution. A preliminary analysis of the lowest vsini cohort, that includes SB1 systems, implies that roughly one third may be nitrogen rich and we speculate that this cohort is a mix of pristine single stars, long period binaries, and merger products. The SB2 systems appear to be mostly short period binaries in synchronous rotation and have vsini estimates distributed around a mean value of approximately 140 km/s . Higher vsini sources are also present in the single and SB1 systems, all of which have tail to higher vsini values, consistent with tidal and mass-transfer effects. The supergiants, with a few exceptions, have low vsini, the bulk of these systems being essentially unresolved at current spectral resolution.</description>

      <title>eROSITA-RU Tidal Disruption Events with Keck-I/LRIS: Sample Selection, Optical Properties, and Host Galaxy Demographics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We select seventy tidal disruption event (TDE) candidates among X-ray transients discovered during the eROSITA all-sky surveys in the Eastern Galactic hemisphere between December 2020 and February 2022 (eRASS1--5). We cross-match each X-ray source to a host galaxy in archival optical surveys using Bayesian likelihood-ratio techniques and obtain Keck/LRIS spectroscopy for all 70 host galaxies. Host properties are inferred through SED fitting with Prospector and emission line analysis with pPXF. We develop a robust classification scheme using X-ray and broad line luminosities, narrow-line ionization diagnostics, and optical variability to identify high-confidence TDEs, for which we analyze optical spectral features, light curve properties, and host galaxy demographics. Our final sample contains 52 TDEs with redshifts of $0.018 \leq z\leq0.714$, comprising 41 gold (high-confidence) and 11 silver (lower-confidence) events. The vast majority (93\%) of gold TDEs are intrinsically brighter in the X-ray band, with $L_{\rm X,peak} &gt; L_{\rm opt,peak}$. Among 23 events with detected optical flares, delayed X-ray peak is commonly observed. We identify transient spectral features in eight events, including six with prominent broad \ion{He}{II} $\lambda$4686 and/or H$\alpha$ emission and two coronal-line TDEs. Host galaxy demographics reveal modest over-representation in green valley ($\times1.8$) and quiescent Balmer-strong ($\times5.3$) galaxies, significantly weaker than previous TDE samples, demonstrating greater diversity in star formation histories than previously recognized. Most TDE hosts exhibit suppressed star formation relative to the main sequence, consistent with X-ray selection biases against dusty star-forming galaxies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mega-MUSE Nearby Galaxy Serendipity Survey is a White Paper in response to the ESO Expanding Horizons Call for Ideas. It is based on the notion that novel observing facilities for astronomy almost always make discoveries that were not anticipated at the time of planning and conceptual design. Unlike other surveys it is not targeting the solution of a single specific astrophysical problem, but enables the exploitation of data obtained from other surveys in Local Group and Local Volume galaxies to clarify open science questions that cannot be solved otherwise. The most prominent objectives are to obtain solid statistics of rare stars and gaseous nebulae as well as their properties that are not accessible in the Milky Way disk due to extinction and selection effects, and the discovery of as yet unknown phenomena.</description>

      <title>Probing Periodic and Aperiodic Variability of X-ray Sources in M31, M81 and Centaurus A with Chandra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on archival Chandra observations, we present a systematic timing survey of several hundred X-ray sources in M31, M81, and Centaurus A, mostly low-mass X-ray binaries (LXMBs), focusing on searching and characterizing aperiodic and periodic variability within single observation. We identify flares in 24 sources in M31, 5 in M81, and 26 in Cen~A; several display recurrent events. Flare durations span from tens of seconds to a few $10^{4}$ s, with peak luminosities of $10^{37}$-$10^{40}\ \mathrm{erg\ s^{-1}}$ and low flare duty cycles of $4.9\times10^{-6}$-$3.5\times10^{-2}$. Dipping events are found in 8 sources in M31, 1 in M81, and 5 in Cen A, including two repeaters. On multi-epoch baselines, the standard deviation of the source luminosity correlates linearly with the mean luminosity, with a coefficient of 0.49 (M31), 0.30 (M81), and 0.67 (Cen A), indicating galaxy-to-galaxy diversity. No statistically significant periodic signals are detected in M81 or Cen A, which, along with several periodic signals previously found among the M31 sources, can be understood considering a joint effect of our detection sensitivity and intrinsic distributions of the orbital period and X-ray luminosity of LMXBs. The ensemble of short-duty-cycle flares, a mix of recurrent and isolated dips, and galaxy-dependent rms--flux factor, supports a picture in which stochastic accretion-rate fluctuations modulate luminosity on $\sim$10-$10^{4}$ s. Conducted at known distances and across distinct host environments, this extragalactic survey provides uniform flare/dip samples and rms-flux scalings for bulge-dominated fields, offering empirical constraints for accretion physics and illustrating the promise of timing analyses in external galaxies using the Chandra archive.</description>

      <title>Disentangling AGN Feedback and Sloshing in the Perseus Cluster with XRISM: Insights from Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with XRISM has revealed complex, non-monotonic velocity dispersion profiles in the Perseus cluster, pointing to a complex interplay between at least two physical drivers of motions caused by dynamical processes within the intracluster medium (ICM). To further explore this conclusion, we perform a suite of idealized, controlled simulations targeting the relative roles of merger-induced sloshing and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. Our models systematically isolate and combine these mechanisms to predict observable velocity profiles and X-ray line shapes, providing direct comparison to XRISM and Hitomi data. We find that neither sloshing nor AGN activity alone can reproduce the observed velocity dispersion profile; only their combined action matches the elevated dispersions both at the cluster core and outskirts. Power-spectrum analysis reveals distinct spatial signatures: sloshing generates large-scale coherent motions, while AGN feedback injects turbulence and broadens the velocity spectrum at small scales, especially in the core. By forward-modeling spectral line profiles, we show how these dynamics imprint unique observational signatures on X-ray emission. Our results underscore the necessity of accounting for both large-scale and small-scale drivers of gas motions in the ICM when interpreting high-resolution spectroscopic data, and provide guidance for the analysis of forthcoming XRISM observations.</description>

      <title>Pre-perihelion detection of a wobbling high-latitude jet in the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present observations of the detection of a faint high-latitude jet in the inner coma of comet 3I/ATLAS that coincides with the broad plume detected in visible images along PA $280 \pm 10^{\circ}$. A detailed analysis shows that the jet was clearly detected on seven nights (2025, August~3, 5, 18, 19, 21, 24, and~29). The jet maintains an almost, though not perfectly, constant position angle (PA) throughout these epochs. High-precision PA measurements at a projected distance of 6000~km from the cometary optocenter reveal a periodic modulation centered at ~ 280 degrees, consistent with a high-latitude jet undergoing precessional motion around the sky-projected spin axis of the nucleus. This is the first periodic jet-angle modulation detected in an interstellar comet. The derived periodicity of $7.74 \pm 0.35$ h may imply a nucleus rotation period of $P_{\mathrm{rot}} = 15.48 \pm 0.70$ h if the jet originates from a single active source near one of the poles. This value is slightly shorter than the period of $P_{\mathrm{rot}} = 16.79 \pm 0.23$ h derived from the photometric time series. From the measured PA range, the sky-projected orientation of the spin axis is derived as $\mathrm{PA} = 280.7 \pm 0.2^{\circ}$</description>

      <title>VLBI astrometry of radio stars to link radio and optical celestial reference frames III: 11 radio stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The alignment between the radio-based International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) and the optical Gaia Celestial Reference Frame (Gaia-CRF) is critical for multi-waveband astronomy, yet systematic offsets at the optical bright end (G&lt;13) limit their consistency. While radio stars offer a potential link between these frames, their utility has been restricted by the scarcity of precise Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) astrometry. In this study, we present new VLBI astrometry of 11 radio stars using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), expanding the existing sample with positions, parallaxes, and proper motions measured. All 11 radio stars were detected, for 10 of which parallaxes and proper motions can be estimated, reaching a precision level of &lt;1% in the best cases. These new samples greatly contribute to the link between ICRF and Gaia-CRF at the optical bright end.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the extension of the differentiable hydrodynamics code, diffhydro, enabling scalable PDE-constrained inference and integrated hybrid physics-ML models for a wide range of astrophysical applications. New physics additions include radiative heating/cooling, OU-driven turbulence, and self-gravity via multigrid Poisson. We demonstrate good agreement with the Athena++ code on standard validation tests such as Sedov-Taylor, Kelvin-Helmholtz, and driven/decaying turbulence. We further introduce a solver-in-the-loop neural corrector that reduces coarse-grid errors during time integration while preserving stability. The addition of custom adjoints facilitates efficient end-to-end gradients and multi-device scaling. We present simulations up to 1024^3 elements, run on distributed GPU systems, and we show gradient-based reconstructions of complex initial conditions in turbulent, self-gravitating, radiatively cooling flows. The code is written in JAX, and the solver's modular finite-volume components are compiled by XLA into fused accelerator kernels, delivering high-throughput forward runs and tractable differentiation through long integrations.</description>

      <title>The stellar to sub-stellar masses transition in 47 Tuc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: The study of the Globular Cluster 47 Tuc offers the opportunity to shed new light on the debated issue on the presence of multiple populations in Globular Clusters, as recent results from HST photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy outlined star-to-star differences in the surface chemical composition.
  Aims: The goal of the present investigation is the interpretation of recent JWST data of the low main sequence of 47 Tuc, in order to explore the stellar to sub-stellar transition, to derive the mass distribution of the individual sources and to disentangle stars from different populations.
  Methods: Stellar evolution modelling of low-mass stars of metallicity [Fe/H]=-0.78 and oxygen content [O/Fe]=+0.4 and [O/Fe]=0 is used to simulate the evolution of the first and the second generation of the cluster. The comparison between the calculated sequences with the data points is used to characterize the individual objects, to split the different stellar components and to infer the current mass function of the cluster.
  Results: The first generation of 47 Tuc harbours 45 % of the overall population of the cluster, the remaining 55 % making up the second generation. The transition from the stellar to the sub-stellar domain is found at $0.074 M_{\odot}$ and $0.07 M_{\odot}$ for the first and second generations, respectively. The mass function of both the stellar generations are consistent with a Kroupa-like profile down to $0.22 M_\odot$.</description>

Abstract: In this white paper we focus on compact stellar systems, star clusters, nuclear star clusters (NSCs), stripped nuclei, and ultra-compact dwarfs (UCDs), as engines of galaxy evolution and black-hole growth. We show how the same capability also enables transformative science in active galactic nucleus (AGN) fuelling, stellar surfaces and interacting binaries, and exoplanet atmospheres. These science drivers are naturally aligned with a next-generation kilometre-scale optical/IR interferometer for the 2040s that reuses existing ESO infrastructure while adding diffraction-limited integral-field spectroscopy (IFS).</description>

      <title>Tracing the Early Milky Way with Globular Clusters: The Diagnostic Power of Neutron-Capture Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) are fundamental tracers of the early assembly of the Milky Way (MW). They formed in diverse environments -- including both our Galaxy and dwarf galaxies -- retaining chemical and dynamical signatures that encode their origins and the merger history of the Galaxy. Although significant progress has been made in characterising GC chemistry, most studies have focused on light, $\alpha$-, and iron-peak elements. In contrast, neutron-capture (n-capture) elements remain sparsely investigated across the GC system, despite their unique ability to trace nucleosynthetic channels and star-formation timescales. A homogeneous and statistically robust mapping of n-process elements in a large sample of GCs would provide powerful constraints on their formation environments, chemical signatures of in situ and accreted systems, and refine our understanding of the early chemical evolution of the MW halo. Addressing this gap requires high-resolution, multiplexing, and blue-sensitive spectroscopy capable of accessing the full suite of n-capture diagnostics in several tens of stars per GC.</description>

      <title>Bridging Simulations and EFT: A Hybrid Model of the Lyman-Alpha Forest Field</title>

Abstract: The Lyman-alpha (Lya) forest is a unique probe of cosmology and the intergalactic medium at high redshift and small scales. The statistical power of the ongoing Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) demands precise theoretical tools to model the Lya forest. We present a hybrid effective field theory (HEFT) forward model in redshift space that leverages the accuracy of non-linear particle displacements computed using the N-body simulation suite AbacusSummit with the predictive power of an analytical, perturbative bias forward model in the framework of the effective field theory (EFT). The residual noise between the model and the simulated Lya field has a nearly white (scale-and orientation-independent) power spectrum on quasi-linear scales, substantially simplifying its modeling compared to a purely perturbative description. As a consequence of the improved control over the 3D Lya forest stochasticity, we find agreement between the modeled and the true power spectra at the 5 per cent level down to scales of k &lt;= 1 h/Mpc. This procedure offers a promising path toward constructing efficient and accurate emulators to predict large-scale clustering summary statistics for full-shape cosmological analyses of Lya forest data from both DESI and its successor, DESI-II.</description>

      <title>Overdense fireworks in GOODS-N: Unveiling a record number of massive dusty star forming galaxies at z$\sim$5.2 with the N2CLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As part of the N2CLS Survey, we have identified a remarkable overdensity of eight bright dusty star-forming galaxies at z$\sim$5.2 in the GOODS-N field. Three of these galaxies, N2GN_1_01, 06, and 23 (known as GN10, HDF850.1, and S3, respectively), had previously been spectroscopically confirmed as members of the exceptional large-scale structure at z$\sim$5.1-5.3, which is notably elongated along the line of sight, spanning 30 cMpc. We present the spectroscopic confirmation of N2GN_1_13 at z$_{\rm spec}$=5.182, a massive dusty star-forming galaxy identified through targeted NOEMA observations, and N2GN_1_61 at z$_{\rm spec}$=5.201, revealed using JWST/FRESCO data. In addition to these five spectroscopically confirmed members, we identify three further candidates with photometric redshifts consistent with the overdense structure. These galaxies are massive (with a median stellar mass of 9x 10$^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$) and highly obscured (with a median A$_V$ of 3.3), caught in a short-lived yet extreme starburst phase at z$\sim$5.2. Their high SFRs (with a median of 590 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$), efficient baryon to stellar mass conversion ($\epsilon_{\star}&gt;$20%), substantial gas reservoir and dust content, suggest rapid evolution and imminent quenching. Six of these galaxies reside in overdense filaments; the remaining two may trace new distinct structures which will have to be spectroscopically confirmed. These few dusty galaxies dominate the star formation within the overdensity, contributing more than the numerous H$_{\alpha}$ emitters, and surpassing the cosmic average star formation rate density for this epoch. Their properties suggest an accelerated evolution that current models and simulations have difficulty reproducing.</description>

      <title>The Spheroidal Bulge of the Milky Way: Chemodynamically Distinct from the Inner-Thick Disc and Bar</title>

Abstract: Studying the composition and origin of the inner region of our Galaxy -- the "Galactic bulge" -- is crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of the Milky Way and other galaxies. We present new observational constraints based on a sample of around 18,000 stars in the inner Galaxy, combining Gaia DR3 RVS and APOGEE DR17 spectroscopy. Gaia-RVS complements APOGEE by improving sampling of the metallicity, [Fe/H] in the -2.0 to -0.5 dex range. This work marks the first application of Gaia-RVS spectroscopy to the bulge region, enabled by a novel machine learning approach (hybrid-CNN) that derives stellar parameters from intermediate-resolution spectra with precision comparable to APOGEE's infrared data. We performed full orbit integrations using a barred Galactic potential and applied orbital frequency analysis to disentangle the stellar populations in the inner Milky Way. For the first time, traced by the field stars, we are able to robustly identify the long-sought pressure supported bulge. We show this stellar population to be chemically and kinematically distinct from the other main components co-existing in the same region. The spheroidal bulge has a metallicity distribution function (MDF) peak at around -0.70 dex extending to solar value, is dominated by a high-[alpha/Fe] population with almost no dependency on metallicity, consistent with very rapid early formation, predating the thick disc and the bar. We find evidence that the bar has influenced the dynamics of the spheroidal bulge, introducing a mild triaxiality and radial extension. We identify a group of stars on X4 orbits, likely native to the early spheroid, as this population mimics the chemistry of the spheroidal bulge, with a minor contamination from the more metal-poor ([Fe/H] &lt; -1.0) halo. We find the inner-thick disc to be kinematically hotter (mean Vphi ~125 km/s) than the local-thick disc. ...</description>

      <title>Supernovae drive large-scale, incompressible turbulence through small-scale instabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sources of turbulence in our Galaxy may be diverse, but core-collapse supernovae (SNe) alone provide enough energy to sustain a steady-state galactic turbulence cascade at the observed velocity dispersion. By localizing and analyzing supernova remnants (SNRs) in high-resolution SN-driven galactic disk cut-out simulations from Beattie et al. (2025), I show that isolated SNRs source incompressible turbulence through baroclinic vorticity generation localized at the unstable contact discontinuity. Through the spherical harmonic power spectrum of the corrugations, I provide evidence that this process is seeded by surface instabilities and 2D turbulence on the shell, which corrugates and folds the interface, becoming the strongest source of baroclinicity in the simulations. I present an analytical relation for a baroclinicity-fed incompressible mode (co)spectrum, which matches that observed in the simulated SNRs, and reveals a $k^{-17/20}$ spectrum that drives the turbulence. I show that vortex stretching allows for modes to be shed from the contact discontinuity into the surrounding medium and derive a timescale criteria for this process, revealing that young SNR with radii close to the cooling radius are efficient at radiating turbulence. The unstable layer produces a spectrum of incompressible modes $\propto k^{-3/2}$ locally within the SNRs. Through the inverse cascade mechanism revealed in Beattie et al. (2025), this opens the possibility that the $k^{-3/2}$ spectrum, arising from corrugated folds in the unstable layer, imprints itself on kiloparsec scales, thereby connecting small-scale structure in the layer to the large-scale incompressible turbulence cascade.</description>

      <title>Black Holes in the Shadow: The Missing High-Ionization Lines in the Earliest JWST AGNs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered a substantial population of high-redshift, broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs), whose properties challenge standard models of black hole growth and AGN emission. We analyze a spectroscopic sample of 34 Type 1 AGNs from the JWST Advanced Deep Survey (JADES) survey, spanning redshifts 1.7 &lt; z &lt; 9, to constrain the physical nature of the accretion flows powering these sources with broad-line diagnostics statistically for the first time. At z &gt; 5, we find a marked suppression of high-ionization emission lines (HeII, CIV, NV) relative to prominent broad Halpha and narrow [OIII] features. This contrast places strong constraints on the shape of the ionizing spectral energy distribution (SED) and on the physical conditions in the broad-line region (BLR). By comparing the observations to photoionization models based on SEDs of black holes accreting at sub-Eddington ratios, we show that standard AGN continua struggle to reproduce the observed broad line ratios and equivalent widths across a wide ionization parameter range. These results suggest the need for modified SEDs -- either intrinsically softened due to super-Eddington accretion or radiative inefficiencies in the innermost disk, or externally filtered by intervening optically thick gas that absorbs or scatters the highest-energy photons before they reach the BLR.</description>

      <title>Shadows of the Colossus: Hierarchical Black Hole Mergers in a 10-million-body Globular Cluster Simulation</title>

Abstract: The LIGO/Virgo/Kagra (LVK) Collaboration has detected numerous binary black hole mergers with properties that challenge standard binary evolution scenarios, such as component masses above the pair-instability gap and high spin magnitudes. Dense stellar environments such as globular clusters provide a natural channel for producing such systems through hierarchical mergers, where black hole remnants formed in earlier mergers are retained in the cluster and undergo successive mergers. However, gravitational-wave recoil kicks often eject merger remnants from typical globular clusters, which limits hierarchical growth. Massive clusters with deeper potential wells, such as those found in giant elliptical galaxies like M87, may overcome this barrier, but direct simulations of such massive globular clusters remains computationally challenging. In this study, we present a 10-million-body cluster simulation performed with the $\texttt{Cluster Monte Carlo}$ ($\texttt{CMC}$) code, referred to as $\texttt{colossus}$, which serves as a proxy for the most massive low-metallicity globular clusters observed in the local Universe. This simulation demonstrates that extended chains of hierarchical mergers can occur in massive globular clusters, producing black holes up to fifth generation with masses approaching $250\,M_\odot$, comparable to the most massive LVK events observed to date (e.g., GW231123). Combining the $\texttt{colossus}$ simulation with the previous $\texttt{CMC Cluster Catalog}$, we develop a framework to extrapolate binary black hole merger predictions for the thousands of globular clusters seen in the Virgo Supercluster.</description>

      <title>The role of black hole feedback on galaxy star formation and the degeneracy with halo quenching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between the accretion of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and the stellar mass growth of the host galaxies is still a matter of hot debate. The accretion of the SMBHs is expected to release energy under the form of AGNs. This energy is believed to impact the star formation activity and contribute to the quenching of galaxies. Here, we address this key unsolved issue with our cosmological semi-empirical model DECODE. In DECODE, we grow galaxies with their SFR linked to halo accretion rate distributions via abundance matching. SMBHs are evolved following the stellar mass growth of their host galaxies by assigning an accretion rate at each redshift from the empirical Eddington ratio distributions and duty cycles. We test the assumption that galaxies permanently quench when their central SMBHs approach the limit imposed by the observed $M_{\rm BH} - \sigma_\star$ relation, as a proxy of SMBH disruptive feedback. We find that simply imposing the $M_{\rm BH} - \sigma_\star$ condition is sufficient to generate a fraction of quenched galaxies consistent with current data, including the newest ones from Euclid. In addition, our minimal, data-driven model, also predicts SMBH scaling relations consistent in slope and normalisation with those observed, and an $M_{\rm BH} - M_\star$ relation weakly evolving with redshift. The model also naturally generates SMBH accretion rates peaking within 1 Gyr of their host SFHs. We note that all the main predictions on galaxy quenched fractions and SMBH growth histories and scaling relations are degenerate with those expected in a halo quenching model. The comprehensive data-driven model presented in this work represents an invaluable tool to investigate SMBH demography across time and environments in an accurate, physically motivated manner, ideally suited to rapidly explore the implications from large surveys, such as Euclid and Rubin-LSST.</description>

      <title>The LEGA-C galaxy survey: multiple quenching channels for quiescent galaxies at $z\sim1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyzed the sizes and star-formation histories (SFHs) of 2908 galaxies with $M_\star \geq 10^9$ M$_\odot$ at $0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.0$, drawn from the LEGA-C survey. The goal is to investigate the connection between galaxy sizes with SFH, stellar age, and metallicity. SFHs were derived with Prospector by fitting the high signal-to-noise, high spectral resolution spectroscopy drawn from the LEGA-C DR3 together with the broadband photometry from the UltraVISTA catalog. Galaxy sizes were measured by fitting a 2D S{\'e}rsic profile to the HST ACS~F814W images. We find diverse SFHs and quenching timescales ($\tau_\rm{q}$). The main quiescent population quenched over $\tau_\rm{q}=1.23\pm0.04$ Gyr, whereas compact post-starburst galaxies (PSBs) quenched much faster, $\tau_\rm{q}=0.13\pm0.03$ Gyr. At fixed stellar mass, smaller quiescent galaxies quenched more rapidly than larger ones; at fixed size, the dependence on stellar mass is weak. Larger quiescent galaxies are marginally younger, quenched more slowly, and have near-solar metallicities, while compact quiescent galaxies are older, metal-rich, and quenched faster. PSBs formed half their mass later ($z_\rm{form}\sim1.9$) and quenched on the shortest timescales. The general trends with galaxy size, $Z_\star$, and $z_\rm{form}$ for the quiescent populations remain consistent regardless of the method used to derive the stellar properties. We conclude that compact quiescent galaxies are consistent with both early, moderately fast quenching and with more rapid, late quenching. While this may suggest the existence of multiple quenching channels, our data are also compatible with a continuous distribution of quenching timescales. These findings suggest that different physical mechanisms may drive quenching across galaxy populations, potentially leading to similar morphological outcomes despite differing evolutionary histories.</description>

      <title>Isotopomer-Specific Carbon Isotope Ratio of Complex Organic Molecules in Star-Forming Cores</title>

Abstract: The recent observation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar ices by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), along with previous gas-phase detections, underscores the importance of grain surface and ice mantle chemistry in the synthesis of COMs. In this study, we investigate the formation and carbon isotope fractionation of COMs by constructing a new astrochemical reaction network that distinguishes the position of $^{13}$C within species (e.g., H$^{13}$COOCH$_3$ and HCOO$^{13}$CH$_3$ are distinguished). We take into account the position of $^{13}$C in each species in gas and solid phase chemistry. This new model allows us to resolve isotopomer-specific $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of COMs formed in the star-forming cores. We consider thermal diffusion-driven radical-radical reactions on the ice surface and non-thermal radiolysis chemistry in the bulk (surface + mantle) ice. We find that carbon isotope fractionation of the functional groups in COMs appears through both non-thermal radiolysis in cold environments and thermal diffusion in warm environments, depending on the COMs. In particular, COMs containing methyl groups show isotopomer differences in $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios that reflect their formation pathways and environments. These isotopomer-resolved fractionation patterns provide a diagnostic tool to probe the origins of COMs in star-forming cores. Our results suggest that future comparisons between high-sensitivity isotopic observations and isotopomer-specific models will be helpful for constraining the relative contributions of thermal and non-thermal formation processes of COMs.</description>

      <title>GLIMPSE-D: An Exotic Balmer-Jump Object at z=6.20? Revisiting Photometric Selection and the Cosmic Abundance of Pop III Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present deep JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectroscopy of GLIMPSE-16043, a promising $z\sim6$ Pop III candidate originally identified through NIRCam photometry as having weak [OIII]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$ emission. Our follow-up reveals clear [OIII] emission, ruling out a genuine zero-metallicity nature. However, the combination of the measured line fluxes and photometry indicates that its spectral energy distribution requires an extraordinarily strong Balmer jump ($-1.66 \pm 0.47$ mag) and H$\alpha$ equivalent width ($3750\pm1800$ \AA), features that cannot be reproduced by current stellar+nebular or pure nebular photoionization models. The only models approaching the observations to almost within $1\sigma$ involve a hot ($T_{\rm eff}\!\simeq\!10^{4.7}$ K) single blackbody embedded in a low-$T_{\rm e}$ nebular environment, suggestive of scenarios such as a tidal-disruption event or a microquasar with strong disk winds. This cautions that photometric Pop~III selections are vulnerable to contamination when the rest-frame optical continuum is undetected. Motivated by this, we refine the photometric Pop III selection criteria to exclude the locus of extreme Balmer-jump objects. The revised criteria also recover the recently reported spectroscopic candidate AMORE6, demonstrating that the updated selection preserves sensitivity to genuine Pop III-like sources while removing key contaminants. Applying the refined criteria across legacy survey fields and five newly released CANUCS lensing cluster fields, we revisit the Pop III UV luminosity function and estimate the Pop III cosmic star-formation rate density to be $\approx[10^{-6}$--$10^{-4}]$~$M_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$~cMpc$^{-3}$ at $z\simeq6$--7, falling in the range of current theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Two Decades of Dust Evolution in SN 2005af through JWST, Spitzer, and Chemical Modeling</title>

Abstract: The evolution of dust in core-collapse supernovae (SNe), in general, is poorly constrained owing to a lack of infrared observations after a few years from explosion. Most theories of dust formation in SNe heavily rely only on SN 1987A. In the last two years, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has enabled us to probe the dust evolution in decades-old SNe, such as SN 2004et, SN 2005ip, and SN 1980K. In this paper, we present two decades of dust evolution in SN 2005af, combining early-time infrared observations with Spitzer Space Telescope and recent detections by JWST. We have used a chemical kinetic model of dust synthesis in SN ejecta to develop a template of dust evolution in SN 2005af. Moreover, using this approach, for the first time, we have separately quantified the dust formed in the pre-explosion wind that survived after the explosion, and the dust formed in the metal-rich SN ejecta post-explosion. We report that in SN 2005af, predominantly carbon-rich dust formed in the ejecta, with a total mass of at least 0.02 Msun. In the circumstellar medium, the surviving oxygen-rich dust amounts to about 0.003-0.006 Msun, yielding a total dust mass of at least 0.025 Msun.</description>

      <title>MUSE IFU observations of galaxies hosting Tidal Disruption Events</title>

Abstract: We present an analysis of twenty tidal disruption event (TDE) host galaxies observed with the MUSE integral-field spectrograph on ESO VLT. We investigate the presence of extended emission line regions (EELRs) and study stellar populations mostly at sub-kpc scale around the host nuclei. EELRs are detected in 5/20 hosts, including two unreported systems. All EELRs are found at z&lt;0.045, suggesting a distance bias and faint EELRs may be missed at higher redshift. EELRs only appear in post-merger systems and all such hosts at z&lt;0.045 show them. Thus, we conclude that TDEs and galaxy mergers have a strong relation, and &gt;45% of post-merger hosts in the sample exhibit EELRs. Furthermore, we constrained the distributions of stellar masses near the central black holes (BHs), using the spectral synthesis code Starlight and BPASS stellar evolution models. The youngest nuclear populations have typical ages of 1 Gyr and stellar masses below 2.5MSun. The populations that can produce observable TDEs around non-rotating BHs are dominated by subsolar-mass stars. 3/4 TDEs requiring larger stellar masses exhibit multi-peaked light curves, possibly implying relation to repeated partial disruptions of high-mass stars. The found distributions are in tension with the masses of the stars derived using light curve models. Mass segregation of the disrupted stars can enhance the rate of TDEs from supersolar-mass stars but our study implies that low-mass TDEs should still be abundant and even dominate the distribution, unless there is a mechanism that prohibits low-mass TDEs or their detection.</description>

      <title>Abundance and phase-space distribution of subhalos in cosmological N-body simulations: testing numerical convergence and correction methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07678v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subhalos play a crucial role in accurately modeling galaxy formation and galaxy-based cosmological probes within the highly nonlinear, virialized regime. However, numerical convergence of subhalo evolution is difficult to achieve, especially in the inner regions of host halos where tidal forces are strongest. I investigate the numerical convergence and correction methods for the abundance, spatial, and velocity distributions of subhalos using two $6144^3$-particle cosmological N-body simulations with different mass resolutions -- Jiutian-300 ($1.0 \times 10^{7}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$) and Jiutian-1G ($3.7 \times 10^{8}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$) -- with subhalos identified by HBT+. My study shows that the Surviving subhalo Peak Mass Function (SPMF) converges only for subhalos with $m_{\mathrm{peak}}$ above $5000$ particles but can be accurately recovered by including orphan subhalos that survive according to the merger timescale model of Jiang et al., which outperforms other models. Including orphan subhalos also enables recovery of the real-space spatial and velocity distributions to $5$--$10\%$ accuracy down to scales of $0.1$--$0.2\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$. The remaining differences are likely due to cosmic variance and finite-box effects in the smaller Jiutian-300 simulation. Convergence below $0.1\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ remains challenging and requires more sophisticated modeling of orphan subhalos. I further highlight that redshift-space multipoles are more difficult to recover even at larger scales because unreliable small-scale pairs at $r_{\mathrm{p}} &lt; 0.1\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ in real space affect scales of tens of $\mathrm{Mpc}$ in redshift space due to elongated Fingers-of-God effects. Therefore, for redshift-space statistics, I recommend using modified or alternative measures that reduce sensitivity to small projected separations in subhalo-based studies.</description>

      <title>Spatial Profiles of 3I/ATLAS CN and Ni Outgassing from Keck/KCWI Integral Field Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11779v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cometary activity from interstellar objects provides a unique window into the environs of other stellar systems. We report blue-sensitive integral field unit spectroscopy of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS from the Keck-II-mounted Keck Cosmic Web Imager on August 24, 2025 UT. We confirm previously reported CN and Ni outgassing, and present, for the first time, the radial profiles of Ni and CN emission in 3I/ATLAS. We find a characteristic $e$-folding radius of $593.7\pm14.8$ km for Ni and $841.0\pm15.4$ km for CN; this suggests that the Ni emission is more centrally concentrated in the nucleus of the comet and favors hypotheses involving easily dissociated species such as metal carbonyls or metal-polycyclic-aromatic-hydrocarbon molecules. Additional integral field spectroscopy after perihelion will offer a continued opportunity to determine the evolution of the radial distributions of species in interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS.</description>

      <title>The Binary Ballet: Mapping Local Expansion Around M81 &amp; M82</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study of the M81 complex and its Hubble flow delivers new and improved Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB)-based distances for nine member galaxies, yielding a total of 58 galaxies with high-precision TRGB distances. With those, we perform a systematic analysis of the group's dynamics in the core and its embedding in the local cosmic environment. Our analysis confirms that the satellite galaxies of the M81 complex exhibit a flattened, planar distribution almost perpendicular to the supergalactic pole and thus aligned with a larger-scale filamentary structure in the Local Universe. We demonstrate that the properties of the group's barycentre are robustly constrained by the two brightest members, M81 and M82, and that correcting heliocentric velocities for the solar motion in the Local Group decreases the velocity dispersion of the group. Then applying minor and major infall models, we fit the local Hubble flow to constrain the Hubble Constant and the total mass of the M81 complex. The joint best-fit parameters from both models yield $H_0 = \left(63 \pm 6 \right)$ km/s/Mpc and total mass of $(2.28\pm 0.49) \times 10^{12} M_{\odot}$. We thus arrive at an increased mass estimate compared to prior work but reach a higher consistency with virial, $(2.74 \pm 0.36)\times 10^{12}\,M_\odot$, and projected-mass estimates, $(3.11 \pm 0.69)\times 10^{12} M_\odot$. Moreover, our $H_0$ estimate shows an agreement with Planck, consistent with other TRGB-based Local-Universe inferences of $H_0$ and still within a 2-$\sigma$ agreement with Cepheid-based Local-Universe probes.</description>

      <title>The SPHEREx Satellite Mission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SPHEREx, a NASA explorer satellite launched on 11 March 2025, is carrying out the first all-sky near-infrared spectral survey. The satellite observes in 102 spectral bands from 0.75 to 5.0 um with a resolving power ranging from 35 to 130 in 6.2 arcsecond pixels. The observatory obtains a 5-sigma depth of 19.5 - 19.9 AB mag for 0.75 to 3.8 um and 17.8 - 18.8 AB mag for 3.8 to 5.0 um after mapping the full sky four times over two years. Scientifically, SPHEREx will produce a large galaxy redshift survey over the full sky, intended to constrain the amplitude of inflationary non-Gaussianity. The observations will produce two deep spectral maps near the ecliptic poles that will use intensity mapping to probe the evolution of galaxies over cosmic history. By mapping the depth of infrared absorption features over the Galactic plane, SPHEREx will comprehensively survey the abundance and composition of water and other biogenic ice species in the interstellar medium. The initial data are rapidly released in the form of spectral images to the public. The project will release specialized data products over the life of the mission as the surveys proceed. The science team will also produce specialized spectral catalogs on planet-bearing and low-mass stars, solar system objects, and galaxy clusters 3 years after launch. We describe the design of the instrument and spacecraft, which flow from the core science requirements. Finally, we present an initial evaluation of the in-flight performance and key characteristics.</description>
