      <title>Topology and Network Dynamics of the Lightning Network: A Comprehensive Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging a validated set of reconstructed Lightning Network topology snapshots spanning five years (2019-2023), we computed 47 computationally intensive metrics and network attributes, enabling a comprehensive analysis of the network's structure and temporal dynamics. Our results corroborate prior topology studies while offering deeper insight into the network's structural evolution. In particular, we quantify the network's topological stability over time, yielding implications for the design of heuristic-based pathfinding and routing protocols. More broadly, this work provides a detailed characterization of publicly available Lightning Network snapshots, supporting future research in Payment Channel Network analysis and network science.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks for Source Detection: A Review and Benchmark Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The source detection problem arises when an epidemic process unfolds over a contact network, and the objective is to identify its point of origin, i.e., the source node. Research on this problem began with the seminal work of Shah and Zaman in 2010, who formally defined it and introduced the notion of rumor centrality. With the emergence of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), several studies have proposed GNN-based approaches to source detection. However, some of these works lack methodological clarity and/or are hard to reproduce. As a result, it remains unclear (to us, at least) whether GNNs truly outperform more traditional source detection methods across comparable settings. In this paper, we first review existing GNN-based methods for source detection, clearly outlining the specific settings each addresses and the models they employ. Building on this research, we propose a principled GNN architecture tailored to the source detection task. We also systematically investigate key questions surrounding this problem. Most importantly, we aim to provide a definitive assessment of how GNNs perform relative to other source detection methods. Our experiments show that GNNs substantially outperform all other methods we test across a variety of network types. Although we initially set out to challenge the notion of GNNs as a solution to source detection, our results instead demonstrate their remarkable effectiveness for this task. We discuss possible reasons for this strong performance. To ensure full reproducibility, we release all code and data on GitHub. Finally, we argue that epidemic source detection should serve as a benchmark task for evaluating GNN architectures.</description>

      <title>Signal, Noise, and Burnout: A Human-Information Interaction Analysis of Voter Verification in a High-Volatility Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2024 U.S. Presidential Election unfolded within an information environment of unprecedented volatility, challenging citizens to navigate a torrent of rapidly evolving, often contradictory information while determining what to believe. This study investigates the cognitive mechanisms underlying epistemic self-efficacy - the perceived ability to distinguish accurate news from misinformation - across different information channels during this high-stakes election cycle. Drawing on data from the Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel (Wave 155, September 2024, N = 9,360), we test three hypotheses: (H1) whether reliance on social media predicts lower epistemic self-efficacy compared to mainstream news sources; (H2) whether perceived exposure to inaccurate information mediates this relationship; and (H3) whether information fatigue moderates the cognitive burden of verification across platforms. Contrary to expectations rooted in algorithmic filtering theory, we find no significant differences in reported difficulty determining truth between social media and mainstream news users. Instead, epistemic burden is driven by demographics (age, education) and universal information fatigue, suggesting a "leveling" of the information landscape during periods of extreme volatility. This finding challenges platform-deterministic theories and suggests that interventions to support informed citizenship must address cognitive resilience and attention management rather than platform choice alone.</description>

      <title>Mental Health Self-Disclosure on Social Media throughout the Pandemic Period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has created many problems, especially in people's social lives. There has been increasing isolation and economic hardships since the beginning of the pandemic for people all over the world. Quarantines and lockdowns also took part in that, and so, people have been expressing their emotions throughout the pandemic period using social media platforms like Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, etc. In this study, we seek to analyze the emotions and mental health labels throughout the time period of March 2, 2020, up until July 4, 2020, from the threads and comments gathered from the r/unitedkingdom subreddit. We used a soft labeling technique to generate mental health conditions for each Reddit comment. We compared the overall results with important dates related to COVID-19 policies that took place in the United Kingdom. This can give us a view on how the pandemic and the important dates affect people self disclosing their emotions on social media platforms. Finally, we have developed a proof of concept to show that using mental health features may increase emotion prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Emotion Diffusion in Real and Simulated Social Graphs: Structural Limits of LLM-Based Social Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how emotions diffuse through social networks is central to computational social science. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to simulate social media interactions, raising the question of whether LLM-generated data can realistically reproduce emotion diffusion patterns observed in real online communities. In this study, we conduct a systematic comparison between emotion diffusion in real-world social graphs and in LLM-simulated interaction networks. We construct diffusion graphs from Reddit discussion data and compare them with synthetic social graphs generated through LLM-driven conversational simulations. Emotion states are inferred using established sentiment analysis pipelines, and both real and simulated graphs are analyzed from structural, behavioral, and predictive perspectives. Our results reveal substantial structural and dynamic discrepancies between real and simulated diffusion processes. Real-world emotion diffusion exhibits dense connectivity, repeated interactions, sentiment shifts, and emergent community structures, whereas LLM-simulated graphs largely consist of isolated linear chains with monotonic emotional trajectories. These structural limitations significantly affect downstream tasks such as graph-based emotion prediction, leading to reduced emotional diversity and class imbalance in simulated settings. Our findings highlight current limitations of LLM-based social simulation in capturing the interactive complexity and emotional heterogeneity of real social networks. This work provides empirical evidence for the cautious use of LLM-generated data in social science research and suggests directions for improving future simulation frameworks.</description>

      <title>A Community-Enhanced Graph Representation Model for Link Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the dominant approach for graph representation learning, their performance on link prediction tasks does not always surpass that of traditional heuristic methods such as Common Neighbors and Jaccard Coefficient. This is mainly because existing GNNs tend to focus on learning local node representations, making it difficult to effectively capture structural relationships between node pairs. Furthermore, excessive reliance on local neighborhood information can lead to over-smoothing. Prior studies have shown that introducing global structural encoding can partially alleviate this issue. To address these limitations, we propose a Community-Enhanced Link Prediction (CELP) framework that incorporates community structure to jointly model local and global graph topology. Specifically, CELP enhances the graph via community-aware, confidence-guided edge completion and pruning, while integrating multi-scale structural features to achieve more accurate link prediction. Experimental results across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that CELP achieves superior performance, validating the crucial role of community structure in improving link prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>How fragile is your network? More than you think</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.13943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphs are pervasive in our everyday lives, with relevance to biology, the internet, and infrastructure, as well as numerous other applications. It is thus necessary to have an understanding as to how quickly a graph disintegrates, whether by random failure or by targeted attack. While much of the interest in this subject has been focused on targeted removal of nodes, there has been some recent interest in targeted edge removal. Here, we focus on how robust a graph is against edge removal. We define a measure of network fragility that relates the fraction of edges removed to the largest connected component. We construct a class of graphs that is robust to edge removal. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that graphs generally disintegrate faster than would be anticipated by greedy targeted attack. Finally it is shown that our fragility measure as demonstrated real and natural networks.</description>

      <title>Social learning moderates the tradeoffs between efficiency, stability, and equity in group foraging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective foragers, from animals to robotic swarms, must balance exploration and exploitation to locate sparse resources efficiently. While social learning is known to facilitate this balance, how the range of information sharing shapes group-level outcomes remains unclear. Here, we develop a minimal collective foraging model in which individuals combine independent exploration, local exploitation, and socially guided movement. We show that foraging efficiency is maximized at an intermediate social learning range, where groups exploit discovered resources without suppressing independent discovery. This optimal regime also minimizes temporal burstiness in resource intake, reducing starvation risk. Increasing social learning range further improves equity among individuals but degrades efficiency through redundant exploitation. Introducing risky (negative) targets shifts the optimal range upward; in contrast, when penalties are ignored, randomly distributed negative cues can further enhance efficiency by constraining unproductive exploration. Together, these results reveal how local information rules regulate a fundamental trade-off between efficiency, stability, and equity, providing design principles for biological foraging systems and engineered collectives.</description>
