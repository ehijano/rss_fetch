      <title>Damage spreading and coupling in spin glasses and hard spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the connection between damage spreading, a phenomenon long discussed in the physics literature, and the coupling of Markov chains, a technique used to bound the mixing time. We discuss in parallel the Edwards-Anderson spin glass model and the hard-disk system, focusing on how coupling provides insights into the region of fast coupling within the paramagnetic and liquid phases. We also work out the connection between path coupling and damage spreading. Numerically, the scaling analysis of the mean coupling time determines a critical point between fast and slow couplings. The exact relationship between fast coupling and disordered phases has not been established rigorously, but we suggest that it will ultimately enhance our understanding of phase behavior in disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Jamming the Random Lorentz Gas: Configurational Entropy, Crunching Geometry, and Critical Universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deterministic optimization algorithms unequivocally partition a complex energy landscape in inherent structures (ISs) and their respective basins of attraction. But can these basins be defined solely through geometric principles? This question is particularly important when examining the jamming of hard spheres. We here consider this issue by proposing a geometric class of gradient descent-like algorithms, which we use to study a system in the hard-sphere universality class, the random Lorentz gas. The statistics of the resulting IS is found to be strictly inherited from those of Poisson-Voronoi tessellations. The landscape roughness is further found to give rise to a hierarchical organization of ISs which various algorithms explore differently. In particular, greedy and reluctant schemes tend to favor ISs of markedly different densities. The resulting ISs nevertheless robustly exhibit a universal force distribution, thus confirming the geometric nature of the jamming universality class.</description>

      <title>Learning and Unlearning: Bridging classification, memory and generative modeling in Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human brain is a complex system that is fascinating scientists since a long time. Its remarkable capabilities include categorization of concepts, retrieval of memories and creative generation of new examples. At the same time, modern artificial neural networks are trained on large amounts of data to accomplish these same tasks with a considerable degree of precision. By contrast with biological systems, machines appear to be either significantly slow and energetically expensive to train, suggesting the need for a paradigmatic change in the way they learn. We here review a general learning prescription that allows to perform classification, memorization and generation of new examples in bio-inspired artificial neural networks. The training procedure can be split into a prior Hebbian learning phase and a subsequent anti-Hebbian one (usually referred to as Unlearning). The separation of training in two epochs allows the algorithm to go fully unsupervised while partially aligning with some modern biological theories of learning.</description>

      <title>Boundary-driven many-body phase transitions in a non-Hermitian disordered fermionic chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the boundary sensitivity of a non-Hermitian interacting system in the presence of a random disorder potential. A non-zero boundary parameter results in real-complex spectral phase transitions with non-reciprocal (or unidirectional) hopping at weak disorder. While the many-body localization at strong disorder washes away spectral transitions leading to dynamical stability and real eigenvalue spectrum. We show that the boundary-driven spectral transitions of the non-Hermitian chain are accompanied by the corresponding changes in the level statistics and nearest level-spacing distributions. The intriguing features of non-reciprocity and boundary sensitivity are further revealed using the averaged inverse participation ratios. Finally, we find distinct behaviour in the quench dynamics of local particle density, population imbalance, and entanglement entropy of charge-density-wave ordered state that corroborate the spectral and localization transitions. Our results provide a route to understanding disordered many-body systems under a generalized boundary.</description>

      <title>A correspondence between Hebbian unlearning and steady states generated by nonequilibrium dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classic paradigms for learning and memory recall focus on strengths of synaptic couplings and how these can be modulated to encode memories. In a previous paper [A. K. Behera, M. Rao, S. Sastry, and S. Vaikuntanathan, Physical Review X 13, 041043 (2023)], we demonstrated how a specific non-equilibrium modification of the dynamics of an associative memory system can lead to increase in storage capacity. In this work, using analytical theory and computational inference schemes, we show that the dynamical steady state accessed is in fact similar to those accessed after the operation of a classic unsupervised scheme for improving memory recall, Hebbian unlearning or ``dreaming". Together, our work suggests how nonequilibrium dynamics can provide an alternative route for controlling the memory encoding and recall properties of a variety of synthetic (neuromorphic) and biological systems.</description>

      <title>Anomalous distribution of magnetization in an Ising spin glass with correlated disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of correlations in disorder variables is a largely unexplored topic in spin glass theory. We study this problem through a specific example of correlated disorder introduced in the Ising spin glass model. We prove that the distribution function of the magnetization along the Nishimori line in the present model is identical to the distribution function of the spin glass order parameter in the standard Edwards-Anderson model with symmetrically-distributed independent disorder. This result means that if the Edwards-Anderson model exhibits replica symmetry breaking, the magnetization distribution in the correlated model has support on a finite interval, in sharp contrast to the conventional understanding that the magnetization distribution has at most two delta peaks. This unusual behavior challenges the traditional argument against replica symmetry breaking on the Nishimori line in the Edwards-Anderson model. In addition, we show that when temperature chaos is present in the Edwards-Anderson model, the ferromagnetic phase is strictly confined to the Nishimori line in the present model. These findings are valid not only for finite-dimensional systems but also for the infinite-range model, and highlight the need for a deeper understanding of disorder correlations in spin glass systems.</description>

      <title>Exact full-RSB SAT/UNSAT transition in infinitely wide two-layer neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the problem of storing random pattern-label associations using two classes of continuous non-convex weights models, namely the perceptron with negative margin and an infinite width two layer neural network with non-overlapping receptive fields and generic activation function. Using a full-RSB ansatz we compute the exact value of the SAT/UNSAT transition. Furthermore, in the case of the negative perceptron model we show that, depending on the value of the margin and the constrained density, there is a line separating a phase in which the distribution of overlaps of typical states does not possess a gap from one in which it does. Our results show that the hypothesis underlying some recently developed theorems claiming that Approximate Message Passing (AMP) based algorithms are able to reach capacity, does not hold in general. Finally, we show that Gradient Descent is not able to reach the maximal capacity both in cases where there is and there is not a non-overlap gap phase for the typical states. This, similarly to what occurs in binary weight models, suggests that gradient-based algorithms are biased towards highly atypical states, whose inaccessibility determines the algorithmic threshold.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of chaotic dynamics in random modular networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model of randomly connected neural populations and study its dynamics by means of the dynamical mean-field theory and simulations. Our analysis uncovers a rich phase diagram, featuring high- and low-dimensional chaotic phases, separated by a crossover region characterized by low values of the maximal Lyapunov exponent and participation ratio dimension, but with high and rapidly changing values of the Lyapunov dimension. Counterintuitively, chaos can be attenuated by either adding noise to strongly modular connectivity or by introducing modularity into random connectivity. Extending the model to include a multilevel, hierarchical connectivity reveals that a loose balance between activities across levels drives the system towards the edge of chaos.</description>

      <title>Phase Diagram from Nonlinear Interaction between Superconducting Order and Density: Toward Data-Based Holographic Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address an inverse problem in modeling holographic superconductors. We focus our research on the critical temperature behavior depicted by experiments. We use a physics-informed neural network method to find a mass function $M(F^2)$, which is necessary to understand phase transition behavior. This mass function describes a nonlinear interaction between superconducting order and charge carrier density. We introduce positional embedding layers to improve the learning process in our algorithm, and the Adam optimization is used to predict the critical temperature data via holographic calculation with appropriate accuracy. Consideration of the positional embedding layers is motivated by the transformer model of natural-language processing in the artificial intelligence (AI) field. We obtain holographic models that reproduce borderlines of the normal and superconducting phases provided by actual data. Our work is the first holographic attempt to match phase transition data quantitatively obtained from experiments. Also, the present work offers a new methodology for data-based holographic models.</description>

      <title>Iron phosphate glass structure at different length scale with emphasis on the medium range: a classical molecular dynamic study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glasses are known to have medium range order (MRO) but its link to any experimentally measurable quantity is still ambiguous. The first sharp diffraction peak (FSDP) in structure-factor S(q) obtained from diffraction experiments on glasses has been associated with this MRO but understanding the fundamental origin of this universal peak is still an open problem. We have addressed this issue for a complex glass i.e. iron phosphate glass (IPG) through atomistic models generated from a hybrid approach (our in-house developed MC code with MD simulation). We have performed a comparative study by generating glass models from different initial configurations and randomization techniques. The developed IPG models were first validated with existing data on short range order (SRO) and MRO, through study of pair correlation functions, bond angle distributions and coordination number (CN) for SRO and rings distribution, FSDP in structure factor and void size distribution for MRO. The study of coordination environment of oxygen is specifically shown to aide in understanding glass formation through topological constraint theory. Thereafter to understand the fundamental origin of FSDP in S(q), structure factors were calculated corresponding to individual ring sizes present in the model. The relative contribution of these individual S(q)s in the total experimental S(q) is estimated using an inverse fitting approach. The contributions thus obtained directly correlated with rings size percentages in the models for the considered q-range. Through this exercise we can connect the rings distribution of an atomistic glass model with an experimentally measurable quantity like FSDP in S(q) for a complex glass like IPG.</description>

      <title>Observation of disorder-free localization and efficient disorder averaging on a quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most challenging problems in the computational study of localization in quantum manybody systems is to capture the effects of rare events, which requires sampling over exponentially many disorder realizations. We implement an efficient procedure on a quantum processor, leveraging quantum parallelism, to efficiently sample over all disorder realizations. We observe localization without disorder in quantum many-body dynamics in one and two dimensions: perturbations do not diffuse even though both the generator of evolution and the initial states are fully translationally invariant. The disorder strength as well as its density can be readily tuned using the initial state. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of our platform by measuring Renyi entropies. Our method could also be extended to higher moments of the physical observables and disorder learning.</description>

      <title>Evidence that the AT transition disappears below six dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03711v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the key predictions of Parisi's broken replica symmetry theory of spin glasses is the existence of a phase transition in an applied field to a state with broken replica symmetry. This transition takes place at the de Almeida-Thouless (AT) line in the $h-T$ plane. We have studied this line in the power-law diluted Heisenberg spin glass in which the probability that two spins separated by a distance $r$ interact with each other falls as $1/r^{2\sigma}$. In the presence of a random vector-field of variance $h_r^2$ the phase transition is in the universality class of the Ising spin glass in a field. Tuning $\sigma$ is equivalent to changing the dimension $d$ of the short-range system, with the relation being $d =2/(2\sigma -1)$ for $\sigma &lt; 2/3$. We have found by numerical simulations that $h_{\text{AT}}^2 \sim (2/3 -\sigma)$ implying that the AT line does not exist below $6$ dimensions and that the Parisi scheme is not appropriate for spin glasses in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Tilting the Odds at the Lottery: the Interplay of Overparameterisation and Curricula in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A wide range of empirical and theoretical works have shown that overparameterisation can amplify the performance of neural networks. According to the lottery ticket hypothesis, overparameterised networks have an increased chance of containing a sub-network that is well-initialised to solve the task at hand. A more parsimonious approach, inspired by animal learning, consists in guiding the learner towards solving the task by curating the order of the examples, i.e. providing a curriculum. However, this learning strategy seems to be hardly beneficial in deep learning applications. In this work, we undertake an analytical study that connects curriculum learning and overparameterisation. In particular, we investigate their interplay in the online learning setting for a 2-layer network in the XOR-like Gaussian Mixture problem. Our results show that a high degree of overparameterisation -- while simplifying the problem -- can limit the benefit from curricula, providing a theoretical account of the ineffectiveness of curricula in deep learning.</description>
