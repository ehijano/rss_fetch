      <title>LRBF meshless methods for predicting soil moisture distribution in root zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first propose a coupled numerical model of unsaturated flow in soils and plant root water uptake. The Richards equation and different formulations are used in the developed numerical model to describe infiltration in root zone and to investigate the impact of the plant root on the distribution of soil moisture. The Kirchhoff transformed Richards equation is used and the Gardner model is considered for capillary pressure. In our approach, we employ a meshless method based on localized radial basis functions (LRBF) to solve the resulting system of equations. The LRBF approach is an accurate and computationally efficient method that does not require mesh generation and is flexible in addressing high-dimensional problems with complex geometries. Furthermore, this method leads to a sparse matrix system, which avoids ill-conditioning issues. We implement the coupled numerical model of infiltration and plant root water uptake for one, two, and three-dimensional soils. Numerical experiments are performed using nontrivial analytical solutions and available experimental data to validate the coupled numerical model. The numerical results demonstrate the performance and ability of the proposed numerical method to predict soil moisture dynamics in root zone.</description>

      <title>Energy-consistent Petrov-Galerkin time discretization of port-Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a general class of nonlinear port-Hamiltonian systems we develop a high-order time discretization scheme with certain structure preservation properties. The possibly infinite-dimensional system under consideration possesses a Hamiltonian function, which represents an energy in the system and is conserved or dissipated along solutions. The numerical scheme is energy-consistent in the sense that the Hamiltonian of the approximate solutions at time grid points behaves accordingly. This structure preservation property is achieved by specific design of a continuous Petrov-Galerkin (cPG) method in time. It coincides with standard cPG methods in special cases, in which the latter are energy-consistent. Examples of port-Hamiltonian ODEs and PDEs are presented to visualize the framework. In numerical experiments the energy consistency is verified and the convergence behavior is investigated.</description>

      <title>Preconditioning correction equations in Jacobi--Davidson type methods for computing partial singular value decompositions of large matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a Jacobi--Davidson (JD) type method for singular value decomposition (SVD) problems, called JDSVD, a large symmetric and generally indefinite correction equation is approximately solved iteratively at each outer iteration, which constitutes the inner iterations and dominates the overall efficiency of JDSVD. In this paper, a convergence analysis is made on the minimal residual (MINRES) method for the correction equation. Motivated by the results obtained, a preconditioned correction equation is derived that extracts useful information from current searching subspaces to construct effective preconditioners for the correction equation and is proved to retain the same convergence of outer iterations of JDSVD. The resulting method is called inner preconditioned JDSVD (IPJDSVD) method. Convergence results show that MINRES for the preconditioned correction equation can converge much faster when there is a cluster of singular values closest to a given target, so that IPJDSVD is more efficient than JDSVD. A new thick-restart IPJDSVD algorithm with deflation and purgation is proposed that simultaneously accelerates the outer and inner convergence of the standard thick-restart JDSVD and computes several singular triplets of a large matrix. Numerical experiments justify the theory and illustrate the considerable superiority of IPJDSVD to JDSVD.</description>

      <title>Change of Measure for Bayesian Field Inversion with Hierarchical Hyperparameters Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an effective treatment of hyperparameters in the Bayesian inference of a scalar field from indirect observations. Obtaining the joint posterior distribution of the field and its hyperparameters is challenging. The infinite dimensionality of the field requires a finite parametrization that usually involves hyperparameters to reflect the limited prior knowledge. In the present work, we consider a Karhunen-Lo{\`e}ve (KL) decomposition for the random field and hyperparameters to account for the lack of prior knowledge of its autocovariance function. The hyperparameters must be inferred. To efficiently sample jointly the KL coordinates of the field and the autocovariance hyperparameters, we introduce a change of measure to reformulate the joint posterior distribution into a hierarchical Bayesian form. The likelihood depends only on the field's coordinates in a fixed KL basis, with a prior conditioned on the hyperparameters. We exploit this structure to derive an efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling scheme based on an adapted Metropolis-Hasting algorithm. We rely on surrogate models (Polynomial Chaos expansions) of the forward model predictions to further accelerate the MCMC sampling. A first application to a transient diffusion problem shows that our method is consistent with other approaches based on a change of coordinates (Sraj et al., 2016). A second application to a seismic traveltime tomography highlights the importance of inferring the hyperparameters.</description>

      <title>Stability, convergence, and pressure-robustness of numerical schemes for incompressible flows with hybrid velocity and pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the stability, convergence, and pressure-robustness of discretization methods for incompressible flows with hybrid velocity and pressure. Specifically, focusing on the Stokes problem, we identify a set of assumptions that yield inf-sup stability as well as error estimates which distinguish the velocity- and pressure-related contributions to the error. We additionally identify the key properties under which the pressure-related contributions vanish in the estimate of the velocity, thus leading to pressure-robustness. Several examples of existing and new schemes that fit into the framework are provided, and extensive numerical validation of the theoretical properties is provided.</description>

      <title>Laplace--Beltrami Equations and Numerical Conformal Mappings on Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conjugate function method is an algorithm for numerical computation of conformal mappings for simply and multiply connected domains. In this paper, the conjugate function method is extended to cover conformal mappings between Riemannian surfaces. The main challenge addressed here is the connection between Laplace--Beltrami equations on surfaces and the computation of the conformal modulus of a quadrilateral. We consider mappings of simply, doubly, and multiply connected domains. The numerical computation is based on an $hp$-adaptive finite element method. The key advantage of our approach is that it allows highly accurate computations of mappings on surfaces, including domains of complex boundary geometry involving strong singularities and cusps. The efficacy of the proposed method is illustrated via an extensive set of numerical experiments including error estimates.</description>

      <title>Efficient scaling and squaring method for the matrix exponential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a new algorithm to compute the matrix exponential within a given tolerance. Combined with the scaling and squaring procedure, the algorithm incorporates Taylor, partitioned and classical Pad\'e methods shown to be superior in performance to the approximants used in state-of-the-art software. The algorithm computes matrix--matrix products and also matrix inverses, but it can be implemented to avoid the computation of inverses, making it convenient for some problems. If the matrix A belongs to a Lie algebra, then exp(A) belongs to its associated Lie group, being a property which is preserved by diagonal Pad\'e approximants, and the algorithm has another option to use only these. Numerical experiments show the superior performance with respect to state-of-the-art implementations.</description>

      <title>Nodal auxiliary space preconditioners for mixed virtual element methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose nodal auxiliary space preconditioners for facet and edge virtual elements of lowest order by deriving discrete regular decompositions on polytopal grids and generalizing the Hiptmair-Xu preconditioner to the virtual element framework. The preconditioner consists of solving a sequence of elliptic problems on the nodal virtual element space, combined with appropriate smoother steps. Under assumed regularity of the mesh, the preconditioned system is proven to have bounded spectral condition number independent of the mesh size and this is verified by numerical experiments on a sequence of polygonal meshes. Moreover, we observe numerically that the preconditioner is robust on meshes containing elements with high aspect ratios.</description>

      <title>Robust hybrid finite element methods for reaction-dominated diffusion problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a reaction-dominated diffusion problem we study a primal and a dual hybrid finite element method where weak continuity conditions are enforced by Lagrange multipliers. Uniform robustness of the discrete methods is achieved by enriching the local discretization spaces with modified face bubble functions which decay exponentially in the interior of an element depending on the ratio of the singular perturbation parameter and the local mesh-size. A posteriori error estimators are derived using Fortin operators. They are robust with respect to the singular perturbation parameter. Numerical experiments are presented that show that oscillations, if present, are significantly smaller then those observed in common finite element methods.</description>

      <title>A note on higher-order and nonlinear limiting approaches for continuously bounds-preserving discontinuous Galerkin methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In (Dzanic, J. Comp. Phys., 508:113010, 2024), a limiting approach for high-order discontinuous Galerkin schemes was introduced which allowed for imposing constraints on the solution continuously (i.e., everywhere within the element). While exact for linear constraint functionals, this approach only imposed a sufficient (but not the minimum necessary) amount of limiting for nonlinear constraint functionals. This short note shows how this limiting approach can be extended to allow exactness for general nonlinear quasiconcave constraint functionals through a nonlinear limiting procedure, reducing unnecessary numerical dissipation. Some examples are shown for nonlinear pressure and entropy constraints in the compressible gas dynamics equations, where both analytic and iterative approaches are used.</description>

      <title>A Newton's Iteration Converges Quadratically to Nonisolated Solutions Too</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.09180v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The textbook Newton's iteration is practically inapplicable on solutions of nonlinear systems with singular Jacobians. By a simple modification, a novel extension of Newton's iteration regains its local quadratic convergence toward nonisolated solutions that are semiregular as properly defined regardless of whether the system is square, underdetermined or overdetermined while Jacobians can be rank-deficient. Furthermore, the iteration serves as a regularization mechanism for computing singular solutions from empirical data. When a system is perturbed, its nonisolated solutions can be altered substantially or even disappear. The iteration still locally converges to a stationary point that approximates a singular solution of the underlying system with an error bound in the same order of the data accuracy. Geometrically, the iteration approximately approaches the nearest point on the solution manifold. The method simplifies the modeling of nonlinear systems by permitting nonisolated solutions and enables a wide range of applications in algebraic computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.14223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss two types of discrete inf-sup conditions for the Taylor-Hood family $Q_k$-$Q_{k-1}$ for all $k\in \mathbb{N}$ with $k\ge 2$ in 2D and 3D. While in 2D all results hold for a general class of hexahedral meshes, the results in 3D are restricted to meshes of parallelepipeds. The analysis is based on an element-wise technique as opposed to the widely used macroelement technique. This leads to inf-sup conditions on each element of the subdivision as well as to inf-sup conditions on the whole computational domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the dimensions of various inf-sup stable mixed finite element spaces on tetrahedral meshes in 3D with exact divergence constraints. More precisely, we compare the standard Scott-Vogelius elements of higher polynomial degree and low order methods on split meshes, the Alfeld and the Worsey-Farin split. The main tool is a counting strategy to express the degrees of freedom for given polynomial degree and given split in terms of few mesh quantities, for which bounds and asymptotic behavior under mesh refinement is investigated. Furthermore, this is used to obtain insights on potential precursor spaces in full de Rham complexes for finite element methods on the Worsey-Farin split.</description>

      <title>Numerical Methods with Coordinate Transforms for Efficient Brownian Dynamics Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02913v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many stochastic processes in the physical and biological sciences can be modelled as Brownian dynamics with multiplicative noise. However, numerical integrators for these processes can lose accuracy or even fail to converge when the diffusion term is configuration-dependent. One remedy is to construct a transform to a constant-diffusion process and sample the transformed process instead. In this work, we explain how coordinate-based and time-rescaling-based transforms can be used either individually or in combination to map a general class of variable-diffusion Brownian motion processes into constant-diffusion ones. The transforms are invertible, thus allowing recovery of the original dynamics. We motivate our methodology using examples in one dimension before then considering multivariate diffusion processes. We illustrate the benefits of the transforms through numerical simulations, demonstrating how the right combination of integrator and transform can improve computational efficiency and the order of convergence to the invariant distribution. Notably, the transforms that we derive are applicable to a class of multibody, anisotropic Stokes-Einstein diffusion that has applications in biophysical modelling.</description>

Abstract: We present difference schemes for stochastic transport equations with low-regularity velocity fields. We establish $L^2$ stability and convergence of the difference approximations under conditions that are less strict than those required for deterministic transport equations. The $L^2$ estimate, crucial for the analysis, is obtained through a discrete duality argument and a comprehensive examination of a class of backward parabolic difference schemes.</description>

      <title>Proving the stability estimates of variational least-squares Kernel-Based methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the need for the rigorous analysis of the numerical stability of variational least-squares kernel-based methods for solving second-order elliptic partial differential equations, we provide previously lacking stability inequalities. This fills a significant theoretical gap in the previous work [Comput. Math. Appl. 103 (2021) 1-11], which provided error estimates based on a conjecture on the stability. With the stability estimate now rigorously proven, we complete the theoretical foundations and compare the convergence behavior to the proven rates. Furthermore, we establish another stability inequality involving weighted-discrete norms, and provide a theoretical proof demonstrating that the exact quadrature weights are not necessary for the weighted least-squares kernel-based collocation method to converge. Our novel theoretical insights are validated by numerical examples, which showcase the relative efficiency and accuracy of these methods on data sets with large mesh ratios. The results confirm our theoretical predictions regarding the performance of variational least-squares kernel-based method, least-squares kernel-based collocation method, and our new weighted least-squares kernel-based collocation method. Most importantly, our results demonstrate that all methods converge at the same rate, validating the convergence theory of weighted least-squares in our proven theories.</description>

      <title>High curvature means low-rank: On the sectional curvature of Grassmann and Stiefel manifolds and the underlying matrix trace inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01879v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Methods and algorithms that work with data on nonlinear manifolds are collectively summarized under the term `Riemannian computing'. In practice, curvature can be a key limiting factor for the performance of Riemannian computing methods. Yet, curvature can also be a powerful tool in the theoretical analysis of Riemannian algorithms. In this work, we investigate the sectional curvature of the Stiefel and Grassmann manifold. On the Grassmannian, tight curvature bounds are known since the late 1960ies. On the Stiefel manifold under the canonical metric, it was believed that the sectional curvature does not exceed 5/4. Under the Euclidean metric, the maximum was conjectured to be at 1. For both manifolds, the sectional curvature is given by the Frobenius norm of certain structured commutator brackets of skew-symmetric matrices. We provide refined inequalities for such terms and pay special attention to the maximizers of the curvature bounds. In this way, we prove for the Stiefel manifold that the global bounds of 5/4 (canonical metric) and 1 (Euclidean metric) hold indeed. With this addition, a complete account of the curvature bounds in all admissible dimensions is obtained. We observe that `high curvature means low-rank', more precisely, for the Stiefel and Grassmann manifolds under the canonical metric, the global curvature maximum is attained at tangent plane sections that are spanned by rank-two matrices, while the extreme curvature cases of the Euclidean Stiefel manifold occur for rank-one matrices. Numerical examples are included for illustration purposes.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a VEM-fully discrete polytopal scheme with bubble stabilisation for contact mechanics with Tresca friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work performs the convergence analysis of the polytopal nodal discretisation of contact-mechanics (with Tresca friction) recently introduced in [18] in the framework of poro-elastic models in fractured porous media. The scheme is based on a mixed formulation, using face-wise constant approximations of the Lagrange multipliers along the fracture network and a fully discrete first order nodal approximation of the displacement field. The displacement field is enriched with additional bubble degrees of freedom along the fractures to ensure the inf-sup stability with the Lagrange multiplier space. It is presented in a fully discrete formulation, which makes its study more straightforward, but also has a Virtual Element interpretation. The analysis establishes an abstract error estimate accounting for the fully discrete framework and the non-conformity of the discretisation. A first order error estimate is deduced for sufficiently smooth solutions both for the gradient of the displacement field and the Lagrange multiplier. A key difficulty of the numerical analysis is the proof of a discrete inf-sup condition, which is based on a non-standard $H^{-1/2}$-norm (to deal with fracture networks) and involves the jump of the displacements, not their traces. The analysis also requires the proof of a discrete Korn inequality for the discrete displacement field which takes into account fracture networks. Numerical experiments based on analytical solutions confirm our theoretical findings</description>

      <title>Irrational-window-filter projection method and application to quasiperiodic Schr\"odinger eigenproblems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, the irrational-window-filter projection method (IWFPM), for solving arbitrary dimensional global quasiperiodic systems. Based on the projection method (PM), IWFPM further utilizes the concentrated distribution of Fourier coefficients to filter out relevant spectral points using an irrational window. Moreover, a corresponding index-shift transform is designed to make the Fast Fourier Transform available. The corresponding error analysis on the function approximation level is also given. We apply IWFPM to 1D, 2D, and 3D quasiperiodic Schr\"odinger eigenproblems to demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency. IWFPM exhibits a significant computational advantage over PM for both extended and localized quantum states. Furthermore, the widespread existence of such spectral point distribution feature can endow IWFPM with significant potential for broader applications in quasiperiodic systems.</description>

      <title>Projection method for quasiperiodic elliptic equations and application to quasiperiodic homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, our main objective is to address the challenge of solving elliptic equations with quasiperiodic coefficients. To achieve accurate and efficient computation, we introduce the projection method, which enables the embedding of quasiperiodic systems into higher-dimensional periodic systems. To enhance the computational efficiency, we propose a compressed storage strategy for the stiffness matrix by its multi-level block circulant structure, reducing memory requirements while preserving accuracy. Furthermore, we design a diagonal preconditioner to efficiently solve the resulting high-dimensional linear system by reducing the condition number of the stiffness matrix. These techniques collectively contribute to the computational effectiveness of our proposed approach. We demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our approach through a series of numerical examples. Moreover, we apply our method to achieve a highly accurate computation of the homogenized coefficients for a quasiperiodic multiscale elliptic equation.</description>

      <title>On the Computational Power of Particle Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the computational power of particle methods, a well-established class of algorithms with applications in scientific computing and computer simulation. The computational power of a compute model determines the class of problems it can solve. Automata theory allows describing the computational power of abstract machines (automata) and the problems they can solve. At the top of the Chomsky hierarchy of formal languages and grammars are Turing machines, which resemble the concept on which most modern computers are built. Although particle methods can be interpreted as automata based on their formal definition, their computational power has so far not been studied. We address this by analyzing Turing completeness of particle methods. In particular, we prove two sets of restrictions under which a particle method is still Turing powerful, and we show when it loses Turing powerfulness. This contributes to understanding the theoretical foundations of particle methods and provides insight into the powerfulness of computer simulations.</description>

      <title>A Quadrature Approach for General-Purpose Batch Bayesian Optimization via Probabilistic Lifting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parallelisation in Bayesian optimisation is a common strategy but faces several challenges: the need for flexibility in acquisition functions and kernel choices, flexibility dealing with discrete and continuous variables simultaneously, model misspecification, and lastly fast massive parallelisation. To address these challenges, we introduce a versatile and modular framework for batch Bayesian optimisation via probabilistic lifting with kernel quadrature, called SOBER, which we present as a Python library based on GPyTorch/BoTorch. Our framework offers the following unique benefits: (1) Versatility in downstream tasks under a unified approach. (2) A gradient-free sampler, which does not require the gradient of acquisition functions, offering domain-agnostic sampling (e.g., discrete and mixed variables, non-Euclidean space). (3) Flexibility in domain prior distribution. (4) Adaptive batch size (autonomous determination of the optimal batch size). (5) Robustness against a misspecified reproducing kernel Hilbert space. (6) Natural stopping criterion.</description>

      <title>Towards a Foundation Model for Partial Differential Equations: Multi-Operator Learning and Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models, such as large language models, have demonstrated success in addressing various language and image processing tasks. In this work, we introduce a multi-modal foundation model for scientific problems, named PROSE-PDE. Our model, designed for bi-modality to bi-modality learning, is a multi-operator learning approach which can predict future states of spatiotemporal systems while concurrently learning the underlying governing equations of the physical system. Specifically, we focus on multi-operator learning by training distinct one-dimensional time-dependent nonlinear constant coefficient partial differential equations, with potential applications to many physical applications including physics, geology, and biology. More importantly, we provide three extrapolation studies to demonstrate that PROSE-PDE can generalize physical features through the robust training of multiple operators and that the proposed model can extrapolate to predict PDE solutions whose models or data were unseen during the training. Furthermore, we show through systematic numerical experiments that the utilization of the symbolic modality in our model effectively resolves the well-posedness problems with training multiple operators and thus enhances our model's predictive capabilities.</description>
