      <title>The inverse eigenvalue problems for perturbed Bessel operator with mixed data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider inverse eigenvalue problems for the perturbed Bessel operator in $L^{2}(0,1)$. (1) For the case where the angular-momentum quantum number $\ell\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$, we establish a uniqueness result for the inverse spectral problem by utilizing the closedness condition of a certain function system constructed based on the eigenvalues and the norming constants. (2) For the broader case where $\ell \geq -1/2$, we provide a uniqueness result for the inverse problem by using the density condition satisfied by the eigenvalues and the norming constants, where an additional smoothness condition may be imposed on the potential. (3) In the last section of this article, we present some corollaries based on (2). The results in these corollaries have already been established for the case $\ell=0$ by Gesztesy, Simon, Wei, Xu, Hatino\v{g}lu, et al., and we extend these results to the general case $\ell \geq -1/2$.</description>

      <title>The combinatorics of permuting and preserving curve-bound spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that continuous spectrum- and commutativity-preserving maps to $\mathcal{M}_n(\mathbb{C})$ from the space of normal (real or complex) $n\times n$, $n\ge 3$ matrices with spectra contained in a given continuous-injection interval image $\Lambda\subseteq \mathbb{C}$ or $\mathbb{R}$ are (a) conjugations; (b) transpose conjugations, or (c) orderings of spectra according to an orientation of $\Lambda$, with fixed eigenspaces. This generalizes results of Petek's (self-maps of real or complex Hermitian matrices) and the author's (complex Hermitian matrices as the domain, $\mathcal{M}_n(\mathbb{C})$ as the codomain). An application rules out possibility (c) for normal matrices with spectra constrained to a simple closed curve, extending a result by the author, Gogi\'c and Toma\v{s}evi\'c to the effect that continuous commutativity and spectrum preservers on unitary groups are (transpose) conjugations.
  The involution preserving eigenspaces and complex-conjugating eigenvalues is a novel possibility beyond (a), (b) and (c) if the domain consists of all semisimple operators with $\Lambda$-bound spectra instead; its continuity (or lack thereof) and whether or not that map furthermore extends continuously to arbitrary $\Lambda$-constrained-spectrum matrices hinge on the geometry and regularity of $\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Spectral Analysis of Weighted Weyl Fractional Operators: Aging, Infinite Memory, and the Amnesia Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a rigorous spectral framework for the Weighted Weyl Fractional Calculus, designed to model non-local systems exhibiting aging and subjective time scales. By constructing a conjugation map involving a time-dependent weight $\omega(t)$ and a scale function $\psi(t)$, we define a new class of fractional operators that preserve the spectral tractability of time-invariant systems. We derive the Spectral Mapping Theorem for these operators and prove that Weighted Mittag-Leffler functions act as their fundamental eigenfunctions, demonstrating that the Weighted Fourier Transform naturally diagonalizes the associated evolution equations. As a physical application, we formulate a constitutive law for aging viscoelastic materials with infinite memory. Crucially, we analytically demonstrate the "Amnesia Phenomenon": we prove that rapid aging modulates the system's history, effectively transforming the hereditary power-law decay into a short-range exponential relaxation. This result provides a closed-form explanation for the loss of memory in fast-aging media, overcoming the computational bottlenecks of standard discretization methods.</description>

      <title>Optimal Hardy Inequality for Fractional Laplacians on the Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fractional Hardy inequality on the integer lattice. We prove null-criticality of the Hardy weight and hence optimality of the constant. More specifically, we present a family of Hardy weights with respect to a parameter and show that below a certain threshold the Hardy weight is positive critical while above the threshold it is subcritical. In particular, the Hardy weight at the threshold is optimal in the sense that any larger weight would fail to be a Hardy weight and the Hardy inequality does not allow for a minimizer. A crucial ingredient in our proof is an asymptotic expansion of the fractional discrete Riesz kernel.</description>

      <title>Adjacency-diametrical matrix of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adjacency-diametrical matrix (AD matrix) of a connected graph $G$ with diameter $d$, denoted by $AD(G)$, is the matrix indexed by the vertices of $G$ in which the $(i,j)$-entry of $AD(G)$ is $1$ if $d_G(v_i,v_j)=1$, is $d$ if $d_G(v_i,v_j)=d$, and $0$ otherwise, where $d_G(v_i,v_j)$ denotes the distance between the vertices $v_i$ and $v_j$ in $G$. We determine the spectrum of the AD matrix for paths, cycles, and double star graphs and obtain its determinant for a connected graph. We characterize a class of bipartite graphs using the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial and the eigenvalues of the AD matrix. We establish bounds relating the eigenvalues of the AD matrix to various graph invariants, and we determine the spectrum of the AD matrix for graphs formed by the join, lexicographic product, and Cartesian product operations under certain conditions on the constituent graphs.</description>

      <title>Some classes of connected signed graphs with girth $g$ and negative inertia index $\lceil\frac{g}{2}\rceil+1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a signed graph. The number of negative eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of $\Gamma$ is called the negative inertia index of $\Gamma$, which is denoted by $i_-(\Gamma)$. The length of the shortest cycle contained in $\Gamma$ is called the girth of $\Gamma$, and it is denoted by $g$. In this paper, we give some classes of connected signed graphs $\Gamma$ which satisfy the condition $i_-(\Gamma)=\lceil\frac{g}{2}\rceil+1$.</description>

      <title>Optimal Spectral Inequality for the Higher-Dimensional Landau Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove optimal spectral inequalities for Landau operators in full space and in arbitrary dimension. Spectral inequalities are lower bounds on the L 2 -mass of functions in spectral subspaces of finite energy when integrated over a sampling set S $\subset$ R d . Landau operators are Schr{\"o}dinger operators associated with a constant magnetic field of the form (-$\nabla$ + A(x)) 2 where A is a -in case of non-vanishing magnetic field -unbounded vector potential. Our strategy relies on so-called magnetic Bernstein estimates and analyticity, adapting an approach used by Kovrijkine in the context of the Logvinenko-Sereda theorem. We generalize results previously only known in dimension d = 2. The main difficulty in dimension d $\ge$ 3 are the magnetic Bernstein inequalities which, in comparison to the twodimensional case, lead to additional complications and require more delicate estimates. Our results have immediate consequences for control theory, spectral theory and mathematical physics which we comment on.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity, global symplectification and the stability of Dry Ten Martini Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any fixed irrational frequency and trigonometric-polynomial potential, we show that every type I energy with positive Lyapunov exponent that satisfies the gap-labelling condition is a boundary of an open spectral gap. As a corollary, for the almost-Mathieu operator in the supercritical regime the "all spectral gaps are open" property is robust under a small trigonometric-polynomial perturbation at any irrational frequency. The proof introduces a geometric, all-frequency approach built from three ingredients: (i) the projective action on the Lagrangian Grassmannian and an associated fibred rotation number, (ii) monotonicity of one-parameter families of (Hermitian) symplectic cocycles, and (iii) a partially hyperbolic splitting with a two-dimensional center together with a global symplectification (holonomy-driven parallel transport). This provides a partial resolution to the stability of the Dry Ten Martini Problem in the supercritical regime, and answers a question by M. Shamis regarding the survival of periodic gaps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of Laurent multiple orthogonality on the unit circle and define Angelesco and AT systems in this setting. Using a generalized Andreief identity, we establish normality of all multi-indices for any such system, thereby ensuring existence and uniqueness of Laurent multiple orthogonal polynomials of type I and type II at every location. As an application, we demonstrate existence and uniqueness of the approximants for two natural two-point Hermite-Pad\'e problems -- type I and type II -- arising in the simultaneous rational approximation of $r$ Carath\'{e}odory functions.</description>

      <title>Local spectral approximation of unbounded operators: non-asymptotic and unified error quantification for subspace methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for subspace methods which approximate the spectra of self-adjoint, unbounded operators in a local region. Using the projection-valued measure, we derive integrated spectral inequalities that also apply to unbounded operators. Our framework is non-asymptotic, gap-independent, and enables a unified error quantification of numerical routines subject to multiple error sources. Furthermore, we formalize the class of methods applicable to our framework, and establish a rigorous foundation for dimension detection in the presence of noise as solution to frequent numerical artifacts such as spectral pollution. The practical relevance of this non-asymptotic analysis is substantiated by its recent application to sampled prolate filter diagonalization, where it successfully predicted a sharp accuracy transition linking spectral density to the minimal observation time required to decompose a signal.</description>
