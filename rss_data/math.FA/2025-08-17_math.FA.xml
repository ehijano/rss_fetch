      <title>On Chebyshev centers in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we observe that $X\in (GC)$ if $X$ admits Chebyshev center for any finite set in it. This answers the problem raised by Vesel\'y, addressed in [{\em Generalized centers of finite sets in Banach spaces}, Acta Math. Univ. Comenian. (N.S.) {\bf 66}(1) (1997), 83--115]. We extend our observation towards the fact that the property $(GC)$ is not a 3-space property.</description>

      <title>Frechet and Mordukhovich Derivative (Coderivative) and Covering Constant for Single-Valued Mapping in Euclidean Space with Application (II)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the study in part I for calculating the Frechet derivatives and Mordukhovich derivatives (coderivatives) and covering constants for single-valued mappings in Euclidean spaces (It is part I). In this paper, we particularly consider a norm-reserved mapping f: R^2 to R^2 that is defined by (1.1) in Section 1. We will find the precise solutions of Frechet derivative and Mordukhovich derivative at every point in R^2. By using these solutions, we will find the covering constant for this mapping f is exact 1 at every point in R^2 except the origin. Then we extend this mapping to R^4. Finally, by using the covering constant for f and by applying the Arutyunov Mordukhovich and Zhukovskiy Parameterized Coincidence Point Theorem, we will solve some parameterized equations.</description>

      <title>On Banach spaces with angelic Mackey duals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if $X$ is a sequentially reflexive Banach space, then its Mackey dual $(X^{*},\tau (X^{*}, X))$ is an angelic space. This builds on a result of J. Howard which says that in the Mackey dual $(X^{*}, \tau (X^{*}, X))$ of a Banach space $X$, relative sequential compactness is, in general, strictly stronger than relative compactness and that the two notions of compactness are equivalent if $X$ is reflexive or separable. Our main result gives a characterization of the sequentially reflexive spaces as the Banach spaces $X$ for which the the finest locally convex topology on $X^{*}$ with the same precompact sets as the Mackey topology $\tau (X^{*}, X)$ is the bound extension of $\tau (X^{*}, X)$.</description>

      <title>Rough convergence on Riesz spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends the theory of rough convergence from normed linear spaces to the more abstract setting of Riesz spaces. We introduce and systematically develop the concept of rough $\mathbb{c}$-convergence ($rc$-convergence) for nets. A net $(x_\alpha)_{\alpha\in A}$ in a Riesz space $E$ is said to be rough $\mathbb{c}$-convergent to $x\in E$ if there exists a net $(y_\alpha)_{\alpha\in A}$ in $E$ with $y_\alpha \xrightarrow[]{\mathbb{c}} \theta$ for a given background convergence $\mathbb{c}$, such that $|x_\alpha-x| \leq y_\alpha + \mathbb{r}$ holds for all $\alpha\in A$, where $\mathbb{r}$ is a fixed positive vector in $E$ representing the roughness degree. The study first establishes that this new construction satisfies the axioms of a formal convergence structure. Key properties of $\mathbb{rc}$-convergence are then investigated, including its relationship with linearity and the continuity of lattice operations. Since the limit of an $\mathbb{rc}$-convergent net is not necessarily unique, the paper dedicates significant analysis to the set of rough $\mathbb{c}$-limit points. Furthermore, a crucial connection is established between the order boundedness of a net and the non-emptiness of its set of $\mathbb{rc}$-limit points. This work provides a foundational framework for further exploration of convergence in Riesz spaces.</description>

      <title>Weak cluster points of maximizing sequences on Banach spaces satisfying $\boldsymbol{(M_p)}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a bounded linear operator $T$ on a separable Banach space with property $(M_p)$, we prove that the smallest and the largest norm of weak cluster points of all maximizing sequences for $T$ can only take the values $0$ or $1$. The three classes of bounded linear operators emerging from the dichotomy of these extremal norm values coincides with the partition, created by considering the norm-attaining property and if the essential norm equals the norm.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{L}^p$-based Sobolev theory for PDEs on closed manifolds of class $C^m$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $\mathrm{L}^p$-based ($1&lt;p&lt;\infty$) well-posedness and Sobolev regularity for appropriate weak formulations of the (stationary) Laplace--Beltrami, Bochner Laplace, tangent Stokes, and tangent Navier--Stokes problems on compact, connected $d$-dimensional manifolds without boundary of class $C^m$ ($m \geq 2$) embedded in $\mathrm{R}^{d+1}$, in terms of the regularity of the source terms and the manifold. Firstly, we localize and translate the Laplace--Beltrami problem into flat domains to establish $\mathrm{L}^p$-based ($2 \leq p &lt; \infty$) Sobolev regularity results as a consequence of the powerful Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund theory. From then onwards, our strategy is purely ``variational'', building upon the abstract functional analytic idea of ``duality'' and classical results such as the Banach--Ne\v{c}as--Babu\v{s}ka theorem and the generalized Babu\v{s}ka--Brezzi theory in reflexive Banach spaces to analyze and relate to each other different strong, weak and ultra-weak formulations for the aforementioned problems. In particular, by exploiting the lack of manifold boundary, we are able to decouple the velocity and the pressure unknowns in the tangent Stokes problem to establish their higher-regularity $\mathbf{W}^{k,p} \times \mathrm{W}^{k-1,p}$ ($k \geq 2$) as a consequence of the $\mathrm{L}^p$-based well-posedness and regularity theory for the Laplace--Beltrami and Bochner--Laplace operators. We finish this work by applying this newly derived regularity theory to: i) define and appropriate Stokes operator and study its spectral and regularity properties, ii) establish $\mathrm{L}^p$-based ($1&lt;p&lt;\infty$) existence and well-posedness for the (stationary) tangent Oseen and Navier--Stokes equations via a Galerkin method and bootstrapping, and higher $\mathrm{L}^p$-based Sobolev regularity results. iii) transfer our regularity results to other choices of vector Laplace operators.</description>

      <title>Banach modules, almost mathematics and condensed mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relationship between almost mathematics, condensed mathematics and the categories of seminormed and Banach modules over a Banach ring $A$, with submetric (norm-decreasing) $A$-module homomorphisms for morphisms. If $A$ is a Banach ring with a norm-multiplicative topologically nilpotent unit $\varpi$ contained in the closed unit ball $A_{\leq1}$ such that $\varpi$ admits a compatible system of $p$-power roots $\varpi^{1/p^{n}}$ with \begin{equation*}\lVert\varpi^{1/p^{n}}\rVert=\lVert\varpi\rVert^{1/p^{n}}\end{equation*}for all $n$, we prove that the "almost closed unit ball" functor \begin{equation*}M\mapsto M_{\leq1}^{a}\end{equation*}is an equivalence between the category of Banach $A$-modules and submetric $A$-module maps and the category of $\varpi$-adically complete, $\varpi$-torsion-free almost $(A_{\leq1}, (\varpi^{1/p^{\infty}}))$-modules. We also obtain an analogous result for Banach algebras and almost algebras. The main novelty in our approach is that we show that the norm on the Banach module $M$ is completely determined by the corresponding almost $A_{\leq1}$-module $M_{\leq1}^{a}$, rather than being determined only up to equivalence.
  We deduce from our results the existence of a natural fully faithful embedding of the category of Banach $A$-modules and submetric $A$-module maps into the category of (static) condensed almost $(A_{\leq1}, (\varpi^{1/p^{\infty}}))$-modules in the sense of Mann, which factors through the full subcategory of solid condensed $(A_{\leq1}, (\varpi^{1/p^{\infty}}))$-almost modules. If $A$ is perfectoid and the adic spectrum of $(A, A^{\circ})$ is totally disconnected, we show that this embedding transforms the complete tensor product of Banach $A$-modules into (an almost analog of) the solid tensor product of solid condensed almost modules.</description>

      <title>Explicit solutions to Christoffel-Minkowski problems and Hessian equations under rotational symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An explicit solution to the Christoffel-Minkowski problem for convex bodies of revolution is presented. The conditions on the prescribed measure involve only first moments over spherical caps, and the support function of the resulting convex body is given by an explicit representation formula in terms of the measure. More generally, existence problems for mixed area measures are addressed. The approach relies on constructing explicit convex solutions to mixed Monge-Amp\`ere equations on $\mathbb{R}^n$ under the assumption of radial symmetry, with the conditions on the measure being expressed through its values on open balls. As a special case, the Dirichlet problem for $k$-Hessian equations on $\mathbb{R}^n$ is treated.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new geometric constant based on a generalization of the parallelogram law, and study its properties as well as some relationships with other well-known geometric constants. A sufficient condition for normal structure is presented. Next, we introduce a constant and calculate its value in a specific space. Furthermore, we introduce another new constant and investigate some of its basic properties.</description>

      <title>Generic nonexpansive Hilbert space mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a closed convex set $C$ in a separable, infinite-dimensional Hilbert space and endow the set $\mathcal{N}(C)$ of nonexpansive self-mappings on $C$ with the topology of pointwise convergence. We introduce the notion of a somewhat bounded set and establish a strong connection between this property and the existence of fixed points for the generic $f\in\mathcal{N}(C)$, in the sense of Baire categories. Namely, if $C$ is somewhat bounded, the generic nonexpansive mapping on $C$ admits a fixed point, whereas if $C$ is not somewhat bounded, the generic nonexpansive mapping on $C$ does not have any fixed points. This results in a topological 0-1 law: the set of all $f\in\mathcal{N}(C)$ with a fixed point is either meager or residual. We further prove that, generically, there are no fixed points in the interior of $C$ and, under additional geometric assumptions, we show the uniqueness of such fixed points for the generic $f\in\mathcal{N}(C)$ and the convergence of the iterates of $f$ to its fixed point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate threshold phenomena in weighted $\ell^2$-spaces and characterize the critical regimes where elements with either small support or maximally bad range can be constructed. Our results are shown to be optimal in several respects, and our proofs principally rely on techniques involving sparse Fourier spectrum. We further show that these seemingly pathological constructions are actually generic from certain categorical perspectives.</description>
