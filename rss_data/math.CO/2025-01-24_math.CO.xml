      <title>On the Existence of Balanced Chain Rule Task Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mathematics education research, mathematics task sets involving mixed practice include tasks from many different topics within the same assignment. In this paper, we use graph decompositions to construct mixed practice task sets for Calculus I, focusing on derivative computation tasks, or tasks of the form "Compute $f'(x)$ of the function $f(x)=$ [elementary function]." A decomposition $D$ of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a collection $\{H_1, H_2, ... , H_t\}$ of nonempty subgraphs such that $H_i=G[E_i]$ for some nonempty subset $E_i$ of $E(G)$, and $\{E_1, E_2, ... , E_t\}$ is a partition of $E(G)$. We extend results on decompositions of the complete directed graph due to Meszka and Skupie\'n to construct balanced task sets that assess the Chain Rule.</description>

      <title>A refined lower bound theorem for $d$-polytopes with at most $2d$ vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1967, Gr\"unbaum conjectured that the function $$ \phi_k(d+s,d):=\binom{d+1}{k+1}+\binom{d}{k+1}-\binom{d+1-s}{k+1},\; \text{for $2\le s\le d$} $$ provides the minimum number of $k$-faces for a $d$-dimensional polytope (abbreviated as a $d$-polytope) with $d+s$ vertices. In 2021, Xue proved this conjecture for each $k\in[1\ldots d-2]$ and characterised the unique minimisers, each having $d+2$ facets.
  In this paper, we refine Xue's theorem by considering $d$-polytopes with $d+s$ vertices ($2\le s\le d$) and at least $d+3$ facets. If $s=2$, then there is precisely one minimiser for many values of $k$. For other values of $s$, the number of $k$-faces is at least $\phi_k(d+s,d)+\binom{d-1}{k}-\binom{d+1-s}{k}$, which is met by precisely two polytopes in many cases, and up to five polytopes for certain values of $s$ and $k$. We also characterise the minimising polytopes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph code is a linear code obtained from linear codes $C$ and a certain bipartite graph G. In this paper, I propose an expansion of the definition of graph code to general $l$-partite, and give its lower bound of minimum distance. I also give an example of generalized graph code and calculate its parameters $[n, k, d]$.</description>

      <title>The r-Dynamic Chromatic Number is Bounded in the Strong 2-Coloring Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A proper vertex-coloring of a graph is $r$-dynamic if the neighbors of each vertex $v$ receive at least $\min(r, \mathrm{deg}(v))$ different colors. In this note, we prove that if $G$ has a strong $2$-coloring number at most $k$, then $G$ admits an $r$-dynamic coloring with no more than $(k-1)r+1$ colors. As a consequence, for every class of graphs of bounded expansion, the $r$-dynamic chromatic number is bounded by a linear function in $r$. We give a concrete upper bound for graphs of bounded row-treewidth, which includes for example all planar graphs.</description>

      <title>Cornerless, peakless, valleyless Motzkin paths (regular and skew) and applications to bargraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motzkin paths consist of up-steps, down-steps, horizontal steps, never go below the $x$-axis and return to the $x$-axis. Versions where the return to the $x$-axis isn't required are also considered. A path is peakless (valleyless) if $UD$ (if $DU$) never occurs. If it is both peakless and valleyless, it is called cornerless. Deutsch and Elizalde have linked cornerless Motzkin paths and bargraphs bijectly. Thus, instead of prefixes of bargraphs one might consider prefixes of cornerless Motzkin paths. In this paper, this is extended by counting the occurrences of $UD$ resp., $DU$. The concepts are extended to so-called skew Motzkin paths. Methods are generating functions and the kernel method to compute explicit forms.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of caterpillar tanglegrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A tanglegram consists of two rooted binary trees with the same number of leaves and a perfect matching between the leaves of the trees. Given a size-$n$ tanglegram, i.e., a tanglegram for two trees with $n$ leaves, a multiset of induced size-$(n-1)$ tanglegrams is obtained by deleting a pair of matched leaves in every possible way. Here, we analyze whether a size-$n$ tanglegram is uniquely encoded by this multiset of size-$(n-1)$ tanglegrams. We answer this question affirmatively in the case that at least one of the two trees of the tanglegram is a caterpillar tree.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the recursive sequence of polynomials $p_n(x)$, defined by $p_0(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $p_n(x) = p_{n-1}(x)^2 - 2$ for $n \geq 1$. It describes the field-theoretic motivations behind this sequence, derives a recursive formula for its coefficients, and identifies invariants that uncover combinatorial connections, including links to weighted Catalan numbers.</description>

      <title>The odd triangle ring puzzle problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ring puzzles are tessellations of the Euclidean plane respecting local constraints around vertices. Such puzzles may arise in geometric group theory, for example, as embedded flat planes in certain CAT(0) complexes of dimension 2. In the present paper, we solve the odd ring puzzle problem, which is associated with the unique odd Moebius--Kantor CAT(0) complex by the method of Sidon sequences. We prove that there are precisely three families of such puzzles, two uncountable families, and a finite family of twelve exceptional puzzles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph \( G \) is said to be \( m \)-minor-universal if every graph with at most \( m \) edges (and no isolated vertices) is a minor of \( G \). We prove that the \( d \)-dimensional hypercube, \( Q_d \), is \( \Omega\left(\frac{2^d}{d}\right) \)-minor-universal, and that there exists an absolute constant \( C \) such that \( Q_d \) is not \( \frac{C2^d}{\sqrt{d}} \)-minor-universal. Similar results are obtained in a more generalized setting, where we bound the size of minors in a product of finite connected graphs. We discuss future directions and pose open problems.</description>

      <title>On the hook length biases of the $2$- and $3$-regular partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $b_{t,i}(n)$ denote the total number of the $i$ hooks in the $t$-regular partitions of $n$. Singh and Barman (J. Number Theory { 264} (2024), 41--58) raised two conjectures on $b_{t,i}(n)$. The first conjecture is on the positivity of $b_{3,2}(n)-b_{3,1}(n)$ for $n\ge 28$. The second conjecture states that when $k\ge 3$, $b_{2,k}(n)\ge b_{2,k+1}(n)$ for all $n$ except for $n= k+1$. In this paper, we confirm the first conjecture. {Moreover, we show that for any odd $k\ge 3$, the second conjecture fails for infinitely many $n$.} {Furthermore, we verify that the second conjecture holds for $k=4$ and $6$.} We also propose a conjecture on the even case $k$, which is a modification of Singh and Barman's second conjecture.</description>

      <title>On total transitivity of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V, E)$ be a graph where $V$ and $E$ are the vertex and edge sets, respectively. For two disjoint subsets $A$ and $B$ of $V$, we say $A$ \emph{dominates} $B$ if every vertex of $B$ is adjacent to at least one vertex of $A$. A vertex partition $\pi = \{V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_k\}$ of $G$ is called a \emph{transitive partition} of size $k$ if $V_i$ dominates $V_j$ for all $1\leq i&lt;j\leq k$. In this article, we study a variation of transitive partition, namely \emph{total transitive partition}. The total transitivity $Tr_t(G)$ is equal to the maximum order of a vertex partition $\pi = \{V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_k\}$ of $G$ obtained by repeatedly removing a total dominating set from $G$, until no vertices remain. Thus, $V_1$ is a total dominating set of $G$, $V_2$ is a total dominating set of the graph $G_1=G-V_1$, and, in general, $V_{i+1}$ is a total dominating set in the graph $G_i=G-\bigcup_{j=1}^i V_i$. A vertex partition of order $Tr_t(G)$ is called $Tr_t$-partition. The \textsc{Maximum Total Transitivity Problem} is to find a total transitive partition of a given graph with the maximum number of parts. First, we characterize split graphs with total transitivity equal to $1$ and $\omega(G)-1$. Moreover, for the split graph $G$ and $1\leq p\leq \omega(G)-1$, we give some necessary conditions for $Tr_t(G)=p$. Furthermore, we show that the decision version of this problem is NP-complete for bipartite graphs. On the positive side, we design a polynomial-time algorithm to solve \textsc{Maximum Total Transitivity Problem} in trees.</description>

      <title>Cutting a unit square and permuting blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a random permutation of $kn$ objects that permutes $n$ disjoint blocks of size $k$ and then permutes elements within each block. Normalizing its cycle lengths by $kn$ gives a random partition of unity, and we derive the limit law of this partition as $k,n \to \infty$. The limit may be constructed via a simple square cutting procedure that generalizes stick breaking in the classical case of uniform permutations ($k=1$). The proof is by coupling, providing upper and lower bounds on the Wasserstein distance. The limit is shown to have a certain self-similar structure that gives the distribution of large cycles and relates to a multiplicative function involving the Dickman function. Along the way we also give the first extension of the Erd\H{o}s-Tur\'an law to a proper permutation subgroup.</description>

      <title>Uniform set systems with small VC-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the longstanding problem of determining the maximum size of a $(d+1)$-uniform set system with VC-dimension at most $d$. Since the seminal 1984 work of Frankl and Pach, which established the elegant upper bound $\binom{n}{d}$, this question has resisted significant progress. The best-known lower bound is $\binom{n-1}{d} + \binom{n-4}{d-2}$, obtained by Ahlswede and Khachatrian, leaving a substantial gap of $\binom{n-1}{d-1}-\binom{n-4}{d-2}$. Despite decades of effort, improvements to the Frankl--Pach bound have been incremental at best: Mubayi and Zhao introduced an $\Omega_d(\log{n})$ improvement for prime powers $d$, while Ge, Xu, Yip, Zhang, and Zhao achieved a gain of 1 for general $d$.
  In this work, we provide a purely combinatorial approach that significantly sharpens the Frankl--Pach upper bound. Specifically, for large $n$, we demonstrate that the Frankl--Pach bound can be improved to $\binom{n}{d} - \binom{n-1}{d-1} + O_d(n^{d-1 - \frac{1}{4d-2}})=\binom{n-1}{d}+O_d(n^{d-1 - \frac{1}{4d-2}})$. This result completely removes the main term $\binom{n-1}{d-1}$ from the previous gap between the known lower and upper bounds. It also offers fresh insights into the combinatorial structure of uniform set systems with small VC-dimension. In addition, the original Erd\H{o}s--Frankl--Pach conjecture, which sought to generalize the EKR theorem in the 1980s, has been disproven. We propose a new refined conjecture that might establish a sturdier bridge between VC-dimension and the EKR theorem, and we verify several specific cases of this conjecture, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On 1-11-representability and multi-1-11-representability of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jeff Remmel introduced the concept of a $k$-11-representable graph in 2017. This concept was first explored by Cheon et al. in 2019, who considered it as a natural extension of word-representable graphs, which are exactly 0-11-representable graphs. A graph $G$ is $k$-11-representable if it can be represented by a word $w$ such that for any edge (resp., non-edge) $xy$ in $G$ the subsequence of $w$ formed by $x$ and $y$ contains at most $k$ (resp., at least $k+1$) pairs of consecutive equal letters. A remarkable result of Cheon at al. is that any graph is 2-11-representable, while it is still unknown whether every graph is 1-11-representable. Cheon et al. showed that the class of 1-11-representable graphs is strictly larger than that of word-representable graphs, and they introduced a useful toolbox to study 1-11-representable graphs, which was extended by additional powerful tools suggested by Futorny et al. in 2024.
  In this paper, we prove that all graphs on at most 8 vertices are 1-11-representable hence extending the known fact that all graphs on at most 7 vertices are 1-11-representable. Also, we discuss applications of our main result in the study of multi-1-11-representation of graphs we introduce in this paper analogously to the notion of multi-word-representation of graphs suggested by Kenkireth and Malhotra in 2023.</description>

      <title>Universal optimality of $T$-avoiding spherical codes and designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an open set (a union of open intervals), $T\subset [-1,1]$ we introduce the concepts of $T$-avoiding spherical codes and designs, that is, spherical codes that have no inner products in the set $T$. We show that certain codes found in the minimal vectors of the Leech lattices, as well as the minimal vectors of the Barnes--Wall lattice and codes derived from strongly regular graphs, are universally optimal in the restricted class of $T$-avoiding codes. We also extend a result of Delsarte--Goethals--Seidel about codes with three inner products $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ (in our terminology $(\alpha,\beta)$-avoiding $\gamma$-codes). Parallel to the notion of tight spherical designs, we also derive that these codes are minimal (tight) $T$-avoiding spherical designs of fixed dimension and strength. In some cases, we also find that codes under consideration have maximal cardinality in their $T$-avoiding class for given dimension and minimum distance.</description>

      <title>Graphs with no long claws: An improved bound for the analog of the Gy\'{a}rf\'{a}s' path argument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a fixed integer $t \geq 1$, a ($t$-)long claw, denoted $S_{t,t,t}$, is the unique tree with three leaves, each at distance exactly $t$ from the vertex of degree three. Majewski et al. [ICALP 2022, ACM ToCT 2024] proved an analog of the Gy\'{a}rf\'{a}s' path argument for $S_{t,t,t}$-free graphs: given an $n$-vertex $S_{t,t,t}$-free graph, one can delete neighborhoods of $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ vertices so that the remainder admits an extended strip decomposition (an appropriate generalization of partition into connected components) into particles of multiplicatively smaller size. This statement has proven to be very useful in designing quasi-polynomial time algorithms for Maximum Weight Independent Set and related problems in $S_{t,t,t}$-free graphs.
  In this work, we refine the argument of Majewski et al. and show that a constant number of neighborhoods suffice.</description>

      <title>Complexity and Algorithm for the Matching vertex-cutset Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1985, Chv\'{a}tal introduced the concept of star cutsets as a means to investigate the properties of perfect graphs, which inspired many researchers to study cutsets with some specific structures, for example, star cutsets, clique cutsets, stable cutsets. In recent years, approximation algorithms have developed rapidly, the computational complexity associated with determining the minimum vertex cut possessing a particular structural property have attracted considerable academic attention.
  In this paper, we demonstrate that determining whether there is a matching vertex-cutset in $H$ with size at most $k$, is $\mathbf{NP}$-complete, where $k$ is a given positive integer and $H$ is a connected graph. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for a connected graph $H$, there exists a $2$-approximation algorithm in $O(nm^2)$ for us to find a minimum matching vertex-cutset. Finally, we show that every plane graph $H$ satisfying $H\not\in\{K_2, K_4\}$ contains a matching vertex-cutset with size at most three, and this bound is tight.</description>

      <title>Failure of the Lefschetz property for the Graphic Matroid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the strong Lefschetz property for standard graded Artinian Gorenstein algebras. Such an algebra has a presentation of the quotient algebra of the ring of the differential polynomials modulo the annihilator of some homogeneous polynomial. There is a characterization of the strong Lefschetz property for such an algebra by the non-degeneracy of the higher Hessian matrix of the homogeneous polynomial. Maeno and Numata conjectured that if such an algebra is defined by the basis generating polynomial of any matroid, then it has the strong Lefschetz property. For this conjecture, we give counterexamples that are associated with graphic matroids. We prove the degeneracy of the higher Hessian matrix by constructing a non-zero element in the kernel of that matrix.</description>

      <title>A New Construction of Non-Binary Deletion Correcting Codes and their Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-binary codes correcting multiple deletions have recently attracted a lot of attention. In this work, we focus on multiplicity-free codes, a family of non-binary codes where all symbols are distinct. Our main contribution is a new explicit construction of such codes, based on set and permutation codes. We show that our multiplicity-free codes can correct multiple deletions and provide a decoding algorithm. We also show that, for a certain regime of parameters, our constructed codes have size larger than all the previously known non-binary codes correcting multiple deletions.</description>

      <title>On the $L^q$ dimension of stationary measures for M\"{o}bius iterated function systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $L^q$ dimension $D(\nu,q)\ (q&gt;1)$ of stationary measures $\nu$ for M\"{o}bius iterated function systems on $\mathbb{R}$ satisfying the strongly Diophantine condition, and try the extension of Shmerkin's result \cite[Theorem 6.6]{Shm19}. As the result, we show that there is the dichotomy: the $L^q$ spectrum $\tau(\nu,q)=(q-1)D(\nu,q)$ is equal to the desired value $\min\{\widetilde{\tau}(\nu,q),q-1\}$ for any $q&gt;1$, where $\widetilde{\tau}(\nu,q)$ is the zero of the canonical pressure function, or there exist $q_0&gt;1$ and $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$ such that $\tau(\nu,q)=\min\{\widetilde{\tau}(\nu,q),q-1\}$ for $1&lt;q&lt;q_0$ and $\tau(\nu,q)=\alpha q$ for $q\geq q_0$. In addition, we give examples of M\"{o}bius iterated function systems which show the latter case by giving an affirmative answer to Solomyak's question \cite[Question 2]{Sol24}.</description>

      <title>Forbidden Induced Subgraphs for Bounded Shrub-Depth and the Expressive Power of MSO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The graph parameter shrub-depth is a dense analog of tree-depth. We characterize classes of bounded shrub-depth by forbidden induced subgraphs. The obstructions are well-controlled flips of large half-graphs and of disjoint unions of many long paths. Applying this characterization, we show that on every hereditary class of unbounded shrub-depth, MSO is more expressive than FO. This confirms a conjecture of [Gajarsk\'y and Hlin\v{e}n\'y; LMCS 2015] who proved that on classes of bounded shrub-depth FO and MSO have the same expressive power. Combined, the two results fully characterize the hereditary classes on which FO and MSO coincide, answering an open question by [Elberfeld, Grohe, and Tantau; LICS 2012].
  Our work is inspired by the notion of stability from model theory. A graph class C is MSO-stable, if no MSO-formula can define arbitrarily long linear orders in graphs from C. We show that a hereditary graph class is MSO-stable if and only if it has bounded shrub-depth. As a key ingredient, we prove that every hereditary class of unbounded shrub-depth FO-interprets the class of all paths. This improves upon a result of [Ossona de Mendez, Pilipczuk, and Siebertz; Eur. J. Comb. 2025] who showed the same statement for FO-transductions instead of FO-interpretations.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph in which each edge is assigned one of the colours $1, 2, \ldots, m$, and let $\Gamma$ be a subgroup of $S_m$. The operation of switching at a vertex $x$ of $G$ with respect to an element $\pi$ of $\Gamma$ permutes the colours of the edges incident with $x$ according to $\pi$. We investigate the complexity of whether there exists a sequence of switches that transforms a given $m$-edge coloured graph $G$ so that it has a colour-preserving homomorphism to a fixed $m$-edge coloured graph $H$ and give a dichotomy theorem in the case that $\Gamma$ acts transitively.</description>

      <title>Action convergence of general hypergraphs and tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Action convergence provides a limit theory for linear bounded operators $A_n:L^{\infty}(\Omega_n)\longrightarrow L^1(\Omega_n)$ where $\Omega_n$ are potentially different probability spaces. This notion of convergence emerged in graph limits theory as it unifies and generalizes many notions of graph limits. We generalize the theory of action convergence to sequences of multi-linear bounded operators $A_n:L^{\infty}(\Omega_n)\times \ldots \times L^{\infty}(\Omega_n)\longrightarrow L^1(\Omega_n)$. Similarly to the linear case, we obtain that for a uniformly bounded (under an appropriate norm) sequence of multi-linear operators, there exists an action convergent subsequence. Additionally, we explain how to associate different types of multi-linear operators to a tensor and we study the different notions of convergence that we obtain for tensors and in particular for adjacency tensors of hypergraphs. We obtain several hypergraphs convergence notions and we link these with the hierarchy of notions of quasirandomness for hypergraph sequences. This convergence also covers sparse and inhomogeneous hypergraph sequences and it preserves many properties of adjacency tensors of hypergraphs. Moreover, we explain how to obtain a meaningful convergence for sequences of non-uniform hypergraphs and, therefore, also for simplicial complexes. Additionally, we highlight many connections with the theory of dense uniform hypergraph limits (hypergraphons) and we conjecture the equivalence of this theory with a modification of multi-linear action convergence.</description>

Abstract: A conjecture of Jackson from 1981 states that every $d$-regular oriented graph on $n$ vertices with $n\leq 4d+1$ is Hamiltonian. We prove this conjecture for sufficiently large $n$. In fact we prove a more general result that for all $\alpha&gt;0$, there exists $n_0=n_0(\alpha)$ such that every $d$-regular digraph on $n\geq n_0$ vertices with $d \geq \alpha n $ can be covered by at most $n/(d+1)$ vertex-disjoint cycles, and moreover that if $G$ is an oriented graph, then at most $n/(2d+1)$ cycles suffice.</description>

Abstract: We provide a construction for the kromatic symmetric function $\overline{X}_G$ of a graph introduced by Crew, Pechenik, and Spirkl using combinatorial (linearly compact) Hopf algebras. As an application, we show that $\overline{X}_G$ has a positive expansion into multifundamental quasisymmetric functions. We also study two related quasisymmetric $q$-analogues of $\overline{X}_G$, which are $K$-theoretic generalizations of the quasisymmetric chromatic function of Shareshian and Wachs. We classify exactly when one of these analogues is symmetric. For the other, we derive a positive expansion into symmetric Grothendieck functions when $G$ is the incomparability graph of a natural unit interval order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the minimum genus of a graph is a fundamental optimisation problem in the study of network design and implementation as it gives a measure of non-planarity of graphs. In this paper, we are concerned with determining the smallest value of $g$ such that a given graph $G$ has an embedding on the orientable surface of genus $g$. In particular, we consider the Cartesian product of graphs since this is a well studied graph operation which is often used for modelling interconnection networks. The $s$-cube $Q_i^{(s)}$ is obtained by taking the repeated Cartesian product of $i$ complete bipartite graphs $K_{s,s}$. We determine the genus of the Cartesian product of the $2r$-cube with the repeated Cartesian product of cycles and of the Cartesian product of the $2r$-cube with the repeated Cartesian product of paths.</description>

Abstract: A consistent path system in a graph $G$ is an collection of paths, with exactly one path between any two vertices in $G$. A path system is said to be consistent if it is intersection-closed. We say that $G$ is strictly metrizable if every consistent path system in $G$ can be realized as the system of unique geodesics with respect to some assignment of positive edge weight. In this paper, we show that the family of strictly metrizable graphs is minor-closed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove two theorems about tree-decompositions in the setting of coarse graph theory. First, we show that a graph $G$ admits a tree-decomposition in which each bag is contained in the union of a bounded number of balls of bounded radius, if and only if $G$ admits a quasi-isometry to a graph with bounded tree-width. (The ``if'' half is easy, but the ``only if'' half is challenging.) This generalizes a recent result of Berger and Seymour, concerning tree-decompositions when each bag has bounded radius.
  Second, we show that if $G$ admits a quasi-isometry $\phi$ to a graph $H$ of bounded path-width, then $G$ admits a quasi-isometry (with error only an additive constant) to a graph of bounded path-width. Indeed, we will show a much stronger statement: that we can assign a non-negative integer length to each edge of $H$, such that the same function $\phi$ is a quasi-isometry (with error only an additive constant) to this weighted version of $H$.</description>

Abstract: The standard notion of poset probability of a finite poset P involves calculating, for incomparable $\alpha$, $\beta$ in P, the number of linear extensions of P for which $\alpha$ precedes $\beta$. The fraction of those linear extensions among all linear extensions of P is the probability that $\alpha &lt; \beta$. The question of whether there is always a pair $\alpha, \beta$ such that this probability lies between 1/3 and 2/3, in any poset P (that is not a chain) is the famous "1/3-2/3-conjecture".
  A general way of counting linear extensions of P for which $\alpha$ precedes $\beta$ is to count linear extensions of the poset obtained by adding the relation $(\alpha,\beta)$, and its transitive consequences.
  For chain-products, and more generally for partition posets, lattice-path methods can be used to count the number of those linear extensions.
  We present an alternative approach to find the pertinent linear extensions. It relies on finding the "blocking ideals" in $J(P)$, where $J(P)$ is the lattice of order ideals in P. This method works for all finite posets.
  We illustrate this method by using blocking ideals to find explicit formulas of poset probabilities in cell posets $P_{\lambda}$ of two-row partitions. Well-known formulae such as the hook-length formula for $f^\lambda$, the number of standard Young tableaux on a partition $\lambda$, and the corresponding determinental formula by Jacobi-Trudi-Aitken for $f^{\lambda / \mu}$, the number of standard Young tableaux on a skew partition $\lambda / \mu$, are used along the way.
  We also calculate the limit probabilities when the elements $\alpha,\beta$ are fixed cells, but the arm-lengths tend to infinity.</description>

Abstract: A conjecture of Verstra\"ete states that for any fixed $\ell &lt; k$ there exists a positive constant $c$ such that any $C_{2k}$-free graph $G$ contains a $C_{2\ell}$-free subgraph with at least $c |E(G)|$ edges. For $\ell = 2$, this conjecture was verified by K\"uhn and Osthus. We show that $C_6$ and $C_{2k}$ satisfy the conjecture for all odd $k$, but observe that a recent construction of a dense $C_{10}$-free subgraph of the hypercube yields a counterexample to the conjecture for $C_8$ and $C_{10}$.</description>

      <title>Dimension of Diophantine approximation and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a new family of sets via Diophantine approximation, in which the classical examples are endpoints.
  Our first application is on their Hausdorff dimension. We show a recent result of Ren and Wang, known sharp on orthogonal projections in the plane, is also sharp on $A+cB$, $c\in C$, thus completely settle this ABC sum-product problem. Higher dimensional examples are also discussed.
  In addition to Hausdorff dimension, we also consider Fourier dimension. In particular, now for every $0\leq t\leq s\leq 1$ we have an explicit construction in $\mathbb{R}$ of Hausdorff dimension $s$ and Fourier dimension $t$, together with a measure $\mu$ that captures both dimensions.
  In the end we give new sharpness examples for the Mockenhaupt-Mitsis-Bak-Seeger Fourier restriction theorem. In particular, to deal with the non-geometric case we construct measures of "Hausdorff dimension" $a$ and Fourier dimension $b$, even if $a&lt;b$. This clarifies some difference between sets and measures.</description>

      <title>Simplifying and Characterizing DAGs and Phylogenetic Networks via Least Common Ancestor Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00708v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rooted phylogenetic networks, or more generally, directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), are widely used to model species or gene relationships that traditional rooted trees cannot fully capture, especially in the presence of reticulate processes or horizontal gene transfers. Such networks or DAGs are typically inferred from observable data (e.g. genomic sequences of extant species), providing only an estimate of the true evolutionary history. However, these inferred DAGs are often complex and difficult to interpret. In particular, many contain vertices that do not serve as least common ancestors (LCAs) for any subset of the underlying genes or species, thus may lack direct support from the observable data. In contrast, LCA vertices are witnessed by historical traces justifying their existence and thus represent ancestral states substantiated by the data. To reduce unnecessary complexity and eliminate unsupported vertices, we aim to simplify a DAG to retain only LCA vertices while preserving essential evolutionary information.
  In this paper, we characterize $\mathrm{LCA}$-relevant and $\mathrm{lca}$-relevant DAGs, defined as those in which every vertex serves as an LCA (or unique LCA) for some subset of taxa. We introduce methods to identify LCAs in DAGs and efficiently transform any DAG into an $\mathrm{LCA}$-relevant or $\mathrm{lca}$-relevant one while preserving key structural properties of the original DAG or network. This transformation is achieved using a simple operator ``$\ominus$'' that mimics vertex suppression.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Algorithm for Permutation Iteration Using a Singly Linked List</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10102v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for iterating over all permutations of a sequence. The algorithm leverages elementary $O(1)$ operations on recursive lists. As a result, no new nodes are allocated during the computation. Instead, all elements are rearranged within the original nodes of the singly linked list throughout the process. While permutations are generated in an unusual order, the transitions between consecutive permutations remain smooth. A proof of concept written in the Lisp programming language is proposed and discussed.</description>
