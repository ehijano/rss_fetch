      <title>Emission Characteristics of Energetic Electrons with Crescent-shaped Velocity Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar flares release magnetic energy through reconnection, accelerating electrons into nonthermal velocity distributions, including crescent-shaped electron populations. These energetic electron distributions are crucial in driving instabilities which can lead to distinct electromagnetic emissions. This study investigates the emission properties of crescent-shaped electron velocity distribution functions (EVDFs) under different frequency ratios ($\omega_{pe}/\Omega_{ce}$), critical for understanding plasma conditions in various astrophysical environments, by comparing the emissions and intensities of waves among different cases. Here, we study and analyze three distinct frequency ratio conditions (2.2, 10, and 1, designated as cases A, B, and C, respectively). We found that the beam-Langmuir (BL) and upper-hybrid (UH) modes can be efficiently excited, leading to further plasma emissions in different cases. Our study reveals that the fundamental (O/F) emission can reach a maximum value of $\sim$$10^{-4} E_{\mathrm{k}0}$, while the harmonics (H) can extend to $\sim$$1.5 \times 10^{-5} E_{\mathrm{k}0}$ depending on the frequency ratio of the environment. The intensity of the fundamental mode exceeds previous findings for pure-ring, beam, and ring-beam distributions, highlighting the impact of crescent-shaped electron velocity distributions on wave excitation and emission processes. This effect is notably influenced by different frequency ratios, offering new insights into the way that nonthermal electron distributions affect the plasma emission process.</description>

      <title>Observations of Turbulence and Transport of Energetic Particles at Interplanetary Shocks: Transition of Transport Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transport of energetic particles is intimately related to the properties of plasma turbulence, a ubiquitous dynamic process that transfers energy across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales. However, the mechanisms governing the interactions between plasma turbulence and energetic particles remain incompletely understood. Here we present comprehensive observations from the upstream region of a quasi-perpendicular interplanetary (IP) shock on 2004 January 22, using data from four Cluster spacecraft to investigate the interplay between turbulence dynamics and energetic particle transport. Our observations reveal a transition in energetic proton fluxes from exponential to power-law decay with increasing distance from the IP shock. This result provides possible observational evidence of a shift in transport behavior from normal diffusion to superdiffusion. This transition correlates with an increase in the time ratio from $\tau_s/\tau_{c}&lt;1$ to $\tau_s/\tau_{c}\gg1$, where $\tau_s$ is the proton isotropization time, and $\tau_{c}$ is the turbulence correlation time. Additionally, the frequency-wavenumber distributions of magnetic energy in the power-law decay zone indicate that energetic particles excite linear Alfv\'en-like harmonic waves through gyroresonance, thereby modulating the original turbulence structure. These findings provide valuable insights for future studies on the propagation and acceleration of energetic particles in turbulent astrophysical and space plasma systems.</description>

      <title>Using the STIX background detector as a proxy for GOES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-Rays (STIX) onboard Solar Orbiter was designed to observe solar flares in the X-ray range of 4-150 keV, providing spectral, temporal and spatial information. Besides 30 imaging detectors, STIX has two additional detectors, the coarse flare locator (CFL) and the background (BKG) detector. Flares observed from Earth are classified using their peak X-ray flux observed by the GOES satellites. Roughly half of all flares observed by STIX are located on the backside of the Sun. These flares lack a GOES-class classification.
  Aims. In this paper, we describe the calibration of the BKG detector aperture sizes. Using the calibrated measurements of the BKG detector, we explore the relationship between the peak flux for flares jointly observed by STIX and GOES. This allows us to estimate the GOES flare classes of backside flares using STIX measurements.
  Methods. We looked at the 500 largest flares observed by both STIX and GOES in the time range Feb. 21 to Apr. 23. Aperture size calibration is done by comparing 4-10 keV counts of the BKG detector with the CFL measurements. In a second step, we correlate the calibrated STIX BKG peak flux with the GOES peak flux for individual flares.
  Results. We calibrated the BKG detector aperture sizes of STIX. Further, we showed that for the larger flares a close power law fit exists between the STIX BKG and GOES peak flux with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.97. This correlation provides a GOES proxy with a one sigma uncertainty of 11%. We were able to show that the BKG detector can reliably measure a broad range of GOES flare classes from roughly B5 up to at least X85 (assuming a radial distance of 1AU), making it an interesting detector-concept for future space weather missions. The largest flare observed by STIX to date is an estimated X16.5 $\pm$ 1.8 backside flare on the 20 Mai 2024.</description>
