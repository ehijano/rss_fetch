      <title>Intrinsic Maximum Light Absorption in Laser-Field-Driven Growth of Highly Ordered Silicon Nanowire Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide direct experimental evidence for a state-selection principle in a far-from-equilibrium system. Using the laser-driven growth of silicon nanowires as a uniquely clean and quantifiable platform, we show that a long-range ordered array emerges as the system spontaneously selects the periodicity that maximizes its collective light absorption. This establishes a direct, measurable link between a maximum dissipation/absorption principle and emergent structural order. Our results thus offer a concrete test for models of non-equilibrium self-organization.</description>

      <title>Predictability of Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of complex systems has attracted widespread attention from researchers in the fields of natural sciences, social sciences, and engineering. Prediction is one of the central issues in this field. Although most related studies have focused on prediction methods, research on the predictability of complex systems has received increasing attention across disciplines--aiming to provide theories and tools to address a key question: What are the limits of prediction accuracy? Predictability itself can serve as an important feature for characterizing complex systems, and accurate estimation of predictability can provide a benchmark for the study of prediction algorithms. This allows researchers to clearly identify the gap between current prediction accuracy and theoretical limits, thereby helping them determine whether there is still significant room to improve existing algorithms. More importantly, investigating predictability often requires the development of new theories and methods, which can further inspire the design of more effective algorithms. Over the past few decades, this field has undergone significant evolution. In particular, the rapid development of data science has introduced a wealth of data-driven approaches for understanding and quantifying predictability. This review summarizes representative achievements, integrating both data-driven and mechanistic perspectives. After a brief introduction to the significance of the topic in focus, we will explore three core aspects: the predictability of time series, the predictability of network structures, and the predictability of dynamical processes. Finally, we will provide extensive application examples across various fields and outline open challenges for future research.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of additive and parametric pinning control protocols for systems of weakly coupled oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the behavior of nonlinear systems on networks is a paramount task in control theory, in particular the control of synchronization, given its vast applicability. In this work, we focus on pinning control and we examine two different approaches: the first, more common in engineering applications, where the control is implemented through an external input (additive pinning); the other, where the parameters of the pinned nodes are varied (parametric pinning). By means of the phase reduction technique, we show that the two pinning approaches are equivalent for weakly coupled systems exhibiting periodic oscillatory behaviors. Through numerical simulations, we validate the claim for a system of coupled Stuart--Landau oscillators. Our results pave the way for further applications of pinning control in real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Condorcet's Jury Theorem to Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize Condorcet's jury theorem (CJT) to socially connected populations in which agents revise discrete choices on a network in the presence of zealots. Free agents receive privately informative signals about the correct alternative and, at each update, either retain their state or imitate a uniformly chosen neighbor (free or zealot). For finite networks, we derive closed-form stationary laws for vote counts, and we characterize the corresponding vote-share limits as the number of free voters tends to infinity. For majority rule -- both in binary and multi-alternative settings -- we obtain an exact accuracy limit in closed form via the regularized incomplete beta function. For plurality rule, we establish sharp closed-form lower bounds on accuracy, expressed in terms of regularized incomplete beta functions. Under an absolute-majority condition for the correct alternative, both majority and plurality accuracies strictly exceed the accuracy of any single voter, showing that informative signals, coupled through social interaction, are amplified at the group level. These results extend CJT beyond independence and provide closed-form accuracy benchmarks for networked decision systems in social, biological, and engineered settings.</description>

      <title>Ambush strategy impacts species predominance and coexistence in rock-paper-scissors models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the adaptive Ambush strategy in cyclic models following the rules of the spatial rock-paper-scissors game. In our model, individuals of one species possess cognitive abilities to perceive environmental cues and assess the local density of the species they dominate in the spatial competition for natural resources. Based on this assessment, they either initiate a direct attack or, if the local concentration of target individuals does not justify the risk, reposition strategically to prepare an ambush. To quantify the evolutionary consequences of these behavioural strategies, we perform stochastic simulations, analysing emergent spatial patterns and the dependence of species densities on the threshold used by individuals to decide between immediate attack or anticipation. Our findings reveal that, despite being designed to enhance efficiency, cognitive strategies can reduce the abundance of the species due to the constraints of cyclic dominance. We identify an optimal decision threshold: attacking only when the local density of target individuals exceeds 15% provides the best balance between selection risk and long-term persistence. Furthermore, the Ambush strategy benefits low-mobility organisms, increasing coexistence probabilities by up to 53%. These results deepen the understanding of adaptive decision-making in spatial ecology, linking cognitive complexity to ecosystem resilience and extinction risk.</description>

      <title>Moving towards informative and actionable social media research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social media is nearly ubiquitous in modern life, raising concerns about its societal impacts-from mental health and polarization to violence and democratic disruption. Yet research on its causal effects remains inconclusive: observational studies often find concerning associations, while randomized controlled trials (RCTs) tend to yield small, conflicting, or null results. Literature summaries tend to causally prioritize findings from RCTs, often arguing that concerns about social media are overstated. However, like observational studies, RCTs rely on assumptions that can easily be violated in the context of social media, especially regarding societal outcomes at scale. Here, we enumerate and examine the features of social media as a complex system that challenge our ability to infer causality at societal scales. Drawing on insight from disciplines that have faced similar challenges, like climate-science or epidemiology, we propose a path forward that combines the strength of observational and experimental approaches while acknowledging the limitations of each.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Emergent Behaviors in Agent-Based Models using Mean Information Gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emergent behaviors are a defining feature of complex systems, yet their quantitative characterization remains an open challenge, as traditional classifications rely mainly on visual inspection of spatio-temporal patterns. In this Letter, we propose using the Mean Information Gain (MIG) as a metric to quantify emergence in Agent-Based Models. The MIG is a conditional entropy-based metric that quantifies the lack of information about other elements in a structure given certain known properties. We apply it to a multi-agent biased random walk that reproduces Wolfram's four behavioral classes and show that MIG differentiates these behaviors. This metric reconnects the analysis of emergent behaviors with the classical notions of order, disorder, and entropy, thereby enabling the quantitative classification of regimes as convergent, periodic, complex, and chaotic. This approach overcomes the ambiguity of qualitative inspection near regime boundaries, particularly in large systems, and provides a compact, extensible framework for identifying and comparing emergent behaviors in complex systems.</description>
