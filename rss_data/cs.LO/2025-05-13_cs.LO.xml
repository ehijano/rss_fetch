      <title>Varieties of Distributed Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed knowledge is one of the better known group knowledge modalities. While its intuitive idea is relatively clear, there is ample room for interpretation of details. We investigate 12 definitions of distributed knowledge that differ from each other in the kinds of information sharing the agents can perform in order to achieve shared mutual knowledge of a proposition. We then show which kinds of distributed knowledge are equivalent, and which kinds imply each other, i.e., for any two variants $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ of distributed knowledge we show whether a proposition $\phi$ being distributed knowledge under definition $\tau_1$ implies that $\phi$ is distributed knowledge under definition $\tau_2$.</description>

      <title>LPrL: An Asynchronous Linear Time Hyper Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel asynchronous hyper linear time temporal logic named LPrL (Linear Time Predicate Logic) and establish its basic theory. LPrL is a natural first order extension of LTL (Linear time temporal logic), in which the predicates specify the properties of and the relationships between traces (infinite sequences of actions) using Boolean combinations of LTL formulas. To augment the expressive power of the logic, we introduce a simple language of terms and add the equality predicate t = t' where t and t' are terms. We first illustrate how a number of the security policies as well as a basic consistency property of distributed processes can be captured using LPrL. We then establish our main results using automata theoretic techniques. Namely, the satisfiability and model checking problems for LPrL can be solved in elementary time. These results are in sharp contrast to HyperLTL, the prevalent synchronous hyper linear time logic, whose satisfiability problem is undecidable and whose model checking problem has non-elementary time complexity.</description>

      <title>First-Order Coalition Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce First-Order Coalition Logic ($\mathsf{FOCL}$), which combines key intuitions behind Coalition Logic ($\mathsf{CL}$) and Strategy Logic ($\mathsf{SL}$). Specifically, $\mathsf{FOCL}$ allows for arbitrary quantification over actions of agents. $\mathsf{FOCL}$ is interesting for several reasons. First, we show that $\mathsf{FOCL}$ is strictly more expressive than existing coalition logics. Second, we provide a sound and complete axiomatisation of $\mathsf{FOCL}$, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first axiomatisation of any variant of $\mathsf{SL}$ in the literature. Finally, while discussing the satisfiability problem for $\mathsf{FOCL}$, we reopen the question of the recursive axiomatisability of $\mathsf{SL}$.</description>

      <title>Formal P-Category Theory and Normalization by Evaluation in Rocq</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional category theory is typically based on set-theoretic principles and ideas, which are often non-constructive. An alternative approach to formalizing category theory is to use E-category theory, where hom sets become setoids. Our work reconsiders a third approach - P-category theory - from \v{C}ubri\'c et al. (1998) emphasizing a computational standpoint. We formalize in Rocq a modest library of P-category theory - where homs become subsetoids - and apply it to formalizing algorithms for normalization by evaluation which are purely categorical but, surprisingly, do not use neutral and normal terms. \v{C}ubri\'c et al. (1998) establish only a soundness correctness property by categorical means; here, we extend their work by providing a categorical proof also for a strong completeness property. For this we formalize the full universal property of the free Cartesian-closed category, which is not known to have been performed before. We further formalize a novel universal property of unquotiented simply typed lambda-calculus syntax and apply this to a proof of correctness of a categorical normalization by evaluation algorithm. We pair the overall mathematical development with a formalization in the Rocq proof assistant, following the principle that the formalization exists for practical computation. Indeed, it permits extraction of synthesized normalization programs that compute (long) beta-eta-normal forms of simply typed lambda-terms together with a derivation of beta-eta-conversion.</description>

      <title>Duality theory and representations for distributive quasi relation algebras and DInFL-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop dualities for complete perfect distributive quasi relation algebras and complete perfect distributive involutive FL-algebras. The duals are partially ordered frames with additional structure. These frames are analogous to the atom structures used to study relation algebras. We also extend the duality from complete perfect algebras to all algebras, using so-called doubly-pointed frames with a Priestley topology.
  We then turn to the representability of these algebras as lattices of binary relations. Some algebras can be realised as term subreducts of representable relation algebras and are hence representable. We provide a detailed account of known representations for all algebras up to size six.</description>

Abstract: This paper gives a translation from the $\mu$-fragment of the graded modal $\mu$-calculus to a class of distributed message-passing automata. As a corollary, we obtain an alternative proof for a theorem from \cite{ahvonen_neurips} stating that recurrent graph neural networks working with reals and graded modal substitution calculus have the same expressive power in restriction to the logic monadic second-order logic MSO.</description>

      <title>BedreFlyt: Improving Patient Flows through Hospital Wards with Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital twins are emerging as a valuable tool for short-term decision-making as well as for long-term strategic planning across numerous domains, including process industry, energy, space, transport, and healthcare. This paper reports on our ongoing work on designing a digital twin to enhance resource planning, e.g., for the in-patient ward needs in hospitals. By leveraging executable formal models for system exploration, ontologies for knowledge representation and an SMT solver for constraint satisfiability, our approach aims to explore hypothetical "what-if" scenarios to improve strategic planning processes, as well as to solve concrete, short-term decision-making tasks. Our proposed solution uses the executable formal model to turn a stream of arriving patients, that need to be hospitalized, into a stream of optimization problems, e.g., capturing daily inpatient ward needs, that can be solved by SMT techniques. The knowledge base, which formalizes domain knowledge, is used to model the needed configuration in the digital twin, allowing the twin to support both short-term decision-making and long-term strategic planning by generating scenarios spanning average-case as well as worst-case resource needs, depending on the expected treatment of patients, as well as ranging over variations in available resources, e.g., bed distribution in different rooms. We illustrate our digital twin architecture by considering the problem of bed bay allocation in a hospital ward.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Pure Strategy Relevant Equilibria in Concurrent Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study rational synthesis problems for concurrent games with $\omega$-regular objectives. Our model of rationality considers only pure strategy Nash equilibria that satisfy either a social welfare or Pareto optimality condition with respect to an $\omega$-regular objective for each agent. This extends earlier work on equilibria in concurrent games, without consideration about their quality. Our results show that the existence of Nash equilibria satisfying social welfare conditions can be computed as efficiently as the constrained Nash equilibrium existence problem. On the other hand, the existence of Nash equilibria satisfying the Pareto optimality condition possibly involves a higher upper bound, except in the case of B\"uchi and Muller games, for which all three problems are in the classes P and PSPACE-complete, respectively.</description>

Abstract: In order to get $\lambda$-models with a rich structure of $\infty$-groupoid, which we call "homotopy $\lambda$-models", a general technique is described for solving domain equations on any cartesian closed $\infty$-category (c.c.i.) with enough points. Finally, the technique is applied in a particular c.c.i., where some examples of homotopy $\lambda$-models are given.</description>

      <title>Positive Hennessy-Milner Logic for Branching Bisimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.07380v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Labelled transitions systems can be studied in terms of modal logic and in terms of bisimulation. These two notions are connected by Hennessy-Milner theorems, that show that two states are bisimilar precisely when they satisfy the same modal logic formulas. Recently, apartness has been studied as a dual to bisimulation, which also gives rise to a dual version of the Hennessy-Milner theorem: two states are apart precisely when there is a modal formula that distinguishes them.
  In this paper, we introduce "directed" versions of Hennessy-Milner theorems that characterize when the theory of one state is included in the other. For this we introduce "positive modal logics" that only allow a limited use of negation. Furthermore, we introduce directed notions of bisimulation and apartness, and then show that, for this positive modal logic, the theory of $s$ is included in the theory of $t$ precisely when $s$ is directed bisimilar to $t$. Or, in terms of apartness, we show that $s$ is directed apart from $t$ precisely when the theory of $s$ is not included in the theory of $t$. From the directed version of the Hennessy-Milner theorem, the original result follows.
  In particular, we study the case of branching bisimulation and Hennessy-Milner Logic with Until (HMLU) as a modal logic. We introduce "directed branching bisimulation" (and directed branching apartness) and "Positive Hennessy-Milner Logic with Until" (PHMLU) and we show the directed version of the Hennessy-Milner theorems. In the process, we show that every HMLU formula is equivalent to a Boolean combination of Positive HMLU formulas, which is a very non-trivial result. This gives rise to a sublogic of HMLU that is equally expressive but easier to reason about.</description>

      <title>A Monoidal View on Fixpoint Checks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02957v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fixpoints are ubiquitous in computer science as they play a central role in providing a meaning to recursive and cyclic definitions. Bisimilarity, behavioural metrics, termination probabilities for Markov chains and stochastic games are defined in terms of least or greatest fixpoints. Here we show that our recent work which proposes a technique for checking whether the fixpoint of a function is the least (or the largest) admits a natural categorical interpretation in terms of gs-monoidal categories. The technique is based on a construction that maps a function to a suitable approximation. We study the compositionality properties of this mapping and show that under some restrictions it can naturally be interpreted as a (lax) gs-monoidal functor. This guides the development of a tool, called UDEfix that allows us to build functions (and their approximations) like a circuit out of basic building blocks and subsequently perform the fixpoints checks. We also show that a slight generalisation of the theory allows one to treat a new relevant case study: coalgebraic behavioural metrics based on Wasserstein liftings.</description>

      <title>A Logic for Paraconsistent Belief Revision based on Epistemic Entrenchment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the integration of epistemic entrenchment into paraconsistent belief revision systems based on Logics of Formal Inconsistency (LFIs). While systems like AGMp and AGMo adapt AGM principles to paraconsistency, they lack mechanisms to rank beliefs, primarily due to the absence of properties such as the replacement property in the underlying logics. We introduce two novel logics, Cbr and RCBr, with the latter extending the former to fully address these limitations given that it is self-extensional. Using RCBr, we define contraction operations via epistemic entrenchment, adhering to key rationality principles. Our framework leverages non-deterministic matrix semantics (Nmatrices) and Boolean algebras with LFI operators (BALFIs), providing a robust foundation for paraconsistent reasoning. These contributions advance the theory of paraconsistent belief revision and pave the way for applications in domains such as multi-agent systems and inconsistent knowledge bases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Program synthesis is the task of automatically constructing a program conforming to a given specification. In this paper we focus on synthesis of single-invocation recursion-free functions conforming to a specification given as a logical formula in the presence of uncomputable symbols (i.e., symbols used in the specification but not allowed in the resulting function). We approach the problem via SMT-solving methods: we present a quantifier elimination algorithm using model-based projections for both total and partial function synthesis, working with theories of uninterpreted functions and linear arithmetic and their combination. For this purpose we also extend model-based projection to produce witnesses for these theories. Further, we present procedures tailored for the case of uniquely determined solutions. We implemented a prototype of the algorithms using the SMT-solver Z3, demonstrating their practical efficiency compared to the state of the art.</description>

Abstract: Neural theorem proving combines large language models (LLMs) with proof assistants such as Lean, where the correctness of formal proofs can be rigorously verified, leaving no room for hallucination. With existing neural theorem provers pretrained on a fixed collection of data and offering valuable suggestions at times, it is challenging for them to continually prove novel theorems in a fully autonomous mode, where human insights may be critical. In this paper, we explore LLMs as copilots that assist humans in proving theorems. We introduce Lean Copilot, a general framework for running LLM inference natively in Lean. It enables programmers to build various LLM-based proof automation tools that integrate seamlessly into the workflow of Lean users. Lean users can use our pretrained models or bring their own ones that run either locally (with or without GPUs) or on the cloud. Using Lean Copilot, we build LLM-based tools that suggest proof steps, complete proof goals, and select relevant premises. Experimental results on the Mathematics in Lean textbook demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to existing rule-based proof automation in Lean (aesop). When assisting humans, Lean Copilot requires only 2.08 manually-entered proof steps on average (3.86 required by aesop); when automating the theorem proving process, Lean Copilot automates 74.2% proof steps on average, 85% better than aesop (40.1%). We open source all code and artifacts under a permissive MIT license to facilitate further research.</description>

      <title>String Diagrams for Graded Monoidal Theories with an Application to Imprecise Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18404</link>

Abstract: We introduce string diagrams for graded symmetric monoidal categories. Our approach includes a definition of graded monoidal theory and the corresponding freely generated syntactic category. Also, we show how an axiomatic presentation for the graded theory may be modularly obtained from one for the grading theory and one for the base category. The Para construction on monoidal actegories is a motivating example for our framework. As a case study, we show how to axiomatise a variant of the graded category ImP, recently introduced by Liell-Cock and Staton to model imprecise probability. This culminates in a representation, as string diagrams with grading wires, of programs with primitives for nondeterministic and probabilistic choices and conditioning.</description>

      <title>Logical Modalities within the European AI Act: An Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the European AI Act in terms of its logical modalities, with the aim of preparing its formal representation, for example, within the logic-pluralistic Knowledge Engineering Framework and Methodology (LogiKEy). LogiKEy develops computational tools for normative reasoning based on formal methods, employing Higher-Order Logic (HOL) as a unifying meta-logic to integrate diverse logics through shallow semantic embeddings. This integration is facilitated by Isabelle/HOL, a proof assistant tool equipped with several automated theorem provers. The modalities within the AI Act and the logics suitable for their representation are discussed. For a selection of these logics, embeddings in HOL are created, which are then used to encode sample paragraphs. Initial experiments evaluate the suitability of these embeddings for automated reasoning, and highlight key challenges on the way to more robust reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>APOLLO: Automated LLM and Lean Collaboration for Advanced Formal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Formal reasoning and automated theorem proving constitute a challenging subfield of machine learning, in which machines are tasked with proving mathematical theorems using formal languages like Lean. A formal verification system can check whether a formal proof is correct or not almost instantaneously, but generating a completely correct formal proof with large language models (LLMs) remains a formidable task. The usual approach in the literature is to prompt the LLM many times (up to several thousands) until one of the generated proofs passes the verification system. In this work, we present APOLLO (Automated PrOof repair via LLM and Lean cOllaboration), a modular, model-agnostic pipeline that combines the strengths of the Lean compiler with an LLM's reasoning abilities to achieve better proof-generation results at a low sampling budget. Apollo directs a fully automated process in which the LLM generates proofs for theorems, a set of agents analyze the proofs, fix the syntax errors, identify the mistakes in the proofs using Lean, isolate failing sub-lemmas, utilize automated solvers, and invoke an LLM on each remaining goal with a low top-K budget. The repaired sub-proofs are recombined and reverified, iterating up to a user-controlled maximum number of attempts. On the miniF2F benchmark, we establish a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 75.0% among 7B-parameter models while keeping the sampling budget below one thousand. Moreover, Apollo raises the state-of-the-art accuracy for Goedel-Prover-SFT to 65.6% while cutting sample complexity from 25,600 to a few hundred. General-purpose models (o3-mini, o4-mini) jump from 3-7% to over 40% accuracy. Our results demonstrate that targeted, compiler-guided repair of LLM outputs yields dramatic gains in both efficiency and correctness, suggesting a general paradigm for scalable automated theorem proving.</description>
