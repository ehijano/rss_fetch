      <title>Status and prospects of Muon g-2 experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article reviews the muon g-2 experiment, a cornerstone in precision tests of the Standard Model of particle physics. The experiment measures the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon with unprecedented accuracy, seeking potential discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental results that might indicate physics beyond the Standard Model. We trace the evolution of this measurement from its beginnings at CERN in the 1960s to the current state-of-the-art experiment at Fermilab, highlighting the remarkable engineering achievements required to achieve parts-per-billion precision. Recent results from Runs 1-3 have achieved a systematic uncertainty of 70 ppb, exceeding design goals, while ongoing theoretical calculations continue to refine predictions. Despite these advances, the analysis remains statistics-limited, with continued data collection and novel experimental approaches at MUonE and J-PARC promising further insights into this fundamental physical quantity.</description>

      <title>Search for Charmonium(-like) states decaying into the $\Omega^-\bar\Omega^+$ final states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the BESIII experiment performed a measurement of the energy-dependent Born cross section and the effective form factor for the $e^+e^-\to\Omega^-\bar\Omega^+$ reaction at center-of-mass energies ranging from 3.4 to 4.7 GeV. A fit to the energy dependence of the dressed cross section is performed. With the assumption of a charmonium (like) resonance [i.e., $\psi(3770)$, $\psi(4040)$, $\psi(4160)$, $Y(4230)$, $Y(4360)$, $\psi(4415)$, or $Y(4660)$] plus a power-law function, the fit is applied to the data from the recent BESIII measurement, which was additionally combined with previous CLEO-c measurement data. No significance is found. The products of the branching fraction and the two electronic partial widths for the assumed charmonium(-like) states decaying into the $\Omega^-\bar\Omega^+$ final states are also provided. In addition, by taking the world average values of the electronic branching fraction, the branching fractions for $\psi(3770)$, $\psi(4040)$, $\psi(4160)$, $\psi(4415)$ decaying into $\Omega^-\bar\Omega^+$ final states at the 90\% confidence level are determined for the first time. These are found to be at least an order of magnitude larger than expected from predictions using a scaling based on the observed electronic widths.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Materials for Light Dark Matter Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the use of several unconventional materials as detectors for dark matter with mass beneath the MeV scale. These include the transition-metal dichalcogenide TiSe$_2$ hosting a low-energy plasmon in the charge-density-wave phase, Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ containing a low-energy acoustic demon mode, and hole-doped diamond with tunable optical and acoustic plasmon frequencies. We perform first-principles density functional theory computations of their loss functions at non-vanishing momenta and establish their reach into light dark matter parameter space. We show that due to intense low-energy plasmon modes -- of different microscopic origin in each -- the reach of detectors based on these materials could surpass existing proposals by several orders of magnitude for both dark matter scattering and absorption on electrons. The anisotropic response of these materials, which enables directional detection, renders them exceptionally strong detector candidates, motivating the design and fabrication of future devices.</description>

      <title>Searches for new light particles at the Troitsk Meson Factory (TiMoFey)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The project of a new accelerator complex at the Institute for Nuclear Research of RAS in Troitsk has recently been included in the Russian National Program ``Fundamental Properties of Matter". It will sustain a proton beam with a current of 300 (100) $\mu$A and a proton kinetic energy of $T_p=423\,(1300)$ MeV at the first (second) stage of operation. The complex is multidisciplinary, and here we investigate its prospects in exploring new physics with light, feebly interacting particles. We find that TiMoFey can access new regions of parameter space of models with light axion-like particles and models with hidden photons, provided by a generic multipurpose detector installed downstream the proton beam dump. The signature to be exploited is the decay of a new particle into a pair of known particles inside the detector. Likewise, TiMoFey can probe previously unreachable ranges of parameters of models with millicharged particles obtained in measurements with detectors recognizing energy deposits associated with elastic scattering of new particles, passing through the detector volume. The latter detector may be useful for dark matter searches, as well as for studies of neutrino physics suggested at the facility in the Program framework.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Astrophysical $\bar{\nu}:\nu$ Ratio with IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements of astrophysical neutrinos have expanded our understanding of their nature and origin. However, very little is still known about the astrophysical $\bar{\nu}:\nu$
  ratio. The only prior measurement is the recent, single Glashow event seen by IceCube. Understanding the astrophysical $\bar{\nu}:\nu$
  ratio has a bearing on multiple questions, including the astrophysical spectral shape and neutrino production mechanisms. This analysis uses a new approach to measuring the astrophysical muon $\bar{\nu}:\nu$ ratio at various energies. It uses inelasticity, the fraction of the initial neutrino energy carried away by the hadronic shower. Inelasticity probes the $\bar{\nu}:\nu$
  ratio due to the fact that at energies below roughly 100 TeV, valence quarks dominate in deep inelastic scattering interactions, leading to different neutrino and antineutrino inelasticities and cross-sections. We use 10.3 years of IceCube data consisting of starting tracks at energies between 1 TeV and 1 PeV with a self-veto selection that enhances astrophysical event purity in the down-going direction. Based on this sample and analysis method, we present the first measurement of the astrophysical $\bar{\nu}:\nu$
  ratio at sub-PeV energies.</description>

      <title>AION-10: Technical Design Report for a 10m Atom Interferometer in Oxford</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This Technical Design Report presents AION-10, a 10-meter atom interferometer to be located at Oxford University using ultracold strontium atoms to make precision measurements of fundamental physics. AION-10 serves as both a prototype for future larger-scale experiments and a versatile scientific instrument capable of conducting its own diverse physics programme.
  The design features a 10-meter vertical tower housing two atom interferometer sources in an ultra-high vacuum environment. Key engineering challenges include achieving nanometer-level vibrational stability and precise magnetic field control. Solutions include active vibration isolation, specialized magnetic shielding, and a modular assembly approach using professional lifting equipment.
  Detailed analysis confirms the design meets all performance requirements, with critical optical components remaining within our specifications 97% of the time under realistic operating conditions. Vacuum and vibration measurements in the host building validate that the instrument will achieve the precision needed for quantum sensing applications.
  This work establishes the technical foundation for scaling atom interferometry to longer baselines while creating a cutting-edge facility for precision measurements that could advance our understanding of fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>The High Level Trigger and Express Data Production at STAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) has developed and deployed a high-performance High Level Trigger (HLT) and Express Data Production system to enable real-time event processing during the Beam Energy Scan phase-II (BES-II) program. Designed to meet the demands of high event rates and complex final states, the HLT performs online tracking, event reconstruction, and physics object selection using parallelized algorithms including the Cellular Automaton Track Finder and the KF Particle Finder, optimized for identifying both long- and short-lived particles.
  Tightly integrated with the STAR data acquisition (DAQ) and detector control systems, the HLT employs a dedicated computing cluster to perform near real-time calibration, vertexing, and event filtering. The Express Data Production pipeline runs concurrently, enabling fast reconstruction and immediate physics analysis. This architecture allows for real-time monitoring of data quality, detector performance, and beam conditions, supporting dynamic feedback during operations.
  This framework has been instrumental in enabling prompt identification of rare signals such as hyperons and hypernuclei. Notably, it enabled the first real-time reconstruction of ${}^5_{\Lambda}\mathrm{He}$ hypernuclei with high statistical significance, as well as efficient processing of hundreds of millions of heavy-ion collision events during BES-II.
  The successful operation of this real-time system demonstrates its effectiveness in handling high data volumes while maintaining stringent physics quality standards. It establishes a scalable and modular model for future high-luminosity experiments requiring integrated online tracking, event selection, and rapid offline-quality reconstruction within hours of data taking.</description>

      <title>Global Extraction of the $\rm^{12}C$ Nuclear Electromagnetic Response Functions (${\cal R}_L$ and ${\cal R}_T$) and Comparisons to Nuclear Theory and Neutrino/Electron Monte Carlo Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have performed a global extraction of the ${\rm ^{12}C}$ longitudinal (${\cal R}_L$) and transverse (${\cal R}_T$) nuclear electromagnetic response functions from an analysis of all available electron scattering data on carbon. The response functions are extracted for energy transfer $\nu$, spanning the nuclear excitation, quasielastic (QE), resonance and inelastic continuum over a large range of the square of the four-momentum transfer, $Q^2.$ In addition, we perform a universal fit to all ${\rm ^{12}C}$ electron scattering data which also provides parmeterizations of ${\cal R}_L$ and ${\cal R}_T$ over a larger kinematic range. Given the nuclear physics common to both electron and neutrino scattering from nuclei, extracted response functions from electron scattering spanning a large range of $Q^2$ and $\nu$ also provide a powerful tool for validation and tuning of neutrino Monte Carlo (MC) generators. In this paper we focus on the nuclear excitation, single nucleon (QE-1p1h) and two nucleon (2p2h) final state regions and compare the measurements to theoretical predictions including ``Energy Dependent-Relativistic Mean Field'' (ED-RMF), ``Green's Function Monte Carlo'' (GFMC), "Short Time Approximation Quantum Monte Carlo" (STA-QMC), an improved superscaling model (SuSAv2), "Correlated Fermi Gas" (CFG), as well as the \nuwro{}, and \achilles~ generators. Combining the ED-RMF-QE-1p1h predictions with the SuSAv2-MEC-2p2h predictions provides a good description of ${\cal R}_L$ and ${\cal R}_T$ for both single nucleon (from QE and nuclear excitations) and two nucleon final states over the entire kinematic range.</description>

      <title>Antihelium-3 Sensitivity for the GRAMS Experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gamma-Ray and AntiMatter Survey (GRAMS) is a next-generation balloon/satellite mission utilizing a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) detector to measure both MeV gamma rays and antinuclei produced by dark matter annihilation or decay. The GRAMS can identify antihelium-3 events based on the measurements of X-rays and charged pions from the decay of the exotic atoms, Time of Flight (TOF), energy deposition, and stopping range. This paper shows the antihelium-3 sensitivity estimation using a GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulation. For the proposed long-duration balloon (LDB) flight program (35 days $ \times $ 3 flights) and future satellite mission (2-year observation / 10-year observation), the sensitivities become 1.47 $\times$ 10$^{-7}$ [m$^2$ s sr GeV/n]$^{-1}$ and 1.55 $\times$ 10$^{-9}$ [m$^2$ s sr GeV/n]$^{-1}$ / $3.10\times10^{-10}$ [m$^2$ s sr GeV/n]$^{-1}$, respectively. The results indicate that GRAMS can extensively investigate various dark matter models through the antihelium-3 measurements.</description>

      <title>On Measuring Stimulated Photon-photon Scattering using Multiple Ultraintense Lasers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stimulated photon-photon scattering is a predicted consequence of quantum electrodynamics that has yet to be measured directly. Measuring the cross-section for stimulated photon-photon scattering is the aim of a flagship experiment for NSF OPAL, a proposed laser user facility with two, 25-PW beamlines. We present optimized experimental designs for achieving this challenging and canonical measurement. A family of experimental geometries is identified that satisfies the momentum- and energy-matching conditions for two selected laser frequency options. Numerical models predict a maximum signal exceeding 1000 scattered photons per shot at the experimental conditions envisaged at NSF OPAL. Experimental requirements on collision geometry, polarization, cotiming and copointing, background suppression, and diagnostic technologies are investigated numerically. These results confirm that a beam cotiming shorter than the pulse duration and control of the copointing on a scale smaller than the shortest laser wavelength are needed to robustly scatter photons on a per-shot basis. Finally, we assess the bounds that a successful execution of this experiment may place on the mass scale of Born-Infeld nonlinear electrodynamics beyond the Standard Model of physics.</description>

      <title>Leveraging intermediate resonances to probe CP violation at colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the phenomenological impact of interference in tree-level contributions to three-body final states in $2\to 3$ scattering processes. This work introduces a novel search strategy leveraging asymmetries to enable sensitivity to CP-violating effects in less well-explored regions of phase space. Analytically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this observable in probing interference between Standard Model charged-current decays and effective left-handed vector interactions, illustrated in a toy model featuring a scalar leptoquark, $S_1 \sim (3, 1, -1/3)$. Numerically, we apply this framework to studying the process $pp\to b \tau\nu$; unlike traditional high-$p_T$ searches or ``bump hunts", this approach utilizes an intermediate energy regime -- where new physics is neither light enough to be produced on shell or heavy enough to justify an effective field theory treatment. A proof-of-principle analysis at parton level demonstrates a percent-level asymmetry, with sensitivity also to BSM weak-CP phase. While the specific phase sensitivity is diminished at particle level due to showering and detector effects, a machine learning classifier can recover sensitively to the presence of SM-BSM interference, significantly outperforming standard analysis methods. Notably discrimination between BSM signal and SM background could be achieved at the 2$\sigma$ level for the current LHC dataset and 8$\sigma$ at the High-Luminosity LHC. Moreover, this asymmetry observable as defined can also be more broadly applied to other searches for CP-violation in $2\to 3$ processes in present and future collider environments.</description>

Abstract: Recent measurements by various experiments in ultra-peripheral collisions have observed spin-interference in $\rho^{0}$ photoproduction, marking a breakthrough in Fermi-scale quantum interference experiments. Building on this, STAR extended the measurement to hadronic heavy-ion collisions, where significant rescattering effects on $\rho^{0}$ mesons were expected. In this study, we investigate how these rescattering effects influence the measurement of spin-interference. By embedding $\rho^{0}$ mesons produced via photoproduction, modeled by the Vector Meson Dominance model, into the Ultrarelativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics framework, we estimate the impact on the $\cos2\phi$ and $\cos4\phi$ modulations, where $\phi$ is the angle between $\rho^{0}$ and one of the daughters' ($\pi^{\pm}$) transverse momentum. The results indicate a significant suppression of the $\cos2\phi$ modulation, while the $\cos4\phi$ modulation remains largely unaffected, which provides insight for understanding the difference due to rescattering effects between experimental measurements and theoretical predictions for $\rho^{0}$ photoproduction in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>About testing Bell locality at colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18535</link>

Abstract: Colliders enable the testing of quantum mechanics at its most fundamental level, and in the presence of both strong and electroweak interactions. Particle physics naturally provides examples of systems that consist not only of qubits but also qutrits. Quantum tomography at colliders makes possible the measurement of entanglement and the testing of Bell locality. We provide a comprehensive explanation of how this is achieved and why it offers a novel perspective on the loopholes exploited by local hidden variable models to evade Bell tests.</description>

      <title>Transverse-momentum-dependent pion structures from lattice QCD: Collins-Soper kernel, soft factor, TMDWF, and TMDPDF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04625v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculation of the pion valence-quark transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF) within the framework of large-momentum effective theory (LaMET). Using correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge (CG), we computed the quasi-TMD beam function for a pion with a mass of 300 MeV, a fine lattice spacing of $a = 0.06$ fm and multiple large momenta up to 3 GeV. The intrinsic soft functions in the CG approach are extracted from form factors with large momentum transfer, and as a byproduct, we also obtain the corresponding Collins-Soper (CS) kernel. Our determinations of both the soft function and the CS kernel agree with perturbation theory at small transverse separations ($b_\perp$) between the quarks. At larger $b_\perp$, the CS kernel remains consistent with recent results obtained using both CG and gauge-invariant TMD correlators in the literature. By combining next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) factorization of the quasi-TMD beam function and the soft function, we obtain $x$-dependent pion valence-quark TMDPDF for transverse separations $b_\perp \gtrsim 1$ fm. Interestingly, we find that the $b_\perp$ dependence of the phenomenological parameterizations of TMDPDF for moderate values of $x$ are in reasonable agreement with our QCD determinations. In addition, we present results for the transverse-momentum-dependent wave function (TMDWF) for a heavier pion with 670 MeV mass.</description>

      <title>Bounds and detection of MeV-scale dark matter annihilation to neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current and most upcoming neutrino detectors can only reach a dark matter annihilation cross section to neutrinos larger than the standard freeze-out value, but they open intriguing detection avenues for non-standard dark matter paradigms. An important corollary of these non-standard scenarios is relic dark matter annihilation after neutrino decoupling, which was previously overlooked in constraining MeV-scale dark matter. However, by combining the contributions from entropy injection during neutrino decoupling and from nonthermal neutrino energy release after decoupling, we derive significant constraints on the annihilation cross section to neutrinos, which in some mass regimes become stronger than the current bounds. Furthermore, we find that the lower bounds on dark matter masses become inconclusive under the recent data releases from the DESI, SPT-3G, and ACT collaborations. These bounds determine the extent to which upcoming neutrino detectors will probe dark matter annihilation into neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Understanding the low-lying $\Omega_c$ structures from a coupled-channel perspective</title>

Abstract: We perform a systematic analysis of the low-lying $\Omega_c$ structures in a coupled-channel approach. The couplings between meson-baryon channels, $\Xi_c \bar K$, $\Xi_c^{\prime} \bar K$, $\Xi_c^{*} \bar K$, $\Omega_c\eta$ and $\Omega_c^{*}\eta$, and three-quark bare states $\Omega_c(1P_\lambda)$ are considered. We predict a bound state $\Omega_c(2954)$ below the $\Xi_c \bar K$ threshold with $(J^P,j)=(1/2^-,0)$, which can be studied in the final states of $\Omega_c^{(*)} \pi$ and $\Omega_c^{(*)} \gamma$. Also, the resonances $\Omega_c(3000)$ and $\Omega_c(3050)$ can be classified as the lower $(J^P,j)=(1/2^-,1)$ and $(J^P,j)=(3/2^-,1)$ states, respectively. Our present assignments based on this coupled-channel perspective are significantly different from those of traditional three-quark picture and of molecular scenario. The future BelleII and LHCb experiments can search for the bound state $\Omega_c(2954)$ and measure the spin-parities of particles $\Omega_c(3000)$ and $\Omega_c(3050)$ to test our predictions.</description>

      <title>Quantifying EFT Uncertainties in LHC Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective Field Theory (EFT) is a general framework to parametrize the low-energy approximation to a UV model that is widely used in model-independent searches for new physics. The use of EFTs at the LHC can suffer from a 'validity' issue, since new physics amplitudes often grow with energy and the kinematic regions with the most sensitivity to new physics have the largest theoretical uncertainties. We propose a method to account for these uncertainties with the aim of producing robust model-independent results with a well-defined statistical interpretation. In this approach, one must specify the new operators being studied as well as the new physics cutoff $M$, the energy scale where the EFT approximation breaks down. At energies below $M$, the EFT uncertainties are accounted for by adding additional higher dimensional operators with coefficients that are treated as nuisance parameters. The size of the nuisances are governed by a prior likelihood function that incorporates information about dimensional analysis, naturalness, and the scale $M$. At energies above $M$, our method incorporates the lack of predictivity of the EFT, and we show that this is crucial to obtain consistent results. We perform a number of tests of this method in a simple toy model, illustrating its performance in analyses aimed at new physics exclusion as well as for discovery. The method is conveniently implemented by the technique of event reweighting and is easily ported to realistic LHC analyses. We find that the procedure converges quickly with the number of nuisance parameters and is conservative when compared to UV models. The paper gives a precise meaning and offers a principled and practical solution to the widely debated 'EFT validity issue'.</description>

      <title>Quantum Aspects of Natural Top Quark Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In top quark condensation the Brout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) boson is a $\bar{t}t$ bound state. With a UV completion of a single coloron exchange interaction, a recent semiclassical treatment gave a novel theory of the BEH boson as an extended object with composite scale $M_0\sim 6$ TeV. Presently we obtain the semiclassical theory as an effective action, using the source/Legendre transformation techniques of Jackiw, \etal, and fermion loop effects in the large-$N_c$ limit by deploying an auxiliary field to implement the sum of leading fermion loop diagrams. The theory remains natural at the loop level, with fine tuning at the level of a few \%, and the effective coupling of the 4-fermion interaction, $\bar{g}_0^2$, is significantly enhanced by quantum loops over the fundamental coloron coupling, $g_0^2$. Hence a relatively weaker ``topcolor'' theory can produce critical coupling in the effective BEH bound state theory.</description>

      <title>Branching ratios and CP asymmetries of $B^0 \to \eta_c f_0$ in the improved perturbative QCD formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the idea of fragmented scalar glueball, we investigate the decays $B^0 \to \eta_c f_0$ within the improved perturbative QCD (iPQCD) framework by including the known next-to-leading order corrections. Here, $B^0$ and $f_0$ denote the neutral $B_{d,s}^0$ mesons and the light scalar mesons $f_0(500, 980, 1370, 1500)$ under the $q\bar q$ assignment. The CP-averaged branching ratios (BRs) and the CP asymmetries of $B^0 \to \eta_c f_0$ are evaluated with the $f_0(500)[f_0(1370)]-f_0(980)[f_0(1500)]$ mixing in quark-flavor basis. For effective comparisons with the near-future measurements, we further derive the $B^0 \to \eta_c f_0 (\to \pi^+ \pi^-/K^+ K^-)$ BRs under the narrow-width approximation. ${\rm BR}(B_s^0 \to \eta_c f_0(980) (\to \pi^+ \pi^-))= (2.87^{+1.38}_{-1.29}) \times 10^{-4}$ and ${\rm BR}(B_d^0 \to \eta_c f_0(500)(\to \pi^+\pi^-))/{\rm BR}(B_s^0 \to \eta_c f_0(980)(\to \pi^+\pi^-)) = (12^{+8}_{-7})\%$ obtained in the iPQCD formalism agree with the available measurements and/or predictions within uncertainties. Large BRs of $B_s^0 \to \eta_c f_0(1500) (\to \pi^+ \pi^-/K^+ K^-)$ and large direct CP asymmetries of $B^0 \to \eta_c f_0(1370, 1500)$ are accessible in the LHCb and Belle-II experiments. The experimental tests of these iPQCD predictions would help us to understand the nature of these light scalars more deeply and provide evidences to decipher $f_0(1500)$ as a primary or fragmented scalar glueball potentially.</description>
