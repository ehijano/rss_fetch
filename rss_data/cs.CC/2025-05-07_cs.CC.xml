      <title>Proof Complexity and Feasible Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a survey on propositional proof complexity aimed at introducing the basics of the field with a particular focus on a method known as feasible interpolation. This method is used to construct "hard theorems" for several proof systems for both classical and non-classical logics. Here, a "hard theorem" refers to a theorem in the logic whose shortest proofs are super-polynomially long in the length of the theorem itself. To make this survey more accessible, we only assume a basic familiarity with propositional, modal, and first-order logic, as well as a basic understanding of the key concepts in computational complexity, such as the definitions of the classes $\mathbf{NP}$ and $\mathbf{PSPACE}$. Any additional concepts will be introduced and explained as needed.</description>

      <title>Delta-modular ILP Problems of Bounded Codimension, Discrepancy, and Convolution (new version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17001v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For integers $k,n \geq 0$ and a cost vector $c \in Z^n$, we study two fundamental integer linear programming (ILP) problems: \[
  \text{(Standard Form)} \quad \max\bigl\{c^\top x \colon Ax = b,\ x \in Z^n_{\geq 0}\bigr\} \text{ with } A \in Z^{k \times n}, \text{rank}(A) = k, b \in Z^k, \] \[
  \text{(Canonical Form)} \quad \max\bigl\{c^\top x \colon Ax \leq b,\ x \in Z^n\bigr\} \text{ with } A \in Z^{(n+k) \times n}, \text{rank}(A) = n, b \in Z^{n+k}. \] We present improved algorithms for both problems and their feasibility versions, parameterized by $k$ and $\Delta$, where $\Delta$ denotes the maximum absolute value of $\text{rank}(A) \times \text{rank}(A)$ subdeterminants of $A$. Our main complexity results, stated in terms of required arithmetic operations, are: \[ \text{Optimization:}\quad O(\log k)^{2k} \cdot \Delta^2 / 2^{\Omega(\sqrt{\log \Delta})} + 2^{O(k)} \cdot \text{poly}(\varphi), \] \[ \text{Feasibility:} \quad O(\log k)^k \cdot \Delta \cdot (\log \Delta)^3 + 2^{O(k)} \cdot \text{poly}(\varphi), \] where $\varphi$ represents the input size measured by the bit-encoding length of $(A,b,c)$. We also examine several special cases when $k \in \{0,1\}$, which have important applications in: expected computational complexity of ILP with varying right-hand side $b$, ILP problems with generic constraint matrices, ILP problems on simplices. Our results yield improved complexity bounds for these specific scenarios.
  As independent contributions, we present: An $n^2/2^{\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})}$-time algorithm for the tropical convolution problem on sequences indexed by elements of a finite Abelian group of order $n$; A complete and self-contained error analysis of the generalized DFT over Abelian groups in the Word-RAM model.</description>

      <title>Constant-Cost Communication is not Reducible to k-Hamming Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every known communication problem whose randomized communication cost is constant (independent of the input size) can be reduced to $k$-Hamming Distance, that is, solved with a constant number of deterministic queries to some $k$-Hamming Distance oracle. We exhibit the first examples of constant-cost problems which cannot be reduced to $k$-Hamming Distance.
  To prove this separation, we relate it to a natural coding-theoretic question. For $f : \{2, 4, 6\} \to \mathbb{N}$, we say an encoding function $E : \{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}^m$ is an $f$-code if it transforms Hamming distances according to $\mathrm{dist}(E(x), E(y)) = f(\mathrm{dist}(x, y))$ whenever $f$ is defined. We prove that, if there exist $f$-codes for infinitely many $n$, then $f$ must be affine: $f(4) = (f(2) + f(6))/2$.</description>

      <title>Time hierarchies for sublogarithmic-space quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new results on the landscape of problems that can be solved by quantum Turing machines (QTM's) employing severely limited amounts of memory. In this context, we demonstrate two infinite time hierarchies of complexity classes within the ``small space'' regime: For all $i\geq 0$, there is a language that can be recognized by a constant-space machine in $2^{O(n^{1/2^i})}$ time, but not by any sublogarithmic-space QTM in $2^{O(n^{1/2^{i+1}})}$ time. For quantum machines operating within $o(\log \log n)$ space, there exists another hierarchy, each level of which corresponds to an expected runtime of $2^{O((\log n)^i)}$ for a different positive integer $i$. We also improve a quantum advantage result, demonstrating a language that can be recognized by a polynomial-time constant-space QTM, but not by any classical machine using $o(\log \log n)$ space, regardless of the time budget. The implications of our findings for quantum space-time tradeoffs are discussed.</description>

      <title>Trinomials and Deterministic Complexity Limits for Real Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.06115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We detail an algorithm that -- for all but a $\frac{1}{\Omega(\log(dH))}$ fraction of $f\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ with exactly $3$ monomial terms, degree $d$, and all coefficients in $\{-H,\ldots, H\}$ -- produces an approximate root (in the sense of Smale) for each real root of $f$ in deterministic time $\log^{4+o(1)}(dH)$ in the classical Turing model. (Each approximate root is a rational with logarithmic height $O(\log(dH))$.) The best previous deterministic bit complexity bounds were exponential in $\log d$. We then relate this to Koiran's Trinomial Sign Problem (2017): Decide the sign of a degree $d$ trinomial $f\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ with coefficients in $\{-H,\ldots,H\}$, at a point $r\!\in\!\mathbb{Q}$ of logarithmic height $\log H$, in (deterministic) time $\log^{O(1)}(dH)$. We show that Koiran's Trinomial Sign Problem admits a positive solution, at least for a fraction $1-\frac{1}{\Omega(\log(dH))}$ of the inputs $(f,r)$.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuit lower bounds in the magic hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the magic hierarchy, a quantum circuit model that alternates between arbitrary-sized Clifford circuits and constant-depth circuits with two-qubit gates ($\textsf{QNC}^0$). This model unifies existing circuit models, such as $\textsf{QAC}^0_f$ and models with adaptive intermediate measurements. Despite its generality, we are able to prove nontrivial lower bounds.
  We prove new lower bounds in the first level of the hierarchy, showing that certain explicit quantum states cannot be approximately prepared by circuits consisting of a Clifford circuit followed by $\textsf{QNC}^0$. These states include ground states of some topologically ordered Hamiltonians and nonstabilizer quantum codes. Our techniques exploit the rigid structure of stabilizer codes and introduce an infectiousness property: if even a single state in a high distance code can be approximately prepared by one of these circuits, then the entire subspace must lie close to a perturbed stabilizer code. We also show that proving state preparation lower bounds beyond a certain level of the hierarchy would imply classical circuit lower bounds beyond the reach of current techniques in complexity theory.
  More broadly, our techniques go beyond lightcone-based methods and highlight how the magic hierarchy provides a natural framework for connecting circuit complexity, condensed matter, and Hamiltonian complexity.</description>
