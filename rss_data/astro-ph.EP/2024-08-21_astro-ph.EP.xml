      <title>RV measurements of directly imaged brown dwarf GQ Lup B to search for exo-satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GQ Lup B is one of the few substellar companions with a detected cicumplanetary disk, or CPD. Observations of the CPD suggest the presence of a cavity, possibly formed by an exo-satellite. Using the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC), a high contrast imaging suite that feeds a high resolution spectrograph (1.9-2.5 microns, R$\sim$35,000), we present the first dedicated radial velocity (RV) observations around a high-contrast, directly imaged substellar companion, GQ Lup B, to search for exo-satellites. Over 11 epochs, we find a best and median RV error of 400-1000 m/s, most likely limited by systematic fringing in the spectra due to transmissive optics within KPIC. With this RV precision, KPIC is sensitive to exomoons 0.6-2.8% the mass of GQ Lup B ($\sim 30 M_{\text{Jup}}$) at separations between the Roche limit and $65 R_{\text{Jup}}$, or the extent of the cavity inferred within the CPD detected around GQ Lup B. Using simulations of HISPEC, a high resolution infrared spectrograph planned to debut at W.M. Keck Observatory in 2026, we estimate future exomoon sensitivity to increase by over an order of magnitude, providing sensitivity to less massive satellites potentially formed within the CPD itself. Additionally, we run simulations to estimate the amount of material that different masses of satellites could clear in a CPD to create the observed cavity. We find satellite-to-planet mass ratios of $q &gt; 2 \times 10^{-4}$ can create observable cavities and report a maximum cavity size of $\sim 51 \, R_{\text{Jup}}$ carved from a satellite.</description>

      <title>The interior of Uranus: thermal profile, bulk composition and the distribution of rock, water and hydrogen and helium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present improved empirical density profiles of Uranus and interpret them in terms of their temperature and composition using a new random algorithm. The algorithm to determine the temperature and composition is agnostic with respect to the temperature gradient in non-isentropic regions and chooses randomly amongst all possible gradients that are stable against convection and correspond to an Equation of State compatible composition. Our empirical models are based on an efficient implementation of the Theory of Figures up to 10th order including a proper treatment of the atmosphere. The accuracy of 10th order ToF enables us to present accurate calculations of the gravitational moments of Uranus up to $J_{14}$:
  $J_{6} = ( 5.3078 \pm 0.3312)\cdot10^{-7}$,
  $J_{8} = (-1.1114 \pm 0.1391)\cdot10^{-8}$,
  $J_{10} = ( 2.8616 \pm 0.5466)\cdot10^{-10}$,
  $J_{12} = (-8.4684 \pm 2.0889)\cdot10^{-12}$ and
  $J_{14} = ( 2.7508 \pm 0.7944)\cdot10^{-13}$.
  We consider two interior models of Uranus that differ with respect to the maximal number of materials allowed per layer of Uranus (three vs. four composition components). The case with three materials does not allow Hydrogen and Helium in deeper parts of Uranus and results in a higher water abundance which leads to lower central temperatures. On the other hand, the models with four materials allow H-He to be mixed into the deeper interior and lead to rock-dominated solutions. We find that these four composition components models are less reliable due to the underlying empirical models incompatibility with realistic Brunt frequencies. Most of our models are found to be either purely convective with the exception of boundary layers, or only convective in the outermost region. Almost all of our models possess a region that is convective and consists of ionic H$_{2}$O which could explain the generation of Uranus' magnetic field.</description>

      <title>The GAPS Programme at TNG. LIX. A characterisation study of the $\sim$300 Myr old multi-planetary system orbiting the star BD+40 2790 (TOI-2076)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We collected more than 300 high-resolution spectra of the 300 Myr old star BD+40 2790 (TOI-2076) over ~3 years. This star hosts three transiting planets discovered by TESS, with orbital periods ~10, 21, and 35 days. BD+40 2790 shows an activity-induced scatter larger than 30 m/s in the radial velocities. We employed different methods to measure the stellar radial velocities and several models to filter out the dominant stellar activity signal, in order to bring to light the planet-induced signals which are expected to have semi-amplitudes one order of magnitude lower. We evaluated the mass loss rate of the planetary atmospheres using photoionization hydrodynamic modeling. The dynamical analysis confirms that the three sub-Neptune-sized companions (our radius measurements are $R_b$=2.54$\pm$0.04, $R_c$=3.35$\pm$0.05, and $R_d$=3.29$\pm$0.06 $R_{\rm Earth}$) have masses in the planetary regime. We derive 3$\sigma$ upper limits below or close to the mass of Neptune for all the planets: 11--12, 12--13.5, and 14--19 $M_{\rm Earth}$ for planet $b$, $c$, and $d$ respectively. In the case of planet $d$, we found promising clues that the mass could be between ~7 and 8 $M_{\rm Earth}$, with a significance level between 2.3--2.5$\sigma$ (at best). This result must be further investigated using other analysis methods or using high-precision near-IR spectrographs to collect new radial velocities, which could be less affected by stellar activity. Atmospheric photo-evaporation simulations predict that BD+40~2790 b is currently losing its H-He gaseous envelope, which will be completely lost at an age within 0.5--3 Gyr if its current mass is lower than 12 $M_{\rm Earth}$. BD+40 2790 c could have a lower bulk density than $b$, and it could retain its atmosphere up to an age of 5 Gyr. For the outermost planet $d$, we predict almost negligible evolution of its mass and radius induced by photo-evaporation.</description>

      <title>The missing rings around Solar System moons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rings are complex structures surrounding giant planets and some minor bodies in the Solar System. While some formation mechanisms could also potentially foster their existence around (regular or irregular) satellites, none of these bodies currently bear these structures. We aim to understand the underlying mechanisms that govern the potential formation, stability, and/or decay of hypothetical circumsatellital rings (CSRs), orbiting the largest moons in the Solar System. This extends to the exploration of short-term morphological features within these rings, providing insights into the ring survival time-scales and the interactions that drive their evolution. To conduct this study, we use numerical N-body simulations under the perturbing influence of the host planet and other moon companions. We found that moons with a lower Roche-to-Hill radius can preserve their rings over extended periods. Moreover, the gravitational environment in which these rings are immersed influences the system's morphological evolution, inducing gaps through the excitation of eccentricity and inclination of constituent particles. Specifically, our results show that Iapetus' and Rhea's rings experience minimal variations in their orbital parameters, enhancing their long-term stability. This agrees with the hypothesis that some of the features of Iapetus and Rhea were produced by ancient ring systems, for example, the huge ridge in Iapetus equator as a result of a decaying ring. From a dynamical perspective, we found that there are no mechanisms that preclude the existence of CSRs and we attribute their current absence to non-gravitational phenomena. Effects such as stellar radiation, magnetic fields, and the influence of magnetospheric plasma can significantly impact the dynamics of constituent particles and trigger their decay, highlighing the importance of future studies on these effects.</description>

      <title>Chemical composition of comets C/2021 A1 (Leonard) and C/2022 E3 (ZTF) from radio spectroscopy and the abundance of HCOOH and HNCO in comets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a molecular survey of long period comets C/2021 A1 (Leonard) and C/2022 E3 (ZTF). Comet C/2021 A1 was observed with the IRAM 30-m radio telescope in November-December 2021 before perihelion when it was closest to the Earth. We observed C/2022 E3 in January-February 2023 with the Odin 1-m space telescope and IRAM 30-m, shortly after its perihelion, and when it was closest to the Earth. Snapshots were obtained during 12-16 November 2021 period for comet C/2021 A1. Spectral surveys were undertaken over the 8-13 December 2021 period for comet C/2021 A1 (8, 16, and 61 GHz bandwidth in the 3 mm, 2 mm, and 1 mm window) and over the 3-7 February 2023 period for comet C/2022 E3 (25 and 61 GHz at 2 and 1mm). We report detections of 14 molecular species (HCN, HNC, CH3CN, HNCO, NH2CHO, CH3OH, H2CO, HCOOH, CH3CHO, H2S, CS, OCS, C2H5OH and aGg-(CH2OH)2 ) in both comets plus HC3N and CH2OHCHO marginally detected in C/2021 A1 and CO and H2O (with Odin detected in C/2022 E3. The spatial distribution of several species is investigated. Significant upper limits on the abundances of other molecules and isotopic ratios are also presented. The activity of comet C/2021 A1 did not vary significantly between 13 November and 13 December 2021. Short-term variability in the outgassing of comet C/2022 E3 on the order of +-20% is present and possibly linked to its 8h rotation period. Both comets exhibit rather low abundances relative to water for volatiles species such as CO (&lt; 2%) and H2S (0.15%). Methanol is also rather depleted in comet C/2021 A1 (0.9%). Following their revised photo-destruction rates, HNCO and HCOOH abundances in comets have been reevaluated. Both molecules are relatively enriched in these two comets (0.2% relative to water). We cannot exclude that these species could be produced by the dissociation of ammonium salts.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Semi-convective Staircases in Rotating Flows: Consequences for Fuzzy Cores in Giant Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observational constraints on the internal structure of Jupiter and Saturn suggest that these planets have ``fuzzy" cores, i.e., radial gradients of the concentration of heavy elements that might span $50\%$ to $70\%$ of each planet's radius. These cores could be composed of a semi-convective staircase, i.e., multiple convective layers separated by diffusive interfaces arising from double-diffusive instabilities. However, to date, no study has demonstrated how such staircases can avoid layer mergers and persist over evolutionary time scales. In fact, previous work has found that these mergers occur rapidly, quickly leading to only a single convective layer. Using 3D simulations of convective staircases in non-rotating and rotating flows, we demonstrate that rotation prolongs the lifetime of a convective staircase by increasing the timescale for both layer merger and erosion of the interface between the final two layers. We present an analytic model for the erosion phase, predicting that rotation increases the erosion time by a factor of approximately $\mathrm{Ro}^{-1/2}$, where $\mathrm{Ro}$ is the Rossby number of the convective flows (the ratio of the rotation period to the convective turnover time). For Jovian conditions at early times after formation (when convection is vigorous enough to mix a large fraction of the planet), we find the erosion time to be roughly $10^{9}~\mathrm{yrs}$ in the non-rotating case and $10^{11}~\mathrm{yrs}$ in the rotating case. Thus, the current existence of convective staircases within the deep interiors of giant planets is a strong possibility, and rotation could be an important factor in the preservation of their fuzzy cores.</description>

      <title>Geodynamics of super-Earth GJ 486b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many super-Earths are on very short orbits around their host star and, therefore, more likely to be tidally locked. Because this locking can lead to a strong contrast between the dayside and nightside surface temperatures, these super-Earths could exhibit mantle convection patterns and tectonics that could differ significantly from those observed in the present-day solar system. The presence of an atmosphere, however, would allow transport of heat from the dayside towards the nightside and thereby reduce the surface temperature contrast between the two hemispheres. On rocky planets, atmospheric and geodynamic regimes are closely linked, which directly connects the question of atmospheric thickness to the potential interior dynamics of the planet. Here, we study the interior dynamics of super-Earth GJ 486b ($R=1.34$ $R_{\oplus}$, $M=3.0$ $M_{\oplus}$, T$_\mathrm{eq}\approx700$ K), which is one of the most suitable M-dwarf super-Earth candidates for retaining an atmosphere produced by degassing from the mantle and magma ocean. We investigate how the geodynamic regime of GJ 486b is influenced by different surface temperature contrasts by varying possible atmospheric circulation regimes. We also investigate how the strength of the lithosphere affects the convection pattern. We find that hemispheric tectonics, the surface expression of degree-1 convection with downwellings forming on one hemisphere and upwelling material rising on the opposite hemisphere, is a consequence of the strong lithosphere rather than surface temperature contrast. Anchored hemispheric tectonics, where downwellings und upwellings have a preferred (day/night) hemisphere, is favoured for strong temperature contrasts between the dayside and nightside and higher surface temperatures.</description>

      <title>LavAtmos 2.0: Incorporating Volatiles Species in Vaporization Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to strong irradiation, hot rocky exoplanets are able to sustain lava oceans. Direct interaction between these oceans and overlying atmospheres can provide insight into planetary interiors. In order to fully understand how the composition of the atmosphere of such planets are affected by the properties of the oceans, comprehensive chemical equilibrium models are required. Thus far, most models have only taken non-volatile species into account when calculating lava vaporisation. We investigate the effect of including C-, H-, N-, S-, and P-bearing species in the equilibrium lava vaporisation calculations on the overall atmospheric composition of hot rocky exoplanets by expanding our LavAtmos code. In LavAtmos 2.0 we integrate the chemical equilibrium code FastChem to expand the considered gas phase species to 523. We apply this new approach to calculate the composition of "pure" atmospheres which contain only a single volatile element and more complex atmospheres which contain C, H, N, S, and P. We also test two proposed compositions for the atmosphere of 55-Cnc e. We find that the inclusion of volatile elements in vaporisation calculations increases the partial pressures of vaporised species for all tested atmospheric compositions. Our models indicate that the tested volatile atmospheres above a lava ocean have a relatively low C-O ratio. This demonstrates the utility of complex chemical models that better describe the chemical behavior of atmospheres across a wide range of pressures and temperatures. Volatile elements must be taken into account for comprehensive modeling of vaporisation from a surface lava ocean into a volatile atmosphere. Vaporised species such as SiO, TiO, and Na may be present in greater abundances than previously estimated. A low atmospheric C/O ratio may be able to function as a new tracer for the presence of surface lava oceans on hot rocky exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Varying water activity and momentum transfer on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko from its non-gravitational forces and torques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ability of a simultaneous fitting of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko's non-gravitational forces, torques and total water-outgassing rate, as observed by Rosetta, to constrain complex thermophysical models of cometary material. We extend the previous work of fitting geographically defined surface outgassing models to the Rosetta observations by testing the effects of a more detailed geomorphological mapping, the resolution of the shape-model used, self-heating by neighbouring facets on the shape-model, thermal inertia in the outgassing solution, and variation in the momentum coupling between the gas and the nucleus. We also directly compare the non-gravitational acceleration curves available in the literature. We correct an error in the calculation of pole-orientation in the previous paper. We find that, under the assumptions of the model: non-gravitational forces and torques are driven by water sublimation from the nucleus, thermal inertia and self-heating have only minor effects, spatially uniform activity cannot explain 67P's non-gravitational dynamics, spatially uniform momentum transfer cannot explain 67P's non-gravitational dynamics, and different terrain types have different instantaneous responses to insolation. Consolidated terrain facing south on 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko has a high outgassing flux, steep response to insolation, and large gas momentum transfer coefficient. Meanwhile, that facing north behaves differently, producing low-to-no water outgassing, and with a lower momentum transfer efficiency. Dusty terrain also has a lower outgassing rate and momentum transfer efficiency, and either depletes its volatile component or is buried in fall-back as the comet approaches the Sun. Momentum transfer appears correlated with insolation, likely due to an increased enhancement in the gas temperature as the dust it flows through is heated.</description>

      <title>Reactive molecular dynamics simulations of micrometeoroid bombardment for space weathering of asteroid (162173) Ryugu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote sensing observations by Hayabusa2 and laboratory measurements have revealed that the phyllosilicates on asteroid (162173) Ryugu are dehydrated/dehydroxylated due to space weathering. Reactive molecular dynamics simulations were performed to evaluate the magnitude of the dehydroxylation of Mg-rich serpentine by micrometeoroid impacts. When micrometeoroids were not coupled with interplanetary magnetic fields, serpentine could be dehydroxylated by micrometeoroids as small as 2 nm in size. In particular, ~200 O-H bonds dissociated when the meteoroids were derived from cometary activity (the impact velocity was ~20 km s$^{-1}$). When nano-sized dust particles were accelerated to ~300 km s$^{-1}$ by the magnetic fields of solar wind plasma, the number of dissociated O-H bonds increased by one order of magnitude. Consequently even 1 nm-sized dust particles can contribute to the space weathering of Ryugu. In all cases, Si-OH, H2O, and free OH were generated from the hydroxyls initially connected to Mg, which could partially offset dehydration. Despite the limitations of our computational resources, which restricted the simulation time scale to 1 ps, reactive molecular dynamic simulations demonstrated that micrometeoroid bombardment could influence the space weathering of asteroids.</description>

      <title>A reassessment of the "hard-steps" model for the evolution of intelligent life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10293</link>

Abstract: According to the "hard-steps" model, the origin of humanity required "successful passage through a number of intermediate steps" (so-called "hard" or "critical" steps) that were intrinsically improbable with respect to the total time available for biological evolution on Earth. This model similarly predicts that technological life analogous to human life on Earth is "exceedingly rare" in the universe. Here, we critically reevaluate the core assumptions of the hard-steps model in light of recent advances in the Earth and life sciences. Specifically, we advance a potential alternative model where there are no hard steps, and evolutionary novelties (or singularities) required for human origins can be explained via mechanisms outside of intrinsic improbability. Furthermore, if Earth's surface environment was initially inhospitable not only to human life, but also to certain key intermediate steps in human evolution (e.g., the origin of eukaryotic cells, multicellular animals), then the "delay" in the appearance of humans can be best explained through the sequential opening of new global environmental windows of habitability over Earth history, with humanity arising relatively quickly once the right conditions were established. In this co-evolutionary (or geobiological) scenario, humans did not evolve "early" or "late" with respect to the total lifespan of the biosphere, but "on time."</description>

      <title>ExoTiC-LD: thirty seconds to stellar limb-darkening coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar limb darkening is the observed variation in brightness of a star between its centre and edge (or limb) when viewed in the plane of the sky. Stellar brightness is maximal at the centre and then decreases radially and monotonically towards the limb -- hence the term "limb darkening". This effect is crucial for finding and characterising planets beyond our Solar System, known as exoplanets, as these planets are often studied when crossing in front of their host stars. As such, limb darkening is directly linked to the exoplanet signals. Limb darkening is typically modelled by one of various functional forms, as outlined in Claret (2000) and Sing (2010), and the coefficients of these functions is what ExoTiC-LD is designed to compute. A wide variety of functional forms are supported, including those benchmarked by Espinoza &amp; Jord\'an (2016) as well as reparameterisations suggested by Kipping (2013).</description>

      <title>High-pressure torsion processing of serine and glutamic acid: Understanding mechanochemical behavior of amino acids under astronomical impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astronomical impacts by small solar system bodies (meteoroids, asteroids, comets, and transitional objects) are considered a mechanism for delivering amino acids and their polymerization to proteins in early Earth conditions. High-pressure torsion (HPT) is a new methodology to simulate such impacts and clarify the behavior of biomolecules. In this study, two amino acids, crystalline L-serine and L-glutamic acid that were detected in meteorites, are processed by HPT and examined by ex situ X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and in situ mechanical shear testing. No polymerization, chemical reactions, or phase transformations are detected after HPT, indicating that the stability and presence of these two amino acids in meteorites are quite reasonable. However, some microstructural and mechanical changes like crystal size reduction to the nanometer level, crystal defect formation, lattice expansion by vacancy formation, and shear strength enhancement to the steady state are found which are similar to the behaviors reported in metals and ceramics after HPT processing.</description>

      <title>Discovery space and science with the PLACID stellar coronagraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The world's first ever ''adaptive stellar coronagraph'' facility will be the PLACID instrument, installed on Turkey's new national observatory 4-m DAG telescope. PLACID incorporates a customized spatial light modulator (SLM) acting as a dynamically addressed focal-plane phase mask (FPM) coronagraph in the H-Ks bands. This new approach to high-contrast imaging will be applied on-sky in late 2024/early 2025. We present a first estimate of the science discovery space for PLACID, in terms of known exoplanets and brown dwarfs, considering raw lab contrast, contrast ratios, limiting magnitudes, coronagraphic inner working angle etc. In the future, we will also look into predicted disk and binary or multiple stars systems imaging performance, with the latter being a possible niche science case for the instrument (adaptive FPM for multiple stars). This work will inform on the first light PLACID commissioning activities and early science on the DAG telescope and is deemed to evolve in function of future developments on the DAG AO instrumentation suite.</description>

      <title>Future exoplanet direct imaging instruments: Simulating spatial light modulator-based pixelated focal-plane coronagraphy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The programmable Liquid-crystal Active Coronagraphic Imager for the DAG Telescope (PLACID) instrument will be installed on the Turkish 4-m Telescope by the fall of 2024 and is expected to be on-sky by the end of the year. PLACID will be the first ''active stellar coronagraph instrument'', equipped with a customized spatial light modulator (SLM), which performs as a dynamically programmable focal-plane phase mask (FPM) from H- to Ks- band. A Python-based numerical simulator of SLM-based focal-plane phase coronagraph is developed to investigate the effects of discrete pixelated FPM patterns in place of classical phase masks. The simulator currently explores the impacts of two design choices, spatial sampling in the coronagraphic focal-plane (number of SLM pixels per $\lambda$/D) and phase resolution (SLM greylevel steps). The preliminary results of the monochromatic simulations show that in ideal conditions (no wavefront errors) it is sufficient to use FPMs with spatial sampling of 10 SLM pixel per $\lambda$/D and phase resolution of 8 bits. The tool is expected to enable detailed simulations of PLACID or similar SLM-based instruments, and to help with real-time operations (optimal choice of FPM for given observing conditions) and interpretation of real data. Additionally, the tool is designed to integrate and simulate advanced operation modes, in particular focal-plane phase diversity for coherent differential imaging (CDI) of exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Cosmoglobe DR2. III. Improved modelling of zodiacal light with COBE-DIRBE through global Bayesian analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an improved zodiacal light model for COBE-DIRBE derived through global Bayesian analysis within the Cosmoglobe Data Release 2 framework. The parametric form of the ZL model is identical to that introduced by Kelsall et al. (1998), but the specific best-fit parameter values are re-derived using the combination of DIRBE Calibrated Individual Observations, Planck HFI sky maps, and WISE and Gaia compact object catalogs. Furthermore, the ZL parameters are fitted jointly with astrophysical parameters, such as thermal dust and starlight emission, and the new model takes into account excess radiation that appears stationary in solar-centric coordinates as reported in a companion paper. The relative differences between the predicted signals from K98 and our new model are $\lesssim 5\%$ in the 12 and 25 $\mu$m channels over the full sky. The zero-levels of the cleaned DR2 maps are lower than those of the K98 Zodiacal light Subtracted Mission Average maps by $\sim 10$ kJy/sr at 1.25-3.5 $\mu$m, which is larger than the entire predicted contribution from high-redshift galaxies to the Cosmic Infrared Background at the same wavelengths. The total RMS of each DR2 map at wavelengths up to and including 25 $\mu$m are $\sim 30$ $\%$ lower at high Galactic latitudes than the corresponding DIRBE ZSMA maps. Still, obvious ZL residuals can be seen in several of the DR2 maps, and further work is required to mitigate these. Joint analysis with existing and future high-resolution full-sky surveys such as AKARI, IRAS, Planck HFI, and SPHEREx will be essential both to break key degeneracies in the current model and to determine whether the reported solar-centric excess radiation has a ZL or instrumental origin. Thus, while the results presented in this paper do redefine the state-of-the-art for DIRBE modelling, it also only represents the first among many steps toward a future optimal Bayesian ZL model.</description>

      <title>An FUV-detected Accretion Shock at the Star-Disk Boundary of FU Ori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: FU Ori objects are the most extreme eruptive young stars known. Their 4 to 5 magnitude photometric outbursts last for decades and are attributed to a factor of up to 10,000 increase in the stellar accretion rate. The nature of the accretion disk-to-star interface in FU Ori objects has remained a mystery for decades. To date, attempts to directly observe a shock or boundary layer have been thwarted by the apparent lack of emission in excess of the accretion disk photosphere down to $\lambda = 2300$ \AA. We present a new NUV and the first high-sensitivity FUV spectrum of FU Ori. The FUV continuum is detected for the first time and, at $\lambda = 1400$ \AA, is more than $10^4$ times brighter than predicted by a viscous accretion disk. We interpret the excess as arising from a shock at the boundary between the disk and the stellar surface. We model the shock emission as a blackbody and find that the temperature of the shocked material is $T_\mathrm{FUV} \approx 16,000 \pm 2000$ K. The shock temperature corresponds to an accretion flow along the surface of the disk that reaches a velocity of 40 km s$^{-1}$ at the boundary, consistent with predictions from simulations.</description>

      <title>HATS-38 b and WASP-139 b join a growing group of hot Neptunes on polar orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We constrain the sky-projected obliquities of two low-density hot Neptune planets, HATS-38 b and WASP-139 b, orbiting nearby G and K stars using Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) observations with VLT/ESPRESSO, yielding $\lambda = -108_{-16}^{+11}$ deg and $-85.6_{-4.2}^{+7.7}$ deg, respectively. To model the RM effect, we use a new publicly available code, ironman, which is capable of jointly fitting transit photometry, Keplerian radial velocities, and RM effects. WASP-139 b has a residual eccentricity $e=0.103_{-0.041}^{+0.050}$ while HATS-38 b has an eccentricity of $e=0.112_{-0.070}^{+0.072}$, which is compatible with a circular orbit given our data. Using the obliquity constraints, we show that they join a growing group of hot and low-density Neptunes on polar orbits. We use long-term radial velocities to rule out companions with masses $\sim 0.3-50$ $M_J$ within $\sim10$ au. We show that the orbital architectures of the two Neptunes can be explained with high-eccentricity migration from $\gtrsim 2$ au driven by an unseen distant companion. If HATS-38b has no residual eccentricity, its polar and circular orbit can also be consistent with a primordial misalignment. Finally, we performed a hierarchical Bayesian modeling of the true obliquity distribution of Neptunes and found suggestive evidence for a higher preponderance of polar orbits of hot Neptunes compared to Jupiters. However, we note that the exact distribution is sensitive to the choice of priors, highlighting the need for additional obliquity measurements of Neptunes to robustly compare the hot Neptune obliquity distribution to Jupiters.</description>
