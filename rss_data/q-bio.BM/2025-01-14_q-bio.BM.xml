      <title>COLOR: A compositional linear operation-based representation of protein sequences for identification of monomer contributions to properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of biological materials like proteins and nucleic acids are largely determined by their primary sequence. While certain segments in the sequence strongly influence specific functions, identifying these segments, or so-called motifs, is challenging due to the complexity of sequential data. While deep learning (DL) models can accurately capture sequence-property relationships, the degree of nonlinearity in these models limits the assessment of monomer contributions to a property - a critical step in identifying key motifs. Recent advances in explainable AI (XAI) offer attention and gradient-based methods for estimating monomeric contributions. However, these methods are primarily applied to classification tasks, such as binding site identification, where they achieve limited accuracy (40-45%) and rely on qualitative evaluations. To address these limitations, we introduce a DL model with interpretable steps, enabling direct tracing of monomeric contributions. We also propose a metric ($\mathcal{I}$), inspired by the masking technique in the field of image analysis and natural language processing, for quantitative analysis on datasets mainly containing distinct properties of anti-cancer peptides (ACP), antimicrobial peptides (AMP), and collagen. Our model exhibits 22% higher explainability, pinpoints critical motifs (RRR, RRI, and RSS) that significantly destabilize ACPs, and identifies motifs in AMPs that are 50% more effective in converting non-AMPs to AMPs. These findings highlight the potential of our model in guiding mutation strategies for designing protein-based biomaterials.</description>

      <title>A Nonlocal size modified Poisson-Boltzmann Model and Its Finite Element Solver for Protein in Multi-Species Ionic Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) model is a widely used implicit solvent model in protein simulations. Although variants, such as the size modified PB and nonlocal modified PB models, have been developed to account for ionic size effects and nonlocal dielectric correlations, no existing PB variants simultaneously incorporate both, due to significant modeling and computational challenges. To address this gap, in this paper, a nonlocal size modified PB (NSMPB) model is introduced and solved using a finite element method for a protein with a three-dimensional molecular structure and an ionic solution containing multiple ion species. In particular, a novel solution decomposition is proposed to overcome the difficulties caused by the increased nonlinearity, nonlocality, and solution singularities of the model. It is then applied to the development of the NSMPB finite element solver, which includes an efficient modified Newton iterative method, an effective damping parameter selection strategy, and good selections of initial iterations. Moreover, the construction of the modified Newton iterative method is mathematically justified. Furthermore, an NSMPB finite element package is developed by integrating a mesh generation tool, a protein data bank file retrieval program, and the PDB2PQR package to simplify and accelerate its usage and application. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted on an ionic solution with four species, proteins with up to 11439 atoms, and irregular interface-fitted tetrahedral box meshes with up to 1188840 vertices. The numerical results confirm the fast convergence and strong robustness of the modified Newton iterative method, demonstrate the high performance of the package, and highlight the crucial roles played by the damping parameter and initial iteration selections in enhancing the method's convergence. The package will be a valuable tool in protein simulations.</description>
