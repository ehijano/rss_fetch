      <title>Satisficing Exploration in Bandit Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the concept of satisficing in decision-making, we consider the problem of satisficing exploration in bandit optimization. In this setting, the learner aims at selecting satisficing arms (arms with mean reward exceeding a certain threshold value) as frequently as possible. The performance is measured by satisficing regret, which is the cumulative deficit of the chosen arm's mean reward compared to the threshold. We propose SELECT, a general algorithmic template for Satisficing Exploration via LowEr Confidence bound Testing, that attains constant satisficing regret for a wide variety of bandit optimization problems in the realizable case (i.e., a satisficing arm exists). Specifically, given a class of bandit optimization problems and a corresponding learning oracle with sub-linear (standard) regret upper bound, SELECT iteratively makes use of the oracle to identify a potential satisficing arm with low regret. Then, it collects data samples from this arm, and continuously compares the LCB of the identified arm's mean reward against the threshold value to determine if it is a satisficing arm. As a complement, SELECT also enjoys the same (standard) regret guarantee as the oracle in the non-realizable case. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to validate the performance of SELECT for several popular bandit optimization settings.</description>

      <title>A local squared Wasserstein-2 method for efficient reconstruction of models with uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a local squared Wasserstein-2 (W_2) method to solve the inverse problem of reconstructing models with uncertain latent variables or parameters. A key advantage of our approach is that it does not require prior information on the distribution of the latent variables or parameters in the underlying models. Instead, our method can efficiently reconstruct the distributions of the output associated with different inputs based on empirical distributions of observation data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method across several uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks, including linear regression with coefficient uncertainty, training neural networks with weight uncertainty, and reconstructing ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with a latent random variable.</description>

      <title>Flexible Parametric Inference for Space-Time Hawkes Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many modern spatio-temporal data sets, in sociology, epidemiology or seismology, for example, exhibit self-exciting characteristics, triggering and clustering behaviors both at the same time, that a suitable Hawkes space-time process can accurately capture. This paper aims to develop a fast and flexible parametric inference technique to recover the parameters of the kernel functions involved in the intensity function of a space-time Hawkes process based on such data. Our statistical approach combines three key ingredients: 1) kernels with finite support are considered, 2) the space-time domain is appropriately discretized, and 3) (approximate) precomputations are used. The inference technique we propose then consists of a $\ell_2$ gradient-based solver that is fast and statistically accurate. In addition to describing the algorithmic aspects, numerical experiments have been carried out on synthetic and real spatio-temporal data, providing solid empirical evidence of the relevance of the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>Transformers Provably Learn Sparse Token Selection While Fully-Connected Nets Cannot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transformer architecture has prevailed in various deep learning settings due to its exceptional capabilities to select and compose structural information. Motivated by these capabilities, Sanford et al. proposed the sparse token selection task, in which transformers excel while fully-connected networks (FCNs) fail in the worst case. Building upon that, we strengthen the FCN lower bound to an average-case setting and establish an algorithmic separation of transformers over FCNs. Specifically, a one-layer transformer trained with gradient descent provably learns the sparse token selection task and, surprisingly, exhibits strong out-of-distribution length generalization. We provide empirical simulations to justify our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>On the Limitation of Kernel Dependence Maximization for Feature Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple and intuitive method for feature selection consists of choosing the feature subset that maximizes a nonparametric measure of dependence between the response and the features. A popular proposal from the literature uses the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) as the nonparametric dependence measure. The rationale behind this approach to feature selection is that important features will exhibit a high dependence with the response and their inclusion in the set of selected features will increase the HSIC. Through counterexamples, we demonstrate that this rationale is flawed and that feature selection via HSIC maximization can miss critical features.</description>

      <title>DecoR: Deconfounding Time Series with Robust Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal inference on time series data is a challenging problem, especially in the presence of unobserved confounders. This work focuses on estimating the causal effect between two time series, which are confounded by a third, unobserved time series. Assuming spectral sparsity of the confounder, we show how in the frequency domain this problem can be framed as an adversarial outlier problem. We introduce Deconfounding by Robust regression (DecoR), a novel approach that estimates the causal effect using robust linear regression in the frequency domain. Considering two different robust regression techniques, we first improve existing bounds on the estimation error for such techniques. Crucially, our results do not require distributional assumptions on the covariates. We can therefore use them in time series settings. Applying these results to DecoR, we prove, under suitable assumptions, upper bounds for the estimation error of DecoR that imply consistency. We show DecoR's effectiveness through experiments on synthetic data. Our experiments furthermore suggest that our method is robust with respect to model misspecification.</description>

      <title>Convergence rate of random scan Coordinate Ascent Variational Inference under log-concavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Coordinate Ascent Variational Inference scheme is a popular algorithm used to compute the mean-field approximation of a probability distribution of interest. We analyze its random scan version, under log-concavity assumptions on the target density. Our approach builds on the recent work of M. Arnese and D. Lacker, \emph{Convergence of coordinate ascent variational inference for log-concave measures via optimal transport} [arXiv:2404.08792] which studies the deterministic scan version of the algorithm, phrasing it as a block-coordinate descent algorithm in the space of probability distributions endowed with the geometry of optimal transport. We obtain tight rates for the random scan version, which imply that the total number of factor updates required to converge scales linearly with the condition number and the number of blocks of the target distribution. By contrast, available bounds for the deterministic scan case scale quadratically in the same quantities, which is analogue to what happens for optimization of convex functions in Euclidean spaces.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Ill-conditioned Hankel Matrix Recovery via Structured Newton-like Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the robust Hankel recovery problem, which simultaneously removes the sparse outliers and fulfills missing entries from the partial observation. We propose a novel non-convex algorithm, coined Hankel Structured Newton-Like Descent (HSNLD), to tackle the robust Hankel recovery problem. HSNLD is highly efficient with linear convergence, and its convergence rate is independent of the condition number of the underlying Hankel matrix. The recovery guarantee has been established under some mild conditions. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real datasets show the superior performance of HSNLD against state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Local Model Validity using Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world applications of machine learning models are often subject to legal or policy-based regulations. Some of these regulations require ensuring the validity of the model, i.e., the approximation error being smaller than a threshold. A global metric is generally too insensitive to determine the validity of a specific prediction, whereas evaluating local validity is costly since it requires gathering additional data.We propose learning the model error to acquire a local validity estimate while reducing the amount of required data through active learning. Using model validation benchmarks, we provide empirical evidence that the proposed method can lead to an error model with sufficient discriminative properties using a relatively small amount of data. Furthermore, an increased sensitivity to local changes of the validity bounds compared to alternative approaches is demonstrated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficiently post-training large language models remains a challenging task due to the vast computational resources required. We present Spectrum, a method that accelerates LLM training by selectively targeting layer modules based on their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and freezing the remaining modules. Our approach, which utilizes an algorithm to compute module SNRs prior to training, has shown to effectively match the performance of full fine-tuning while reducing GPU memory usage. Experiments comparing Spectrum to existing methods such as QLoRA demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of model quality and VRAM efficiency in distributed environments.</description>

      <title>Hinge-FM2I: An Approach using Image Inpainting for Interpolating Missing Data in Univariate Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate time series forecasts are crucial for various applications, such as traffic management, electricity consumption, and healthcare. However, limitations in models and data quality can significantly impact forecasts accuracy. One common issue with data quality is the absence of data points, referred to as missing data. It is often caused by sensor malfunctions, equipment failures, or human errors. This paper proposes Hinge-FM2I, a novel method for handling missing data values in univariate time series data. Hinge-FM2I builds upon the strengths of the Forecasting Method by Image Inpainting (FM2I). FM2I has proven effective, but selecting the most accurate forecasts remain a challenge. To overcome this issue, we proposed a selection algorithm. Inspired by door hinges, Hinge-FM2I drops a data point either before or after the gap (left/right-hinge), then use FM2I for imputation, and then select the imputed gap based on the lowest error of the dropped data point. Hinge-FM2I was evaluated on a comprehensive sample composed of 1356 time series, extracted from the M3 competition benchmark dataset, with missing value rates ranging from 3.57\% to 28.57\%. Experimental results demonstrate that Hinge-FM2I significantly outperforms established methods such as, linear/spline interpolation, K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), and ARIMA. Notably, Hinge-FM2I achieves an average Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (sMAPE) score of 5.6\% for small gaps, and up to 10\% for larger ones. These findings highlight the effectiveness of Hinge-FM2I as a promising new method for addressing missing values in univariate time series data.</description>

      <title>Federated Nonparametric Hypothesis Testing with Differential Privacy Constraints: Optimal Rates and Adaptive Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning has attracted significant recent attention due to its applicability across a wide range of settings where data is collected and analyzed across disparate locations. In this paper, we study federated nonparametric goodness-of-fit testing in the white-noise-with-drift model under distributed differential privacy (DP) constraints.
  We first establish matching lower and upper bounds, up to a logarithmic factor, on the minimax separation rate. This optimal rate serves as a benchmark for the difficulty of the testing problem, factoring in model characteristics such as the number of observations, noise level, and regularity of the signal class, along with the strictness of the $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP requirement. The results demonstrate interesting and novel phase transition phenomena. Furthermore, the results reveal an interesting phenomenon that distributed one-shot protocols with access to shared randomness outperform those without access to shared randomness. We also construct a data-driven testing procedure that possesses the ability to adapt to an unknown regularity parameter over a large collection of function classes with minimal additional cost, all while maintaining adherence to the same set of DP constraints.</description>

      <title>Optimal Federated Learning for Nonparametric Regression with Heterogeneous Distributed Differential Privacy Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies federated learning for nonparametric regression in the context of distributed samples across different servers, each adhering to distinct differential privacy constraints. The setting we consider is heterogeneous, encompassing both varying sample sizes and differential privacy constraints across servers. Within this framework, both global and pointwise estimation are considered, and optimal rates of convergence over the Besov spaces are established.
  Distributed privacy-preserving estimators are proposed and their risk properties are investigated. Matching minimax lower bounds, up to a logarithmic factor, are established for both global and pointwise estimation. Together, these findings shed light on the tradeoff between statistical accuracy and privacy preservation. In particular, we characterize the compromise not only in terms of the privacy budget but also concerning the loss incurred by distributing data within the privacy framework as a whole. This insight captures the folklore wisdom that it is easier to retain privacy in larger samples, and explores the differences between pointwise and global estimation under distributed privacy constraints.</description>

      <title>Personalized Binomial DAGs Learning with Network Structured Covariates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The causal dependence in data is often characterized by Directed Acyclic Graphical (DAG) models, widely used in many areas. Causal discovery aims to recover the DAG structure using observational data. This paper focuses on causal discovery with multi-variate count data. We are motivated by real-world web visit data, recording individual user visits to multiple websites. Building a causal diagram can help understand user behavior in transitioning between websites, inspiring operational strategy. A challenge in modeling is user heterogeneity, as users with different backgrounds exhibit varied behaviors. Additionally, social network connections can result in similar behaviors among friends. We introduce personalized Binomial DAG models to address heterogeneity and network dependency between observations, which are common in real-world applications. To learn the proposed DAG model, we develop an algorithm that embeds the network structure into a dimension-reduced covariate, learns each node's neighborhood to reduce the DAG search space, and explores the variance-mean relation to determine the ordering. Simulations show our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art competitors in heterogeneous data. We demonstrate its practical usefulness on a real-world web visit dataset.</description>

      <title>Stable Minima Cannot Overfit in Univariate ReLU Networks: Generalization by Large Step Sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the generalization of two-layer ReLU neural networks in a univariate nonparametric regression problem with noisy labels. This is a problem where kernels (\emph{e.g.} NTK) are provably sub-optimal and benign overfitting does not happen, thus disqualifying existing theory for interpolating (0-loss, global optimal) solutions. We present a new theory of generalization for local minima that gradient descent with a constant learning rate can \emph{stably} converge to. We show that gradient descent with a fixed learning rate $\eta$ can only find local minima that represent smooth functions with a certain weighted \emph{first order total variation} bounded by $1/\eta - 1/2 + \widetilde{O}(\sigma + \sqrt{\mathrm{MSE}})$ where $\sigma$ is the label noise level, $\mathrm{MSE}$ is short for mean squared error against the ground truth, and $\widetilde{O}(\cdot)$ hides a logarithmic factor. Under mild assumptions, we also prove a nearly-optimal MSE bound of $\widetilde{O}(n^{-4/5})$ within the strict interior of the support of the $n$ data points. Our theoretical results are validated by extensive simulation that demonstrates large learning rate training induces sparse linear spline fits. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to obtain generalization bound via minima stability in the non-interpolation case and the first to show ReLU NNs without regularization can achieve near-optimal rates in nonparametric regression.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear time-series embedding by monotone variational inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the wild, we often encounter collections of sequential data such as electrocardiograms, motion capture, genomes, and natural language, and sequences may be multichannel or symbolic with nonlinear dynamics. We introduce a new method to learn low-dimensional representations of nonlinear time series without supervision and can have provable recovery guarantees. The learned representation can be used for downstream machine-learning tasks such as clustering and classification. The method is based on the assumption that the observed sequences arise from a common domain, but each sequence obeys its own autoregressive models that are related to each other through low-rank regularization. We cast the problem as a computationally efficient convex matrix parameter recovery problem using monotone Variational Inequality and encode the common domain assumption via low-rank constraint across the learned representations, which can learn the geometry for the entire domain as well as faithful representations for the dynamics of each individual sequence using the domain information in totality. We show the competitive performance of our method on real-world time-series data with the baselines and demonstrate its effectiveness for symbolic text modeling and RNA sequence clustering.</description>

      <title>Training Dynamics of Nonlinear Contrastive Learning Model in the High Dimensional Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter presents a high-dimensional analysis of the training dynamics for a single-layer nonlinear contrastive learning model. The empirical distribution of the model weights converges to a deterministic measure governed by a McKean-Vlasov nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE). Under L2 regularization, this PDE reduces to a closed set of low-dimensional ordinary differential equations (ODEs), reflecting the evolution of the model performance during the training process. We analyze the fixed point locations and their stability of the ODEs unveiling several interesting findings. First, only the hidden variable's second moment affects feature learnability at the state with uninformative initialization. Second, higher moments influence the probability of feature selection by controlling the attraction region, rather than affecting local stability. Finally, independent noises added in the data argumentation degrade performance but negatively correlated noise can reduces the variance of gradient estimation yielding better performance. Despite of the simplicity of the analyzed model, it exhibits a rich phenomena of training dynamics, paving a way to understand more complex mechanism behind practical large models.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Reinforced Planning with Large Language Models for Drug Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The objective of drug discovery is to identify chemical compounds that possess specific pharmaceutical properties toward a binding target. Existing large language models (LLMS) can achieve high token matching scores in terms of likelihood for molecule generation. However, relying solely on LLM decoding often results in the generation of molecules that are either invalid due to a single misused token, or suboptimal due to unbalanced exploration and exploitation as a consequence of the LLMs prior experience. Here we propose ERP, Entropy-Reinforced Planning for Transformer Decoding, which employs an entropy-reinforced planning algorithm to enhance the Transformer decoding process and strike a balance between exploitation and exploration. ERP aims to achieve improvements in multiple properties compared to direct sampling from the Transformer. We evaluated ERP on the SARS-CoV-2 virus (3CLPro) and human cancer cell target protein (RTCB) benchmarks and demonstrated that, in both benchmarks, ERP consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art algorithm by 1-5 percent, and baselines by 5-10 percent, respectively. Moreover, such improvement is robust across Transformer models trained with different objectives. Finally, to further illustrate the capabilities of ERP, we tested our algorithm on three code generation benchmarks and outperformed the current state-of-the-art approach as well. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/xuefeng-cs/ERP.</description>

      <title>On the relation between trainability and dequantization of variational quantum learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quest for successful variational quantum machine learning (QML) relies on the design of suitable parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs), as analogues to neural networks in classical machine learning. Successful QML models must fulfill the properties of trainability and non-dequantization, among others. Recent works have highlighted an intricate interplay between trainability and dequantization of such models, which is still unresolved. In this work we contribute to this debate from the perspective of machine learning, proving a number of results identifying, among others when trainability and non-dequantization are not mutually exclusive. We begin by providing a number of new somewhat broader definitions of the relevant concepts, compared to what is found in other literature, which are operationally motivated, and consistent with prior art. With these precise definitions given and motivated, we then study the relation between trainability and dequantization of variational QML. Next, we also discuss the degrees of "variationalness" of QML models, where we distinguish between models like the hardware efficient ansatz and quantum kernel methods. Finally, we introduce recipes for building PQC-based QML models which are both trainable and nondequantizable, and corresponding to different degrees of variationalness. We do not address the practical utility for such models. Our work however does point toward a way forward for finding more general constructions, for which finding applications may become feasible.</description>

      <title>Efficient Mixture Learning in Black-Box Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixture variational distributions in black box variational inference (BBVI) have demonstrated impressive results in challenging density estimation tasks. However, currently scaling the number of mixture components can lead to a linear increase in the number of learnable parameters and a quadratic increase in inference time due to the evaluation of the evidence lower bound (ELBO). Our two key contributions address these limitations. First, we introduce the novel Multiple Importance Sampling Variational Autoencoder (MISVAE), which amortizes the mapping from input to mixture-parameter space using one-hot encodings. Fortunately, with MISVAE, each additional mixture component incurs a negligible increase in network parameters. Second, we construct two new estimators of the ELBO for mixtures in BBVI, enabling a tremendous reduction in inference time with marginal or even improved impact on performance. Collectively, our contributions enable scalability to hundreds of mixture components and provide superior estimation performance in shorter time, with fewer network parameters compared to previous Mixture VAEs. Experimenting with MISVAE, we achieve astonishing, SOTA results on MNIST. Furthermore, we empirically validate our estimators in other BBVI settings, including Bayesian phylogenetic inference, where we improve inference times for the SOTA mixture model on eight data sets.</description>

      <title>Active learning for affinity prediction of antibodies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary objective of most lead optimization campaigns is to enhance the binding affinity of ligands. For large molecules such as antibodies, identifying mutations that enhance antibody affinity is particularly challenging due to the combinatorial explosion of potential mutations. When the structure of the antibody-antigen complex is available, relative binding free energy (RBFE) methods can offer valuable insights into how different mutations will impact the potency and selectivity of a drug candidate, thereby reducing the reliance on costly and time-consuming wet-lab experiments. However, accurately simulating the physics of large molecules is computationally intensive. We present an active learning framework that iteratively proposes promising sequences for simulators to evaluate, thereby accelerating the search for improved binders. We explore different modeling approaches to identify the most effective surrogate model for this task, and evaluate our framework both using pre-computed pools of data and in a realistic full-loop setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo methods, Variational Inference, and their combinations play a pivotal role in sampling from intractable probability distributions. However, current studies lack a unified evaluation framework, relying on disparate performance measures and limited method comparisons across diverse tasks, complicating the assessment of progress and hindering the decision-making of practitioners. In response to these challenges, our work introduces a benchmark that evaluates sampling methods using a standardized task suite and a broad range of performance criteria. Moreover, we study existing metrics for quantifying mode collapse and introduce novel metrics for this purpose. Our findings provide insights into strengths and weaknesses of existing sampling methods, serving as a valuable reference for future developments. The code is publicly available here.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a boosted conformal procedure designed to tailor conformalized prediction intervals toward specific desired properties, such as enhanced conditional coverage or reduced interval length. We employ machine learning techniques, notably gradient boosting, to systematically improve upon a predefined conformity score function. This process is guided by carefully constructed loss functions that measure the deviation of prediction intervals from the targeted properties. The procedure operates post-training, relying solely on model predictions and without modifying the trained model (e.g., the deep network). Systematic experiments demonstrate that starting from conventional conformal methods, our boosted procedure achieves substantial improvements in reducing interval length and decreasing deviation from target conditional coverage.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback without Reward Inference: Model-Free Algorithm and Instance-Dependent Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) under an episodic Markov decision process with a general trajectory-wise reward model. We developed a model-free RLHF best policy identification algorithm, called $\mathsf{BSAD}$, without explicit reward model inference, which is a critical intermediate step in the contemporary RLHF paradigms for training large language models (LLM). The algorithm identifies the optimal policy directly from human preference information in a backward manner, employing a dueling bandit sub-routine that constantly duels actions to identify the superior one. $\mathsf{BSAD}$ adopts a reward-free exploration and best-arm-identification-like adaptive stopping criteria to equalize the visitation among all states in the same decision step while moving to the previous step as soon as the optimal action is identifiable, leading to a provable, instance-dependent sample complexity $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(c_{\mathcal{M}}SA^3H^3M\log\frac{1}{\delta})$ which resembles the result in classic RL, where $c_{\mathcal{M}}$ is the instance-dependent constant and $M$ is the batch size. Moreover, $\mathsf{BSAD}$ can be transformed into an explore-then-commit algorithm with logarithmic regret and generalized to discounted MDPs using a frame-based approach. Our results show: (i) sample-complexity-wise, RLHF is not significantly harder than classic RL and (ii) end-to-end RLHF may deliver improved performance by avoiding pitfalls in reward inferring such as overfit and distribution shift.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Hallucination Rate of Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is about estimating the hallucination rate for in-context learning (ICL) with Generative AI. In ICL, a conditional generative model (CGM) is prompted with a dataset and asked to make a prediction based on that dataset. The Bayesian interpretation of ICL assumes that the CGM is calculating a posterior predictive distribution over an unknown Bayesian model of a latent parameter and data. With this perspective, we define a \textit{hallucination} as a generated prediction that has low-probability under the true latent parameter. We develop a new method that takes an ICL problem -- that is, a CGM, a dataset, and a prediction question -- and estimates the probability that a CGM will generate a hallucination. Our method only requires generating queries and responses from the model and evaluating its response log probability. We empirically evaluate our method on synthetic regression and natural language ICL tasks using large language models.</description>

      <title>Partially Observed Trajectory Inference using Optimal Transport and a Dynamics Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trajectory inference seeks to recover the temporal dynamics of a population from snapshots of its (uncoupled) temporal marginals, i.e. where observed particles are not tracked over time. Lavenant et al. arXiv:2102.09204 addressed this challenging problem under a stochastic differential equation (SDE) model with a gradient-driven drift in the observed space, introducing a minimum entropy estimator relative to the Wiener measure. Chizat et al. arXiv:2205.07146 then provided a practical grid-free mean-field Langevin (MFL) algorithm using Schr\"odinger bridges. Motivated by the overwhelming success of observable state space models in the traditional paired trajectory inference problem (e.g. target tracking), we extend the above framework to a class of latent SDEs in the form of observable state space models. In this setting, we use partial observations to infer trajectories in the latent space under a specified dynamics model (e.g. the constant velocity/acceleration models from target tracking). We introduce PO-MFL to solve this latent trajectory inference problem and provide theoretical guarantees by extending the results of arXiv:2102.09204 to the partially observed setting. We leverage the MFL framework of arXiv:2205.07146, yielding an algorithm based on entropic OT between dynamics-adjusted adjacent time marginals. Experiments validate the robustness of our method and the exponential convergence of the MFL dynamics, and demonstrate significant outperformance over the latent-free method of arXiv:2205.07146 in key scenarios.</description>

      <title>Beyond Model Collapse: Scaling Up with Synthesized Data Requires Reinforcement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthesized data from generative models is increasingly considered as an alternative to human-annotated data for fine-tuning Large Language Models. This raises concerns about model collapse: a drop in performance of models fine-tuned on generated data. Considering that it is easier for both humans and machines to tell between good and bad examples than to generate high-quality samples, we investigate the use of feedback on synthesized data to prevent model collapse. We derive theoretical conditions under which a Gaussian mixture classification model can achieve asymptotically optimal performance when trained on feedback-augmented synthesized data, and provide supporting simulations for finite regimes. We illustrate our theoretical predictions on two practical problems: computing matrix eigenvalues with transformers and news summarization with large language models, which both undergo model collapse when trained on model-generated data. We show that training from feedback-augmented synthesized data, either by pruning incorrect predictions or by selecting the best of several guesses, can prevent model collapse, validating popular approaches like RLHF.</description>

      <title>Towards Fundamentally Scalable Model Selection: Asymptotically Fast Update and Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of deep learning technologies is bringing new models every day, motivating the study of scalable model selection. An ideal model selection scheme should minimally support two operations efficiently over a large pool of candidate models: update, which involves either adding a new candidate model or removing an existing candidate model, and selection, which involves locating highly performing models for a given task. However, previous solutions to model selection require high computational complexity for at least one of these two operations. In this work, we target fundamentally (more) scalable model selection that supports asymptotically fast update and asymptotically fast selection at the same time. Firstly, we define isolated model embedding, a family of model selection schemes supporting asymptotically fast update and selection: With respect to the number of candidate models $m$, the update complexity is O(1) and the selection consists of a single sweep over $m$ vectors in addition to O(1) model operations. Isolated model embedding also implies several desirable properties for applications. Secondly, we present Standardized Embedder, an empirical realization of isolated model embedding. We assess its effectiveness by using it to select representations from a pool of 100 pre-trained vision models for classification tasks and measuring the performance gaps between the selected models and the best candidates with a linear probing protocol. Experiments suggest our realization is effective in selecting models with competitive performances and highlight isolated model embedding as a promising direction towards model selection that is fundamentally (more) scalable.</description>

      <title>Data-dependent Generalization Bounds via Variable-Size Compressibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish novel data-dependent upper bounds on the generalization error through the lens of a "variable-size compressibility" framework that we introduce newly here. In this framework, the generalization error of an algorithm is linked to a variable-size 'compression rate' of its input data. This is shown to yield bounds that depend on the empirical measure of the given input data at hand, rather than its unknown distribution. Our new generalization bounds that we establish are tail bounds, tail bounds on the expectation, and in-expectations bounds. Moreover, it is shown that our framework also allows to derive general bounds on any function of the input data and output hypothesis random variables. In particular, these general bounds are shown to subsume and possibly improve over several existing PAC-Bayes and data-dependent intrinsic dimension-based bounds that are recovered as special cases, thus unveiling a unifying character of our approach. For instance, a new data-dependent intrinsic dimension-based bound is established, which connects the generalization error to the optimization trajectories and reveals various interesting connections with the rate-distortion dimension of a process, the R\'enyi information dimension of a process, and the metric mean dimension.</description>

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIA) can reveal whether a particular data point was part of the training dataset, potentially exposing sensitive information about individuals. This article provides theoretical guarantees by exploring the fundamental statistical limitations associated with MIAs on machine learning models. More precisely, we first derive the statistical quantity that governs the effectiveness and success of such attacks. We then theoretically prove that in a non-linear regression setting with overfitting algorithms, attacks may have a high probability of success. Finally, we investigate several situations for which we provide bounds on this quantity of interest. Interestingly, our findings indicate that discretizing the data might enhance the algorithm's security. Specifically, it is demonstrated to be limited by a constant, which quantifies the diversity of the underlying data distribution. We illustrate those results through two simple simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17467v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative diffusion models have achieved spectacular performance in many areas of machine learning and generative modeling. While the fundamental ideas behind these models come from non-equilibrium physics, variational inference and stochastic calculus, in this paper we show that many aspects of these models can be understood using the tools of equilibrium statistical mechanics. Using this reformulation, we show that generative diffusion models undergo second-order phase transitions corresponding to symmetry breaking phenomena. We show that these phase-transitions are always in a mean-field universality class, as they are the result of a self-consistency condition in the generative dynamics. We argue that the critical instability that arises from the phase transitions lies at the heart of their generative capabilities, which are characterized by a set of mean-field critical exponents. Finally, we show that the dynamic equation of the generative process can be interpreted as a stochastic adiabatic transformation that minimizes the free energy while keeping the system in thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Are Normalizing Flows the Key to Unlocking the Exponential Mechanism?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09200v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Exponential Mechanism (ExpM), designed for private optimization, has been historically sidelined from use on continuous sample spaces, as it requires sampling from a generally intractable density, and, to a lesser extent, bounding the sensitivity of the objective function. Any differential privacy (DP) mechanism can be instantiated as ExpM, and ExpM poses an elegant solution for private machine learning (ML) that bypasses inherent inefficiencies of DPSGD. This paper seeks to operationalize ExpM for private optimization and ML by using an auxiliary Normalizing Flow (NF), an expressive deep network for density learning, to approximately sample from ExpM density. The method, ExpM+NF is an alternative to SGD methods for model training. We prove a sensitivity bound for the $\ell^2$ loss permitting ExpM use with any sampling method. To test feasibility, we present results on MIMIC-III health data comparing (non-private) SGD, DPSGD, and ExpM+NF training methods' accuracy and training time. We find that a model sampled from ExpM+NF is nearly as accurate as non-private SGD, more accurate than DPSGD, and ExpM+NF trains faster than Opacus' DPSGD implementation. Unable to provide a privacy proof for the NF approximation, we present empirical results to investigate privacy including the LiRA membership inference attack of Carlini et al. and the recent privacy auditing lower bound method of Steinke et al. Our findings suggest ExpM+NF provides more privacy than non-private SGD, but not as much as DPSGD, although many attacks are impotent against any model. Ancillary benefits of this work include pushing the SOTA of privacy and accuracy on MIMIC-III healthcare data, exhibiting the use of ExpM+NF for Bayesian inference, showing the limitations of empirical privacy auditing in practice, and providing several privacy theorems applicable to distribution learning.</description>

      <title>Nash Learning from Human Feedback</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the main paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Typically, RLHF involves the initial step of learning a reward model from human feedback, often expressed as preferences between pairs of text generations produced by a pre-trained LLM. Subsequently, the LLM's policy is fine-tuned by optimizing it to maximize the reward model through a reinforcement learning algorithm. However, an inherent limitation of current reward models is their inability to fully represent the richness of human preferences and their dependency on the sampling distribution.
  In this study, we introduce an alternative pipeline for the fine-tuning of LLMs using pairwise human feedback. Our approach entails the initial learning of a preference model, which is conditioned on two inputs given a prompt, followed by the pursuit of a policy that consistently generates responses preferred over those generated by any competing policy, thus defining the Nash equilibrium of this preference model. We term this approach Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF).
  In the context of a tabular policy representation, we present a novel algorithmic solution, Nash-MD, founded on the principles of mirror descent. This algorithm produces a sequence of policies, with the last iteration converging to the regularized Nash equilibrium. Additionally, we explore parametric representations of policies and introduce gradient descent algorithms for deep-learning architectures. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present experimental results involving the fine-tuning of a LLM for a text summarization task. We believe NLHF offers a compelling avenue for preference learning and policy optimization with the potential of advancing the field of aligning LLMs with human preferences.</description>

      <title>On the Recoverability of Causal Relations from Temporally Aggregated I.I.D. Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the effect of temporal aggregation on instantaneous (non-temporal) causal discovery in general setting. This is motivated by the observation that the true causal time lag is often considerably shorter than the observational interval. This discrepancy leads to high aggregation, causing time-delay causality to vanish and instantaneous dependence to manifest. Although we expect such instantaneous dependence has consistency with the true causal relation in certain sense to make the discovery results meaningful, it remains unclear what type of consistency we need and when will such consistency be satisfied. We proposed functional consistency and conditional independence consistency in formal way correspond functional causal model-based methods and conditional independence-based methods respectively and provide the conditions under which these consistencies will hold. We show theoretically and experimentally that causal discovery results may be seriously distorted by aggregation especially in complete nonlinear case and we also find causal relationship still recoverable from aggregated data if we have partial linearity or appropriate prior. Our findings suggest community should take a cautious and meticulous approach when interpreting causal discovery results from such data and show why and when aggregation will distort the performance of causal discovery methods.</description>

      <title>Optimization-based Causal Estimation from Heterogenous Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.11990v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new optimization approach to causal estimation. Given data that contains covariates and an outcome, which covariates are causes of the outcome, and what is the strength of the causality? In classical machine learning (ML), the goal of optimization is to maximize predictive accuracy. However, some covariates might exhibit a non-causal association with the outcome. Such spurious associations provide predictive power for classical ML, but they prevent us from causally interpreting the result. This paper proposes CoCo, an optimization algorithm that bridges the gap between pure prediction and causal inference. CoCo leverages the recently-proposed idea of environments, datasets of covariates/response where the causal relationships remain invariant but where the distribution of the covariates changes from environment to environment. Given datasets from multiple environments-and ones that exhibit sufficient heterogeneity-CoCo maximizes an objective for which the only solution is the causal solution. We describe the theoretical foundations of this approach and demonstrate its effectiveness on simulated and real datasets. Compared to classical ML and existing methods, CoCo provides more accurate estimates of the causal model and more accurate predictions under interventions.</description>

      <title>Metrizing Fairness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.15049v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study supervised learning problems that have significant effects on individuals from two demographic groups, and we seek predictors that are fair with respect to a group fairness criterion such as statistical parity (SP). A predictor is SP-fair if the distributions of predictions within the two groups are close in Kolmogorov distance, and fairness is achieved by penalizing the dissimilarity of these two distributions in the objective function of the learning problem. In this paper, we identify conditions under which hard SP constraints are guaranteed to improve predictive accuracy. We also showcase conceptual and computational benefits of measuring unfairness with integral probability metrics (IPMs) other than the Kolmogorov distance. Conceptually, we show that the generator of any IPM can be interpreted as a family of utility functions and that unfairness with respect to this IPM arises if individuals in the two demographic groups have diverging expected utilities. We also prove that the unfairness-regularized prediction loss admits unbiased gradient estimators, which are constructed from random mini-batches of training samples, if unfairness is measured by the squared $\mathcal L^2$-distance or by a squared maximum mean discrepancy. In this case, the fair learning problem is susceptible to efficient stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data show that these SGD algorithms outperform state-of-the-art methods for fair learning in that they achieve superior accuracy-unfairness trade-offs -- sometimes orders of magnitude faster.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conditional Independence (CI) graphs are a type of probabilistic graphical models that are primarily used to gain insights about feature relationships. Each edge represents the partial correlation between the connected features which gives information about their direct dependence. In this survey, we list out different methods and study the advances in techniques developed to recover CI graphs. We cover traditional optimization methods as well as recently developed deep learning architectures along with their recommended implementations. To facilitate wider adoption, we include preliminaries that consolidate associated operations, for example techniques to obtain covariance matrix for mixed datatypes.</description>

      <title>Label Alignment Regularization for Distribution Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.14960v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work has highlighted the label alignment property (LAP) in supervised learning, where the vector of all labels in the dataset is mostly in the span of the top few singular vectors of the data matrix. Drawing inspiration from this observation, we propose a regularization method for unsupervised domain adaptation that encourages alignment between the predictions in the target domain and its top singular vectors. Unlike conventional domain adaptation approaches that focus on regularizing representations, we instead regularize the classifier to align with the unsupervised target data, guided by the LAP in both the source and target domains. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under certain assumptions, our solution resides within the span of the top right singular vectors of the target domain data and aligns with the optimal solution. By removing the reliance on the commonly used optimal joint risk assumption found in classic domain adaptation theory, we showcase the effectiveness of our method on addressing problems where traditional domain adaptation methods often fall short due to high joint error. Additionally, we report improved performance over domain adaptation baselines in well-known tasks such as MNIST-USPS domain adaptation and cross-lingual sentiment analysis.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent Ascent for Finite-Sum Minimax Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02724v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Minimax optimization problems have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their widespread application in numerous machine learning models. To solve the minimax problem, a wide variety of stochastic optimization methods have been proposed. However, most of them ignore the distributed setting where the training data is distributed on multiple workers. In this paper, we developed a novel decentralized stochastic gradient descent ascent method for the finite-sum minimax problem. In particular, by employing the variance-reduced gradient, our method can achieve $O(\frac{\sqrt{n}\kappa^3}{(1-\lambda)^2\epsilon^2})$ sample complexity and $O(\frac{\kappa^3}{(1-\lambda)^2\epsilon^2})$ communication complexity for the nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax problem. As far as we know, our work is the first one to achieve such theoretical complexities for this kind of minimax problem. At last, we apply our method to AUC maximization, and the experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Spectral Estimators for Structured Generalized Linear Models via Approximate Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of parameter estimation in a high-dimensional generalized linear model. Spectral methods obtained via the principal eigenvector of a suitable data-dependent matrix provide a simple yet surprisingly effective solution. However, despite their wide use, a rigorous performance characterization, as well as a principled way to preprocess the data, are available only for unstructured (i.i.d.\ Gaussian and Haar orthogonal) designs. In contrast, real-world data matrices are highly structured and exhibit non-trivial correlations. To address the problem, we consider correlated Gaussian designs capturing the anisotropic nature of the features via a covariance matrix $\Sigma$. Our main result is a precise asymptotic characterization of the performance of spectral estimators. This allows us to identify the optimal preprocessing that minimizes the number of samples needed for parameter estimation. Surprisingly, such preprocessing is universal across a broad set of statistical models, which partly addresses a conjecture on optimal spectral estimators for rotationally invariant designs. Our principled approach vastly improves upon previous heuristic methods, including for designs common in computational imaging and genetics. The proposed methodology, based on approximate message passing, is broadly applicable and opens the way to the precise characterization of spiked matrices and of the corresponding spectral methods in a variety of settings.</description>

      <title>Post-hoc Orthogonalization for Mitigation of Protected Feature Bias in CXR Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To analyze and remove protected feature effects in chest radiograph embeddings of deep learning models. Methods: An orthogonalization is utilized to remove the influence of protected features (e.g., age, sex, race) in CXR embeddings, ensuring feature-independent results. To validate the efficacy of the approach, we retrospectively study the MIMIC and CheXpert datasets using three pre-trained models, namely a supervised contrastive, a self-supervised contrastive, and a baseline classifier model. Our statistical analysis involves comparing the original versus the orthogonalized embeddings by estimating protected feature influences and evaluating the ability to predict race, age, or sex using the two types of embeddings. Results: Our experiments reveal a significant influence of protected features on predictions of pathologies. Applying orthogonalization removes these feature effects. Apart from removing any influence on pathology classification, while maintaining competitive predictive performance, orthogonalized embeddings further make it infeasible to directly predict protected attributes and mitigate subgroup disparities. Conclusion: The presented work demonstrates the successful application and evaluation of the orthogonalization technique in the domain of chest X-ray image classification.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Mixup to Data for Calibration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among all data augmentation techniques proposed so far, linear interpolation of training samples, also called Mixup, has found to be effective for a large panel of applications. Along with improved performance, Mixup is also a good technique for improving calibration and predictive uncertainty. However, mixing data carelessly can lead to manifold intrusion, i.e., conflicts between the synthetic labels assigned and the true label distributions, which can deteriorate calibration. In this work, we argue that the likelihood of manifold intrusion increases with the distance between data to mix. To this end, we propose to dynamically change the underlying distributions of interpolation coefficients depending on the similarity between samples to mix, and define a flexible framework to do so without losing in diversity. We provide extensive experiments for classification and regression tasks, showing that our proposed method improves performance and calibration of models, while being much more efficient. The code for our work is available at https://github.com/qbouniot/sim_kernel_mixup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12244v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In most real-world reinforcement learning applications, state information is only partially observable, which breaks the Markov decision process assumption and leads to inferior performance for algorithms that conflate observations with state. Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), on the other hand, provide a general framework that allows for partial observability to be accounted for in learning, exploration and planning, but presents significant computational and statistical challenges. To address these difficulties, we develop a representation-based perspective that leads to a coherent framework and tractable algorithmic approach for practical reinforcement learning from partial observations. We provide a theoretical analysis for justifying the statistical efficiency of the proposed algorithm, and also empirically demonstrate the proposed algorithm can surpass state-of-the-art performance with partial observations across various benchmarks, advancing reliable reinforcement learning towards more practical applications.</description>

      <title>Fun with Flags: Robust Principal Directions via Flag Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04071v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA), along with its extensions to manifolds and outlier contaminated data, have been indispensable in computer vision and machine learning. In this work, we present a unifying formalism for PCA and its variants, and introduce a framework based on the flags of linear subspaces, ie a hierarchy of nested linear subspaces of increasing dimension, which not only allows for a common implementation but also yields novel variants, not explored previously. We begin by generalizing traditional PCA methods that either maximize variance or minimize reconstruction error. We expand these interpretations to develop a wide array of new dimensionality reduction algorithms by accounting for outliers and the data manifold. To devise a common computational approach, we recast robust and dual forms of PCA as optimization problems on flag manifolds. We then integrate tangent space approximations of principal geodesic analysis (tangent-PCA) into this flag-based framework, creating novel robust and dual geodesic PCA variations. The remarkable flexibility offered by the 'flagification' introduced here enables even more algorithmic variants identified by specific flag types. Last but not least, we propose an effective convergent solver for these flag-formulations employing the Stiefel manifold. Our empirical results on both real-world and synthetic scenarios, demonstrate the superiority of our novel algorithms, especially in terms of robustness to outliers on manifolds.</description>

      <title>(Accelerated) Noise-adaptive Stochastic Heavy-Ball Momentum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic heavy ball momentum (SHB) is commonly used to train machine learning models, and often provides empirical improvements over stochastic gradient descent. By primarily focusing on strongly-convex quadratics, we aim to better understand the theoretical advantage of SHB and subsequently improve the method. For strongly-convex quadratics, Kidambi et al. (2018) show that SHB (with a mini-batch of size $1$) cannot attain accelerated convergence, and hence has no theoretical benefit over SGD. They conjecture that the practical gain of SHB is a by-product of using larger mini-batches. We first substantiate this claim by showing that SHB can attain an accelerated rate when the mini-batch size is larger than a threshold $b^*$ that depends on the condition number $\kappa$. Specifically, we prove that with the same step-size and momentum parameters as in the deterministic setting, SHB with a sufficiently large mini-batch size results in an $O\left(\exp(-\frac{T}{\sqrt{\kappa}}) + \sigma \right)$ convergence, where $T$ is the number of iterations and $\sigma^2$ is the variance in the stochastic gradients. We prove a lower-bound which demonstrates that a $\kappa$ dependence in $b^*$ is necessary. To ensure convergence to the minimizer, we design a noise-adaptive multi-stage algorithm that results in an $O\left(\exp\left(-\frac{T}{\sqrt{\kappa}}\right) + \frac{\sigma}{T}\right)$ rate. We also consider the general smooth, strongly-convex setting and propose the first noise-adaptive SHB variant that converges to the minimizer at an $O(\exp(-\frac{T}{\kappa}) + \frac{\sigma^2}{T})$ rate. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Refined Sample Complexity for Markov Games with Independent Linear Function Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov Games (MG) is an important model for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). It was long believed that the "curse of multi-agents" (i.e., the algorithmic performance drops exponentially with the number of agents) is unavoidable until several recent works (Daskalakis et al., 2023; Cui et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023). While these works resolved the curse of multi-agents, when the state spaces are prohibitively large and (linear) function approximations are deployed, they either had a slower convergence rate of $O(T^{-1/4})$ or brought a polynomial dependency on the number of actions $A_{\max}$ -- which is avoidable in single-agent cases even when the loss functions can arbitrarily vary with time. This paper first refines the AVLPR framework by Wang et al. (2023), with an insight of designing *data-dependent* (i.e., stochastic) pessimistic estimation of the sub-optimality gap, allowing a broader choice of plug-in algorithms. When specialized to MGs with independent linear function approximations, we propose novel *action-dependent bonuses* to cover occasionally extreme estimation errors. With the help of state-of-the-art techniques from the single-agent RL literature, we give the first algorithm that tackles the curse of multi-agents, attains the optimal $O(T^{-1/2})$ convergence rate, and avoids $\text{poly}(A_{\max})$ dependency simultaneously.</description>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds promise as a technology that can be used to improve government and economic policy-making. This paper proposes a new research agenda towards this end by introducing Social Environment Design, a general framework for the use of AI for automated policy-making that connects with the Reinforcement Learning, EconCS, and Computational Social Choice communities. The framework seeks to capture general economic environments, includes voting on policy objectives, and gives a direction for the systematic analysis of government and economic policy through AI simulation. We highlight key open problems for future research in AI-based policy-making. By solving these challenges, we hope to achieve various social welfare objectives, thereby promoting more ethical and responsible decision making.</description>

      <title>Batched Nonparametric Contextual Bandits</title>

Abstract: We study nonparametric contextual bandits under batch constraints, where the expected reward for each action is modeled as a smooth function of covariates, and the policy updates are made at the end of each batch of observations. We establish a minimax regret lower bound for this setting and propose a novel batch learning algorithm that achieves the optimal regret (up to logarithmic factors). In essence, our procedure dynamically splits the covariate space into smaller bins, carefully aligning their widths with the batch size. Our theoretical results suggest that for nonparametric contextual bandits, a nearly constant number of policy updates can attain optimal regret in the fully online setting.</description>

      <title>Signature Kernel Conditional Independence Tests in Causal Discovery for Stochastic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inferring the causal structure underlying stochastic dynamical systems from observational data holds great promise in domains ranging from science and health to finance. Such processes can often be accurately modeled via stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which naturally imply causal relationships via "which variables enter the differential of which other variables". In this paper, we develop a kernel-based test of conditional independence (CI) on "path-space" -- e.g., solutions to SDEs, but applicable beyond that -- by leveraging recent advances in signature kernels. We demonstrate strictly superior performance of our proposed CI test compared to existing approaches on path-space and provide theoretical consistency results. Then, we develop constraint-based causal discovery algorithms for acyclic stochastic dynamical systems (allowing for self-loops) that leverage temporal information to recover the entire directed acyclic graph. Assuming faithfulness and a CI oracle, we show that our algorithms are sound and complete. We empirically verify that our developed CI test in conjunction with the causal discovery algorithms outperform baselines across a range of settings.</description>

      <title>Calibrating doubly-robust estimators with unbalanced treatment assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning methods, particularly the double machine learning (DML) estimator (Chernozhukov et al., 2018), are increasingly popular for the estimation of the average treatment effect (ATE). However, datasets often exhibit unbalanced treatment assignments where only a few observations are treated, leading to unstable propensity score estimations. We propose a simple extension of the DML estimator which undersamples data for propensity score modeling and calibrates scores to match the original distribution. The paper provides theoretical results showing that the estimator retains the DML estimator's asymptotic properties. A simulation study illustrates the finite sample performance of the estimator.</description>

      <title>Black-Box $k$-to-$1$-PCA Reductions: Theory and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03905v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $k$-principal component analysis ($k$-PCA) problem is a fundamental algorithmic primitive that is widely-used in data analysis and dimensionality reduction applications. In statistical settings, the goal of $k$-PCA is to identify a top eigenspace of the covariance matrix of a distribution, which we only have black-box access to via samples. Motivated by these settings, we analyze black-box deflation methods as a framework for designing $k$-PCA algorithms, where we model access to the unknown target matrix via a black-box $1$-PCA oracle which returns an approximate top eigenvector, under two popular notions of approximation. Despite being arguably the most natural reduction-based approach to $k$-PCA algorithm design, such black-box methods, which recursively call a $1$-PCA oracle $k$ times, were previously poorly-understood.
  Our main contribution is significantly sharper bounds on the approximation parameter degradation of deflation methods for $k$-PCA. For a quadratic form notion of approximation we term ePCA (energy PCA), we show deflation methods suffer no parameter loss. For an alternative well-studied approximation notion we term cPCA (correlation PCA), we tightly characterize the parameter regimes where deflation methods are feasible. Moreover, we show that in all feasible regimes, $k$-cPCA deflation algorithms suffer no asymptotic parameter loss for any constant $k$. We apply our framework to obtain state-of-the-art $k$-PCA algorithms robust to dataset contamination, improving prior work in sample complexity by a $\mathsf{poly}(k)$ factor.</description>

      <title>Unified Mechanism-Specific Amplification by Subsampling and Group Privacy Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Amplification by subsampling is one of the main primitives in machine learning with differential privacy (DP): Training a model on random batches instead of complete datasets results in stronger privacy. This is traditionally formalized via mechanism-agnostic subsampling guarantees that express the privacy parameters of a subsampled mechanism as a function of the original mechanism's privacy parameters. We propose the first general framework for deriving mechanism-specific guarantees, which leverage additional information beyond these parameters to more tightly characterize the subsampled mechanism's privacy. Such guarantees are of particular importance for privacy accounting, i.e., tracking privacy over multiple iterations. Overall, our framework based on conditional optimal transport lets us derive existing and novel guarantees for approximate DP, accounting with R\'enyi DP, and accounting with dominating pairs in a unified, principled manner. As an application, we analyze how subsampling affects the privacy of groups of multiple users. Our tight mechanism-specific bounds outperform tight mechanism-agnostic bounds and classic group privacy results.</description>

      <title>Random Features Approximation for Control-Affine Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern data-driven control applications call for flexible nonlinear models that are amenable to principled controller synthesis and realtime feedback. Many nonlinear dynamical systems of interest are control affine. We propose two novel classes of nonlinear feature representations which capture control affine structure while allowing for arbitrary complexity in the state dependence. Our methods make use of random features (RF) approximations, inheriting the expressiveness of kernel methods at a lower computational cost. We formalize the representational capabilities of our methods by showing their relationship to the Affine Dot Product (ADP) kernel proposed by Casta\~neda et al. (2021) and a novel Affine Dense (AD) kernel that we introduce. We further illustrate the utility by presenting a case study of data-driven optimization-based control using control certificate functions (CCF). Simulation experiments on a double pendulum empirically demonstrate the advantages of our methods.</description>
