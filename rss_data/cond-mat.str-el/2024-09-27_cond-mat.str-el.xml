      <title>Topological zero modes and correlation pumping in an engineered Kondo lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological phases of matter provide a flexible platform to engineer unconventional quantum excitations in quantum materials. Beyond single particle topological matter, in systems with strong quantum many-body correlations, many-body effects can be the driving force for non-trivial topology. Here, we propose a one-dimensional engineered Kondo lattice where the emergence of topological excitations is driven by collective many-body Kondo physics. We first show the existence of topological zero modes in this system by solving the interacting model with tensor networks, and demonstrate their robustness against disorder. To unveil the origin of the topological zero modes, we analyze the associated periodic Anderson model showing that it can be mapped to a topological non-Hermitian model, enabling rationalizing the origin of the topological zero modes. We finally show that the topological invariant of the many-body Kondo lattice can be computed with a correlation matrix pumping method directly with the exact quantum many-body wavefunction. Our results provide a strategy to engineer topological Kondo insulators, highlighting quantum magnetism as a driving force in engineering topological matter.</description>

      <title>Fermionic parton theory of Rydberg $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programmable quantum simulators based on neutral atom arrays today offer powerful platforms for studying strongly correlated phases of quantum matter. Here, we employ the projective symmetry group framework to describe the symmetry fractionalization patterns in a topologically ordered $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid (QSL) synthesized in such a Rydberg array on the ruby lattice. By systematically comparing the static structure factors of $\textit{all}$ possible mean-field $\textit{Ans\"atze}$ against density-matrix renormalization group calculations, we identify a promising candidate for the precise $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ QSL realized microscopically. We also present detailed analyses of the dynamical structure factors as a reference for future experiments and showcase how these spin correlations can differentiate between varied QSL $\textit{Ans\"atze}$.</description>

      <title>Detecting axion dynamics on the surface of magnetic topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axions, initially proposed to solve the strong CP problem, have recently gained attention in condensed matter physics, particularly in topological insulators. However, detecting axion dynamics has proven challenging, with no experimental confirmations to date. In this study, we identify the surface of magnetic topological insulators as an ideal platform for observing axion dynamics. The vanishing bulk gap at the surface allows for order $O(1)$ variations in the axion field, making the detection of axion-like phenomena more feasible. In contrast, these phenomena are strongly suppressed in the bulk due to the small magnetic exchange gap. We investigate two-photon decay as a signature of axion dynamics and calculate the branching ratio using a perturbative approach. Our findings reveal that the photon flux emitted from the surface is in-plane and orders of magnitude larger than that from the bulk, making it detectable with modern microwave technology. We also discuss potential material platforms for detecting axion two-photon decay and strategies to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

      <title>LiV2O4: Hund-Assisted Orbital-Selective Mottness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the remarkably small Fermi-liquid coherence scale and large effective mass observed in LiV$_2$O$_4$ are due to the proximity of a Hund-assisted orbital-selective Mott state. Our work is based on an ab initio dynamical mean-field approach, combining several quantum impurity solvers to capture the physics from high to very low temperature. We find that the Hund coupling plays a crucial role in rearranging the orbital populations and in generating the heavy mass and low coherence scale. The latter is found to be approximately 1-2 Kelvin, even though the most correlated orbital is found to be significantly doped ~10% away from half-filling. A flat quasiparticle band appears near the Fermi level as a result of the strong electronic correlations. Finally, we discuss our results in comparison to experiments.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure, spin-orbit interaction and electron-phonon coupling of triangular adatom lattices on semiconductor substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A one-third monolayer of the heavy metals Sn and Pb deposited on semiconductor substrates can lead to a $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ surface reconstruction, constituting an exciting triangular lattice material platform. A long history of experiments identified charge-ordered and magnetic ground states. These discoveries were accompanied by a decades-long debate of whether electron correlations or other effects involving phonons are the driving force of the symmetry-broken states. The most recent discovery of superconductivity in boron-doped Sn/Si(111) with a $T_c$ between 5K and 9K led to a renewed excitement. Here we revisit the electronic and phononic properties of Sn and Pb adatom triangular lattices on Si(111) and SiC(0001). For all materials we compute relativistic bandstructures using DFT+$U$ where $U$ is only applied to the substrate atoms in order to adjust the band gap to match the experimental value; as a consequence, some of the resulting tight-binding parameters of the metallic surface band differ substantially compared to previous studies. Remarkably, for Pb/SiC(0001) we predict Rashba spin-orbit coupling as large as 45% of the nearest-neighbor hopping energy. In addition, we compute the phonon spectra and electron-phonon coupling constants for all materials, and for Pb/Si(111) even relativistically although the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling has surprisingly little effect on the electron-phonon coupling constant. We conclude that the resulting couplings are too weak to account for electron-phonon mediated superconductivity in any of these materials.</description>

      <title>Giant Hall effect in a highly conductive frustrated magnet GdCu$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hall effect is one of the most fundamental but elusive phenomena in condensed matter physics due to the rich variety of underlying mechanisms. Here we report an exceptionally large Hall effect in a frustrated magnet GdCu$_2$ with high conductivity. The Hall conductivity at the base temperature is as high as 4 x 10$^4$ $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$ and shows abrupt sign changes under magnetic fields. Remarkably, the giant Hall effect is rapidly suppressed as the longitudinal conductivity is lowered upon increasing temperature or introducing tiny amount of quenched disorder. Our systematic transport measurements together with neutron scattering measurements and ab initio band calculations indicate that the unusual Hall effect can be understood in terms of spin-splitting induced emergence/disappearance of Fermi pockets as well as skew scattering from spin-chiral cluster fluctuations in a field-polarized state. The present study demonstrates complex interplay among magnetization, spin-dependent electronic structure, and spin fluctuations in producing the giant Hall effect in highly conductive frustrated magnets.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal DC Conductivity in Dirac Nodal Line Semimetals: Intrinsic and Extrinsic Contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nodal line semimetals, a class of topological quantum materials, exhibit a variety of novel phenomena due to their properties, such as bands touching on a one-dimensional line or a ring in the Brillouin zone and drumhead-like surface states. In addition, these semimetals are protected by the combined space-inversion and time-reversal ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry. In this study, we investigate the longitudinal DC conductivity of the Dirac nodal line semimetals for the broken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric system by the mass term. Here, using the quantum kinetic technique, we find the intrinsic (field-driven) and extrinsic (scattering-driven) contributions to the total DC conductivity due to interband effects. Interestingly, the resulting intrinsic conductivity is the Fermi sea contribution, while the extrinsic stems from the Fermi surface contribution. We show that at low chemical potential, the extrinsic part contributes more and dominates over the traditional Drude intraband term, while at the high chemical potential, the intrinsic conductivity contributes. Furthermore, the total DC response due to interband effects saturates at high chemical potential and its strength decreases with increasing mass value. Our findings suggest that the extrinsic contributions are rich enough to understand the overall feature of the response for the three-dimensional system.</description>

      <title>Optical control of spin-splitting in an altermagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulating and controlling the band structure and the spin-splitting in the newly discovered class of magnetic materials known as 'altermagnets' is highly desirable for their application in spintronics. Based on real-time simulations for an interacting multiband tight-binding model, we propose optical excitations as an effective way to selectively control the spin-splitting of an altermagnet. The consistent treatment of electronic interactions and electron-phonon coupling in the model allows for a systematic study of the effect of these interactions on the spin-splitting of the altermagnet in the ground as well as in the excited-state. Our simulations reveal that optical excitations modify the band structure and thus lead to significant changes in the spin-splitting within 50 fs. The relative spin-splitting in the conduction band grows up to four times in the optically excited altermagnet. We disentangle the roles of Coulomb $U$ and $J$ in the enhancement of the spin-splitting in the photoexcited state. Our study elucidates the potential for exploiting optical control of spin-splitting gaps to obtain desirable properties in altermagnets on the fastest possible timescales.</description>

      <title>Loop Algorithm for Quantum Transverse Ising Model in a Longitudinal Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum transverse Ising model and its extensions play a critical role in various fields, such as statistical physics, quantum magnetism, quantum simulations, and mathematical physics. Although it does not suffer from the sign problem in most cases, the corresponding quantum Monte Carlo algorithm performs inefficiently, especially at a large longitudinal field. The main hindrance is the lack of loop update method which can strongly decrease the auto-correlation between Monte Carlo steps. Here, we successfully develop a loop algorithm with a novel merge-unmerge process. It demonstrates a great advantage over the state-of-the-art algorithm when implementing it to simulate the Rydberg atom chain and Kagome qubit ice. This advanced algorithm suits many systems such as Rydberg atom arrays, trapped ions, quantum materials, and quantum annealers.</description>

      <title>Topological chiral superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a mechanism to produce superconductivity by strong purely-repulsive interactions, say in multi-layer graphene. The resulting superconductors break both time-reversal and reflection symmetries in the orbital motion of electrons, and exhibit non-trivial topological order. Our findings suggest that this topological chiral superconductivity is more likely to emerge near or between fully spin-valley polarized metallic phase and Wigner crystal phase. Unlike conventional BCS superconductors in fully spin-valley polarized metals, these topological chiral superconductors are only partially spin-valley polarized, even though the neighboring normal state remains fully spin-valley polarized. The ratios of electron densities associated with different spin-valley quantum numbers are quantized as simple rational numbers. Furthermore, many of these topological chiral superconductors exhibit charge-4 or higher condensation. One of the topological chiral superconductors is in the same phase as the "spin"-triplet $p+ \textrm{i} p$ BCS superconductor, while others are in different phases than any BCS superconductors. The same mechanism is also used to produce anyon superconductivity between fractional anomalous quantum Hall states in the presence of a periodic potential.</description>

      <title>(SPT-)LSM theorems from projective non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Projective symmetries are ubiquitous in quantum lattice models and can be leveraged to constrain their phase diagram and entanglement structure. In this paper, we investigate the consequences of projective algebras formed by non-invertible symmetries and lattice translations in a generalized $1+1$D quantum XY model based on group-valued qudits. This model is specified by a finite group $G$ and enjoys a projective $\mathsf{Rep}(G)\times Z(G)$ and translation symmetry, where symmetry operators obey a projective algebra in the presence of symmetry defects. For invertible symmetries, such projective algebras imply Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomalies. However, this is not generally true for non-invertible symmetries, and we derive a condition on $G$ for the existence of an LSM anomaly. When this condition is not met, we prove that any unique and gapped ground state is necessarily a non-invertible weak symmetry protected topological (SPT) state with non-trivial entanglement, for which we construct an example fixed-point Hamiltonian. The projectivity also affects the dual symmetries after gauging $\mathsf{Rep}(G)\times Z(G)$ sub-symmetries, giving rise to non-Abelian and non-invertible dipole symmetries, as well as non-invertible translations. We complement our analysis with the SymTFT, where the projectivity causes it to be a topological order non-trivially enriched by translations. Throughout the paper, we develop techniques for gauging $\mathsf{Rep}(G)$ symmetry and inserting its symmetry defects on the lattice, which are applicable to other non-invertible symmetries.</description>

      <title>Two-dopant origin of competing stripe and pair formation in Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the physics of the two-dimensional Hubbard model is widely believed to be a key step in achieving a full understanding of high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ cuprate superconductors. In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models' phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling $t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.</description>

      <title>Visualizing Dynamics of Charges and Strings in (2+1)D Lattice Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) can be employed to understand a wide range of phenomena, from elementary particle scattering in high-energy physics to effective descriptions of many-body interactions in materials. Studying dynamical properties of emergent phases can be challenging as it requires solving many-body problems that are generally beyond perturbative limits. We investigate the dynamics of local excitations in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT using a two-dimensional lattice of superconducting qubits. We first construct a simple variational circuit which prepares low-energy states that have a large overlap with the ground state; then we create particles with local gates and simulate their quantum dynamics via a discretized time evolution. As the effective magnetic field is increased, our measurements show signatures of transitioning from deconfined to confined dynamics. For confined excitations, the magnetic field induces a tension in the string connecting them. Our method allows us to experimentally image string dynamics in a (2+1)D LGT from which we uncover two distinct regimes inside the confining phase: for weak confinement the string fluctuates strongly in the transverse direction, while for strong confinement transverse fluctuations are effectively frozen. In addition, we demonstrate a resonance condition at which dynamical string breaking is facilitated. Our LGT implementation on a quantum processor presents a novel set of techniques for investigating emergent particle and string dynamics.</description>

      <title>Spectral gaps of local quantum channels in the weak-dissipation limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of generic chaotic quantum many-body systems with no conservation laws, subject to weak bulk dissipation. It was recently observed [T. Mori, arXiv:2311.10304] that the generator of these dissipative dynamics, a quantum channel $\mathcal{E}$, retains a nonzero gap as the dissipation strength $\gamma \to 0$ if the thermodynamic limit is taken first. We use a hydrodynamic description of operator spreading in the presence of dissipation to estimate the gap of $\mathcal{E}$ as $\gamma \to 0$; to calculate the operator-size distribution of the low-lying eigenmodes of $\mathcal{E}$; and to relate the gap to the long-time decay rates of autocorrelation functions under unitary dynamics. We provide a microscopic derivation of this hydrodynamic perspective for random unitary circuits. We argue that the gap in the $\gamma \to 0$ limit can change nonanalytically as one tunes the parameters of the unitary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Thermalization rates and quantum Ruelle-Pollicott resonances: insights from operator hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In thermalizing many-body quantum systems without conservation laws such as ergodic Floquet and random unitary circuits, local expectation values are predicted to decay to their equilibrium values exponentially quickly. In this work we derive a relationship between said exponential decay rate $\overline{g}$ and the operator spreading properties of a local unitary evolution. A hydrodynamical picture for operator spreading allows us to argue that, for random unitary circuits, $\overline{g}$ is encoded by the leading eigenvalue of a dynamical map obtained by enriching unitary dynamics with dissipation, in the limit of weak dissipation. We argue that the size of the eigenvalue does not depend on the details of this weak dissipation (given mild assumptions on properties of the ergodic dynamics), so long as it only suppresses large operators significantly. Our calculations are based on analytical results for random unitary circuits, but we argue that similar results hold for ergodic Floquet systems. These conjectures are in accordance with existing results which numerically obtain quantum many-body analogues of classical Ruelle-Pollicott resonances [T. Prosen J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 35 L737 (2002), T. Mori, arXiv:2311.10304] by studying unitary evolutions subject to weak dissipation.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-weak spontaneous breaking of 1-form symmetry and intrinsically mixed topological order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological orders in 2+1d are spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) phases of 1-form symmetries in pure states. The notion of symmetry is further enriched in the context of mixed states, where a symmetry can be either ``strong" or ``weak". In this work, we apply a R\'enyi-2 version of the proposed equivalence relation in [Sang, Lessa, Mong, Grover, Wang, &amp; Hsieh, to appear] on density matrices that is slightly finer than two-way channel connectivity. This equivalence relation distinguishes general 1-form strong-to-weak SSB (SW-SSB) states from phases containing pure states, and therefore labels SW-SSB states as ``intrinsically mixed". According to our equivalence relation, two states are equivalent if and only if they are connected to each other by finite Lindbladian evolution that maintains continuously varying, finite R\'enyi-2 Markov length. We then examine a natural setting for finding such density matrices: disordered ensembles. Specifically, we study the toric code with various types of disorders and show that in each case, the ensemble of ground states corresponding to different disorder realizations form a density matrix with different strong and weak SSB patterns of 1-form symmetries, including SW-SSB. Furthermore we show by perturbative calculations that these disordered ensembles form stable ``phases" in the sense that they exist over a finite parameter range, according to our equivalence relation.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of terahertz conductivity in a gated monolayer semiconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional semiconductors and their moir\'e superlattices have emerged as important platforms for investigating correlated electrons. However, many key properties of these systems, such as the frequency-dependent conductivity, remain experimentally inaccessible because of the mesoscopic sample size. Here we report a technique to directly measure the complex conductivity of electrostatically gated two-dimensional semiconductors in the terahertz frequency range. Applying this technique to a WSe2 monolayer encapsulated in hBN, we observe clear Drude-like response between 0.1 and 1 THz, in a density range challenging to access even in DC transport. Our work opens a new avenue for studying tunable van der Waals heterostructures using terahertz spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Entropic selection of magnetization in a frustrated 2D magnetic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the magnetic ground state and properties of a frustrated two-dimensional classical Heisenberg model of interacting hexagonal clusters of spins. The energy of the ground states is found exactly for arbitrary values of $J_1$ (intra-cluster couplings) and $J_2$ (inter-cluster couplings). Our main results concern a frustrated region of the phase diagram, where we show that the set of ground states has a degeneracy larger than that due to global rotation symmetry. Furthermore, the ground state manifold does not have a fixed total magnetization~: there is a range of allowed values. At finite temperature, our Monte-Carlo simulations show that the entropy selects the most probable value of the total magnetization, while the histogram of the Monte-Carlo time series is non-trivial. This model is a first step towards modelling properties of a class of frustrated magnetic structures composed of coupled spin clusters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions (QED$_3$) with two Dirac fermions displays time reversal symmetry, nontrivial SPT phases and anomalies. The fate of this theory in its strongly coupled regime has been debated extensively. Surprisingly, we find that gluing together the phase diagrams of two standard Wilson-Fisher $O(4)$ theories suffices to reproduce all the SPT phases, anomalies, and semi-classical limits. A central mechanism behind it is ``SPT absorption''. The patching of the $O(4)$ transitions makes very concrete predictions for the behavior of the theory in its strongly coupled limits; for instance, the $\theta=\pi$ sigma model with $S^3$ topology appears due to monopole condensation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14916v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ a protocol, dubbed entanglement microscopy, to reveal the multipartite entanglement encoded in the full reduced density matrix of microscopic subregion both in spin and fermionic many-body systems. We exemplify our method by studying the phase diagram near quantum critical points (QCP) in 2 spatial dimensions: the transverse field Ising model and a Gross-Neveu-Yukawa transition of Dirac fermions. Our main results are: i) the Ising QCP exhibits short-range entanglement with a finite sudden death of the LN both in space and temperature; ii) the Gross-Neveu QCP has a power-law decaying fermionic LN consistent with conformal field theory (CFT) exponents; iii) going beyond bipartite entanglement, we find no detectable 3-party entanglement with our two witnesses in a large parameter window near the Ising QCP in 2d, in contrast to 1d. We further establish the singular scaling of general multipartite entanglement measures at criticality, and present an explicit analysis in the tripartite case. We also analytically obtain the large-temperature power-law scaling of the fermionic LN for general interacting systems. Entanglement microscopy opens a rich window into quantum matter, with countless systems waiting to be explored.</description>

      <title>A Noisy Approach to Intrinsically Mixed-State Topological Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13879v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for studying two-dimensional (2D) topologically ordered states subject to local correlated errors and show that the resulting mixed-state can display intrinsically mixed-state topological order (imTO) -- topological order which is not expected to occur in the ground state of 2D local gapped Hamiltonians. Specifically, we show that decoherence, previously interpreted as anyon condensation in a doubled Hilbert space, is more naturally phrased as, and provides a physical mechanism for, ``gauging out" anyons in the original Hilbert space. We find that gauging out anyons generically results in imTO, with the decohered mixed-state strongly symmetric under certain anomalous 1-form symmetries. This framework lays bare a striking connection between the decohered density matrix and topological subsystem codes, which can appear as anomalous surface states of 3D topological orders. Through a series of examples, we show that the decohered state can display a classical memory, encode logical qubits (i.e., exhibit a quantum memory), and even host chiral or non-modular topological order. We argue that a partial classification of imTO is given in terms of non-modular braided fusion categories.</description>

      <title>Imaging quantum interference in a monolayer Kitaev quantum spin liquid candidate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single atomic defects are prominent windows to look into host quantum states because collective responses from the host states emerge as localized states around the defects. Friedel oscillations and Kondo clouds in Fermi liquids are quintessential examples. However, the situation is quite different for quantum spin liquid (QSL), an exotic state of matter with fractionalized quasiparticles and topological order arising from a profound impact of quantum entanglement. Elucidating the underlying local electronic property has been challenging due to the charge neutrality of fractionalized quasiparticles and the insulating nature of QSLs. Here, using spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy, we report atomically resolved images of monolayer $\alpha-RuCl_3$, the most promising Kitaev QSL candidate, on metallic substrates. We find quantum interference in the insulator manifesting as incommensurate and decaying spatial oscillations of the local density of states around defects with a characteristic bias dependence. The oscillation differs from any known spatial structures in its nature and does not exist in other Mott insulators, implying it is an exotic oscillation involved with excitations unique to $\alpha-RuCl_3$. Numerical simulations suggest that the observed oscillation can be reproduced by assuming that itinerant Majorana fermions of Kitaev QSL are scattered across the Majorana Fermi surface. The oscillation provides a new approach to exploring Kitaev QSLs through the local response against defects like Friedel oscillations in metals.</description>

Abstract: We show that the standard 1+1d $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ cluster model has a non-invertible global symmetry, described by the fusion category Rep(D$_8$). Therefore, the cluster state is not only a $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase, but also a non-invertible SPT phase. We further find two new commuting Pauli Hamiltonians for the other two Rep(D$_8$) SPT phases on a tensor product Hilbert space of qubits, matching the classification in field theory and mathematics. We identify the edge modes and the local projective algebras at the interfaces between these non-invertible SPT phases. Finally, we show that there does not exist a symmetric entangler that maps between these distinct SPT states.</description>

      <title>Probing phase transition and underlying symmetry breaking via entanglement entropy scanning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using entanglement entropy (EE) to probe the intrinsic physics of the novel phases and phase transitions in quantum many-body systems is an important but challenging topic in condensed matter physics. Thanks to our newly developed bipartite-reweight-annealing algorithm, we can systematically study EE behaviors near both first and second-order phase transition points of two-dimensional strongly correlated systems by scanning the EE across a large parameter region, which was super difficult previously due to the huge computation resources demanded. Interestingly, we find that the EE or its derivative diverges at the critical point, which essentially reveals the phase transition involving discrete or continuous symmetry breaking. What's more, we observe that the peak of the EE curve can detect first-order phase transitions at high symmetry breaking points, separating phases with lower symmetry broken. This behavior also applies to the symmetry-enhanced first-order phase transition in the two-dimensional chequerboard $J-Q$ model, where the emergent higher symmetry arises from the related deconfined criticality beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. This work points to new phenomena and mechanisms that can help us better identify different phase transitions and the underlying symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Defining a universal sign to strictly probe a phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12438v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mystery of the infamous sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo simulations mightily restricts applications of the method in fermionic and frustrated systems. A recent work [Science 375, 418 (2022)] made a remarkable breakthrough in the sign problem by pointing out that the sign can be used to probe phase transition. In this work, we proposed a general argument based on the definition of the sign that is related to the difference in free energy between the original and reference systems to clarify that the sign problem and phase transition cannot always be strictly related. The sign can exactly probe phase transition only if the free energy in the reference system is flat under variable parameters, which is almost impossible to design. Generally speaking, the conclusion that the sign can probe phase transition is survivorship bias without universality. To solve this problem, we define a modified sign that excludes the influence of the reference system, which can probe the phase transition strictly. The work gives an unbiased solution for detecting phase transition by the new modified sign.</description>

      <title>Gr\"uneisen parameter as an entanglement compass and the breakdown of the Hellmann-Feynman theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gr\"uneisen ratio $\Gamma$, i.e., the singular part of the ratio of thermal expansion to the specific heat, has been broadly employed to explore both finite-$T$ and quantum critical points (QCPs). For a genuine quantum phase transition (QPT), thermal fluctuations are absent and thus the thermodynamic $\Gamma$ cannot be employed. We propose a quantum analogue to $\Gamma$ that computes entanglement as a function of a tuning parameter $\lambda$ and show that QPTs take place only for systems in which the ground-state energy depends on $\lambda$ non-linearly. Furthermore, we demonstrate the breakdown of the Hellmann-Feynman theorem in the thermodynamic limit at any QCP. We showcase our approach using the quantum 1D Ising model with transverse field and Kane's quantum computer. The slowing down of the dynamics and thus the "creation of mass" close to any QCP/QPT is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative study of quantum many-body correlation effects in neutron stars: Equation of state</title>

Abstract: Although neutron stars have been studied for decades, their internal structure remains enigmatic, mainly due to large uncertainties in the equation of state. In neutron stars, the nucleons are strongly interacting by exchanging mesons, which can lead to significant quantum many-body correlation effects. Mean-field calculations failed to capture these effects. Here, we develop a nonperturbative quantum field-theoretic approach to handle strongly correlated dense nuclear matter within the framework of quantum hadrodynamics. We show that the many-body effects can be incorporated in the Dyson-Schwinger equation of the nucleon propagator. Based on a linear $\sigma$-$\omega$-$\rho$ model, we successfully reproduce six empirical observable quantities of saturation nuclear matter by tuning six parameters. After including the many-body effects into the equation of state of realistic neutron star matter, we obtain a mass-radius relation that is comparable with recent astrophysical observations of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Relaxed hydrodynamic theory of electrically driven non-equilibrium steady states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The capability of hydrodynamics to accurately describe slow and long-wavelength fluctuations around non-equilibrium steady states (NESS), characterized by a stationary flow of energy or matter in the presence of a driving force, remains an open question. In this study, we explicitly construct a hydrodynamic description of electrically driven non-equilibrium charged steady states \new{in the limit in which the relaxation of the first non-hydrodynamic excitation is parametrically slow}. Our approach involves introducing gapped modes and extending the effective description into a relaxed hydrodynamic theory (RHT). Leveraging the gauge-gravity duality as a tool for controlled computations within non-equilibrium systems, we establish an ultraviolet complete model for these NESS that confirms the validity of our RHT. In summary, our findings provide a concrete realization of the validity of hydrodynamics beyond thermal equilibrium, offering valuable insights into the dynamics of non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Simulating graphene-based single-electron transistor: incoherent current effects due to the presence of electron-electron interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Carbon-based nanostructures have unparalleled electronic properties. At the same time, using an allotrope of carbon as the contacts can yield better device control and reproducibility. In this work, we simulate a single-electron transistor composed of a segment of a graphene nanoribbon coupled to carbon nanotubes electrodes. Using the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism we atomistically describe the electronic transport properties of the system including electron-electron interactions. Using this methodology we are able to recover experimentally observed phenomena, such as the Coulomb blockade, as well as the corresponding Coulomb diamonds. Furthermore, we are able to separate the different contributions to transport and show that incoherent effects due to the interaction play a crucial role in the transport properties depending on the region of the stability diagram being considered.</description>

      <title>Displacive Jahn--Teller transition in NaNiO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01267v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Below its Jahn--Teller transition temperature, $T_\mathrm{JT}$, NaNiO$_2$ has a monoclinic layered structure consisting of alternating layers of edge-sharing NaO$_6$ and Jahn-Teller-distorted NiO$_6$ octahedra. Above $T_\mathrm{JT}$ where NaNiO$_2$ is rhombohedral, diffraction measurements show the absence of a cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion, accompanied by an increase in the unit cell volume. Using neutron total scattering, solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) experiments as local probes of the structure we find direct evidence for a displacive, as opposed to order-disorder Jahn-Teller transition at $T_\mathrm{JT}$. This is supported by \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. To our knowledge this study is the first to show a displacive Jahn-Teller transition in any material using direct observations with local probe techniques.</description>

      <title>Rotations, Negative Eigenvalues, and Newton Method in Tensor Network Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10312v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the tensor network approach to statistical physics, properties of the critical point of a 2D lattice model are encoded by a four-legged tensor which is a fixed point of an RG map. The traditional way to find the fixed point tensor consists in iterating the RG map after having tuned the temperature to criticality. Here we develop a different and more direct technique, which solves the fixed point equation via the Newton method. This is challenging due to the existence of marginal deformations -- linear transformations of the coordinate frame, which parametrize a two-dimensional family of fixed points. We address this challenge by including a 90 degree rotation into the RG map. This flips the sign of the problematic marginal eigenvalues, rendering the fixed point isolated and accessible via the Newton method. We demonstrate the power of this technique via explicit computations for the 2D Ising model. Using the Gilt-TNR algorithm at bond dimension $\chi=30$, we find the fixed point tensor with $10^{-9}$ accuracy, much higher than what was previously achieved.</description>

      <title>Quest for nuclear quadrupole relaxation in HgCa$_{2}$Ba$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derived a simple reduced form from the exact solution of the mixed magnetic and quadrupolar nuclear spin-lattice relaxation function at the central transition line of a quadrupole-split NMR spectrum for nuclear spin $I$ = 3/2. From the application of the reduced form to the $^{63}$Cu nuclear spin-lattice relaxation curves in the high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ superconductors of $^{63}$Cu-enriched triple-layer HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{\delta}$, we estimated the nuclear electric quadrupole spin-lattice relaxation rate $^{63}W_Q$ and the upper limit.</description>
