      <title>Development of a linac-based LEPD experimental station for surface structure analysis and coordination with synchrotron radiation ARPES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the development of a low-energy positron diffraction (LEPD) experimental station for surface structure analysis using a linac-based slow-positron beam. LEPD, the positron counterpart of low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), offers higher accuracy in surface structure determination. The station enables acquisition of LEPD I-V curves within a few hours, allowing measurements before surface degradation occurs. It consists of two ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chambers: one for sample preparation and the other for LEPD observations. The preparation chamber includes an Ar+ sputtering system, a triple-pocket electron beam evaporator, three gas introduction systems, additional user-configurable ports, and a LEED/Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) system. Sample manipulators enable rapid cooling, precise positioning, and orientation adjustments. In the preparation chamber, the manipulator also supports direct current heating up to 1200 {\deg}C. The sample holder is compatible with the LEPD station at SPF-A4 and the ARPES station at PF BL-13B, both located at the Tsukuba campus of the Institute of Materials Structure Science (IMSS), KEK. Design concepts and experimental demonstrations are presented.</description>

      <title>NIOS II Soft-Core Processor and Ethernet Controller Solution for RPC-DAQ in INO ICAL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a high-performance Soft-Core Processor based data acquisition system designed for handling Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs). The DAQ consist of FPGA-based hardware equipped with Soft-Core Processor and embedded hardwired Ethernet controllers named RPC-DAQ, offering a versatile and fast network-enabled data acquisition solution. A soft processor, NIOS, is instantiated within an Intel Cyclone IV FPGA, overseeing control, communication, and data transfer with remote processing units. These integrated RPC-DAQ units, in substantial numbers, connect to a limited set of high-end processing units via LAN switches. This paper provides a detailed account of the software implementation scheme for the NIOS processor in the RPC-DAQ system. A remarkable 28,800 RPC-DAQ units will be deployed in proximity to the RPCs, serving the proposed INO-ICAL experiment in Theni-Madurai, Tamil Nadu. The network-enabled RPC-DAQ units controlled by the soft processor offloads FPGA tasks including event data acquisition, periodic health monitoring of RPCs, command interfaces, high voltage control, and data transfer to back-end data concentrators. Communication and data transfer are executed efficiently via TCP and UDP protocols over a 100 Mbps Ethernet interface. This system provides innovative solutions to improve data acquisition and control in large-scale scientific experiments.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Monte Carlo Simulation Tool on Electron Transport in Noble Gases and Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the particle detectors based on noble gases or liquids, it is essential to understand the transport dynamic and the properties of the electrons. We report the development of a tool for electron transport in noble gases He, Ne, Ar, Kr, or Xe, and liquids Ar, Kr, or Xe. The simulation, implemented in C++ and MATLAB, is based on electron-atom collisions, including elastic scattering, excitation and ionization. We validate the program through assessing the electron's swarm parameters, specifically the drift velocity and the diffusion coefficient. For electron transport in liquids, two models are discussed and both are used for the construction of the Monte Carlo framework based on the Cohen Leker theory. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the simulation tool, which offers a valuable support for detector design and data analysis.</description>

      <title>Design and construction of the multiplexing cold neutron spectrometer BOYA with double-column Rowland focusing analyzers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing neutron spectrometers with higher counting efficiency has been an essential pursuit in neutron instrumentation. In this work, we present BOYA, a multiplexing cold neutron spectrometers designed and implemented at the China Advanced Research Reactor. Equipped with 34 angular analyzing channels spanning 119{\deg}, each containing 5 inelastic channels and 1 diffraction channel, BOYA enhances the measurement efficiency by two orders of magnitude over a traditional triple-axis spectrometer. To optimize both intensity and energy resolution, innovative double-column Rowland focusing analyzers have been developed. By filling the crystal gaps in the traditional Rowland focusing geometry, our design enhances the neutron beam coverage without introducing appreciable double-scattering. Our commissioning results on vanadium and MnWO4 have confirmed the success of the design, establishing BOYA as a successful multiplexing instrument for neutron spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Calorimetric Wire Detector for Measurement of Atomic Hydrogen Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A calorimetric detector for minimally disruptive measurements of atomic hydrogen beams is described. The calorimeter measures heat released by the recombination of hydrogen atoms into molecules on a thin wire. As a demonstration, the angular distribution of a beam with a peak intensity of $\approx 10^{16} \,{\rm{atoms}}/{(\rm{cm}^2 \rm{s})}$ is measured by translating the wire across the beam. The data agree well with an analytic model of the beam from the thermal hydrogen atom source. Using the beam shape model, the relative intensity of the beam can be determined to 5% precision or better at any angle.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Measurements of the Magnetic Flux Density in Steel Blocks of the Compact Muon Solenoid Magnet Yoke with Solenoid Coil Fast Discharges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN is used to study the production of new particles in proton-proton collisions at a center of mass energy of 13.6 TeV. The detector includes a magnet based on a 6 m diameter superconducting coil operating at a current of 18.164 kA. This current creates a central magnetic flux density of 3.8 T that allows for the high-precision measurement of the momenta of the produced charged particles using tracking and muon subdetectors. The CMS magnet contains a 10,000 ton flux-return yoke made from the construction steel blocks. These blocks are magnetized, with the coil returned magnetic flux and wrap the muons escaping the hadronic calorimeters. To describe the distribution of the magnetic flux in the magnet yoke layers, a three-dimensional computer model of the CMS magnet is used. To validate the calculations, special measurements are performed, with the flux loops wound in 22 cross-sections of the flux-return yoke blocks. The measured voltages induced in the flux loops during the CMS magnet current variations, are integrated over time to obtain the initial magnetic flux densities in the flux loop cross-sections. In the last time, three fast discharges occurred during the standard ramp-downs of the magnet. This allows us to single out the contributions of the eddy currents, induced in steel, to the flux loop voltages. Accounting for these contributions to the flux loop measurements during intentionally triggered fast discharges in 2006 allows us to perform the validation of the CMS magnet computer model with better precision. The technique for the flux loop measurements and the obtained results are presented and discussed. The method for measuring magnetic flux density in steel blocks described in this study is innovative.</description>

      <title>Deep learning optimal molecular scintillators for dark matter direct detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct searches for sub-GeV dark matter are limited by the intrinsic quantum properties of the target material. In this proof-of-concept study, we argue that this problem is particularly well suited for machine learning. We demonstrate that a simple neural architecture consisting of a variational autoencoder and a multi-layer perceptron can efficiently generate unique molecules with desired properties. In specific, the energy threshold and signal (quantum) efficiency determine the minimum mass and cross section to which a detector can be sensitive. Organic molecules present a particularly interesting class of materials with intrinsically anisotropic electronic responses and $\mathcal{O}$(few) eV excitation energies. However, the space of possible organic compounds is intractably large, which makes traditional database screening challenging. We adopt excitation energies and proxy transition matrix elements as target properties learned by our network. Our model is able to generate molecules that are not in even the most expansive quantum chemistry databases and predict their relevant properties for high-throughput and efficient screening. Following a massive generation of novel molecules, we use clustering analysis to identify some of the most promising molecular structures that optimise the desired molecular properties for dark matter detection.</description>

Abstract: This paper implies Bluetooth technology, which is put into effect to alter extant, wired into wireless Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). Here two Bluetooth devices are employed as a transceiver to transmit and receives the input signal to contrive wireless PLC. The main advantage of PLC is to control the output according to the status of input. In Bluetooth technology, the handshaking between the two Bluetooth modules takes place, which is interfaced with a microcontroller board (Arduino board) and then to PLC such that field devices can be controlled without wire.</description>

      <title>Performance Variance of Low Noise Resonant Capacitance Bridges While Replacing their Ungapped MnZn Ferrite Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision AC resonant capacitance bridges, with a planar printed circuit board transformer using an ungapped MnZn ferrite core, have shown excellent noise performance in high-precision measurements. As many applications use an ensemble of bridges, consistency of performance is critical to the functionality of the systems. If part of the same manufacturing batch and scaled to the same frequency, the noise performance of the ferrite cores at 293 K has a weighted mean variance of &lt;0.3%, with all the cores within a +/- 1% band. At 140 K the weighted mean variance is &lt;0.6% and the 90% inclusion band is +/- 1.5%. Ten cores of SIFERRIT Material N41, from TDK Ferrites Accessories, were tested at room temperature, 293 K, and in a liquid nitrogen dewar at 140 K. Fitted to a parabolic function, to + 3dB on both frequency sides, the weighted mean of the noise minima at 293 K was 0.3027 aF/rtHz, with a variance of 0.0012 aF/rtHz spanning a frequency range of 85.0 +/- 2.7 kHz. Scaled to 100 kHz, the weighted mean and variance were 0.2788 aF/rtHz and 0.0008 aF/rtHz. Corresponding noise values at 140 K were 0.1815 aF/rtHz with a variance of 0.0016 aF/rtHz for the range of 152.7 +/- 6.3 kHz, and 0.1835 aF/rtHz with a variance of 0.0011 aF/rtHz when scaled to 150 kHz. Scaled for resonant frequency and temperature these results are consistent with a previous measurement of another ungapped core (same supplier and type, different manufacturing batch) to within 9% and 6% at 293 K and 140 K respectively.</description>

      <title>Energy reconstruction and calibration techniques of the DUNE LArTPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) technology is currently a preferred choice for neutrino experiments and beyond the standard model physics searches such as nucleon decay and dark matter. The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) will employ the LArTPC technology at a large scale for physics programs, benefiting from its large target mass and excellent imaging, tracking, and particle identification capabilities. In DUNE, accurate energy reconstruction is important for precisely measuring CP violation, determining neutrino mass ordering and fully utilising the detector's potential. The energy calibration techniques developed for the DUNE far detector (FD) horizontal drift are presented here, utilising stopping cosmic-ray muons and validating the methods with the stopping pions and protons. The study demonstrates the versatility of the calibration techniques, applicable to other LArTPC, and valid for different particles. The electromagnetic shower energy reconstruction from $\pi^{0} \rightarrow 2\gamma$ events and the subsequent reconstruction of $\pi^{0}$ mass are also presented. These are important calibrations which address the measurement of energy loss in the DUNE FD volume and are critical for achieving the exciting physics goals of the experiment.</description>
