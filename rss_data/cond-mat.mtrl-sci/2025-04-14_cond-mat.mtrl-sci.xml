      <title>Volatile and Nonvolatile Resistive Switching in Lateral 2D Molybdenum Disulfide-Based Memristive Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing electronic devices capable of emulating biological functions is essential for advancing brain-inspired computation paradigms such as neuromorphic computing. In recent years, two-dimensional materials have emerged as promising candidates for neuromorphic electronic devices. This work addresses the coexistence of volatile and nonvolatile resistive switching in lateral memristors based on molybdenum disulfide with silver as the active electrode. The fabricated devices exhibited switching voltages of ~0.16 V and ~0.52 V for volatile and nonvolatile operation, respectively, under direct-current measurements. They also displayed the essential synaptic functions of paired-pulse facilitation and short- and long-term plasticity under pulse stimulation. The operation mechanism was investigated by in-situ transmission electron microscopy, which showed lateral migration of silver ions along the molybdenum disulfide between electrodes. Based on the experimental data, a macroscopic semi-classical electron transport model was used to reproduce the current-voltage characteristics and support the proposed underlying switching mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the dynamics of conductive filaments in MoS${_2}$ based memristors by operando transmission electron microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced operando transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques enable the observation of nanoscale phenomena in electrical devices during operation. They can be used to study the switching mechanisms in two-dimensional (2D) materials-based memristive devices, which is crucial to tailor their operating regimes and improve reliability and variability. Here, we investigate lateral memristive devices composed of 2D layered molybdenum disulfide (MoS${_2}$) with palladium (Pd) and silver (Ag) electrodes. We visualized the formation and migration of Ag conductive filaments (CFs) between the two electrodes under external bias voltage and their complete dissolution upon reversing the bias voltage polarity. The CFs exhibited a wide range of sizes, ranging from several {\AA}ngstr\"oms to tens of nanometers, and followed diverse pathways: along the MoS${_2}$ surfaces, within the van der Waals gap between MoS${_2}$ layers, and through the spacing between MoS${_2}$ bundles. Notably, the Ag electrode functioned as a reservoir for the CFs, as evidenced by the shrinking and growing of the Ag electrode upon switching. Our method enabled correlating the current-voltage responses with real-time TEM imaging, offering insights into failed and anomalous switching behavior, and providing clarity on the cycle-to-cycle variabilities. Our findings provide solid evidence for the electrochemical metallization mechanism, elucidate the formation dynamics of CFs, and reveal key parameters influencing the switching performance. Our approach can be extended to investigate similar memristive devices.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast dynamics of ferroelectric polarization of NbOI$_{2}$ captured with femtosecond electron diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric materials like NbOI$_{2}$ have garnered significant interest, yet their temporal response and synergetic interaction with light remain underexplored. Previous studies on the polarization of oxide ferroelectrics have relied on time-resolved optical second harmonic generation or ultrafast X-ray scattering. Here, we probe the laser-induced polarization dynamics of 2D NbOI$_{2}$ nanocrystals using ultrafast transmission electron diffraction and deflectometry. The deflection of the electron pulses is directly sensitive to the changes in the polarization, while the diffraction signal captures the structural evolution. Excited with a UV laser pulse, the polarization of NbOI$_{2}$ is initially suppressed for two picoseconds, then it recovers and overshoots, leading to a transiently enhanced polarization persisting for over 200 ps. This recovery coincides with coherent acoustic phonon generation, triggering a piezoresponse in the NbOI$_{2}$ nanocrystals. Our results offer a new method for sensing the ferroelectric order parameter in femtosecond time scales.</description>

      <title>Band gap tuning by structural phase transition in Sm-substituted BiFeO3 powders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The substitution of bismuth by samarium in BiFeO3 is known to induce a structural phase transition from the polar phase to a non-polar phase, with a possible antiferroelectric intermediate structure. In this paper, we investigate the impact of this phase change on the optical properties. The optical band gap was measured by diffuse reflectance as a function of temperature for several samarium concentrations across the structural phase transition. We found that the optical band gap for each of the pure phases varies linearly with temperature and that the phase transitions are revealed by smooth transitions between those linear regimes. This allows us to quantify the contribution of the structural change in the optical absorption. We find that a difference in optical band gap of about 130meV can be attributed to the phase change. We anticipate that the same change could be obtained by applying an electric field in an antiferroelectric composition.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional perovskites with maximum symmetry enable exciton diffusion length exceeding 2 micrometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing semiconductors with high symmetry of their crystallographic structures has been a virtue of inorganic materials and has resulted in novel physical behaviors. In contrast, hybrid (organic and inorganic) crystals such as two-dimensional metal halide perovskites exhibit much lower crystal symmetry due to in-plane or out of plane octahedral distortions. Despite their amazing ability for photoinduced light emission at room temperature, the Achilles' heel of this attractive class of 2D materials for optoelectronics remains the poor control and lack of performance for charge carrier transport. Inspired by the tremendous charge carrier properties of the 3D cubic perovskite phase of FAPbI3 and combining the use of the appropriate cage cation, the spacer molecule and the temperature and rate of crystallization, we report a new series of FA-based layered two-dimensional perovskites that exhibits the highest theoretically predicted symmetry with a tetragonal P4/mmm space group, resulting in no octahedral distortion in both in-plane and out-of-plane directions. These 2D perovskites present the shortest interlayer distances (4 angstrom), which results in systematically lower bandgaps (1.7 to 1.8 eV). Finally, the absence of octahedral distortions, results in an exciton diffusion length of 2.5 {\mu}m, and a diffusivity of 4.4 cm2s-1, both of which are an order of magnitude larger compared to previously reported 2D perovskites and on par with monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Structural Control of Atomic Silicon Wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bare Si(100)-2$\times$1 surface atoms exhibit a buckled structure where one Si atom in a dimer is lowered while the other is raised, leading to two possible buckling configurations equivalent in energy. The relatively low energy barrier between these configurations allows dimers to flip rapidly and uncontrollably unless stabilized by surface defects or observed at low temperatures due to reduced thermal energy using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). This rapid flipping results in a time-averaged symmetric appearance under STM. In this study, we investigated variable length buckled dimer wires on the hydrogenated Si(100) surface composed of silicon dangling bonds for the first time. We demonstrate that on degenerate p-type silicon at 4.5 K, the rapid switching of these dimers can be frozen at low scanning biases. It is shown that the stability of a fixed buckled configuration increases with wire length. Such buckled wires can however be controllably flipped using a bias pulse. A line as long as 37 dimers was repeatedly uniformly flipped by a single pulse delivered near one terminus of the wire. The tip-directed flipping of a particular wire does not switch adjacent wires, suggesting binary wires can make well isolated rewritable binary memory elements. Furthermore, at sufficiently high biases switching generates telegraph noise that could be of utility for random number generation. The integration and encapsulation of these wires with previously described silicon dangling bond-made logic gates and binary wires might allow for self contained actuation and readout without requiring any role of an STM tip.</description>

      <title>Contrasting Light-Induced Spin Torque in Antiferromagnetic and Altermagnetic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-matter interaction has become one of the promising routes to manipulating various physical feature of quantum materials in an ultrafast kinetics. In this work, we focus on the nonlinear optical effects of the spintronic behavior in antiferromagnetic (AFM) and altermagnetic (AM) systems with compensated magnetic moments, which has been extensively attractive for their potential applications. With vanishing net magnetic moments, one of the main concerns is how to distinguish and disentangle AFMs and AMs in experiments, as they usually behave similarly in many susceptibility measurements. To address this challenge, we propose that linearly polarized light could trigger contrasting nonequilibrium local spin torques in these systems, unravelling hidden light-induced spintronic behaviors. In general, one could achieve light-induced spin canting in AMs, while only Neel vector torques in AFMs. We scrutinize and enumerate their symmetry constraints of all 122 magnetic point groups. We also adopt low energy Hamiltonian models and first-principles calculations on two representative materials to illustrate our theory. Our work provides a new perspective for the design and optimization of spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Laser-driven solid-state synthesis of high-entropy oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vast compositional and structural landscape of high-entropy oxides (HEOs) grants them a wide range of potentially valuable physicochemical properties. However, the elemental immiscibility and crystal complexity limit their controllable synthesis. Here, we report a laser-driven solid-state synthesis technique that enables high-throughput production of HEOs with different crystal structures, including rock-salt, perovskite, spinel, fluorite, pyrochlore, tantalate, and silicate, incorporating up to 20 cationic elements. Typically, we successfully synthesize all types of high-entropy rare-earth disilicates (HEREDs), including A-, {\alpha}-, \b{eta}-, {\gamma}-, {\delta}-, F-, and G-type phase structures, with up to 15 rare-earth elements in the A site and 5 transition-metal elements in the B site. Benefiting from their unique G-type phase structure and 20-cation composition, HEREDs are endowed with the new functionality of microwave absorption (effective absorption bandwidth of 4.3 GHz). Our work not only realizes the controllable synthesis of HEOs with vast compositional and structural space but also offers them new physicochemical properties, making them highly promising for a diverse array of structural and functional applications.</description>

      <title>Determining 3D atomic coordinates of light-element quantum materials using ptychographic electron tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding quantum materials at the atomic scale requires precise 3D characterization of atomic positions and crystal defects. However, resolving the 3D structure of light-element materials (Z &lt;= 8) remains a major challenge due to their low contrast and beam damage in electron microscopy. Here, we demonstrate ptychographic atomic electron tomography (pAET), achieving sub-angstrom 3D atomic precision (11 pm) in light elements, marking the first-ever experimental realization of 3D atomic imaging for light-element materials. Using twisted bilayer graphene as a model system, we determine the 3D atomic coordinates of individual carbon atoms, revealing chiral lattice distortions driven by van der Waals interactions that exhibit meron-like and skyrmion-like structures. These findings provide direct insights into the interplay between 3D chiral lattice deformation and electronic properties in moire materials. Beyond TBG, pAET offers a transformative approach for 3D atomic-scale imaging across quantum materials, 2D heterostructures, functional oxides, and energy materials.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Multi-Objective Collaborative Optimization of Doped Thermoelectric Materials via Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermoelectric performance of materials exhibits complex nonlinear dependencies on both elemental types and their proportions, rendering traditional trial-and-error approaches inefficient and time-consuming for material discovery. In this work, we present a deep learning model capable of accurately predicting thermoelectric properties of doped materials directly from their chemical formulas, achieving state-of-the-art performance. To enhance interpretability, we further incorporate sensitivity analysis techniques to elucidate how physical descriptors affect the thermoelectric figure of merit (zT). Moreover, we establish a coupled framework that integrates a surrogate model with a multi-objective genetic algorithm to efficiently explore the vast compositional space for high-performance candidates. Experimental validation confirms the discovery of a novel thermoelectric material with superior $zT$ values in the medium-temperature regime.</description>

      <title>Role of Heat Transport in All-Optical Helicity-Independent Magnetization Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-shot all-optical helicity independent switching processes are investigated using advanced micromagnetic modeling in a ferrimagnetic thin film embedded in a multilayer stack. Building on recent experimental findings, our multiscale simulations realistically account for heat transport in the stack, focusing on the influence of a metallic copper underlayer with varying thickness. We analyze how this thermal transport affects the final magnetic state of the ferrimagnet as a function of both the laser pulse duration and fluence. Our results reproduce the experimentally observed switching behaviors and elucidate the physical mechanisms that govern the emergence of three distinct final magnetic states. In particular, we demonstrate how these states are critically influenced by the thickness of the underlying copper layer.</description>

      <title>Circular dichroism in resonant photoelectron diffraction as a direct probe of sublattice magnetization in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets are a new class of materials, which are promising for spintronics applications, but the experimental proof of a finite sublattice magnetisation is often difficult. Here it is shown that in altermagnets, there exists a large magnetic circular dichroism (CD) in the resonant photoelectron diffraction (RPED) pattern. RPED calculations are performed for MnTe at the Mn L$_{2,3}$-edge resonance, using a combination of atomic multiplet and multiple scattering theory. A large CD of purely magnetic origin is found for light helicity parallel to the N\'eel vector. The magnetic CD has the same angular distribution as the difference between the structural RPED of the two magnetic sublattices and its amplitude is approximately proportional to the magnetic CD in X-ray absorption of a single sublattice. This shows that RPED-CD provides a direct experimental probe of the staggered magnetization.</description>

      <title>Giant Orbital Torque-driven Picosecond Switching in Magnetic Tunnel Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital Hall effect was recently discovered as a novel pathway for driving magnetic moment. However, the integration of orbital Hall effect in magnetic memories suffers from low orbital-to-spin conversion efficiency and incompatibility with magnetic tunnel junctions. Here we demonstrate an orbital Hall effect-driven magnetic tunnel junction based on Ru/W bilayer, where the Ru layer possesses a strong orbital Hall conductivity and the {\alpha}-W layer features an orbital-to-spin conversion efficiency exceeding 90% because of the large orbit-spin diffusivity. By harnessing the giant orbital torque, we achieve a 28.7-picosecond switching and a five to eight-fold reduction in driving voltages over conventional spin-orbit torque magnetic memories. Our work bridges the critical gap between orbital effects and magnetic memory applications, significantly advancing the field of spintronics and orbitronics.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of intrinsic magnetic topological insulator MnBi2nTe3n+1 family by chemical vapor transport method with feedback regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MnBi2nTe3n+1 (MBT) is a representative family of intrinsic magnetic topological insulators, in which numerous exotic phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect are expected. The high-quality crystal growth and magnetism manipulation are the most essential processes. Here we develop a modified chemical vapor transport method using a feedback-regulated strategy, which provides the closed-loop control of growth temperature within +/- 0.1 degree Celsius. Single crystals of MnBi2Te4, MnBi4Te7, and MnBi6Te10 are obtained under different temperature intervals respectively, and show variable tunability on magnetism by finely tuning the growth temperatures. Specifically, the cold-end temperatures not only vary the strength of antiferromagnetic coupling in MnBi2Te4, but also induce magnetic ground state transitions from antiferromagnetism to ferromagnetism in MnBi4Te7 and MnBi6Te10. In MnBi2Te4 with optimized magnetism, quantized transport with Chern insulator state is also realized at the low field of 3.7 T. Our results provide a systematic picture for the crystal growth and the rich magnetic tunability of MBT family, providing richer platforms for the related researches combining magnetism and topological physics.</description>

      <title>Explicit core-hole single-particle methods for L- and M- edge X-ray absorption and electron energy-loss spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-particle methods based on Kohn-Sham unoccupied states to describe near-edge X-ray absorption (XAS) spectra are routinely applied for the description of K-edge spectra, as there is no complication due to spin-orbit (SO) coupling. L- and M-edge spectra are often addressed via variants of time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) based on SO calculations. Here, we present a computationally efficient implementation based on single-particle calculations with core holes within the frozen-core approximation. Combined with a semiempirical energy shift and a fixed spin-orbit splitting, this allows for a prediction of experimental spectra on the absolute energy scale. Such spectra are compared to linear-response TDDFT for molecules and show similar or even better match with experiment, except for multiplet effects that are not covered by the single-particle approximation. A similar picture emerges for solids, where good qualitative and sometimes even quantitative agreement to XAS and electron energy-loss spectra is achieved.</description>

      <title>Calculation of Elastic Constants of UO$_2$ using the Hubbard-Corrected Density-Functional Theory DFT+U</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uranium dioxide which is used as a fuel in light water nuclear reactors, is continually exposed to radiation damage originated from the collision of high-energy particles. Accumulation of the resulting defects gives rise to the evolution in the micro-structure of the fuel which in turn brings about local tensions and strains in the fuel. One of the after effects due to evolution of micro-structure is the swelling of fuel which can damage the fuel cladding and cause environmental contamination by leakage of radioactive particles. Hence, it is vital to continually monitor the evolution of micro-structure and to analyze the changes in mechanical properties of the fuel. The study of elastic constants and analysis of their behavior is very helpful in understanding the mechanical properties of the fuel. In this research, using the Hubbard-corrected first-principles density-functional theory method, we have calculated the elastic constants of the uranium dioxide single crystal and compared the results with existing experimental data. In addition, using the Voigt, Reuss, and Hill models, we have estimated the mechanical properties for the poly-crystalline fresh fuel. The results show a very good agreement between the theory and experiment. Accordingly, we can reliably extend our method of calculations to the complicated system of irradiated fuel pellet, which is in the form of a poly-crystal and hosts various defects.</description>

      <title>Oblique diffraction geometry for the observation of several non-coplanar Bragg reflections under identical illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to determine the strain tensor and local lattice rotation with Dark Field X-ray Microscopy. Using a set of at least 3 non-coplanar, symmetry-equivalent Bragg reflections, the illuminated volume of the sample can be kept constant for all reflections, facilitating easy registration of the measured lattice variations. This requires an oblique diffraction geometry, i.e.~the diffraction plane is neither horizontal nor vertical. We derive a closed, analytical expression that allows determination of the strain and lattice rotation from the deviation of experimental observables (e.g.~goniometer angles) from their nominal position for an unstrained lattice.</description>

      <title>A simple method for detection and quantitative estimation of deep levels in a barrier layer of AlGaN/GaN HEMT strucutres by analysis of light induced threshold voltage shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characterization of deep levels in AlGaN/GaN heterostructures is one of the most important problems in GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) technology. This work reports on a technique for determination of deep level concentration in AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures. The proposed method is relatively simple, and it is based on the detection of free holes created by optically induced transitions of electrons from the deep levels to the conduction band. The developed method can detect and provide quantitative estimation of deep level traps in a barrier layer of AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures. Furthermore, it provides a framework for analysis of light induced threshold voltage shift, which includes an important experimental criterion of determination whether the holes are generated or not in the AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures by sub-band gap illumination. The method was verified by applications it to a study of the deep levels in GaN HEMTs grown on various substrates, i.e. SiC and GaN.</description>

      <title>Exchange interactions in itinerant magnets: the effects of local particle-hole irreducible vertex corrections and SU(2) symmetry of Hund interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study exchange interactions in iron and nickel within the DFT+DMFT approach with density-density and SU(2) symmetric Coulomb interaction. In particular, we analyze the representation of exchange interactions through the non-local part of the particle-hole bubble, supplemented by the local particle-hole (ph) irreducible interaction vertices. The neglect of the local ph-irreducible vertex corrections, suggested previously within the dual fermion approach [E. A. Stepanov, et.al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 037204 (2018)], yields the result, corresponding to generalization of the magnetic force theorem approach. While we argue that these vertex corrections are not important for strong localized magnets, such as iron, they become more essential for weak itinerant magnets, such as nickel. At the same time, the account of the full local vertex and self-energy corrections in the renormalized approach is essential for iron, and less important for nickel. The difference of the results of density-density and SU(2) symmetric Coulomb interaction is found relatively small, in contrast to the Curie temperature and the value of the local magnetic moment.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws of Graph Neural Networks for Atomistic Materials Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomistic materials modeling is a critical task with wide-ranging applications, from drug discovery to materials science, where accurate predictions of the target material property can lead to significant advancements in scientific discovery. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) represent the state-of-the-art approach for modeling atomistic material data thanks to their capacity to capture complex relational structures. While machine learning performance has historically improved with larger models and datasets, GNNs for atomistic materials modeling remain relatively small compared to large language models (LLMs), which leverage billions of parameters and terabyte-scale datasets to achieve remarkable performance in their respective domains. To address this gap, we explore the scaling limits of GNNs for atomistic materials modeling by developing a foundational model with billions of parameters, trained on extensive datasets in terabyte-scale. Our approach incorporates techniques from LLM libraries to efficiently manage large-scale data and models, enabling both effective training and deployment of these large-scale GNN models. This work addresses three fundamental questions in scaling GNNs: the potential for scaling GNN model architectures, the effect of dataset size on model accuracy, and the applicability of LLM-inspired techniques to GNN architectures. Specifically, the outcomes of this study include (1) insights into the scaling laws for GNNs, highlighting the relationship between model size, dataset volume, and accuracy, (2) a foundational GNN model optimized for atomistic materials modeling, and (3) a GNN codebase enhanced with advanced LLM-based training techniques. Our findings lay the groundwork for large-scale GNNs with billions of parameters and terabyte-scale datasets, establishing a scalable pathway for future advancements in atomistic materials modeling.</description>

      <title>Normal state and superconducting state properties of high entropy Ta0.2Nb0.2V0.2Ti0.2X0.2 (X = Zr and Hf )</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High entropy alloy superconductors represent a unique blend of advanced material systems and quantum physics, offering significant potential for advancing superconducting technologies. In this study, we report a detailed theoretical and experimental investigation of high entropy alloy superconductors Ta0.2Nb0.2V0.2Ti0.2X0.2 (X = Zr and Hf). Our study unveils that both the materials crystallize in a body-centered cubic structure (space group: I m -3 m) and exhibit bulk superconductivity with a superconducting onset temperature of (Tonset C ) of 5 K for X = Hf and 6.19 K for X = Zr sample. Our detailed analysis, including magnetization, resistivity, heat capacity measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicates moderately coupled isotropic s-wave superconductivity in these materials. Our DFT results find significant spectral weight at the Fermi energy and phonon spectra is free of imaginary modes, confirming the dynamical stability and metallic nature of these alloys. Remarkably, we have observed a high upper critical field (HC2(0)) surpassing the Pauli paramagnetic limit for the X = Hf sample and explained it on the basis of the increased spin-orbit coupling in the structure. Ta0.2Nb0.2V0.2Ti0.2Zr0.2, on the other hand, shows a conventional HC2 behaviour. With the dynamical stability of these alloys, excellent normal state metallic nature, high micro-hardness, and high upper critical field, these samples emerge as potential candidates for future applications in superconducting devices.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Luminous Transmission and Solar Modulation in Thermochromic VO2 Aerogel-Like Films via Remote Plasma Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vanadium dioxide (VO2) is a thermochromic material that undergoes a phase transition from a monoclinic semiconducting state to a rutile metallic state at 68 degrees C, a temperature close to room temperature. This property makes VO2 particularly valuable in applications such as optical and electrical switches, data storage, neuromorphic computing, and remarkably dynamic smart windows for solar radiation control. VO2 typically needs to be synthesized for these applications as nanostructured thin films. Over the past few decades, significant efforts have been made to control the thermochromic properties of VO2 through crystal structure tuning, doping, and the development of VO2 nanocomposites. Additionally, introducing nano- and mesoporosity has been shown to enhance the optical properties of thermochromic VO2 films. This study presents a methodology for producing highly porous, aerogel-like V2O5 films, which can be thermally processed to form aerogel-like VO2 films. This process is based on sequential plasma polymerization and plasma etching to produce aerogel-like V2O5 films that are annealed to yield ultraporous nanocrystalline VO2 films. The sacrificial vanadium-containing plasma polymers are obtained by remote plasma-assisted vacuum deposition (RPAVD) using vanadyl porphyrin as a precursor and Ar as plasma gas. The aerogel-like VO2 films show exceptional thermochromic performance with luminous transmittances higher than 54%, solar modulation up to 18.8%, and IR modulation up to 35.5%. The presented plasma methodology is versatile, allowing both the synthesis of VO2 plasmonic structures to enhance the thermochromic response and the encapsulation of films to improve their stability in air dramatically. Additionally, this solvent-free synthetic method is fully compatible with doping procedures, scalable, and holds great potential for designing and optimizing smart window coatings.</description>

      <title>Light-Induced Spin Slanting in 2D Multiferroic Magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling spin orientation of two-dimensional (2D) materials has emerged as a frontier of condensed-matter physics, resulting in the discovery of various phases of matter. However, in most cases, spin orientation can be stablished only at specific directions of out-of-plane and in-plane, which is a drawback compared with three-dimensional systems, limiting exploration of novel physics. Here, we introduce a methodology for manipulating spin slanting in 2D multiferroic materials through ultrafast pulses of light. Based on model analysis, we find that simultaneous triggering spin-orbit coupling induced interactions from in-plane and out-of-plane orbitals can generate spin slanting. By choosing 2D multiferroic materials with specific low-energy composition endowed by symmetry, such triggering can be readily achieved through ultrafast light illumination, leading to light-induced spin slanting. Using real-time time-dependent density-functional theory, we demonstrate this approach in multiferroic single-layer CuCr2Se4. This study provides an efficient way to manipulate spin orientation in 2D materials and establishes a general platform to explore physics and applications associated with spin slanting.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall Effect in Type IV 2D Collinear Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a previously unrecognized class of two-dimensional (2D) collinear magnetic phase that extends beyond the established categories of ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, and altermagnets. These type IV 2D collinear magnets exhibit spin-degenerate bands in the nonrelativistic limit, yet support time-reversal symmetry-breaking responses, such as the anomalous Hall effect (AHE), despite having zero net magnetization. Based on spin layer group analysis, we derive the symmetry criteria for this phase and perform first-principles calculations to screen viable candidate materials from 2D databases. Using monolayer Hf2S as a prototype, we demonstrate that in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, the bands are spin degenerate, while its inclusion induce an AHE driven by spin-polarized and even spin-neutral currents, accompanied by a symmetry-protected, truly full-space persistent spin texture. These findings expand the classification of magnetic phases and broaden avenues for realizing unconventional spintronic functionalities in two dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) provides simultaneous measurement of homogeneous and inhomogeneous linewidths through quantitative lineshape analysis. However, conventional lineshape analysis methods assume Gaussian inhomogeneity, limiting its applicability to systems with non-Gaussian inhomogeneity. We present a quantitative lineshape analysis method incorporating arbitrary inhomogeneity using a bivariate spectral distribution function in 2DCS simulations. An algorithm is developed to extract the homogeneous linewidth and arbitrary inhomogeneous distribution from experimentally-measured 2D spectrum. We demonstrate this framework for the excitonic resonance in a GaAs quantum well with non-Gaussian inhomogeneity. This work broadens the scope of quantitative lineshape analysis for studying materials with non-Gaussian inhomogeneity.</description>

      <title>Are nonequilibrium effects relevant for chiral molecule discrimination?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensing and discriminating between enantiomers of chiral molecules remains a significant challenge in the design of sensor platforms. In the case of chemoresistive sensors, where detection relies on changes in electrical response upon analyte adsorption, the sensor substrate is typically functionalized with chirality sensitive molecular receptors. In this computational study, we investigate whether a chirality-blind substrate, such as a graphene nanoribbon, is still capable of discriminating between enantiomers. To this end, we employ a density-functional parametrized tight-binding method combined with nonequilibrium Green functions. For a small set of chiral amino acids, we demonstrate that accounting for the nonequilibrium response of the device leads to significant differences in the electrical currents of enantiomeric pairs of the order tens of nanoamperes. This effect is further amplified when structural fluctuations of the device's active region are considered (1-2 microAmp). Moreover, we propose new quantum-mechanical quantities for enantioselective discrimination in molecular sensors, with an emphasis on binding features and property-property correlations. Therefore, our work demonstrates the significance of nonequilibrium effects in chiral discrimination, laying the foundation for future investigations addressing the design of chiral molecular sensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The grain size of olivine influences mass and heat flux in Earth's upper mantle. We performed annealing experiments on synthetic olivine-pyroxene aggregates (6-13 vol.%) at 1-12 GPa and 1323-1793 K. Grain-size analysis via EBSD reveal an activation volume of $4.8 \times 10^{-6}\ \mathrm{m}^3/\mathrm{mol}$, matching silicon grain-boundary diffusion values. This suggests pressure-driven reduction in olivine growth rates may offset temperature effects at depth, enabling grain-size-sensitive creep at shallower mantle depths than previously modeled.</description>

Abstract: The lithium niobate single crystal is a well-known optical material that has been employed in a wide range of photonic applications. To realize further applications of the crystal, the birefringence properties need to be determined over a large range of temperatures. We report refractive indices and birefringence properties of undoped and MgO-doped lithium niobate crystals with high accuracy using spectroscopic ellipsometry in the spectral range from 450 to 1700 nm and a temperature range from ambient temperature to 1000 {\deg}C. The birefringence results indicate a transition temperature, where the crystal transforms from an anisotropic to isotropic property, and the advance of MgO doping in the crystal, which is related to the optical damage threshold of the materials. In addition, the lattice dynamics of the crystals have been analyzed by revisiting the Raman spectroscopy. The results establish the foundation of optical properties of lithium niobate crystals, providing pathways for their photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Designing Topological High-Order Van Hove Singularities: Twisted Bilayer Kagom\'e</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay of high-order Van Hove singularities and topology plays a central role in determining the nature of the electronic correlations governing the phase of a system with unique signatures characterising their presence. Layered van der Waals heterostuctures are ideal systems for band engineering through the use of twisting and proximity effects. Here, we use symmetry to demonstrate how twisted Kagom\'e bilayers can host topological high-order Van Hove singularities. We study a commensurate system with a large twist angle and demonstrate how the initial choice of high-symmetry stacking order can greatly influence the electronic structure and topology of the system. We, furthermore, study the sublattice interference in the system. Our results illustrate the rich energy landscape of twisted Kagom\'e bilayers and unveil large Chern numbers (of order 10), establishing twisted bilayer Kagom\'e as a natural playground for probing the mixing of strong correlations and topology.</description>

      <title>Emergent phases in the Yao-Lee model via coupling to topological spin textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrons in metals experience an effective vector potential when coupled to spin textures with non-zero scalar spin chirality, such as skyrmions. This coupling can generate a substantial field, leading to pronounced observable phenomena, including the topological Hall effect. Motivated by this, we consider a bilayer model in which the Majorana fermions in the Yao-Lee model on one layer interact with topological spin textures on the second layer via a spin-spin interaction. Unlike the Kitaev model, the Yao-Lee model remains exactly solvable, allowing us to perform Monte Carlo simulations to determine its ground state. Our analysis indicates that skyrmion crystals can give rise to a variety of vison crystals that are periodic arrangements of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes with unusual patterns such as a kagome pattern. In addition, Majorana fermions acquire a substantial Berry phase from skyrmion crystals, resulting in phases with finite Chern numbers up to $\nu =5$. In the case of a single skyrmion defect in the magnetic layer, a corresponding defect in the vison configuration can be realized. These defects support localized states when the spin liquid is gapped. Similar to skyrmion crystals, spiral spin textures also give rise to a diverse range of flux crystals. However, in this case, most of these phases are gapless, with only a few being trivially-gapped. Our results highlight the rich physics emerging from the interplay between topological spin textures and fractionalized quasiparticles in quantum spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Discovery of an ultrastable antiferromagnetic two-dimensional CrF3 phase with anisotropic quasi-one-dimensional mechanical, electronic, and thermal properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19118v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of an ultra-stable antiferromagnetic two-dimensional (2D) CrF3 phase that is energetically more favorable than the traditionally assumed hexagonal structure. Using first-principles calculations and evolutionary structure searches, we identify a new low-energy rectangular configuration of CrF3 with remarkable anisotropic properties. Mechanically, this phase exhibits zero in-plane Poisson's ratio, a rare negative out-of-plane Poisson's ratio, and quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) behavior characterized by minimal coupling between orthogonal directions. Electronically, CrF3 shows quasi-1D transport with two independent conduction bands near the Fermi level, tunable via uniaxial strain. The calculated bandgap is 3.05 eV, which can be modulated under strain, enabling control over its electronic properties. The material also displays out-of-plane antiferromagnetic ordering with a magnetic anisotropy energy of 0.098 meV per Cr atom and an estimated Neel temperature of 20 K. Additionally, we investigate the thermal conductivity of monolayer rectangular CrF3 (r-CrF3), revealing significant anisotropy in heat transport. The thermal conductivity along the y-axis is approximately 60.5 W/mK at 300 K, much higher than along the x-axis at 13.2 W/mK. The thermal anisotropic factor is 4.58, surpassing that of other 2D materials like black phosphorene, WTe2, and arsenene, highlighting r-CrF3's potential for advanced directional heat management. Consequently, the rectangular CrF3 phase is a promising candidate for applications in spintronics, strain-engineered nanoelectronics, mechanical metamaterials, and thermal management technologies.</description>

      <title>Materials Discovery in Combinatorial and High-throughput Synthesis and Processing: A New Frontier for SPM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For over three decades, scanning probe microscopy (SPM) has been a key method for exploring material structures and functionalities at nanometer and often atomic scales in ambient, liquid, and vacuum environments. Historically, SPM applications have predominantly been downstream, with images and spectra serving as a qualitative source of data on the microstructure and properties of materials, and in rare cases of fundamental physical knowledge. However, the fast-growing developments in accelerated material synthesis via self-driving labs and established applications such as combinatorial spread libraries are poised to change this paradigm. Rapid synthesis demands matching capabilities to probe structure and functionalities of materials on small scales and with high throughput. SPM inherently meets these criteria, offering a rich and diverse array of data from a single measurement. Here, we overview SPM methods applicable to these emerging applications and emphasize their quantitativeness, focusing on piezoresponse force microscopy, electrochemical strain microscopy, conductive, and surface photovoltage measurements. We discuss the challenges and opportunities ahead, asserting that SPM will play a crucial role in closing the loop from material prediction and synthesis to characterization.</description>

      <title>Double-Crucible Vertical Bridgman Technique for Stoichiometry-Controlled Chalcogenide Crystal Growth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise stoichiometry control in single-crystal growth is essential for both technological applications and fundamental research. However, conventional growth methods often face challenges such as non-stoichiometry, compositional gradients, and phase impurities, particularly in non-congruent melting systems. Even in congruent melting systems like Bi2Se3, deviations from the ideal stoichiometric composition can lead to significant property degradation, such as excessive bulk conductivity, which limits its topological applications. In this study, we introduce the double-crucible vertical Bridgman (DCVB) method, a novel approach that enhances stoichiometry control through the combined use of continuous source material feeding, traveling-solvent growth, and liquid encapsulation, which suppresses volatile element loss under high pressure. Using Bi2Se3 as a model system, we demonstrate that crystals grown via DCVB exhibit enhanced stoichiometric control, significantly reducing defect density and achieving much lower carrier concentrations compared to those produced by conventional Bridgman techniques. Moreover, the continuous feeding of source material enables the growth of large crystals. This approach presents a promising strategy for synthesizing high-quality, large-scale crystals, particularly for metal chalcogenides and pnictides that exhibit challenging non-congruent melting behaviors.</description>

      <title>Coupling between small polarons and ferroelectricity in BaTiO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12693v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the formation of electron and hole small polarons in the prototypical ferroelectric material BaTiO3, with a focus on their interaction with ferroelectric distortive fields. To accurately describe the ferroelectric phase in electronically correlated BaTiO3, we employ the HSE06 hybrid functional, which addresses the limitations of conventional DFT and DFT+U models, providing a more precise depiction of both ferroelectric and polaronic behaviors. Our analysis spans three structural phases of BaTiO3: cubic, tetragonal, and rhombohedral. We uncover a unique phase-dependent trend in electron polaron stability, which progressively increases across the structural phases, peaking in the rhombohedral phase due to the constructive coupling between the polaron and ferroelectric phonon fields. In contrast, hole polarons exhibit a stability pattern largely unaffected by the phase transitions. Furthermore, we observe that polaron self-trapping significantly alters the local ferroelectric distortive pattern, which propagates to neighboring sites but has a minimal effect on the long-range macroscopic spontaneous polarization. Charge trapping is also associated with localized spin formation, opening new possibilities for enhanced functionalities in multiferroic materials.</description>

      <title>Atomic Origins of Magnetic Anisotropy in Ru-substituted Manganite Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic anisotropy in complex oxides often originates from the complex interplay of several factors, including crystal structure, spin-orbit coupling, and electronic interactions. Recent studies on Ru-substituted $La_{0.70}Sr_{0.30}MnO_3$ (Ru-LSMO) films demonstrate emerging magnetic and magneto-transport properties, where magnetic anisotropy plays a crucial role. However, the atomic origin and underlying mechanisms of the magnetic anisotropy of this material system remain elusive. This work sheds light on these aspects. Detailed element-specific X-ray magnetic dichroism analysis suggests that Ru single ion anisotropy governs the overall magnetic anisotropy. Furthermore, the magnetic property of Mn ions changes dramatically due to strong antiferromagnetic coupling between Ru and Mn ions. Our findings clarify the role of Ru single ion anisotropy behind magnetic anisotropy in Ru-LSMO, offering a promising avenue for designing advanced materials with tailored magnetic properties for next generation magnetic and spintronic technologies. As the Curie temperature of these materials is close to room temperature, such tunable magnetic anisotropy holds prospects for functional room-temperature magnetic devices.</description>

      <title>Surface Sensitive Raman Response of Metal-Supported Monolayer MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Raman spectrum of monolayer (ML) MoS$_2$ is remarkably affected by the interaction with metals. In this work we studied ML-MoS$_2$ supported by the Ag(111) and Ag(110) surfaces by using a combined experimental and theoretical approach. The MoS$_2$ layer was directly grown on atomically clean Ag(111) and Ag(110) surfaces by pulsed laser deposition, followed by in-situ thermal annealing under ultra-high vacuum conditions. The morphology and structure of the two systems were characterized in-situ by scanning tunneling microscopy, providing atomic-scale information on the relation between the MoS$_2$ lattice and the underlying surface. Raman spectroscopy revealed differences between the two MoS$_2$-metal interfaces, especially concerning the behavior of the out-of-plane $A'_1$ vibrational mode, which splits into two contributions on Ag(110). The metal-induced effects on MoS$_2$ vibrational modes are further evidenced by transferring MoS$_2$ onto a more inert substrate (SiO$_2$/Si), where the MoS$_2$ Raman response displays a more ``freestanding-like'' behavior. The experimental data were interpreted with the support of ab-initio calculations of the vibrational modes, which provided insight into the effect of interface properties, such as strain and out-of-plane distortion. Our results highlight the influence of the interaction with metals on MoS$_2$ vibrational properties, and show the high sensitivity of MoS$_2$ Raman modes to the surface structure of the supporting metal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Orb-v3, the next generation of the Orb family of universal interatomic potentials. Models in this family expand the performance-speed-memory Pareto frontier, offering near SoTA performance across a range of evaluations with a &gt;10x reduction in latency and &gt; 8x reduction in memory. Our experiments systematically traverse this frontier, charting the trade-off induced by roto-equivariance, conservatism and graph sparsity. Contrary to recent literature, we find that non-equivariant, non-conservative architectures can accurately model physical properties, including those which require higher-order derivatives of the potential energy surface.
  This model release is guided by the principle that the most valuable foundation models for atomic simulation will excel on all fronts: accuracy, latency and system size scalability. The reward for doing so is a new era of computational chemistry driven by high-throughput and mesoscale all-atom simulations.</description>

We investigate strings governed by constitutive relations where stretch is a bounded, piecewise linear function of tension, extending beyond the traditional Cauchy elasticity framework.

      <title>Scaling Up Purcell-Enhanced Self-Assembled Nanoplasmonic Perovskite Scintillators into the Bulk Regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18477v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scintillators, which convert high-energy radiation into detectable photons, play a crucial role in medical imaging and security applications. The enhancement of scintillator performance through nanophotonics and nanoplasmonics, specifically using the Purcell effect, has shown promise but has so far been limited to ultrathin scintillator films due to the localized nature of this effect. In this study, we present a method to extend nanoplasmonic scintillators to the bulk regime. By integrating 100-nm-size plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles with perovskite scintillator nanocrystals, we enable nanoplasmonic scintillators to function effectively within bulk-scale devices. We experimentally demonstrate power and decay rate enhancements of up to (3.20 $\pm$ 0.20) and (4.20 $\pm$ 0.31) fold for plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles, respectively, in a 5-mm thick CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystal-polymer scintillator at RT. Theoretical modeling further predicts similar enhancements of up to (2.63 $\pm$ 0.79) and (5.62 $\pm$ 1.71) fold for the same nanoparticle shapes and dimensions. These findings provide a viable pathway for using nanoplasmonics to enhance bulk scintillator devices, advancing radiation detection technology.</description>

      <title>Pb-intercalated epitaxial graphene on SiC: Full insight into band structure and orbital character of interlayer Pb, and charge transfer into graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intercalation is a robust approach for modulating the properties of epitaxial graphene on SiC and stabilizing two-dimensional (2D) intercalant layers at the graphene/SiC interface. In this work, we present synchrotron-based angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements focussing on the band structure of intercalated Pb under a single layer of epitaxial graphene. The interlayer Pb exhibits a metallic character, a $(1 \times 1)$ registry with respect to SiC, and free electron-like bands to a first order. Divergences from the free electron approximation include various band splittings and gaps throughout the Pb Brillouin zone. Light polarization dependent ARPES measurements indicate a predominant out-of-plane orbital character for the Pb bands, suggesting potential interactions between the interlayer Pb and graphene's $\pi$ orbitals that may induce proximity effects in graphene. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for a $(1 \times 1)$ Pb monolayer on SiC show a reasonable qualitative agreement with the experimentally observed interlayer bands as well as the polarization dependent measurements. Finally, temperature dependent ARPES measurements reveal that the nearly charge-neutral graphene layer involves charge transfer from both the interlayer Pb and the substrate SiC.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional superconductors with spin-textured Fermi surfaces can be a platform for realizing unconventional pairing states and are of substantial interest in the context of quantum information science, and superconducting spintronics/orbitronics. We observed an unusual in-plane Ising like uniaxial anisotropy in the superconducting 2D electron gas (2DEG) formed at EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interfaces, where the EuOx is magnetic. This anisotropy is not evident in AlOx/KTaO3 (110) where the overlayer is non-magnetic. Our results are consistent with a highly anisotropic spin-textured Fermi surface in 2DEGs formed at the KTaO3 (110) interface that is hidden from external magnetic fields due to a near cancellation between orbital and spin moments but revealed by exchange interactions of the electrons in the 2DEG with Eu moments near the EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interface. The interactions between the uniaxial spin texture and the magnetic overlayer offer new ways to explore the interplay between magnetism and 2D superconductivity.</description>
