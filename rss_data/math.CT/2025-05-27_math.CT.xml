      <title>Fixed-Point Traps and Identity Emergence in Educational Feedback Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a formal categorical proof that exam-driven educational systems obstruct identity emergence and block creative convergence. Using the framework of Alpay Algebra II and III, we define Exam-Grade Collapse Systems (EGCS) as functorial constructs where learning dynamics $\varphi$ are recursively collapsed by evaluative morphisms $E$. We prove that under such collapse regimes, no nontrivial fixed-point algebra $\mu_\varphi$ can exist, hence learner identity cannot stabilize. This creates a universal fixed-point trap: all generative functors are entropically folded before symbolic emergence occurs. Our model mathematically explains the creativity suppression, research stagnation, and structural entropy loss induced by timed exams and grade-based feedback. The results apply category theory to expose why modern educational systems prevent {\phi}-emergence and block observer-invariant self-formation. This work provides the first provable algebraic obstruction of identity formation caused by institutional feedback mechanics.</description>

      <title>Restricted (2+1)-TQFTs supported by thickened and solid tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A faithful $(1+1)$ TQFT has recently been constructed, but the existence of a faithful $(2+1)$ TQFT remains an open question, that subsumes the hard problem of linearity of mapping class groups of surfaces. To circumvent the latter problem we construct a subcategory of the category of 3-cobordisms, containing disjoint unions of tori and simplest cobordisms between them. On this we define TQFTs that are able to distinguish pairs of torus bundles and lens spaces, previously shown not to be distinguishable by quantum invariants.</description>

      <title>Global representation theory: Homological foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A global representation is a compatible collection of representations of the outer automorphism groups of the groups belonging to some collection of finite groups $\mathscr{U}$. Global representations assemble into an abelian category $\mathsf{A}(\mathscr{U})$, simultaneously generalising classical representation theory and the category of VI-modules appearing in the representation theory of the general linear groups. In this paper we establish homological foundations of its derived category $\mathsf{D}(\mathscr{U})$. We prove that any complex of projective global representations is DG-projective, and hence conclude that the derived category admits an explicit model as the homotopy category of projective global representations. We show that from a tensor-triangular perspective it exhibits some unusual features: for example, there are very few dualizable objects and in general many more compact objects. Under more restrictive conditions on the family $\mathscr{U}$, we then construct torsion-free classes for global representations which encode certain growth properties in $\mathscr{U}$. This lays the foundations for a detailed study of the tensor-triangular geometry of derived global representations which we pursue in forthcoming work.</description>

      <title>Composable Uncertainty in Symmetric Monoidal Categories for Design Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Applied category theory often studies symmetric monoidal categories (SMCs) whose morphisms represent open systems. These structures naturally accommodate complex wiring patterns, leveraging (co)monoidal structures for splitting and merging wires, or compact closed structures for feedback. A key example is the compact closed SMC of design problems (DP), which enables a compositional approach to co-design in engineering. However, in practice, the systems of interest may not be fully known. Recently, Markov categories have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling uncertain processes. In this work, we demonstrate how to integrate this perspective into the study of open systems while preserving consistency with the underlying SMC structure. To this end, we employ the change-of-base construction for enriched categories, replacing the morphisms of a symmetric monoidal $\mathcal{V}$-category $\mathcal{C}$ with parametric maps $A \to \mathcal{C}(X,Y)$ in a Markov category induced by a symmetric monoidal monad. This results in a symmetric monoidal 2-category $N_*\mathcal{C}$ with the same objects as $\mathcal{C}$ and reparametrization 2-cells. By choosing different monads, we capture various types of uncertainty. The category underlying $\mathcal{C}$ embeds into $N_*\mathcal{C}$ via a strict symmetric monoidal functor, allowing (co)monoidal and compact closed structures to be transferred. Applied to DP, this construction leads to categories of practical relevance, such as parametrized design problems for optimization, and parametrized distributions of design problems for decision theory and Bayesian learning.</description>

      <title>Comonadic Coalgebras and Bousfield Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11536</link>
      <description>arXiv:1805.11536v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a model category, we prove that taking the category of coalgebras over a comonad commutes with left Bousfield localization in a suitable sense. Then we prove a general existence result for the left-induced model structure on the category of coalgebras over a comonad in a left Bousfield localization. Next we provide several equivalent characterizations of when a left Bousfield localization preserves coalgebras over a comonad. These results are illustrated with many applications in chain complexes, (localized) spectra, the stable module category, and simplicial settings.</description>

      <title>The Yoneda embedding in simplicial type theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Riehl and Shulman introduced simplicial type theory (STT), a variant of homotopy type theory which aimed to study not just homotopy theory, but its fusion with category theory: $(\infty,1)$-category theory. While notoriously technical, manipulating $\infty$-categories in simplicial type theory is often easier than working with ordinary categories, with the type theory handling infinite stacks of coherences in the background. We capitalize on recent work by Gratzer et al. defining the $(\infty,1)$-category of $\infty$-groupoids in STT to define presheaf categories within STT and systematically develop their theory. In particular, we construct the Yoneda embedding, prove the universal property of presheaf categories, refine the theory of adjunctions in STT, introduce the theory of Kan extensions, and prove Quillen's Theorem A.</description>

      <title>EGGs are adhesive!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of rewriting-based visual formalisms is on the rise. In the formal methods community, this is due also to the introduction of adhesive categories, where most properties of classical approaches to graph transformation, such as those on parallelism and confluence, can be rephrased and proved in a general and uniform way.E-graphs (EGGs) are a formalism for program optimisation via an efficient implementation of equality saturation. In short, EGGs can be defined as (acyclic) term graphs with an additional notion of equivalence on nodes that is closed under the operators of the signature. Instead of replacing the components of a program, the optimisation step is performed by adding new components and linking them to the existing ones via an equivalence relation, until an optimal program is reached. This work describes EGGs via adhesive categories. Besides the benefits in itself of a formal presentation, which renders the properties of the data structure precise, the description of the addition of equivalent program components using standard graph transformation tools offers the advantages of the adhesive framework in modelling, for example, concurrent updates.</description>
