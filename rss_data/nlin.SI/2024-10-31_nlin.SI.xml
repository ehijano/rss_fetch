      <title>The non-linear steepest descent approach to the singular asymptotics of the sinh-Gordon reduction of the Painlev\'e III equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the simplest case of tt*-Toda equations, we study the large and small $x$ asymptotics for $x&gt;0$ of real solutions of the sinh-Godron Painlev\'e III($D_6$) equation. These solutions are parametrized through the monodromy data of the corresponding Riemann-Hilbert problem. This unified approach provides connection formulae between the behavior at the origin and infinity of the considered solutions.</description>

      <title>High-genus KdV soliton gases and their long-time asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper employs the Riemann-Hilbert problem to provide a comprehensive analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the high-genus Korteweg-de Vries soliton gases. It is demonstrated that the two-genus soliton gas is related to the two-phase Riemann-Theta function as \(x \to +\infty\), and approaches to zero as \(x \to -\infty\). Additionally, the long-time asymptotic behavior of this two-genus soliton gas can be categorized into five distinct regions in the \(x\)-\(t\) plane, which from left to right are rapidly decay, modulated one-phase wave, unmodulated one-phase wave, modulated two-phase wave, and unmodulated two-phase wave. Moreover, an innovative method is introduced to solve the model problem associated with the high-genus Riemann surface, leading to the determination of the leading terms, which is also related with the multi-phase Riemann-Theta function. A general discussion on the case of arbitrary \(N\)-genus soliton gas is also presented.</description>

      <title>Discrete-time systems in quasi-standard form and the $\mathfrak{h}_6$ coalgebra symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we characterize all discrete-time systems in quasi-standard form admitting coalgebra symmetry with respect to the Lie--Poisson algebra $\mathfrak{h}_{6}$. The outcome of this study is a family of systems depending on an arbitrary function of three variables, playing the r\^ole of the potential. Moreover, using a direct search approach, we classify discrete-time systems from this family that admit an additional invariant at most quadratic in the physical variables. We discuss the integrability properties of the obtained cases, their relationship with known systems, and their continuum limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Hamiltonian operators which are sum of a first order operator and of a Poisson tensor, in two spatial independent variables. In particular, a complete classification of these operators is presented in two and three components, analyzing both the cases of degenerate and non degenerate leading coefficients.</description>

      <title>Noise-induced synchronization in coupled quantum oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum dynamics of a pair of coupled quantum oscillators coupled to a common correlated dissipative environment. The resulting equations of motion for both the operator moments and covariances can be integrated analytically using the Lyapunov equations. We find that for fully correlated and fully anti-correlated environments, the oscillators relax into a phase-synchronized state that persists for long times when the two oscillators are nearly resonant and (essentially) forever if the two oscillators are in resonance. This can be traced to the symmetry of the Lindblad dissipator, which can lead to strong damping in one region of state space and under damping in others. In the extreme cases of fully correlated or fully anti-correlated environments, specific regions of state space are fully decoupled from the environment. We also show that the environmental noise correlation leads to quantum entanglement, and all the correlations between the two oscillators are purely quantum mechanical in origin. This work provides a robust mathematical foundation for understanding how long-lived exciton coherences can be linked to vibronic correlation effects.</description>

      <title>Chapman-Enskog theory for nearly integrable quantum gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrable systems feature an infinite number of conserved charges and on hydrodynamic scales are described by generalised hydrodynamics (GHD). This description breaks down when the integrability is weakly broken and sufficiently large space-time-scales are probed. The emergent hydrodynamics depends then on the charges conserved by the perturbation. We focus on nearly-integrable Galilean-invariant systems with conserved particle number, momentum and energy. Basing on the Boltzmann collision approach to integrability breaking we describe dynamics of the system with GHD equation supplemented with collision term. The limit of large space-time-scales is addressed using Chapman-Enskog expansion adapted to the GHD equation. We recover Navier-Stokes equations and find transport coefficients: viscosity and thermal conductivity, which are given by generalizations of Chapman-Enskog integral equations. We also observe that the diffusion of quasiparticles introduces an additional small parameter enriching the structure of the expansion as compared to the standard Boltzmann equation.</description>

      <title>Exact overlaps for "all" integrable matrix product states of rational spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The overlaps between integrable matrix product states (MPS) and Bethe states are important in both the non-equilibrium statistical physics and the AdS/CFT duality. We present the general MPS overlap formula. The result is a product of a ratio of Gaudin determinants and a prefactor. The Gaudin determinants depend on the spin chain but not on the MPS. The MPS dependent prefactor is given for all integrable MPS of the $\mathfrak{gl}_{N}$, $\mathfrak{o}_{N}$ and $\mathfrak{sp}_{N}$ symmetric spin chains with arbitrary representations.</description>

      <title>Bi-Hamiltonian structures of WDVV-type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of nonlinear PDEs that admit the same bi-Hamiltonian structure as WDVV equations: a Ferapontov-type first-order Hamiltonian operator and a homogeneous third-order Hamiltonian operator in a canonical Doyle--Potemin form, which are compatible. Using various equivalence groups, we classify such equations in two-component and three-component cases. In a four-component case, we add further evidence to the conjecture that there exists only one integrable system of the above type. Finally, we give an example of the six-component system with required bi-Hamiltonian structure. To streamline the symbolic computation we develop an algorithm to find the aforementioned Hamiltonian operators, which includes putting forward a conjecture on the structure of the metric parameterising the first-order Hamiltonian operator.</description>
