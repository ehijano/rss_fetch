      <title>An investigation of escape and scaling properties of a billiard system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate some statistical properties of escaping particles in a billiard system whose boundary is described by two control parameters with a hole on its boundary. Initially, we analyze the survival probability for different hole positions and sizes. We notice the survival probability follows an exponential decay with a characteristic power law tail when the hole is positioned partially or entirely over large stability islands in phase space. We find the survival probability exhibits scaling invariance with respect to the hole size. In contrast, the survival probability for holes placed in predominantly chaotic regions deviates from the exponential decay. We introduce two holes simultaneously and investigate the complexity of the escape basins for different hole sizes and control parameters by means of the basin entropy and the basin boundary entropy. We find a non-trivial relation between these entropies and the system's parameters and show that the basin entropy exhibits scaling invariance for a specific control parameter interval.</description>

      <title>Transition to synchronization in adaptive Sakaguchi-Kuramoto model with higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of transition to synchronization in Sakaguchi-Kuramoto model in the presence of higher-order interactions and global order parameter adaptation. The investigation is done by performing extensive numerical simulations and low dimensional modeling of the system. Numerical simulations of the full system show both continuous (second order) as well as discontinuous transitions. The discontinuous transitions can either be associated with explosive (first order) or with tiered synchronization states depending on the choice of parameters. To develop an in depth understanding of the transition scenario in the parameter space we derive a reduced order model (ROM) using the Ott-Antonsen ansatz, the results of which closely matches with that of the numerical simulations of the full system. The simplicity and analytical accessibility of the ROM helps to conveniently unfold the transition scenario in the system having complex dependence on the parameters. Simultaneous analysis of the full system and the ROM clearly identifies the regions of the parameter space exhibiting different types of transitions. It is observed that the second order continuous transition is connected with a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation (PB) of the ROM. On the other hand, the discontinuous teired transition is associated with multiple saddle-node (SN) bifurcations along with a supercritical PB and the first order explosive transition involves a subcritical PB alongside a SN bifurcation.</description>

      <title>Effects of nonlinearity on Anderson localization of surface gravity waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anderson localization is a multiple-scattering phenomenon of linear waves propagating within a disordered medium. Discovered in the late 50s for electrons, it has since been observed experimentally with cold atoms and with classical waves (optics, microwaves, and acoustics), but whether wave localization is enhanced or weakened for nonlinear waves is a long-standing debate. Here, we show that the nonlinearity strengthens the localization of surface-gravity waves propagating in a canal with a random bottom. We also show experimentally how the localization length depends on the nonlinearity, which has never been reported previously with any type of wave. To do so, we use a full space-and-time-resolved wavefield measurement as well as numerical simulations. The effects of the disorder level and the system's finite size on localization are also reported. We also highlight the first experimental evidence of the macroscopic analog of Bloch's dispersion relation of linear hydrodynamic surface waves over periodic bathymetry.</description>

      <title>Optimal Recurrent Network Topologies for Dynamical Systems Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR) we seek to infer from time series measurements a generative model of the underlying dynamical process. This is a prime objective in any scientific discipline, where we are particularly interested in parsimonious models with a low parameter load. A common strategy here is parameter pruning, removing all parameters with small weights. However, here we find this strategy does not work for DSR, where even low magnitude parameters can contribute considerably to the system dynamics. On the other hand, it is well known that many natural systems which generate complex dynamics, like the brain or ecological networks, have a sparse topology with comparatively few links. Inspired by this, we show that geometric pruning, where in contrast to magnitude-based pruning weights with a low contribution to an attractor's geometrical structure are removed, indeed manages to reduce parameter load substantially without significantly hampering DSR quality. We further find that the networks resulting from geometric pruning have a specific type of topology, and that this topology, and not the magnitude of weights, is what is most crucial to performance. We provide an algorithm that automatically generates such topologies which can be used as priors for generative modeling of dynamical systems by RNNs, and compare it to other well studied topologies like small-world or scale-free networks.</description>

      <title>Impact of pressure anisotropy on the cascade rate of Hall-MHD turbulence with bi-adiabatic ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of ion pressure anisotropy on the energy cascade rate of Hall-MHD turbulence with bi-adiabatic ions and isothermal electrons is evaluated in three-dimensional direct numerical simulations, using the exact law derived in Simon and Sahraoui (2022). It is shown that pressure anisotropy can enhance or reduce the cascade rate, depending on the scales, in comparison with the prediction of the exact law with isotropic pressure, by an amount that correlates well with pressure anisotropy $a_p=\frac{p_\perp}{p_\parallel}\neq1$ developing in simulations initialized with an isotropic pressure (${a_p}_0=1$). A simulation with an initial pressure anisotropy, ${a_p}_0=4$, confirms this trend, yielding a stronger impact on the cascade rate, both in the inertial range and at larger scales, close to the forcing. Furthermore, a Fourier-based numerical method to compute the exact laws in numerical simulations in the full $(\ell_\perp,\ell_\parallel)$ scale separation plane is presented.</description>

      <title>ComplexityMeasures.jl: scalable software to unify and accelerate entropy and complexity timeseries analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the nonlinear timeseries analysis literature, countless quantities have been presented as new "entropy" or "complexity" measures, often with similar roles. The ever-increasing pool of such measures makes creating a sustainable and all-encompassing software for them difficult both conceptually and pragmatically. Such a software however would be an important tool that can aid researchers make an informed decision of which measure to use and for which application, as well as accelerate novel research. Here we present ComplexityMeasures.jl, an easily extendable and highly performant open-source software that implements a vast selection of complexity measures. The software provides 1530 measures with 3,834 lines of source code, averaging only 2.5 lines of code per exported quantity (version 3.5). This is made possible by its mathematically rigorous composable design. In this paper we discuss the software design and demonstrate how it can accelerate complexity-related research in the future. We carefully compare it with alternative software and conclude that ComplexityMeasures.jl outclasses the alternatives in several objective aspects of comparison, such as computational performance, overall amount of measures, reliability, and extendability. ComplexityMeasures.jl is also a component of the DynamicalSystems.jl library for nonlinear dynamics and nonlinear timeseries analysis and follows open source development practices for creating a sustainable community of developers.</description>

      <title>Integrating Multimodal Data for Joint Generative Modeling of Complex Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.07892v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many, if not most, systems of interest in science are naturally described as nonlinear dynamical systems. Empirically, we commonly access these systems through time series measurements. Often such time series may consist of discrete random variables rather than continuous measurements, or may be composed of measurements from multiple data modalities observed simultaneously. For instance, in neuroscience we may have behavioral labels in addition to spike counts and continuous physiological recordings. While by now there is a burgeoning literature on deep learning for dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR), multimodal data integration has hardly been considered in this context. Here we provide such an efficient and flexible algorithmic framework that rests on a multimodal variational autoencoder for generating a sparse teacher signal that guides training of a reconstruction model, exploiting recent advances in DSR training techniques. It enables to combine various sources of information for optimal reconstruction, even allows for reconstruction from symbolic data (class labels) alone, and connects different types of observations within a common latent dynamics space. In contrast to previous multimodal data integration techniques for scientific applications, our framework is fully \textit{generative}, producing, after training, trajectories with the same geometrical and temporal structure as those of the ground truth system.</description>
