      <title>Mahler's problem and Turyn polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mahler's problem asks for the largest possible value of the Mahler measure, normalized by the $L_2$ norm, of a polynomial with $\pm1$ coefficients and large degree. We establish a new record value in this problem exceeding $0.95$ by analyzing certain Turyn polynomials, which are defined by cyclically shifting the coefficients of a Fekete polynomial by a prescribed amount. It was recently established that the distribution of values over the unit circle of Fekete polynomials of large degree is effectively modeled by a particular random point process. We extend this analysis to the Turyn polynomials, and determine expressions for the asymptotic normalized Mahler measure of these polynomials, as well as for their normalized $L_q$ norms. We also describe a number of calculations on the corresponding random processes, which indicate that the Turyn polynomials where the shift is approximately $1/4$ of the length have Mahler measure exceeding $95\%$ of their $L_2$ norm. Further, we show that these asymptotic values are not disturbed by a small change to make polynomials having entirely $\pm1$ coefficients, which establishes the result on Mahler's problem.</description>

      <title>On approximation to a real number by algebraic numbers of bounded degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his seminal 1961 paper, Wirsing studied how well a given transcendental real number $\xi$ can be approximated by algebraic numbers $\alpha$ of degree at most $n$ for a given positive integer $n$, in terms of the so-called naive height $H(\alpha)$ of $\alpha$. He showed that the infimum $\omega^*_n(\xi)$ of all $\omega$ for which infinitely many such $\alpha$ have $|\xi-\alpha| \le H(\alpha)^{-\omega-1}$ is at least $(n+1)/2$. He also asked if we could even have $\omega^*_n(\xi) \ge n$ as it is generally expected. Since then, all improvements on Wirsing's lower bound were of the form $n/2+\mathcal{O}(1)$ until Badziahin and Schleischitz showed in 2021 that $\omega^*_n(\xi) \ge an$ for each $n\ge 4$, with $a=1/\sqrt{3}\simeq 0.577$. In this paper, we use a different approach partly inspired by parametric geometry of numbers and show that $\omega^*_n(\xi) \ge an$ for each $n\ge 2$, with $a=1/(2-\log 2)\simeq 0.765$.</description>

      <title>Faithful Artin induction and the Chebotarev density theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite group G, we prove that the vector space spanned by the faithful irreducible characters of G is generated by the monomial characters in the vector space. As a consequence, we show that in any family of G-extensions of a fixed number field F, almost all are subject to a strong effective version of the Chebotarev density theorem. We use this version of the Chebotarev density theorem to deduce several consequences for class groups in families of number fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we utilize linear algebra to investigate quadratic integral extensions over a complete discrete valuation ring and to classify all of their ideals. With this classification, we establish that the similarity of $2\times2$ matrices with coefficients in a certain complete discrete valuation ring can be ascertained in a larger ring of algebraic integers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify all solution triples with Fibonacci components to the equation $a^2+b^2+c^2=3abc+m,$ for positive $m$. We show that for $m=2$ they are precisely $(1,F(b),F(b+2))$, with even $b$; for $m=21$, there exist exactly two Fibonacci solutions $(1,2,8)$ and $(2,2,13)$ and for any other $m$ there exists at most one Fibonacci solution, which, in case it exists, is always minimal (i.e. it is a root of a Markoff tree). Moreover, we show that there is an infinite number of values of $m$ admitting exactly one such solution.</description>

      <title>A conjecture of Zhi-Wei Sun on matrices concerning multiplicative subgroups of finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent work of Zhi-Wei Sun on determinants involving the Legendre symbol, in this paper, we study some matrices concerning subgroups of finite fields.
  For example, let $q\equiv 3\pmod 4$ be an odd prime power and let $\phi$ be the unique quadratic multiplicative character of the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. If set $\{s_1,\cdots,s_{(q-1)/2}\}=\{x^2:\ x\in\mathbb{F}_q\setminus\{0\}\}$, then we prove that
  $$\det\left[t+\phi(s_i+s_j)+\phi(s_i-s_j)\right]_{1\le i,j\le (q-1)/2}=\left(\frac{q-1}{2}t-1\right)q^{\frac{q-3}{4}}.$$
  This confirms a conjecture of Zhi-Wei Sun.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1797, Pfaff gave a simple proof of a ${}_3F_2$ hypergeometric series which was much later reproved by Andrews in 1996. In the same paper, Andrews also proved other well-known hypergeometric identities using Pfaff's method. In this paper, we prove a number of terminating $q$-hypergeometric series-product identities using Pfaff's method thereby providing a detailed account of its wide applicability.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds for shifted moments of the Riemann zeta function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous work, the author gave upper bounds for the shifted moments of the zeta function \[ M_{{\alpha},{\beta}}(T) = \int_T^{2T} \prod_{k = 1}^m |\zeta(\tfrac{1}{2} + i (t + \alpha_k))|^{2 \beta_k} dt \] introduced by Chandee, where ${\alpha} = {\alpha}(T) = (\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_m)$ and ${\beta} = (\beta_1 \ldots , \beta_m)$ satisfy $|\alpha_k| \leq T/2$ and $\beta_k\geq 0$. Assuming the Riemann hypothesis, we shall prove the corresponding lower bounds: \[ M_{{\alpha},{\beta}}(T) \gg_{{\beta}} T (\log T)^{\beta_1^2 + \cdots + \beta_m^2} \prod_{1\leq j &lt; k \leq m} |\zeta(1 + i(\alpha_j - \alpha_k) + 1/ \log T )|^{2\beta_j \beta_k}. \]</description>

      <title>Local Zeta Functions of Multiparameter Calabi-Yau Threefolds from the Picard-Fuchs Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deformation approach of arXiv:2104.07816 for computing zeta functions of one-parameter Calabi-Yau threefolds is generalised to cover also multiparameter manifolds. Consideration of the multiparameter case requires the development of an improved formalism. This allows us, among other things, to make progress on some issues left open in previous work, such as the treatment of apparent and conifold singularities and changes of coordinates. We also discuss the efficient numerical computation of the zeta functions. As examples, we compute the zeta functions of the two-parameter mirror octic, a non-symmetric split of the quintic threefold also with two parameters, and the $S_5$ symmetric five-parameter Hulek-Verrill manifolds. These examples allow us to exhibit the several new types of geometries for which our methods make practical computations possible. They also act as consistency checks, as our results reproduce and extend those of arXiv:hep-th/0409202 and arXiv:math/0304169. To make the methods developed here more approachable, a Mathematica package "CY3Zeta" for computing the zeta functions of Calabi-Yau threefolds, which is attached to this paper, is presented.</description>

      <title>Rogers-Ramanujan identities in Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the story of the Rogers-Ramanujan identities; being known for 85 years and having about 130 pure mathematics proofs, suddenly entering physics when Rodney Baxter solved the Hard Hexagon Model in Statistical Mechanics in 1980. We next cover the accompanying proofs by George E Andrews of other related Baxter identities arisen of Rogers-Ramanujan type, leading into a new flourishing partnership of Physics and Mathematics. Our narrative goes into the subsequent 44 years, explaining the progress in physics and mathematical analysis. Finally we show some related crossovers with regard to the Elliptic q-gamma function and some Vector Partition generating functional equations; the latter of which may be new. The present paper is essentially chapter 11 of a 32 chapter book to appear in June 2024.</description>

      <title>On the Paley RIP and Paley graph extractor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constructing explicit RIP matrices is an open problem in compressed sensing theory. In particular, it is quite challenging to construct explicit RIP matrices that break the square-root bottleneck. On the other hand, providing explicit $2$-source extractors is a fundamental problem in theoretical computer science, cryptography and combinatorics. Nowadays, there are only a few known constructions for explicit $2$-source extractors (with negligible errors) that break the half barrier for min-entropy.
  In this paper, we establish a new connection between RIP matrices breaking the square-root bottleneck and $2$-source extractors breaking the half barrier for min-entropy. Here we focus on an RIP matrix (called the Paley ETF) and a $2$-source extractor (called the Paley graph extractor), where both are defined from quadratic residues over the finite field of odd prime order $p\equiv 1 \pmod{4}$. As a main result, we prove that if the Paley ETF breaks the square-root bottleneck, then the Paley graph extractor breaks the half barrier for min-entropy as well. Since it is widely believed that the Paley ETF breaks the square-root bottleneck, our result accordingly provides a new affirmative intuition on the conjecture for the Paley graph extractor by Benny Chor and Oded Goldreich.</description>

      <title>Higher R\'edei reciprocity and integral points on conics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.14157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fix an integer $l$ such that $|l|$ is a prime $3$ modulo $4$. Let $d &gt; 0$ be a squarefree integer and let $N_d(x, y)$ be the principal binary quadratic form of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$. Building on a breakthrough of Alexander Smith, we give an asymptotic formula for the solubility of $N_d(x, y) = l$ in integers $x$ and $y$ as $d$ varies among squarefree integers divisible by $l$.
  As a corollary we give, in case $l &gt; 0$, an asymptotic formula for the event that the Hasse Unit Index of the field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-l}, \sqrt{d})$ is $2$ as $d$ varies over all positive squarefree integers. We also improve the results of Fouvry and Kl\"uners and recent results of Chan, Milovic and the authors on the solubility of the negative Pell equation. Our main new tool is a generalization of a classical reciprocity law due to R\'edei.</description>

      <title>Archimedean Zeta Integrals for Unitary Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.04302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive precise formulas for the archimedean Euler factors occurring in certain standard Langlands $L$-functions for unitary groups. In the 1980s, Paul Garrett, as well as Ilya Piatetski-Shapiro and Stephen Rallis (independently of Garrett), discovered integral representations of automorphic $L$-functions that are Eulerian but, in contrast to the Rankin--Selberg and Langlands--Shahidi methods, do not require that the automorphic representations to which the $L$-functions are associated are globally generic. Their approach, the doubling method, opened the door to a variety of applications that could not be handled by prior methods.
  For over three decades, though, the integrals occurring in the Euler factors at archimedean places for unitary groups eluded precise computation, except under particular simplifications (such as requiring certain representations to be one-dimensional, as Garrett did in the first major progress on this computation and only prior progress for general signatures). We compute these integrals for holomorphic discrete series of general vector weights for unitary groups of any signature. This has consequences not only for special values of $L$-functions in the archimedean setting, but also for $p$-adic $L$-functions, where the corresponding term had remained open.</description>

      <title>Bias in cubic Gauss sums: Patterson's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.07463v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $W$ be a smooth test function with compact support in $(0,\infty)$. Conditional on the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis for Hecke $L$-functions over $\mathbb{Q}(\omega)$, we prove that $$\sum_{p \equiv 1 \pmod{3}} \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{p}} \cdot \Big ( \sum_{x \pmod{p}} e^{2\pi i x^3 / p} \Big ) W \Big ( \frac{p}{X} \Big ) \sim \frac{(2\pi)^{2/3}}{3 \Gamma(\tfrac 23)} \int_{0}^{\infty} W(x) x^{-1/6} dx \cdot \frac{X^{5/6}}{\log X},$$ as $X \rightarrow \infty$ and $p$ runs over primes. This explains a well-known numerical bias in the distribution of cubic Gauss sums first observed by Kummer in 1846 and confirms (conditionally on the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis) a conjecture of Patterson from 1978.
  There are two important byproducts of our proof. The first is an explicit level aspect Voronoi summation formula for cubic Gauss sums, extending computations of Patterson and Yoshimoto. Secondly, we show that Heath-Brown's cubic large sieve is sharp up to factors of $X^{o(1)}$ under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. This disproves the popular belief that the cubic large sieve can be improved.
  An important ingredient in our proof is a dispersion estimate for cubic Gauss sums. It can be interpreted as a cubic large sieve with correction by a non-trivial asymptotic main term. This estimate relies on the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, and is one of the fundamental reasons why our result is conditional.</description>

We show that $\Delta$ is congruent to an Eisenstein series $E_{k,\chi, \psi}$ modulo $p$ for explicit choices of $k$ and Dirichlet characters $\chi$ and $\psi$. We then prove formulae describing the Iwasawa invariants of the Mazur--Tate elements attached to $\Delta$, confirming numerical data gathered by the authors in a previous work.</description>

      <title>On a finite sum of cosecants appearing in various problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the finite sum of cosecants $\sum\csc\big(\varphi+a\pi l/n\big),$ where the index $l$ runs through 1 to $n-1$ and $\varphi$ and $a$ are arbitrary parameters, as well as several closely related sums, such as similar sums of a series of secants, of tangents and of cotangents. These trigonometric sums appear in various problems in mathematics, physics, and a variety of related disciplines. Their particular cases were fragmentarily considered in previous works, and it was noted that even a simple particular case $\sum\csc\big(\pi l/n\big)$ does not have a closed-form, i.e. a compact summation formula. In the paper, we derive several alternative representations for the above-mentioned sums, study their properties, relate them to many other finite and infinite sums, obtain their complete asymptotic expansions for large $n$ and provide accurate upper and lower bounds (e.g. the typical relative error for the upper bound is lesser than $2\times10^{-9}$ for $n\geqslant10$ and lesser than $7\times10^{-14}$ for $n\geqslant50$, which is much better than the bounds we could find in previous works). Our researches reveal that these sums are deeply related to several special numbers and functions, especially to the digamma function (furthermore, as a by-product, we obtain several interesting summations formulae for the digamma function). Asymptotical studies show that these sums may have qualitatively different behaviour depending on the choice of $\varphi$ and $a$; in particular, as $n$ increases some of them may become sporadically large. Finally, we also provide several historical remarks related to various sums considered in the paper. We show that some results in the field either were rediscovered several times or can easily be deduced from various known formulae, including some formulae dating back to the XVIIIth century.</description>

      <title>The Density of Borromean Primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an asymptotic distribution of sets of primes satisfying certain "linking conditions" in arithmetic topology, namely, conditions given by the Legendre and R\'edei symbols among sets of primes. As our Main Theorem, we prove an asymptotic density formula for Borromean primes among all primes. For the proof, we use the effective Chebotarev density formula under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis and explicit computations of discriminants of the number fields involved in R\'edei's extension.</description>

      <title>Estimates for trilinear and quadrilinear character sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain new bounds on some trilinear and quadrilinear character sums, which are non-trivial starting from very short ranges of the variables. An application to an apparently new problem on oscillations of characters on differences between Farey fractions is given. Other applications include a modular analogue of a multiplicative hybrid problem of Iwaniec and S\'ark\"ozy (1987) and the solvability of some prime type equations with constraints.</description>

      <title>Proof of the Complete Presence of a Modulo 4 Bias for the Semiprimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dummit, Granville and Kisilevsky have recently shown that the proportion of semiprimes (products of two primes) not exceeding a given $x$, whose factors are congruent to $3$ modulo $4$, is more than a quarter when $x$ is sufficiently large. They have also conjectured that this holds from the very beginning, that is, for all $x \geq 9$. We give a proof for $x\geq 10^{21}$ via an explicit approach based on their work. Together with their data for the remaining $x$, this results in a full proof of the conjecture. Our method consists of techniques with cancellations of sums over primes with different remainders. We also rely on classical estimates for prime counting functions, as well as on very recent explicit improvements by Bennet, Martin, O'Bryant and Rechnitzer, which have wide applications in essentially any setting involving estimations of sums over primes.</description>

      <title>Building Data for Stacky Covers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.10290v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define stacky building data for stacky covers in the spirit of Pardini and give an equivalence of (2,1)-categories between the category of stacky covers and the category of stacky building data. We show that every stacky cover is a flat root stack in the sense of Olsson and Borne--Vistoli and give an intrinsic description of it as a root stack using stacky building data. When the base scheme S is defined over a field, we give a criterion for when a birational building datum comes from a tamely ramified cover for a finite abelian group scheme, generalizing a result of Biswas--Borne.</description>

      <title>Integral of depth zero to three basis of Modular Graph Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07287v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modular Graph Functions (MGFs) are SL(2,$\mathbb{Z}$)-invariant functions that emerge in the study of the low-energy expansion of the one-loop closed string amplitude. To find the string scattering amplitude, we must integrate MGFs over the moduli space of the torus. In this paper, we use the iterated integral representation of MGFs to establish a depth-dependent basis for them, where "depth" refers to the number of iterations in the integral. This basis has a suitable Laplace equation. We integrate this basis from depth zero to depth three over the fundamental domain of SL(2,$\mathbb{Z}$) with a cut-off.</description>

      <title>The Riemann hypothesis and dynamics of Backtracking New Q-Newton's method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new variant of Newton's method -- named Backtracking New Q-Newton's method (BNQN) -- was recently introduced by the second author. This method has good convergence guarantees, specially concerning finding roots of meromorphic functions. This paper explores using BNQN for the Riemann xi function. We show in particular that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to that all attractors of BNQN lie on the critical line. We also explain how an apparent relation between the basins of attraction of BNQN and Voronoi's diagram can be helpful for verifying the Riemann hypothesis or finding a counterexample to it. Some illustrating experimental results are included, which convey some interesting phenomena. The experiments show that BNQN works very stably with highly transcendental functions like the Riemann xi function and its derivatives. Based on insights from the experiments, we discuss some concrete steps on using BNQN towards the Riemann hypothesis. Ideas and results from this paper can be extended to other zeta functions.</description>

      <title>A Specialisation Theorem for Lang-N\'eron Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that, for a polarised smooth projective variety $B \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^n_k$ of dimension $\geq 2$ over an infinite field $k$ and an abelian variety $A$ over the function field of $B$, there exists a dense Zariski open set of smooth geometrically connected hyperplane sections $h$ of $B$ such that $A$ has good reduction at $h$ and the specialisation homomorphism of Lang-N\'eron groups at $h$ is injective (up to a finite $p$-group in positive characteristic $p$). This gives a positive answer to a conjecture of the first author, which is used to deduce a negative definiteness result on his refined height pairing. This also sheds a new light on N\'eron's specialisation theorem.</description>
