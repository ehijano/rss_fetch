      <title>Modeling collagen fibril degradation as a function of matrix microarchitecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collagenolytic degradation is a process fundamental to tissue remodeling. The microarchitecture of collagen fibril networks changes during development, aging, and disease. Such changes to microarchitecture are often accompanied by changes in matrix degradability. In vitro, collagen matrices of the same concentration but different microarchitectures also vary in degradation rate. How do different microarchitectures affect matrix degradation? To answer this question, we developed a computational model of collagen degradation. We first developed a lattice model that describes collagen degradation at the scale of a single fibril. We then extended this model to investigate the role of microarchitecture using Brownian dynamics simulation of enzymes in a multi-fibril three dimensional matrix to predict its degradability. Our simulations predict that the distribution of enzymes around the fibrils is non-uniform and depends on the microarchitecture of the matrix. This non-uniformity in enzyme distribution can lead to different extents of degradability for matrices of different microarchitectures. Our model predictions were tested using in vitro experiments with synthesized collagen gels of different microarchitectures. Experiments showed that indeed degradation of collagen depends on the matrix architecture and fibril thickness. In summary, our study shows that the microarchitecture of the collagen matrix is an important determinant of its degradability.</description>

      <title>Effects of time-delay couplings in the collective frequency of network oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we construct such systems with the Kuramoto model of globally coupled oscillators with time-delayed positive and negative couplings to explore the impact of coupling time delays in the collective frequency of synchronized oscillations. We discuss various identical and nonidentical systems with fixed and exponential distributed delays and derive relationships between the coupling delay and collective frequency for a stably synchronized state. For the nonidentical system of coupled oscillators, we consider the Lorentzian distribution of intrinsic frequencies and exponential distributions of coupling time delays in coupled oscillators, and analytically derived the collective frequency-time delay relationship. We found that the collective frequency of the network oscillations is dependent on both coupling strength and time delay. In identical cases, the network frequency decreases in most cases of positive coupling and increases in a negative coupling with increasing. In non-identical cases with distributed delays, along with the modulations in the network frequency, we discussed time-delay coupling can also lead to the appearance of bifurcations and transitions in the system's behavior resulting in the emergence of new patterns and the breakdown of existing ones. We discuss the implications of these results in understanding the behaviors of the natural systems.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Weakly Supervised Learning for Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning plays an increasingly important role in computational chemistry and materials science, complementing computationally intensive ab initio and first-principles methods. Despite their utility, machine-learning models often lack generalization capability and robustness during atomistic simulations, yielding unphysical energy and force predictions that hinder their real-world applications. We address this challenge by introducing a physics-informed, weakly supervised approach for training machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs). We introduce two novel loss functions, extrapolating the potential energy via a Taylor expansion and using the concept of conservative forces. Our approach improves the accuracy of MLIPs applied to training tasks with sparse training data sets and reduces the need for pre-training computationally demanding models with large data sets. Particularly, we perform extensive experiments demonstrating reduced energy and force errors -- often lower by a factor of two -- for various baseline models and benchmark data sets. Finally, we show that our approach facilitates MLIPs' training in a setting where the computation of forces is infeasible at the reference level, such as those employing complete-basis-set extrapolation.</description>

      <title>Programmable Lipid Nanoparticles for Precision Drug Delivery: A Four-Domain Model Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Programmable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) offer precise spatiotemporal control over drug distribution and release, a critical advancement for treating complex diseases like cancer and genetic disorders. While existing reviews offer extensive insights into LNP development, this work introduces a novel model that dissects key components of LNP design, providing a framework to enhance the rational design of programmable LNPs. This review introduces a novel Four-Domain Model - Architecture, Interface, Payload, and Dispersal - providing a modular perspective that emphasizes the programmability of LNPs. We explore the dynamics between LNPs components and their environment throughout their lifecycle, focusing on thermodynamic stability during synthesis, storage, delivery, and drug release. Through these four distinct but interconnected domains, we introduce the concept of input stimuli, functional components, and output responses. This modular approach offers new perspectives for the rational design of programmable nanocarriers for exquisite control over payload release while minimizing off-target effects. Advances in bioinspired design principles could lead to LNPs that mimic natural biological systems, enhancing their biocompatibility and functionality. This review summarizes recent advancements, identifies challenges, and offers outlooks for programmable LNPs, emphasizing their potential to evolve into more intelligent, naturally integrated systems that enhance scalability and reduce side effects.</description>

      <title>Kinetoplast DNA: a polymer physicist's Olympic dream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All life forms are miraculous, but some are more inexplicable than others. Trypanosomes are by far one of the most puzzling organisms on Earth: their mitochondrial genome, also called kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) forms an Olympic-ring-like network of interlinked DNA circles, challenging conventional paradigms in both biology and physics. In this review, I will discuss kDNA from the astonished perspective of a polymer physicist and tell a story of how a single sub-celluar structure from a blood-dwelling parasite is inspiring generations of polymer chemists and physicists to create new catenated materials.</description>

      <title>Effective and efficient modeling of the hydrodynamics for bacterial flagella</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic interactions between bacterial flagella and surrounding boundaries are important for bacterial motility and gait in complex environment. By modeling each flagellar filament that is both thin and long as a string of spheres, we show that such hydrodynamic interactions can be accurately described through a resistance tensor, which can be efficiently evaluated numerically. For the case of close interaction between one bacterium and one passive colloidal sphere, we see notable difference between results from our model and those from the resistive force theory, showing that the error arises from negligence of the width of flagellar filaments in resistive force theory can be strong.</description>

      <title>Efficient multiphoton microscopy with picosecond laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12911v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiphoton microscopes employ femtosecond lasers as light sources because the high peak power of the ultrashort pulse allows for multiphoton excitation of fluorescence in the examined sample. However, such short pulses are susceptible to broadening in a microscope's highly dispersive optical elements and require careful dispersion management, otherwise decreasing excitation efficiency. Here, we have developed a 10 nJ Yb:fiber picosecond laser with an integrated pulse picker unit and evaluated its performance in multiphoton microscopy. Our results show that performance comparable to femtosecond pulses can be obtained with picosecond pulses only by reducing the pulse repetition rate and that such pulses are significantly less prone to the effect of chromatic dispersion. These findings proved that the temporal compression of fiber lasers is not always efficient, and it can be omitted by using a smaller and easier-to-use all-fiber setup.

      <title>Motility driven glassy dynamics in confluent epithelial monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08437v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As wounds heal, embryos develop, cancer spreads, or asthma progresses, the cellular monolayer undergoes glass transition between solid-like jammed and fluid-like flowing states. During some of these processes, the cells undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT): they acquire in-plane polarity and become motile. Thus, how motility drives the glassy dynamics in epithelial systems is critical for the EMT process. However, no analytical framework that is indispensable for deeper insights exists. Here, we develop such a theory inspired by a well-known glass theory. One crucial result of this work is that the confluency affects the effective persistence time-scale of active force, described by its rotational diffusivity, $D_r^{\text{eff}}$. $D_r^{\text{eff}}$ differs from the bare rotational diffusivity, $D_r$, of the motile force due to cell shape dynamics, which acts to rectify the force dynamics: $D_r^{\text{eff}}$ is equal to $D_r$ when $D_r$ is small and saturates when $D_r$ is large. We test the theoretical prediction of $D_r^{\text{eff}}$ and how it affects the relaxation dynamics in our simulations of active Vertex model. This novel effect of $D_r^{\text{eff}}$ is crucial to understanding the new and previously published simulation data of active glassy dynamics in epithelial monolayers.</description>

      <title>Universal Non-equilibrium Response Theory Beyond Steady States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10952v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluctuation-dissipation relations elucidate the response of near-equilibrium systems to environmental changes, with recent advances extending response theory to non-equilibrium steady states. However, a general response theory for systems evolving far from steady states has remained elusive. Using information geometry of stochastic trajectory probabilities, we derive universal thermodynamic bounds on both linear and nonlinear responses of Markov systems to environmental changes, applicable across all non-equilibrium regimes. This theory establishes a new paradigm in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, offering a unified perspective on the responsiveness of non-stationary systems to external control and environmental changes. Applicable to systems ranging from biological sensory processes to engineered responsive materials, our framework paves the way for understanding and designing complex responsiveness in far-from-equilibrium stochastic systems.</description>
