      <title>Non-Destructive, High-Resolution, Chemically Specific, 3D Nanostructure Characterization using Phase-Sensitive EUV Imaging Reflectometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation nano and quantum devices have increasingly complex 3D structure. As the dimensions of these devices shrink to the nanoscale, their performance is often governed by interface quality or precise chemical or dopant composition. Here we present the first phase-sensitive extreme ultraviolet imaging reflectometer. It combines the excellent phase stability of coherent high-harmonic sources, the unique chemical- and phase-sensitivity of extreme ultraviolet reflectometry, and state-of-the-art ptychography imaging algorithms. This tabletop microscope can non-destructively probe surface topography, layer thicknesses, and interface quality, as well as dopant concentrations and profiles. High-fidelity imaging was achieved by implementing variable-angle ptychographic imaging, by using total variation regularization to mitigate noise and artifacts in the reconstructed image, and by using a high-brightness, high-harmonic source with excellent intensity and wavefront stability. We validate our measurements through multiscale, multimodal imaging to show that this technique has unique advantages compared with other techniques based on electron and scanning-probe microscopies.</description>

      <title>Factors Affecting Terahertz Emission from InGaN Quantum Wells under Ultrafast Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: InGaN quantum wells (QWs) grown on c-plane sapphire substrate experience strain due to the lattice mismatch. The strain generates a strong piezoelectric field in QWs that contributes to THz emission under ultrafast excitation. Physical parameters such as QW width, period number, and Indium concentration can affect the strength of the piezoelectric field and result in THz emission. Experimental parameters such as pump fluence, laser energy, excitation power, pump polarization angle, and incident angle can be tuned to further optimize the THz emission. This review summarizes the effects of physical and experimental parameters of THz emission on InGaN QWs. Comparison and relationship between photoluminescence properties and THz emission in QWs are given, which further explains the origin of THz emission in InGaN QWs.</description>

      <title>Plasmon-enhanced chiral absorption through electric dipole-electric quadrupole interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enantioselective interactions of chiral molecules include distinct absorptions to opposite-handed circularly polarized light, known as chiral absorption. Traditionally, chiral absorption has been primarily attributed to electric dipole and magnetic dipole interaction with molecular chirality. However, this approach falls short for large molecules that support high-order multipolar components, such as electric quadrupole moment. Here, we introduce a theoretical model to study the chiral absorption of large molecules in the presence of plasmonic nanostructures. This model considers both electric dipole-magnetic dipole interaction and electric dipole-electric quadrupole interaction enhanced by a resonant structure. We numerically study such interactions of the chiral molecular solution in the vicinity of a nonchiral plasmonic nano-resonator. Our results show the distinct spectral information of the chiral media on- and off-resonance of the resonator.</description>

      <title>Wide-mode-area slow light waveguides in valley photonic crystal heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We designed slow-light waveguides with a wide mode area based on slab-type valley photonic crystal (VPhC) heterostructures which are composed of a graphene-like PhC sandwiched by two topologically distinct VPhCs. The group velocity of the topological guided mode hosted in a VPhC heterostructure can be slowed down by shifting the VPhC lattice toward the graphene-like PhC at the domain interfaces. Simultaneously, the mode width of the slow-light topological guided mode can be widened by increasing the size of the graphene-like PhC domain. We found that employing the graphene-like structure at the center domain is crucial for realizing a topological single-guided mode in such heterostructures. Furthermore, the impact of random fluctuations in air-hole size in the graphene-like domain was numerically investigated. Our simulation results demonstrate that the transmittance for the slow-light states can be kept high as far as the size fluctuation is small although it drops faster than that for fast-light states when the disorder level increases. The designed wide-mode-area slow-light waveguides are based on hole-based PhCs, offering novel on-chip applications of topological waveguides.</description>

      <title>Nanophotonic inspection of deep-subwavelength integrated optoelectronic chips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial nanostructures with ultrafine and deep-subwavelength feature sizes have emerged as a paradigm-shifting platform to advanced light field management, becoming a key building block for high-performance integrated optoelectronics and flat optics. However, direct optical inspection of such integrated chips with densely packed complex and small features remains a missing metrology gap that hinders quick feedback between design and fabrications. Here, we demonstrate that photothermal nonlinear scattering microscopy can be utilized for direct imaging and resolving of integrated optoelectronic chips beyond the diffraction limit. We reveal that the inherent coupling among deep-subwavelength nanostructures supporting leaky resonances allows for the pronounced heating effect to access reversible nonlinear modulations of the confocal reflection intensity, leading to optical resolving power down to 80 nm (~lambda/7). The versatility of this approach has been exemplified by direct imaging of silicon grating couplers and metalens with a minimum critical dimension of 100 nm, as well as central processing unit (CPU) chip with 45 nm technology, unfolding the long-sought possibility of in-situ, non-destructive, high-throughput optical inspection of integrated optoelectronic chips and nanophotonic chips.</description>

      <title>Probing microcavity resonance spectra with intracavity emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the fluorescence spectrum of broadband emitters in an open optical microcavity with radius of curvature R = 17.7(3) um and finesse F ~= 1000. This geometry enables a combined measurement of emission spectra versus cavity length, which has several benefits over measurements at fixed wavelength or fixed cavity length alone. We demonstrate the role of the optical penetration depths on the cavity modes and provide practical working equations for its analysis. Furthermore, we show the ability to measure the coupling of cavity modes within a small scan range of the cavity length. By measuring these cavity emission spectra as a function of cavity length, we thus obtain a rich and complete picture of the optical microcavity.</description>

      <title>Ultrastable lasers: investigations of crystalline mirrors and closed cycle cooling at 124 K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated crystalline AlGaAs/GaAs optical coatings with three ultra-stable cavities operating at 4 K, 16 K, 124 K and 297 K. The response of the resonance frequencies of cavities to variations in optical power indicates effects beyond the photo-thermo-optic effect observed in dielectric coatings. These effects are strongly dependent on the intensity of the intracavity light at 1.5~\textmu m. When the rear side of the mirrors is illuminated with external light, we observe a prominent photo-modified birefringence for photon energies above the GaAs bandgap, which points to a possible mechanism relating our observations to the semiconductor properties of the coatings. Separately, we also present a low maintenance evolution of our 124 K silicon cavity system where the liquid nitrogen based cooling system is replaced with closed cycle cooling from a pulse-tube cryo-cooler.</description>

      <title>Stable patterns in the Lugiato-Lefever equation with a confined vortex pump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a model of a passive optical cavity based on a novel variety of the two-dimensional Lugiato-Lefever equation, with a localized pump carrying intrinsic vorticity S, and the cubic or cubic-quintic nonlinearity. Up to S = 5, stable confined vortex-ring states (vortex pixels) are produced by means of a variational approximation and in a numerical form. Surprisingly, vast stability areas of the vortex states are found, for both the self-focusing and defocusing signs of the nonlinearity, in the plane of the pump and loss parameters. When the vortex-rings are unstable, they are destroyed by azimuthal perturbations which break the axial symmetry. The results suggest new possibilities for mode manipulations in passive nonlinear photonic media by means of appropriately designed pump beams.</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanics and pressure of composite multimoded weakly nonlinear optical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical mechanics can provide a versatile theoretical framework for investigating the collective dynamics of weakly nonlinear waves-settings that can be utterly complex to describe otherwise. In optics, composite systems arise due to interactions between different frequencies and/or polarizations. The purpose of this work is to develop a thermodynamic theory that takes into account the synergistic action of multiple components. We find that the type of the nonlinearity involved can have important implications in the thermalization process and, hence, can lead to different thermal equilibrium conditions. Importantly, we derive closed-form expressions for the actual optomechanical pressure that is exerted on the system. In particular, the total optomechanical pressure is the sum of the partial pressures due to each component. Our results can be applied to a variety of weakly nonlinear optical settings such as multimode fibers, bulk waveguides, photonic lattices, and coupled microresonators. We present two specific examples, where two colors interact in a waveguide array with either a cubic or quadratic nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Generation, manipulation and detection of snake state trajectories of a neutral atom in a ring-cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.11926v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a set-up to create and detect the atomic counterpart of snake state trajectories which occur at the interface where the magnetic field reverses direction. Such a magnetic field is generated by coupling two counter-propagating modes of a ring cavity to a two-level atom. The spatial distribution and the strength of the induced magnetic field are controlled by the transverse mode profile of the cavity modes and the number of photons in the two modes, respectively. By analysing the atomic motion in such a magnetic field while including the cavity back-action, we find that the atom follows snake state trajectories which can be non-destructively detected and reconstructed from the phase and the intensity of the light field leaking from the cavity. We finally show that the system parameters can be tuned to modify the transport properties of the snake states and even amplify the effect of cavity feedback which can completely alter their topology.</description>

      <title>Photonic quantum walk with ultrafast time-bin encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum walk (QW) has proven to be a valuable testbed for fundamental inquiries in quantum technology applications such as quantum simulation and quantum search algorithms. Many benefits have been found by exploring implementations of QWs in various physical systems, including photonic platforms. Here, we propose a novel platform to perform quantum walks using an ultrafast time-bin encoding (UTBE) scheme. This platform supports the scalability of quantum walks to a large number of steps while retaining a significant degree of programmability. More importantly, ultrafast time bins are encoded at the picosecond time scale, far away from mechanical fluctuations. This enables the scalability of our platform to many modes while preserving excellent interferometric phase stability over extremely long periods of time without requiring active phase stabilization. Our 18-step QW is shown to preserve interferometric phase stability over a period of 50 hours, with an overall walk fidelity maintained above $95\%$</description>

      <title>Astrophotonics: recent and future developments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophotonics is a burgeoning field that lies at the interface of photonics and modern astronomical instrumentation. Here we provide a pedagogical review of basic photonic functions that enable modern instruments, and give an overview of recent and future applications. Traditionally, optical fibres have been used in innovative ways to vastly increase the multiplex advantage of an astronomical instrument, e.g. the ability to observe hundreds or thousands of stars simultaneously. But modern instruments are using many new photonic functions, some emerging from the telecom industry, and others specific to the demands of adaptive optics systems on modern telescopes. As telescopes continue to increase in size, we look to a future where instruments exploit the properties of individual photons. In particular, we envisage telescopes and interferometers that build on international developments in quantum networks, the so-called quantum internet. With the aid of entangled photons and quantum logic gates, the new infrastructures seek to preserve the photonic state and timing of individual photons over a coherent network.</description>

      <title>Efficient ultra-broadband low-resolution astrophotonic spectrographs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Broadband low-resolution near-infrared spectrographs in a compact form are crucial for ground- and space-based astronomy and other fields of sensing. Astronomical spectroscopy poses stringent requirements including high efficiency, broad band operation ($&gt;$ 300 nm), and in some cases, polarization insensitivity. We present and compare experimental results from the design, fabrication, and characterization of broadband (1200 - 1650 nm) arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) spectrographs built using the two most promising low-loss platforms - Si$_3$N$_4$ (rectangular waveguides) and doped-SiO$_2$ (square waveguides). These AWGs have a resolving power ($\lambda/\Delta\lambda$) of ~200, a free spectral range of ~ 200-350 nm, and a small footprint of ~ 50-100 mm$^2$. The peak overall (fiber-chip-fiber) efficiency of the doped-SiO$_2$ AWG was ~ 79\% (1 dB), and it exhibited a negligible polarization-dependent shift compared to the channel spacing. For Si$_3$N$_4$ AWGs, the peak overall efficiency in TE mode was ~ 50\% (3 dB), and the main loss component was found to be fiber-to-chip coupling losses. These broadband AWGs are key to enabling compact integrations such as multi-object spectrographs or dispersion back-ends for other astrophotonic devices such as photonic lanterns or nulling interferometers.</description>

      <title>Designing a Photonic Physically Unclonable Function Having Resilience to Machine Learning Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physically unclonable functions (PUFs) are designed to act as device 'fingerprints.' Given an input challenge, the PUF circuit should produce an unpredictable response for use in situations such as root-of-trust applications and other hardware-level cybersecurity applications. PUFs are typically subcircuits present within integrated circuits (ICs), and while conventional IC PUFs are well-understood, several implementations have proven vulnerable to malicious exploits, including those perpetrated by machine learning (ML)-based attacks. Such attacks can be difficult to prevent because they are often designed to work even when relatively few challenge-response pairs are known in advance. Hence the need for both more resilient PUF designs and analysis of ML-attack susceptibility. Previous work has developed a PUF for photonic integrated circuits (PICs). A PIC PUF not only produces unpredictable responses given manufacturing-introduced tolerances, but is also less prone to electromagnetic radiation eavesdropping attacks than a purely electronic IC PUF. In this work, we analyze the resilience of the proposed photonic PUF when subjected to ML-based attacks. Specifically, we describe a computational PUF model for producing the large datasets required for training ML attacks; we analyze the quality of the model; and we discuss the modeled PUF's susceptibility to ML-based attacks. We find that the modeled PUF generates distributions that resemble uniform white noise, explaining the exhibited resilience to neural-network-based attacks designed to exploit latent relationships between challenges and responses. Preliminary analysis suggests that the PUF exhibits similar resilience to generative adversarial networks, and continued development will show whether more-sophisticated ML approaches better compromise the PUF and -- if so -- how design modifications might improve resilience.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A coherent seeded SU(1,1) interferometer provides a prominent technique in the field of precision measurement. We theoretically study the phase sensitivity of SU(1,1) interferometer with Kerr state seeding under single intensity and homodyne detection schemes. To find the lower bound in this case we calculate the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound using the quantum Fisher information technique. We found that, under some conditions, the Kerr seeding performs better in phase sensitivity compared to the well-known vacuum and coherent seeded case. We expect that the Kerr state might act as an alternative non-classical state in the field of quantum information and sensing technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum metrology leverages quantum correlations for enhanced parameter estimation. Recently, structured light enabled increased resolution and sensitivity in quantum metrology systems. However, lossy and complex setups impacting photon flux, hinder true quantum advantage while using high dimensional structured light. We introduce a straightforward mechanical rotation quantum sensing mechanism, employing high-dimensional structured light and a compact high-flux (45,000 coincidence counts per second) N00N state source with N=2. The system utilizes two opposite spiral phase plates with topological charge of up to l=16 that convert mechanical rotation into wavefront phase shifts, and exhibit a 16-fold enhanced super-resolution and 25-fold enhanced sensitivity between different topological charges, while retaining the acquisition times and with negligible change in coincidence count. Furthermore, the high photon flux enables to detect mechanical angular acceleration in real-time. Our approach paves the way for highly sensitive quantum measurements, applicable to various interferometric schemes.</description>

      <title>Design of cycloidal rays in optical waveguides in analogy to the fastest descent problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.01225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present the design of cycloidal waveguides from a gradient refractive index (GRIN) medium in analogy to the fastest descending problem in classical mechanics. Light rays propagate along cycloids in this medium, of which the refractive index can be determined from relating to the descending speed under gravity force. It can be used as GRIN lenses or waveguides, and the frequency specific focusing and imaging properties have been discussed. The results suggest that the waveguide can be viewed as an optical filter. Its frequency response characteristics change with the refractive index profile and the device geometries.</description>

      <title>High-performance real-world optical computing trained by in situ model-free optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11957v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical computing systems provide high-speed and low-energy data processing but face deficiencies in computationally demanding training and simulation-to-reality gaps. We propose a gradient-based model-free optimization (G-MFO) method based on a Monte Carlo gradient estimation algorithm for computationally efficient in situ training of optical computing systems. This approach treats an optical computing system as a black box and back-propagates the loss directly to the optical computing weights' probability distributions, circumventing the need for a computationally heavy and biased system simulation. Our experiments on diffractive optical computing systems show that G-MFO outperforms hybrid training on the MNIST and FMNIST datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate image-free and high-speed classification of cells from their marker-free phase maps. Our method's model-free and high-performance nature, combined with its low demand for computational resources, paves the way for accelerating the transition of optical computing from laboratory demonstrations to practical, real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Giant Optical Anisotropy in 2D Metal-Organic Chalcogenates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical anisotropy is a fundamental attribute of some crystalline materials and is quantified via birefringence. A birefringent crystal not only gives rise to asymmetrical light propagation but also attenuation along two distinct polarizations, a phenomenon called linear dichroism (LD). Two-dimensional (2D) layered materials with high in- and out-of-plane anisotropy have garnered interest in this regard. Mithrene, a 2D metal-organic chalcogenate (MOCHA) compound, exhibits strong excitonic resonances due to its naturally occurring multi-quantum well (MQW) structure and in-plane anisotropic response in the blue wavelength (~400-500 nm) regime. The MQW structure and the large refractive indices of mithrene allow the hybridization of the excitons with photons to form self-hybridized exciton-polaritons in mithrene crystals with appropriate thicknesses. Here, we report the giant birefringence (~1.01) and tunable in-plane anisotropic response of mithrene, which stem from its low symmetry crystal structure and unique excitonic properties. We show that the LD in mithrene can be tuned by leveraging the anisotropic exciton-polariton formation via the cavity coupling effect exhibiting giant in-plane LD (~77.1%) at room temperature. Our results indicate that mithrene is an ideal polaritonic birefringent material for polarization-sensitive nanophotonic applications in the short wavelength regime.</description>

      <title>Ptycho-endoscopy on a lensless ultrathin fiber bundle tip</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) utilizes an aircraft-carried antenna to emit electromagnetic pulses and detect the returning echoes. As the aircraft travels across a designated area, it synthesizes a large virtual aperture to improve image resolution. Inspired by SAR, we introduce synthetic aperture ptycho-endoscopy (SAPE) for micro-endoscopic imaging beyond the diffraction limit. SAPE operates by hand-holding a lensless fiber bundle tip to record coherent diffraction patterns from specimens. The fiber cores at the distal tip modulate the diffracted wavefield within a confined area, emulating the role of the 'airborne antenna' in SAR. The handheld operation introduces positional shifts to the tip, analogous to the aircraft's movement. These shifts facilitate the acquisition of a ptychogram and synthesize a large virtual aperture extending beyond the bundle's physical limit. We mitigate the influences of hand motion and fiber bending through a low-rank spatiotemporal decomposition of the bundle's modulation profile. Our tests demonstrate the ability to resolve a 548-nm linewidth on a resolution target. Furthermore, SAPE's refocusing capability enables imaging over an extended depth of field exceeding 2 cm. The aperture synthesizing process in SAPE surpasses the diffraction limit set by the probe's maximum collection angle, heralding new opportunities for both fiber-based and distal-chip endoscopy.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of the shadow of a laser beam</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light, being massless, casts no shadow; under ordinary circumstances, photons pass right through each other unimpeded. Here, we demonstrate a laser beam acting like an object - the beam casts a shadow upon a surface when the beam is illuminated by another light source. We observe a regular shadow in the sense it can be seen by the naked eye, it follows the contours of the surface it falls on, and it follows the position and shape of the object (the laser beam). Specifically, we use a nonlinear optical process involving four atomic levels of ruby. We are able to control the intensity of a transmitted laser beam by applying another perpendicular laser beam. We experimentally measure the dependence of the contrast of the shadow on the power of the object laser beam, finding a maximum of approximately of approximately 22 percent, similar to that of a shadow of a tree on a sunny day. We provide a theoretical model that predicts the contrast of the shadow. Making light itself cast a shadow opens new possibilities for fabrication, imaging, and illumination.</description>

      <title>Toward Optimum Coupling between Free Electrons and Confined Optical Modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Free electrons are unique tools to probe and manipulate nanoscale optical fields with emerging applications in ultrafast spectromicroscopy and quantum metrology. However, advances in this field are hindered by the small probability associated with the excitation of single optical modes by individual free electrons. Here, we theoretically investigate the scaling properties of the electron-driven excitation probability for a wide variety of optical modes including plasmons in metallic nanostructures and Mie resonances in dielectric cavities, spanning a broad spectral range that extends from the ultraviolet to the infrared. The highest probabilities for the direct generation of three-dimensionally confined modes are observed at low electron and mode energies in small structures, with order-unity ($\sim100$\%) coupling demanding the use of $&lt;100$~eV electrons interacting with $&lt;1$~eV polaritons confined down to tens of nm. Electronic transitions in artificial atoms also emerge as practical systems to realize strong coupling to few-eV free electrons. In contrast, conventional dielectric cavities reach a maximum probability in the few-percent range. In addition, we show that waveguide modes can be generated with higher-than-unity efficiency by phase-matched interaction with grazing electrons, suggesting an efficient method to create multiple excitations of a localized optical mode by an individual electron through funneling the so-generated propagating photons into a confining cavity -- an alternative approach to direct electron-cavity interaction. Our work provides a roadmap to optimize electron-photon coupling with potential applications in electron spectromicroscopy as well as nonlinear and quantum optics at the nanoscale.</description>

Abstract: Here we are investigating the enhancement in phase sensitivity and resolution in Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) based quantum LiDAR. We are using multi-photonic state (MPS), superposition of four coherent states [1], as the input state and binary outcome parity photon counting measurement and binary outcome zero-nonzero photon counting measurement as the measurement schemes. We thoroughly investigate the results in lossless as well as in lossy cases. We found enhancement in resolution and phase sensitivity in comparison to the coherent state and even coherent superposition state (ECSS) based quantum LiDAR. Our analysis shows that MPS may be an alternative nonclassical resource in the field of quantum imaging and quantum sensing technologies, like in quantum LiDAR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (TDTS) experiments demonstrating strong light-matter coupling in a terahertz (THz) LC-metamaterial in which the phonon resonance of a topological insulator (TI) thin film is coupled to the photonic modes of an array of electronic split-ring resonators. As we tune the metamaterial resonance frequency through the frequency of the low frequency $\alpha$ mode of (Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$)$_2$Te$_3$ (BST), we observe strong mixing and level repulsion between phonon and metamaterial resonance. This hybrid resonance is a phonon polariton. We observe a normalized coupling strength, $\eta$ = $\Omega_R$/$\omega_c$ $\approx$ 0.09, using the measured vacuum Rabi frequency and cavity resonance. Our results demonstrate that one can tune the mechanical properties of materials by changing their electromagnetic environment and therefore modify their magnetic and topological degrees of freedom via coupling to the lattice in this fashion.</description>

      <title>Coherence in resonance fluorescence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resonance fluorescence (RF) of a two-level emitter displays persistently anti-bunching irrespective of the excitation intensity, but inherits the driving laser's linewidth under weak excitation. These properties are commonly explained disjoinedly as the emitter's single photon saturation or passively scattering light, until a recent theory attributes anti-bunching to the laser-like spectrum's interference with the incoherently scattered light. However, the theory implies higher-order scattering processes, and led to an experiment purporting to validate an atom's simultaneous scattering of two photons. If true, it could complicate RF's prospects in quantum information applications. Here, we propose a unified model that treats all RF photons as spontaneous emission, one at a time, and can explain simultaneously both the RF's spectral and correlation properties. We theoretically derive the excitation power dependencies, with the strongest effects measurable at the single-photon incidence level, of the first-order coherence of the whole RF and super-bunching of the spectrally filtered, followed by experimental confirmation on a semiconductor quantum dot micro-pillar device. Furthermore, our model explains peculiar coincidence bunching observed in phase-dependent two-photon interference experiments. Our work provides novel understandings of coherent light-matter interaction and may stimulate new applications.</description>

      <title>Theory of Multimode Squeezed Light Generation in Lossy Media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A unified theoretical approach to describe the properties of multimode squeezed light generated in a lossy medium is presented. This approach is valid for Markovian environments and includes both a model of discrete losses based on the beamsplitter approach and a generalized continuous loss model based on the spatial Langevin equation. For an important class of Gaussian states, we derive master equations for the second-order correlation functions and illustrate their solution for both frequency-independent and frequency-dependent losses. Studying the mode structure, we demonstrate that in a lossy environment no broadband basis without quadrature correlations between the different broadband modes exists. Therefore, various techniques and strategies to introduce broadband modes can be considered. We show that the Mercer expansion and the Williamson decomposition do not provide modes in which the maximal squeezing contained in the system can be measured. In turn, we find a new broadband basis that maximizes squeezing in the lossy system and present an algorithm to construct it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-photon emitters integrated in optical micro-cavities are key elements in quantum communication applications. However, for each combination of a cavity geometry with a quantum emitter system, there are specific challenges in the optimization of the emission properties and cavity-emitter interaction. Here, we present a thorough investigation of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), emitting in the telecom O-band, integrated in an open fiber-cavity. The design provides an optical micro-cavity tunable in all spatial dimensions with intrinsic fiber-coupling. Consequently, it offers a promising approach to a high collection efficiency and the investigation of spatially and spectrally varying samples. On the other hand, the system is also susceptible to vibrational noise. Therefore, we provide a comprehensive study of the cavity and emitter properties together with an analysis of the fluctuations of the cavity length. Due to the Purcell enhancement, we observe a reduction of the decay times of up to a factor of ${2.46(2)}$.</description>

      <title>Maximal quantum interaction between free electrons and photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emerging field of free-electron quantum optics enables electron-photon entanglement and holds the potential for generating nontrivial photon states for quantum information processing. Although recent experimental studies have entered the quantum regime, rapid theoretical developments predict that qualitatively unique phenomena only emerge beyond a certain interaction strength. It is thus pertinent to identify the maximal electron-photon interaction strength and the materials, geometries, and particle energies that enable one to approach it. We derive an upper limit to the quantum vacuum interaction strength between free electrons and single-mode photons, which illuminates the conditions for the strongest interaction. Crucially, we obtain an explicit energy selection recipe for electrons and photons to achieve maximal interaction at arbitrary separations and identify two optimal regimes favoring either fast or slow electrons over those with intermediate velocities. We validate the limit by analytical and numerical calculations on canonical geometries and provide near-optimal designs indicating the feasibility of strong quantum interactions. Our findings offer fundamental intuition for maximizing the quantum interaction between free electrons and photons and provide practical design rules for future experiments on electron-photon and electron-mediated photon-photon entanglement. They should also enable the evaluation of key metrics for applications such as the maximum power of free-electron radiation sources and the maximum acceleration gradient of dielectric laser accelerators.</description>
