      <title>From Partial to Monadic: Combinatory Algebra with Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial Combinatory Algebras (PCAs) provide a foundational model of the untyped $\lambda$-calculus and serve as the basis for many notions of computability, such as realizability theory. However, PCAs support a very limited notion of computation by only incorporating non-termination as a computational effect. To provide a framework that better internalizes a wide range of computational effects, this paper puts forward the notion of Monadic Combinatory Algebras (MCAs). MCAs generalize the notion of PCAs by structuring the combinatory algebra over an underlying computational effect, embodied by a monad. We show that MCAs can support various side effects through the underlying monad, such as non-determinism, stateful computation and continuations. We further obtain a categorical characterization of MCAs within Freyd Categories, following a similar connection for PCAs. Moreover, we explore the application of MCAs in realizability theory, presenting constructions of effectful realizability triposes and assemblies derived through evidenced frames, thereby generalizing traditional PCA-based realizability semantics. The monadic generalization of the foundational notion of PCAs provides a comprehensive and powerful framework for internally reasoning about effectful computations, paving the path to a more encompassing study of computation and its relationship with realizability models and programming languages.</description>

      <title>Abstraction-Based Proof Production in Formal Verification of Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern verification tools for deep neural networks (DNNs) increasingly rely on abstraction to scale to realistic architectures. In parallel, proof production is becoming a critical requirement for increasing the reliability of DNN verification results. However, current proofproducing verifiers do not support abstraction-based reasoning, creating a gap between scalability and provable guarantees. We address this gap by introducing a novel framework for proof-producing abstraction-based DNN verification. Our approach modularly separates the verification task into two components: (i) proving the correctness of an abstract network, and (ii) proving the soundness of the abstraction with respect to the original DNN. The former can be handled by existing proof-producing verifiers, whereas we propose the first method for generating formal proofs for the latter. This preliminary work aims to enable scalable and trustworthy verification by supporting common abstraction techniques within a formal proof framework.</description>

      <title>Syntactic Effectful Realizability in Higher-Order Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizability interprets propositions as specifications for computational entities in programming languages. Specifically, syntactic realizability is a powerful machinery that handles realizability as a syntactic translation of propositions into new propositions that describe what it means to realize the input proposition. This paper introduces EffHOL (Effectful Higher-Order Logic), a novel framework that expands syntactic realizability to uniformly support modern programming paradigms with side effects. EffHOL combines higher-kinded polymorphism, enabling typing of realizers for higher-order propositions, with a computational term language that uses monads to represent and reason about effectful computations. We craft a syntactic realizability translation from (intuitionistic) higher-order logic (HOL) to EffHOL, ensuring the extraction of computable realizers through a constructive soundness proof. EffHOL's parameterization by monads allows for the synthesis of effectful realizers for propositions unprovable in pure HOL, bridging the gap between traditional and effectful computational paradigms. Examples, including continuations and memoization, showcase EffHOL's capability to unify diverse computational models, with traditional ones as special cases. For a semantic connection, we show that any instance of EffHOL induces an evidenced frame, which, in turn, yields a tripos and a realizability topos.</description>

      <title>IMALL with a Mixed-State Modality: A Logical Approach to Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a proof language for Intuitionistic Multiplicative Additive Linear Logic (IMALL), extended with a modality B to capture mixed-state quantum computation. The language supports algebraic constructs such as linear combinations, and embeds pure quantum computations within a mixed-state framework via B, interpreted categorically as a functor from a category of Hilbert Spaces to a category of finite-dimensional C*-algebras. Measurement arises as a definable term, not as a constant, and the system avoids the use of quantum configurations, which are part of the theory of the quantum lambda calculus. Cut-elimination is defined via a composite reduction relation, and shown to be sound with respect to the denotational interpretation. We prove n that any linear map on C 2 can be represented within the system, and illustrate this expressiveness with examples such as quantum teleportation and the quantum switch.</description>

      <title>DHoTT: A Temporal Extension of Homotopy Type Theory for Semantic Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Dynamic Homotopy Type Theory (DHoTT), a temporal extension of Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) designed to reason formally about concepts whose meanings evolve continuously or rupture discontinuously over time. While traditional HoTT captures identity and equivalence within a fixed semantic landscape, DHoTT enriches this framework by explicitly indexing types with a temporal parameter, allowing types themselves to deform, rupture, and reassemble as contexts shift.
  Formally, we show that DHoTT serves as the internal language of a presheaf topos over the linearly ordered time category. As a result, DHoTT (1) conservatively extends HoTT, recovering standard homotopy-theoretic reasoning when time is held constant; (2) preserves foundational structures such as univalence and higher inductive types; and (3) introduces new constructs (drift paths and rupture types) for precisely capturing semantic evolution and discontinuity.
  We illustrate the expressiveness of DHoTT through a worked example derived from conversational dynamics in large language models, highlighting its relevance to posthuman intelligence and the formal modeling of evolving meaning.</description>

      <title>On the cut-elimination of the modal $\mu$-calculus: Linear Logic to the rescue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a proof-theoretic analysis of the modal $\mu$-calculus. More precisely, we prove a syntactic cut-elimination for the non-wellfounded modal $\mu$-calculus, using methods from linear logic and its exponential modalities. To achieve this, we introduce a new system, \muLLmodinf{}, which is a linear version of the modal $\mu$-calculus, intertwining the modalities from the modal $\mu$-calculus with the exponential modalities from linear logic. Our strategy for proving cut-elimination involves (i) proving cut-elimination for \muLLmodinf{} and (ii) translating proofs of the modal mu-calculus into this new system via a ``linear translation'', allowing us to extract the cut-elimination result.</description>

      <title>BemaGANv2: A Tutorial and Comparative Survey of GAN-based Vocoders for Long-Term Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a tutorial-style survey and implementation guide of BemaGANv2, an advanced GAN-based vocoder designed for high-fidelity and long-term audio generation. Built upon the original BemaGAN architecture, BemaGANv2 incorporates major architectural innovations by replacing traditional ResBlocks in the generator with the Anti-aliased Multi-Periodicity composition (AMP) module, which internally applies the Snake activation function to better model periodic structures. In the discriminator framework, we integrate the Multi-Envelope Discriminator (MED), a novel architecture we originally proposed, to extract rich temporal envelope features crucial for periodicity detection. Coupled with the Multi-Resolution Discriminator (MRD), this combination enables more accurate modeling of long-range dependencies in audio. We systematically evaluate various discriminator configurations, including MSD + MED, MSD + MRD, and MPD + MED + MRD, using objective metrics (FAD, SSIM, PLCC, MCD) and subjective evaluations (MOS, SMOS). This paper also provides a comprehensive tutorial on the model architecture, training methodology, and implementation to promote reproducibility. The code and pre-trained models are available at: https://github.com/dinhoitt/BemaGANv2.</description>

      <title>Learning Concepts Definable in First-Order Logic with Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.03820v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Boolean classification problems over relational background structures in the logical framework introduced by Grohe and Tur\'an (TOCS 2004). It is known (Grohe and Ritzert, LICS 2017) that classifiers definable in first-order logic over structures of polylogarithmic degree can be learned in sublinear time, where the degree of the structure and the running time are measured in terms of the size of the structure. We generalise the results to the first-order logic with counting FOCN, which was introduced by Kuske and Schweikardt (LICS 2017) as an expressive logic generalising various other counting logics. Specifically, we prove that classifiers definable in FOCN over classes of structures of polylogarithmic degree can be consistently learned in sublinear time. This can be seen as a first step towards extending the learning framework to include numerical aspects of machine learning. We extend the result to agnostic probably approximately correct (PAC) learning for classes of structures of degree at most $(\log \log n)^c$ for some constant $c$. Moreover, we show that bounding the degree is crucial to obtain sublinear-time learning algorithms. That is, we prove that, for structures of unbounded degree, learning is not possible in sublinear time, even for classifiers definable in plain first-order logic.</description>

      <title>Hybrid-Dynamic Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02094v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse games provide means to characterize elementary equivalence for first-order logic, and by standard translation also for modal logics. We propose a novel generalization of Ehrenfeucht- Fraisse games to hybrid-dynamic logics which is direct and fully modular: parameterized by the features of the hybrid language we wish to include, for instance, the modal and hybrid language operators as well as first-order existential quantification. We use these games to establish a new modular Fraisse-Hintikka Theorem for hybrid-dynamic propositional logic and its various fragments. We study the relationship between countable game equivalence (determined by countable Ehrenfeucht- Fraisse games) and bisimulation (determined by countable back-and-forth systems). In general, the former turns out to be weaker than the latter, but under certain conditions on the language, the two coincide. We also use games to prove that for reachable image-finite Kripke structures elementary equivalence implies isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Comodule Representations of Second-Order Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17664v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop and investigate a general theory of representations of second-order functionals, based on a notion of a right comodule for a monad on the category of containers. We show how the notion of comodule representability naturally subsumes classic representations of continuous functionals with well-founded trees. We find other kinds of representations by varying the monad, the comodule, and in some cases the underlying category of containers. Examples include uniformly continuous or finitely supported functionals, functionals querying their arguments precisely once, or at most once, functionals interacting with an ambient environment through computational effects, as well as functionals trivially representing themselves. Many of these rely on our construction of a monad on containers from a monad on shapes and a weak Mendler-style monad algebra on the universe for positions. We show that comodule representability on the category of propositional containers, which have positions valued in a universe of propositions, is closely related to instance reducibility in constructive mathematics, and through it to Weihrauch reducibility in computability theory.</description>

      <title>Transductions of Graph Classes Admitting Product Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18326v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a quest to thoroughly understand the first-order transduction hierarchy of hereditary graph classes, some questions in particular stand out; such as, what properties hold for graph classes that are first-order transductions of planar graphs (and of similar classes)? When addressing this (so-far wide open) question, we turn to the concept of a product structure - being a subgraph of the strong product of a path and a graph of bounded tree-width, introduced by Dujmovic et al. [JACM 2020]. Namely, we prove that any graph class which is a first-order transduction of a class admitting such product structure, up to perturbations also meets a structural description generalizing the concept of a product structure in a dense hereditary way - the latter concept being introduced just recently by Hlineny and Jedelsky under the name of H-clique-width [MFCS 2024]. Using this characterization, we show that the class of the 3D grids, as well as a class of certain modifications of 2D grids, are not first-order transducible from classes admitting a product structure, and in particular not from the class of planar graphs.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Knowledge Bases as Grammar-Compressed Proof Terms: Exploring Metamath Proof Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Viewing formal mathematical proofs as logical terms provides a powerful and elegant basis for analyzing how human experts tend to structure proofs and how proofs can be structured by automated methods. We pursue this approach by (1) combining proof structuring and grammar-based tree compression, where we show how they are inherently related, and (2) exploring ways to combine human and automated proof structuring. Our source of human-structured proofs is Metamath, which, based on condensed detachment, naturally provides a view of proofs as terms. A knowledge base is then just a grammar that compresses a set of gigantic proof trees. We present a formal account of this view, an implemented practical toolkit as well as experimental results.</description>

      <title>Redefining Functionality and Construction-Defining Capacity: Functions as Principles of Syntactic and Semantic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study redefines the notion of functionality-traditionally understood as a property of mappings or structure preservation-from a more fundamental and generative perspective. Introducing the concept of a Construction-Defining function (CDF), we formalize functionality as a dual capacity to generate both syntactic terms and semantic interpretations. We provide an explicit axiomatization of CDF based on syntactic generativity and semantic compositionality, and further construct categorical models using initial algebras and endofunctors to validate the generality of this concept. Through comparative analysis with type theory, model theory, and formal semantics, we demonstrate that functionality, in this enriched sense, serves as a foundational principle for structural generation across diverse theoretical domains. By reexamining the very nature of functions and their role in structure formation, this work contributes to a unified understanding of logic,semantics, and computation.</description>

      <title>Decomposition Strategies and Multi-shot ASP Solving for Job-shop Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07537v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Job-shop Scheduling Problem (JSP) is a well-known and challenging combinatorial optimization problem in which tasks sharing a machine are to be arranged in a sequence such that encompassing jobs can be completed as early as possible. In this paper, we investigate problem decomposition into time windows whose operations can be successively scheduled and optimized by means of multi-shot Answer Set Programming (ASP) solving. From a computational perspective, decomposition aims to split highly complex scheduling tasks into better manageable subproblems with a balanced number of operations such that good-quality or even optimal partial solutions can be reliably found in a small fraction of runtime. We devise and investigate a variety of decomposition strategies in terms of the number and size of time windows as well as heuristics for choosing their operations. Moreover, we incorporate time window overlapping and compression techniques into the iterative scheduling process to counteract optimization limitations due to the restriction to window-wise partial schedules. Our experiments on different JSP benchmark sets show that successive optimization by multi-shot ASP solving leads to substantially better schedules within tight runtime limits than single-shot optimization on the full problem. In particular, we find that decomposing initial solutions obtained with proficient heuristic methods into time windows leads to improved solution quality.</description>
