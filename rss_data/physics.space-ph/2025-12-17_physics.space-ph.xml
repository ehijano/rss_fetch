      <title>NASA/NOAA MOU Annex Final Report: Evaluating Model Advancements for Predicting CME Arrival Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this project was to assess improvements in CME arrival time forecasts at Earth using the Air Force Data Assimilative Photospheric Flux Transport (ADAPT) model driven by data from the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) ground observatories. These outputs are then fed into the coupled Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) - ENLIL model and compared to an operational version of WSA-ENLIL (without ADAPT). SWPC selected a set of 38 historical events over the period of five years from 2012--2014 (33 events) and 2017--2019 (5 events). The overall three-year project consisted of multiple simulation validation studies for the entire event set (1292 simulations): (a) benchmark single map (operational version prior to May 2019) (b) time-dependent sequence of GONG maps driving WSA-ENLIL with 4 different model settings (c) single test simulation of a time-dependent sequence of GONG maps driving ADAPT-WSA-ENLIL (d) single GONG map driving ADAPT-WSA-ENLIL (e) time-dependent sequence of GONG maps driving ADAPT-WSA-ENLIL. We report that for all 38 events, within each model version/settings combination, the CME arrival time error decreased by 0.2 to 0.9 hours when using a sequence of time-dependent zero-point corrected magnetograms compared to using single magnetogram input. Overall, for all events, when using the older uncorrected magnetograms, the CME arrival time error increased for all new model versions/settings combination compared to the benchmark. Notably for the 5 events in the period 2017--2019 when more reliable zero-point corrected magnetograms were available, the ADAPT-WSA-ENLIL (median arrival realization) CME arrival time error decreased against all benchmarks. In this report we also discuss replicating the operational model, challenges in detecting CME arrival in simulations, and comparing zero-point corrected and uncorrected magnetogram inputs.</description>

      <title>Optical Downlink Modeling for LEO and MEO Satellites under Atmospheric Turbulence with a Quantum State Tomography Use Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the link budget for free-space optical systems involving Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellites. We develop a detailed model of the satellite-to-ground channel that accounts for the primary physical processes affecting transmittance: atmospheric absorption and scattering, free-space diffraction, and turbulence-induced fluctuations. The study introduces a general method for computing transmittance along a slant path between a satellite and an optical ground station, incorporating zenith angle, slant range, and altitude-dependent attenuation. The proposed framework is intended to support the design and evaluation of space-based optical links and serves as a critical tool for defining technical specifications in satellite communication demonstrators and simulations. Numerical estimates are provided to illustrate the magnitude of losses under typical operational conditions, including the role of aperture averaging. In addition to the link budget analysis, we introduce a satellite-based quantum use case. We propose a scheme for quantum state tomography performed on states generated by an onboard photon source on an LEO or MEO satellite and transmitted to the optical ground station. This approach enables continuous verification of the quality of quantum resources that can be used to perform quantum protocols within quantum information networks.</description>

      <title>An Ice Christmas Tree: Fast Three-Dimensional Printing of Ice Structures via Evaporative Cooling in Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel approach to three-dimensional (3D) printing of freeform ice structures by exploiting evaporative cooling. A micrometer-sized water jet is used to 3D print inside a vacuum chamber. The reduced ambient pressure leads to rapid evaporation of the extruded water, extracting latent heat, and quickly cooling the water well below 0 {\deg}C. Once deposited, the water freezes almost instantaneously into stable ice structures. We demonstrate high-fidelity printing of complex geometries (Christmas trees, cones, vertical pillars, and free-standing zigzag structures) without cryogenic infrastructure, supporting materials, or external refrigeration. This approach directly visualizes fundamental thermodynamic principles -- latent heat, evaporative cooling, and pressure-dependent phase transitions -- while offering a relatively simple and scalable platform for ice-templated microfluidics and tissue engineering, or even extraterrestrial 3D printing.</description>

      <title>Direct Forcing of the Collisional Auroral Ionosphere by Kinetic Alfv\'en Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11755v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The structure of the auroral ionosphere is ascribed to local plasma instabilities. However, we report turbulence extending below 90 km altitude, where particle collisions act to stabilize the plasma. Using a composite radar-GPS spectrum, we resolve a scale-invariant cascade in the 80 km-120 km altitude layer. We identify a characteristic kinetic Alfv\'enic k^{-8/3} scaling, spanning four orders of magnitude in k, that tracks precipitating energy flux. This reveals a chemical and electric imprint of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, seeding and driving local instability processes.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Time-Dependent Diffusive Shock Acceleration in the 2022 September 5 Solar Energetic Particle Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On 2022 September 5, a large solar energetic particle (SEP) event was detected by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SolO), at heliocentric distances of 0.07 and 0.71 au, respectively. PSP observed an unusual velocity-dispersion signature: particles below $\sim$1 MeV exhibited a normal velocity dispersion, while higher-energy particles displayed an inverse velocity arrival feature, with the most energetic particles arriving later than those at lower energies. The maximum energy increased from about 20-30 MeV upstream to over 60 MeV downstream of the shock. The arrival of SEPs at PSP was significantly delayed relative to the expected onset of the eruption. In contrast, SolO detected a typical large SEP event characterized by a regular velocity dispersion at all energies up to 100 MeV. To understand these features, we simulate particle acceleration and transport from the shock to the observers with our newly developed SEP model - Particle ARizona and MIchigan Solver on Advected Nodes (PARMISAN). Our results reveal that the inverse velocity arrival and delayed particle onset detected by PSP originate from the time-dependent diffusive shock acceleration processes. After shock passage, PSP's magnetic connectivity gradually shifted due to its high velocity near perihelion, detecting high-energy SEPs streaming sunward. Conversely, SolO maintained a stable magnetic connection to the strong shock region where efficient acceleration was achieved. These results underscore the importance of spatial and temporal dependence in SEP acceleration at interplanetary shocks, and provide new insights to understand SEP variations in the inner heliosphere.</description>

      <title>Direct Measurement of Electron Heating in Electron-Only Reconnection in a Laboratory Mini-Magnetosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09086v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the experimental observation of electron heating in electron-only magnetic reconnection in laser-driven laboratory mini-magnetospheres on the Large Plasma Device (LAPD) at the University of California, Los Angeles. In this experiment, a fast-flowing plasma impacts a pulsed magnetic dipole embedded within LAPD's magnetized ambient plasma, creating an ion-scale magnetosphere and driving electron-only magnetic reconnection between the background and dipole field lines. The electron velocity distribution is measured across the reconnection region using non-collective Thomson scattering, enabling determination of electron temperature and density. Significant electron heating is observed in the electron diffusion region, increasing from an initial temperature of 1.8 eV to 9.5 eV, corresponding to a 40\% conversion of Poynting flux into electron enthalpy flux. Particle-in-cell simulations that provide insights into the heating mechanisms are also presented.</description>
