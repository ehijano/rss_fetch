      <title>Post-glitch Recovery and the Neutron Star Structure: The Vela Pulsar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar glitches, sudden changes in a neutron star's rotation, offer a unique window into the extreme physics governing these celestial bodies. The post-glitch recovery phase, characterized by a gradual recovery, reveals insights into the superfluid dynamics within the star. The post-glitch recovery phase probes the coupling mechanisms between different stellar components, sheds light on the properties of neutron star matter at supra-nuclear densities and even allows us to predict the time to the next glitch. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of the Vela pulsar's rotational behavior using around 100 months of observational data spanning from September 2016 to January 2025, during which four glitches were identified. Here, we demonstrate the post-glitch recovery of these glitches within the framework of the vortex creep model, providing new insights into the Vela pulsar's internal structure. Notably, we present the first-ever investigation of vortex residuals (the discrepancy between observed values and those predicted by the vortex creep model) through the lens of the vortex bending model, marking a significant step forward in understanding neutron star physics through pulsar glitches.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Magnetic Reconnection in Astrophysical Plasmas: A Powerful Mechanism of Nonthermal Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection -- a fundamental plasma physics process, where magnetic field lines of opposite polarity annihilate -- is invoked in astrophysical plasmas as a powerful mechanism of nonthermal particle acceleration, able to explain fast-evolving, bright high-energy flares. Near black holes and neutron stars, reconnection occurs in the ``relativistic'' regime, in which the mean magnetic energy per particle exceeds the rest mass energy. This review reports recent advances in our understanding of the kinetic physics of relativistic reconnection: (1) Kinetic simulations have elucidated the physics of plasma heating and nonthermal particle acceleration in relativistic reconnection; (2) The physics of radiative relativistic reconnection, with its self-consistent interplay between photons and reconnection-accelerated particles -- a peculiarity of luminous, high-energy astrophysical sources -- is the new frontier of research; (3) Relativistic reconnection plays a key role in global models of high-energy sources, both in terms of global-scale layers, as well as of reconnection sites generated as a byproduct of local magnetohydrodynamic instabilities. We summarize themes of active investigation and future directions, emphasizing the role of upcoming observational capabilities, laboratory experiments, and new computational tools.</description>

      <title>Surrogate models for lightcurves and photosphere properties of Type II supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inferences on the properties Type II supernovae (SNe) can provide significant insights into the lives and deaths of the astrophysical population of massive stars and potentially provide measurements of luminosity distance, independent of the distance ladder. Here, we introduce surrogate models for the photospheric properties and lightcurves of Type II SNe trained on a large grid of simulations from the radiation hydrodynamics code, {\sc stella}. The trained model can accurately and efficiently ($\sim 30$ms) predict the lightcurves and properties of Type II SNe within a large parameter space of progenitor ($10-18 M_{\odot}$ at ZAMS) and nickel masses ($0.001-0.3M_{\odot}$), progenitor mass-loss rate ($10^{-5}-10^{-1}~M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$), CSM radius ($1-10\times10^{14}$cm), and SN explosion energies ($0.5-5 \times 10^{51}$erg). We validate this model through inference on lightcurves and photosphere properties drawn directly from the original {\sc stella} simulations not included in training. In particular, for a synthetic Type II SNe observed within the 10-year LSST survey, we find we can measure the progenitor and nickel masses with $\approx 9\%$ and $\approx 25\%$ precision, respectively, when fitting the photometric data while accounting for the uncertainty in the surrogate model itself. Meanwhile, from real observations of SN~2004et, SN~2012aw, and SN~2017gmr we infer a progenitor ZAMS mass of $12.15_{-1.06}^{+1.03} M_{\odot}$, $10.61_{-0.32}^{+0.37} M_{\odot}$, $10.4 \pm 0.3 M_{\odot}$, respectively. We discuss systematic uncertainties from our surrogate modelling approach and likelihood approaches to account for these uncertainties. We further discuss future extensions to the model to enable stronger constraints on properties of Type II SNe and their progenitors, for cosmological applications, and applications of our surrogate modelling approach to other transients.</description>

      <title>SN 2024bfu, SN 2025qe, and the early light curves of type Iax supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Iax supernovae (SNe Iax) are perhaps the most numerous class of peculiar thermonuclear supernova and yet their sample size, particularly those observed shortly after explosion, remains relatively small. In this paper we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of two SNe Iax discovered shortly after explosion, SN 2024bfu and SN 2025qe. Both SNe were observed by multiple all-sky surveys, enabling tight constraints on the moment of first light and the shape of the early light curve. Our observations of SN 2025qe begin &lt;2 d after the estimated time of first light and represent some of the earliest observations of any SN Iax. We identify features consistent with carbon absorption throughout the spectroscopic evolution of SN 2025qe, potentially indicating the presence of unburned material throughout the ejecta. Inspired by our early light curve coverage, we gather a sample of SNe Iax observed by ATLAS, GOTO, and ZTF, and measure their rise times and early light curve power-law rise indices. We compare our findings to a sample of normal SNe Ia and find indications that SNe Iax show systematically shorter rise times, but the small sample size and relatively large uncertainties prevent us from identifying statistically significant differences in most bands. We find some indication that SNe Iax show systematically lower rise indices than normal SNe Ia in all bands. The low rise indices observed among SNe Iax is qualitatively consistent with extended $^{56}$Ni distributions and more thoroughly-mixed ejecta compared to normal SNe Ia, similar to predictions from pure deflagration explosions.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and conservation laws in discrete spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noether's theorem connects symmetries to invariants in continuous systems, however its extension to discrete systems has remained elusive. Recognizing the lowest-order finite difference as the foundation of local continuity, a viable method for obtaining discrete conservation laws is developed by working in exact analogy to the continuous Noether's theorem. A detailed application is given to electromagnetism, where energy-momentum conservation laws are rapidly obtained in highly generalized forms that disrupt conventional notions regarding conservative algorithms. Field-matter couplings and energy-momentum tensors with optional deviations at the discreteness scale properly reduce in the continuous limit. Nonlocal symmetries give rise to an additional conservation channel for each spacetime displacement, permitting generalized nonlocal couplings. Prescriptions for conservative particle integrators emerge directly from field-matter coupling terms, enabling the development of fully explicit, energy-conserving particle-in-cell algorithms. The demonstration of exact conservation laws in discrete spacetime that preserve canonical structure has deep implications for numerical algorithms and fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Scintillation Properties of PSR B1133+16 Measured with Very Long Baseline Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scintillation of pulsars reveals small-scale structure of the interstellar medium.
  A powerful technique for characterizing the scintillating structures (screens) combines analysis of scintillation arcs and very long baseline interferometry (VLBI).
  We present the results of a VLBI analysis of the scintillation arcs of PSR B1133+16 from simultaneous observations with Arecibo, VLA, Jodrell Bank, Effelsberg, and Westerbork.
  Three arcs appear in the data set, all of which appear consistent with being the result of very anisotropic scattering screens.
  We are able to measure their orientations on the sky, down to uncertainties of $3^\circ$ for the two stronger screens, and measure distances, of $140\pm30$, $180\pm20$, and $280\pm50{\rm\,pc}$, consistent with, but substantially more precise than what was inferred previously from annual modulation patterns in the scintillation.
  Comparing with the differential dust extinction with distance in this direction, the two nearer screens appear associated with the wall of the Local Bubble.</description>

      <title>Turbulent drag on stellar mass black holes embedded in AGN discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how AGN disk turbulence affects the orbital dynamics of a stellar-mass black hole (BH) initially located at a migration trap, focusing on the long-term behavior of eccentricity and inclination in the quasi-embedded regime. We develop a semi-analytical framework in which turbulence is modeled as a stochastic velocity field acting through a modified drag force. We integrate the resulting stochastic differential equations both in Cartesian coordinates and in orbital elements using a linearized perturbative approach, and compare these results with full numerical simulations. Eccentricity and inclination evolve toward steady-state Rayleigh distributions, with variances determined by the local disk properties and the ratio of the gas damping rate to the orbital frequency. The analytical predictions agree well with the numerical simulations. We provide closed-form expressions for the variances in both the fast and slow damping regimes. These results are directly applicable to Monte Carlo population models and can serve as physically motivated initial conditions for hydrodynamical simulations. Turbulent forcing prevents full circularization and alignment of BH orbits in AGN disks, even in the presence of strong gas drag. This has important implications for BH merger and binary formation rates, which are sensitive to the residual eccentricity and inclination. Our results highlight the need to account for turbulence-induced stochastic heating when modeling the dynamical evolution of compact objects in AGN environments.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Optical Follow Up of S231206cc: Multi-Model Constraints on BBH Merger Emission in AGN Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The majority of gravitational wave events detected by the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA Collaboration originate from binary black hole (BBH) mergers, for which no confirmed electromagnetic counterparts have been identified to date. However, if such mergers occur within the disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), they may generate observable optical flares induced by relativistic jet activity and shock-heated gas. We present results from a long-term optical follow-up of the gravitational wave event S231206cc, conducted with the T80-South telescope as part of the S-PLUS Transient Extension Program (STEP). Our search prioritized AGN-hosted environments by crossmatching the gravitational wave localization with known AGN catalogs. No candidate met the criteria for a viable optical counterpart. We explored three BBH merger scenarios predicting optical emission in AGN disks: (i) ram pressure stripping, (ii) long-term emission from an emerging jet cocoon, and (iii) jet breakout followed by shock cooling. Using our observational cadence and depth, we constrained the BBH parameter space, including the remnant's location within the AGN disk, kick velocity, and supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass. Detectable flares are most likely when mergers occur at 0.01-0.1 parsecs from SMBHs with masses between 10^7 and 10^8 solar masses, where short delay times and long durations best align with our follow-up strategy. These results provide a framework for identifying AGN-hosted BBH counterparts and guiding future multimessenger efforts.</description>

      <title>Seeking Spinning Subpopulations of Black Hole Binaries via Iterative Density Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attempts to understand the formation of binary black hole (BBH) systems detected via gravitational wave (GW) emission are affected by many unknowns and uncertainties, from both the observational and theoretical (astrophysical modelling) sides. Binary component spins have been proposed as a means to investigate formation channels, however obtaining clear inferences is challenging, given the apparently low magnitude of almost all merging BH spins and their high measurement uncertainties. Even for the effective aligned spin $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ which is more precisely measured than component spins, specific model assumptions have been required to identify any clear trends. Here, we reconstruct the joint component mass and $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ distribution of BBH mergers with minimal assumptions using the GWTC-3 catalog, using an iterative kernel density estimation (KDE)-based method. We reproduce some features seen in previous analyses, for instance a small but preferentially positive $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ for low-mass mergers; we also identify a possible subpopulation of higher-spin BBH with $|\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}|$ up to $\sim\! 0.75$ for primary masses $m_1 \gtrsim 40\,M_\odot$, in addition to the bulk of the distribution with $|\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}| \lesssim 0.2$. This finding is consistent with previous studies indicating a broader spin distribution at high mass, suggesting a distinct origin for the high-spin systems. We also identify a previously-unnoticed trend at lower masses: the population mean of $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ increases (decreases) with $m_1$ ($m_2$) \emph{within} the overdensity around $m_1 \sim 10 M_\odot$. This ``spin fine structure'' may partly explain a previously reported anticorrelation between mass ratio and $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$.</description>

      <title>A Parameter Survey of Neutron Star Accretion Column Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a parameter survey of neutron star accretion column simulations by solving the relativistic radiation MHD equations with opacities that account for strong magnetic fields and pair production. We study how column properties depend on accretion rate, magnetic field strength, and accretion flow geometry. All the simulated accretion columns exhibit kHz oscillatory behavior, consistent with our previous findings. We show how the predicted oscillation properties depend on the column parameters. At higher accretion rates for fixed magnetic field, the column height increases, reducing the local field strength and leading to an anti-correlation between the observed cyclotron line energy and luminosity. We estimate the line energy from the simulations and find agreement with the observed trend. Downward scattering in the free-fall zone plays a key role in shaping sideways emission properties and column height. Strong downward scattering not only re-injects heat back into the column, increasing its height, but also compresses sideways emission, potentially smearing out shock oscillation signals. When the pair-production regime is reached at the base of the column, the system quickly readjusts to a force balance between gravity and radiative support. The high opacity in the pair-production region raises the radiation energy density, enhancing sideways emission through a large horizontal gradient. This shifts the sideways fan-beam radiation toward lower altitudes. In a hollow column geometry, both pencil- and fan-beam radiation emission occurs. Self-illumination across the hollow region increases the height and stabilizes the inner wall of the column, while shock oscillations persist in the outer regions.</description>

      <title>Radiation GRMHD Models of Accretion onto Stellar-Mass Black Holes: I. Survey of Eddington Ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We summarize results from a survey of radiation-dominated black hole accretion flows across a wide range of mass accretion rates, as well as two values of black hole spin and initial magnetic field geometry. These models apply an algorithm targeting direct solutions to the radiation transport equation in full general relativity and have been enabled by access to modern exascale computing systems. Super-Eddington accretion flows form geometrically thick radiation pressure supported disks that drive powerful equatorial outflows. A narrow funnel-shaped photosphere in the inner region results in very low radiative efficiencies in this regime. The structure of near- and sub-Eddington accretion depends on whether there is net vertical magnetic flux at the midplane of the disk. With net flux, the disk forms a thin, dense layer at the midplane surrounded by a magnetically-dominated corona, whereas without net flux the disk remains magnetically dominated everywhere. Although none of our models achieve the magnetically arrested disk (MAD) regime, those with net vertical flux and a rapidly spinning black hole still produce powerful relativistic jets. Our calculations adopt simple opacity models (with scalings appropriate to stellar-mass black hole accretion). We discuss the application of our results to observations of X-ray binaries and ultraluminous X-ray sources such as Cyg X-3 and SS433. We also speculate on the application of our super-Eddington models to the interpretation of little red dots (LRDs) recently discovered by JWST.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Astrometric Monitoring of the Galactic Center Magnetar PSR J1745--2900</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new astrometric observations of the Galactic Center magnetar, PSR J1745-2900, with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). Combined with previously published measurements in 10 epochs that spanned 477 days, the complete data set consists of 25 epochs and 41 independent measurements that span 1984 days. These data constrain the proper motion to an accuracy of $\lesssim 2\%$ and set an upper limit on the absolute value of the magnetar's acceleration of $\lesssim (0.4, 0.2)\, {\rm mas\,y^{-2}}$ in the two celestial coordinates, consistent with the maximum value of $\sim 0.03\,{\rm mas\,y^{-2}}$ expected for an orbit around Sgr A*. Future measurements have the potential to detect the acceleration of PSR J1745-2900 due to Sgr A* should PSR J1745-2900 re-brighten. We consider several potential sources of systematic variations in the astrometric residuals after fitting for standard parameters, including refractive wander, changes in the structure of Sgr A*, and the presence of an unseen binary companion. While a stellar companion model can be fit to the astrometric data, pulse period measurements are inconsistent with that model. No changes in the apparent image size of the magnetar were detected over the duration of these observations, indicating a lack of change in the properties of the line-of-sight scattering during this period. We also show that the upper limit to the mean core shift of Sgr A* is consistent with expectations for a compact jet or symmetric accretion flow.</description>

      <title>Insight into the origin of multiwavelength emissions of PKS 1510-089 through modeling 12 SEDs from 2008 to 2015</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PKS\,1510$-$089 is one of the most peculiar sources among the FSRQs, exhibiting a notable big blue bump (BBB). This provides an unique opportunity to explore the coupling between the activity of the central engine and the relativistic jet, offering further insight into the origin of the multiwavelength emissions. To this end, we collected multiwavelength data spanning four periods from 2008 to 2015 and performed the spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling using a one-zone homogeneous leptonic model. In the model, a multichromatic accretion disk (AD) is used to fit the optical/UV data sets, while the external radiation fields from the broad-line region (BLR) and dusty torus (DT) are properly considered to produce the high-energy $\gamma$-ray emissions. Our best fit to 12 SEDs yields the following results: (i) The innermost stable orbit ($R_{\rm ISO}$) of the AD is not stable but varies between $3\,R_{\rm S}$ and $18\,R_{\rm S}$ during these observations. (ii) The high-energy hump of the SED is well dominated by Compton scattering of the BLR photons, while the X-ray flux may be comprised of multiple radiation components. (iii) The $\gamma$-ray emitting regions are generally matter-dominated, with low magnetization, and are located beyond the BLR but within the DT. At such distance, the multiwavelength emissions are likely to originate from shock accelerations; (iv) For the energization of the relativistic jet, our study supports the Blandford$-$Znajek (BZ) mechanism, instead of the Blandford$-$Payne (BP) mechanism, as the latter fails to power the jet.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength analysis of FSRQ B2 1348+30B: Constraints on the jet power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 14.5-year multi-wavelength analysis of flat-spectrum radio quasar B2 1348+30B using Swift-UVOT, Swift-XRT, and Fermi-LAT observations. In the gamma-ray band, the 3 day bin lightcurve reveals two major flaring events on 2010-09-19 (55458 MJD) and 2022-05-26 (59725 MJD) detected at flux levels $(2.5\pm 0.5) \times 10^{-7}\,\rm{ph\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$ and $(5.2\pm 0.6) \times 10^{-7}\,\rm{ph\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$. The Bayesian block analysis of the flares suggested the variability timescale to be $\leq$ 3\,day. To study the dynamic nature of the source, multi-wavelength spectrum was obtained for three flux states which includes the two flaring state and a relative low state. The $\gamma$-ray spectra of the source in all the states are well fitted by a power-law model with maximum photon energy &lt; 20 GeV. In X-ray, a power-law model can explain the flaring state spectra while a broken power-law with extremely hard high energy component was required to model the low flux state. This indicates the presence of the low energy cutoff in the Compton spectral component. A simple one-zone leptonic model involving synchrotron, synchrotron self Compton and external Compton mechanism can successfully reproduce the broad-band spectral energy distribution of all the flux states. The model parameters suggest significant increase in the jet Lorentz factor during the high flux states. Further, the best fit parameters are used to constrain the minimum energy of the emitting electron distribution from the hard high energy spectrum of the low flux state. This analysis was extended to draw limits on the kinetic power of the blazar jet and was compared with the Eddington luminosity of the central black hole.</description>

      <title>Active galactic nuclei through the prism of galaxy clusters: bounds on axion-like particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypothetical axion-like particles (ALPs) are of interest because of their potential to act as dark matter or to reveal information about yet undiscovered fundamental constituents of matter. Such particles can be created when photons traverse regions of magnetic fields. The conversion probability depends on both the magnetic field parameters and photon energy, leading to multiple spectral absorption features as light passes through magnetized regions.
  Traditionally, astrophysical searches have focused on detecting such features in individual objects. However, the limited understanding of properties of cosmic magnetic fields have hindered the progress. Here we introduce a new approach by analyzing stacked (rather than individual) spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) positioned behind galaxy clusters -- gigantic magnetic field reservoirs. Stacking efficiently averages over the uncertainties in magnetic fields, revealing a unique step-like spectral signature of photon-to-ALP conversion.
  With this approach we advance into previously inaccessible regions of the ALP parameter space for nano-electronvolt masses. Adopting this method will significantly improve existing bounds across a wide range of masses by using different telescopes and increasing the size of the stacked datasets. The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, in particular, will extensively probe the parameter space where ALPs could serve as dark matter.</description>

      <title>Normal Distribution of Crab Pulsar Glitch Activity from a Glitch Cluster Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the most extensively and continuously monitored neutron star, the Crab pulsar serves as representative of the earliest evolutionary stage. Its unique and complex glitch phenomenology provides an unparalleled testing ground for theoretical models of neutron star interior dynamics. Within the self-organized criticality paradigm, Crab pulsar glitch sizes are modeled by a power-law distribution and waiting times by an exponential distribution. However, this framework is incompatible with neutron-star microphysics and fails to account for the quasi-periodic glitch behavior. Using a glitch-clustering perspective, which is motivated by the hypothesis that each event releases only a fraction of the stored angular momentum, we merged small glitches occurring within short temporal separations. We reveal a correlation between glitch size and waiting time and uncover that the waiting-time cumulative distribution function follows a normal distribution. Crucially, without recourse to complex statistical models, this approach permits a reasonable forecast of the next glitch. From the perspective of the dense-glitch region, the Crab pulsar currently falls within the $3\sigma$-$4\sigma$ probability interval. For the existence of a long-term periodicity of 6.68 years, the $\pm1\sigma$ interval defines a time window extending from the present to approximately 387 days ahead, this implies the next glith would emerge at any time before MJD 61081 (February 2026).</description>

      <title>Impact of Accretion Assumptions on Pulse Profile Modelling of Superburst Oscillations in 4U 1636-536</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling the coherent pulsations observed during thermonuclear bursts offers a valuable method to probe the poorly understood equation of state of dense and cold matter. Here we apply the pulse profile modelling technique to the pulsations observed with RXTE during the 2001 superburst of 4U 1636$-$536. By employing a single, uniform-temperature hot spot model with varying size and temperature, along with various assumptions for background/accretion contribution, we find that each assumption leads to different inferred mass, radius, and compactness constraints. This highlights the critical need to better understand the mass accretion rate enhancement/reduction during thermonuclear bursts to accurately model burst oscillation sources using pulse profile modelling.</description>

      <title>The Close AGN Reference Survey (CARS). Long-term spectral variability study of the changing look AGN Mrk 1018</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Changing-look AGNs (CLAGN) are accreting supermassive black hole systems that undergo variations in optical spectral type, driven by major changes in accretion rate. Mrk 1018 has undergone two transitions, a brightening event in the 1980s and a transition back to a faint state over the course of 2-3 years in the early 2010s. We characterize the evolving physical properties of the source's inner accretion flow, particularly during the bright-to-faint transition, as well as the morphological properties of its parsec-scale circumnuclear gas. We model archival X-ray spectra from XMM-Newton, Chandra, Suzaku, and Swift, using physically-motivated models to characterize X-ray spectral variations and track Fe Kalpha line flux. We also quantify Mrk 1018's long-term multi-wavelength spectral variability from optical/UV to the X-rays. Over the duration of the bright-to-faint transition, the UV and hard X-ray flux fell by differing factors, roughly 24 and 8, respectively. The soft X-ray excess faded, and was not detected by 2021. In the faint state, when the Eddington ratio drops to log Lbol/LEdd &lt; -1.7, the hot X-ray corona photon index shows a 'softer-when-fainter' trend, similar to that seen in some black hole X-ray binaries and samples of low-luminosity AGNs. Finally, the Fe Kalpha line flux has dropped by only half the factor of the drop in the X-ray continuum. The transition from the bright state to the faint state is consistent with the inner accretion flow transitioning from a geometrically-thin disk to an ADAF-dominated state, with the warm corona disintegrating or becoming energetically negligible, while the X-ray-emitting hot flow becoming energetically dominant. Meanwhile, narrow Fe Kalpha emission has not yet fully responded to the drop in its driving continuum, likely because its emitter extends up to roughly 10 pc.</description>

      <title>The error budget of binary neutron star merger simulations for configurations with high spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical-relativity simulations offer a unique approach to investigating the dynamics of binary neutron star mergers and provide the most accurate predictions of waveforms in the late inspiral phase. However, the numerical predictions are prone to systematic biases originating from the construction of initial quasi-circular binary configurations, the numerical methods used to evolve them, and to extract gravitational signals. To assess uncertainties arising from these aspects, we analyze mergers of highly spinning neutron stars with dimensionless spin parameter $\chi=0.5$. The initial data are prepared by two solvers, \textsc{FUKA} and \textsc{SGRID}, which are then evolved by two independent codes, \textsc{SACRA} and \textsc{BAM}. We assess the impact of numerical discretizations, finite extraction radii, and differences in numerical frameworks on the resulting gravitational waveforms. Our analysis reveals that the primary source of uncertainty in numerical waveforms is the evolution code, while the initial data solver has a smaller impact. We also compare our numerical-relativity waveforms with state-of-the-art analytical models, finding that the discrepancies between them exceed the estimated numerical uncertainties. Few suggestions are offered: (i) the analytic waveform becomes an inadequate approximation after the two neutron stars come into contact and the binary enters the essentially-one-body phase, (ii) the analytical models may not capture finite-size effects beyond quadrupole moment, and (iii) the inconsistent use of the binary black hole baseline in the analytical models may also be contributing to these discrepancies. The presented results benchmark the error budget for numerical waveforms of binary neutron star mergers, and provide information for the analytic models to explore further the high spin parameter space of binary neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>The Relationship Between Eddington Ratio and Column Density in U/LIRG AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The local X-ray AGN population appears to follow a growth cycle regulated by the AGN's own radiation, marked by changes in their obscuration and Eddington ratio during accretion events. Because AGN in infrared-selected galaxies are more likely to be Compton-thick and have evidence for over-massive black holes, we explore whether infrared-selected AGN follow the radiation-regulated AGN growth scheme. We calculate the Eddington ratios of nine U/LIRG AGN with dynamical BH mass measurements, finding that though the number of objects is limited, AGN in IR-selected galaxies appear consistent with radiation pressure-regulated growth. We suggest that enlarging the sample of dynamical BH mass measurements in IR-selected systems will provide more stringent tests of whether their AGN are primarily regulated by radiation pressure.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter in X-rays: Revised XMM-Newton Limits and New Constraints from eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate two classes of dark matter (DM) candidates, sub-GeV particles and primordial black holes (PBHs), that can inject low-energy electrons and positrons into the Milky Way and leave observable signatures in the X-ray sky. In the case of sub-GeV DM, annihilation or decay into $e^+e^-$ contributes to the diffuse sea of cosmic-ray (CR) leptons, which can generate bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton (IC) emission on Galactic photon fields, producing a broad spectrum from X-rays to $\gamma$-rays detectable by instruments such as eROSITA and XMM-Newton. For PBHs with masses below $\sim10^{17}$ g, Hawking evaporation similarly yields low-energy $e^\pm$, leading to comparable diffuse emission. Using the first data release from eROSITA and incorporating up-to-date CR propagation and diffusion parameters, we derive new constraints on both scenarios. For sub-GeV DM, we exclude thermally averaged annihilation cross sections in the range $\sim 10^{-27}-10^{-25} \ \mathrm{cm^3/s}$ and decay lifetimes of $\sim 10^{24}-10^{25}$ s for masses between 1 MeV and 1 GeV, with eROSITA outperforming previous X-ray constraints below $\sim$ 30 MeV. For asteroid-mass PBHs, we set new bounds on the DM fraction based on their Hawking-induced emission. Finally, we revisit earlier constraints from XMM-Newton, finding that they were approximately four orders of magnitude too stringent due to the use of the instrument's geometric solid angle rather than its exposure-weighted solid angle. Upon using the exposure-weighted solid angle, we show that the revised XMM-Newton limits are slightly weaker than those from eROSITA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COMPAS public rapid binary population synthesis code has undergone a number of key improvements since the original COMPAS methods paper (Team COMPAS: Riley et al., 2022) was published. These include more sophisticated and robust treatments of binary interactions: mass transfer physics, common-envelope events, tides and gravitational-wave radiation reaction; and updated prescriptions for stellar evolution, winds and supernovae. The code structure and outputs have also been updated, with a focus on improving resolution without sacrificing computational speed. This paper describes the substantive changes in the code between the previous methods paper and COMPAS v03.20.02.</description>

      <title>Impact of convective overshooting on the single-degenerate model of Type Ia supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The single-degenerate (SD) model is one of the principal models for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). However, it faces some challenges, the primary being its inability to account for the observed SN Ia birth rate. Many studies have attempted to address this issue by expanding the parameter space, defined by the initial donor star mass and orbital period, that can lead to SNe Ia, as well as by improving binary population synthesis. While these efforts have led to significant progress, many uncertainties in stellar physics persist, which influences the outcomes of such studies. Convective overshooting, which can significantly affect the internal structure of a star and subsequently its evolution within a binary system, is one of the most significant sources of uncertainty in stellar physics. We investigate the effect of convective overshooting on the parameter space and birth rate of SNe Ia within the SD model. We employed the common-envelope wind (CEW) model, a new version of the SD model, as our progenitor model. Using MESA, we obtained the parameter space that leads to SNe Ia for three different convective overshooting parameters and calculated the corresponding SN Ia birth rate. Convective overshooting expands the upper boundaries (corresponding to a larger initial donor mass) and right boundaries (corresponding to a longer initial orbital period) of the parameter space for systems with massive white dwarfs (WDs; &gt;= 0.75Msun). However, the minimum WD mass and the parameter space for low-mass WDs - and, consequently, the calculated SN Ia birth rate - vary non-monotonically with convective overshooting parameters. The CEW model may explain the SNe Ia that interact with the circumstellar medium (CSM), i.e., SNe Ia-CSM. We find that the parameter space for SNe Ia-CSM increases with convective overshooting parameters, as does their birth rate.</description>

      <title>Realistic assessment of a single gravitational wave source localization taking into account precise pulsar distances with pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are anticipated to detect continuous gravitational waves (GWs) from individual supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) in the near future. To identify the host galaxy of a GW source, PTAs require significantly improved angular resolution beyond the typical range of 100-1000 square degrees achieved by recent continuous GW searches. In this study, we investigate how precise pulsar distance measurements can enhance the localization of a single GW source. Accurate distance information, comparable to or better than the GW wavelength (typically 1~pc) can refine GW source localization. In the near future, with the advent of Square Kilometre Array (SKA), such high-precision distance measurements will be feasible for a few nearby pulsars. We focus on the relatively nearby pulsars J0437-4715 (156 pc) and J0030+0451 (331 pc), incorporating their actual distance uncertainties based on current VLBI measurements and the anticipated precision of the SKA-era. By simulating 87 pulsars with the GW signal and Gaussian white noise in the timing residuals, we assess the impact of the pulsar distance information on GW source localization. Our results show that without precise distance information, localization remains insufficient to identify host galaxies under 10 ns noise. However, incorporating SKA-era distance precision for nearby pulsars J0437-4715 and J0030+0451 can reduce localization uncertainties to the required level of $10^{-3}$ $\rm deg^{2}$. Localization accuracy strongly depends on the geometric configuration of pulsars with well-measured distances and improves notably near and between such pulsars. The improvement of the localization will greatly aid in identifying the host galaxy of a GW source and constructing an SMBHB catalog. It will further enable follow-up electromagnetic observations to investigate the SMBHB in greater detail.</description>

      <title>Test Gravitational-Wave Polarizations with Space-Based Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the capability of space-based gravitational wave detectors in constraining parameters of non-tensor polarization modes. Using Bayesian inference and Fisher Information Matrix methods, we analyze gravitational wave signals from the inspiral phase of supermassive binary black hole mergers. By starting with time-domain signals and applying Fourier transforms, we avoid the use of the stationary phase approximation. We found an asymmetry in the estimation of the vector-mode parameter $\alpha_x$ at inclination angles $\iota = 0$ and $\iota = \pi$, which has not been explicitly pointed out in previous studies. We also observe strong correlations between scalar-mode parameters, $\alpha_b$ and $\alpha_l$, which currently limit their independent estimation. These findings underscore the importance of using complete inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms to enhance the ability to distinguish the non-tensor polarization modes. Finally, we employ a new LISA-Taiji network configuration, in which the orientation of spacecrafts of Taiji maintains a fixed phase offset relative to these of LISA. Under the adiabatic approximation and the assumption of equal arms, this phase is found to have no significant effect on data analysis.</description>

      <title>A Complete Survey from the $\texttt{CompactObject}$ Perspective on Equation of State Cross-Comparison Using Observational and Nuclear Experimental Constraints</title>

Abstract: This extensive survey seeks to analyze and contrast different phenomenological methods used to model the nuclear equation of state (EOS) for neutron star matter based on covariant energy density functionals (CEDF). Using two complementary methodologies, we seek to capture a comprehensive picture of the potential behaviors of ultra-dense nucleonic matter and identify the most plausible models based on current observational and experimental constraints. Observational data from radio pulsar timing, gravitational wave detection of GW170817, and X-ray timing provide critical benchmarks for testing the models. We have derived the EOS posteriors for various CEDF models within the $\texttt{CompactObject}$ package, utilizing recent observational data on neutron stars, state-of-the-art theoretical constraints from chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) calculations for pure neutron matter at low densities, and pQCD-derived constraints at approximately $7 \times 0.16$ $ \mathrm{fm}^{-3}$. Our analysis has demonstrated that while all considered CEDF models broadly reproduce current astrophysical and theoretical constraints, subtle yet important differences persist among them, with each framework exhibiting distinct characteristics at supra-nuclear density. This is in particular true for the proton fraction inside neutron stars, but also supported by the models' behavior with respect to the pure neutron matter EOS and the density dependence of the speed of sound. Our study highlights the sensitivity of dense matter predictions to the underlying EOS parameterizations and the priors considered.</description>

      <title>Associations Between Scattering Screens and Interstellar Medium Filaments</title>

Abstract: Pulsar scintillation can be used to measure small scale structure in the Galaxy, but little is known about the specific interstellar medium features that cause scintillation. We searched for interstellar medium counterparts to all scintillation screens for which absolute distances and scattering orientations have been measured - a sample of 12 pulsars and 22 screens. For one pulsar, PSR J0737-3039A, we re-analyze its scintillation screen and find evidence for a highly anisotropic screen. Among the screens, we found that eight are located inside of the Local Bubble, and a further six are less than 100 pc farther than its inner edge. Comparisons with tracers of ionized and magnetized media did not find any new associations. Instead, for seven of the pulsars analyzed, aligned HI filaments are seen for at least one of their screens, for a total of 12 out of 22 screens. This result seems unlikely to be due to chance: comparing with random trials, we estimate a likelihood of finding 12 or more screens with aligned emission by chance of only 0.004%. Estimating the significance of the amount of aligned emission (in standard deviations over the mean), the probability of finding as much observed aligned emission by chance is larger, at 1.7%, but still indicative of a real correlation. Since HI filaments are preferentially associated with cold neutral gas, and thus unlikely to cause scintillation, this may indicate both the filaments and the screens are aligned preferentially by the same mechanisms such as magnetic fields or shocks.</description>

      <title>In-ice Askaryan Emission from Air Showers: Implications for Radio Neutrino Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most promising techniques for detecting ultra-high energy neutrinos involves the use of radio antennas to observe the 10-1000 MHz radiation generated by the showers that neutrinos induce in large volumes of ice. The expected neutrino detection rates of one neutrino or less per detector station per 10 years make the characterization of backgrounds a priority. The largest natural background comes from ultra-high energy cosmic rays which are orders of magnitude more abundant than neutrinos. Particularly crucial is the understanding of geometries in which substantial energy of the cosmic-ray-induced air shower is deposited in the ice giving rise to a compact in-ice shower close to the ice surface. We calculated the radio emission of air-shower cores using the novel CORSIKA 8 code and found it to be similar to the predictions for neutrino-induced showers. For the first time, we calculated the detection rates for O(100m) deep antennas yielding 10-100 detections per year and detector station, which makes this a useful calibration source as these downward-going signals can be differentiated from neutrino-induced showers based on the signal arrival direction. However, the presence of reflection layers in the ice confuses the arrival directions, which makes this a potentially important background. We review the existing information on reflecting layers in the South Pole glacier and, for the first time, quantify the corresponding rate of reflected air-shower signals for the proposed IceCube-Gen2 radio array and discuss mitigation strategies. The reflectivity of the layers is the dominant uncertainty resulting in rate predictions of much less than one detection to several detections per year for IceCube-Gen2 if not mitigated.</description>

      <title>Searching for dark matter annihilating into light long-lived mediators from stars inside dwarf spheroidal galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several astrophysical and cosmological observations suggest the existence of dark matter (DM) through its gravitational effects, yet its nature remains elusive. Despite the lack of DM signals from direct detection experiments, efforts continue to focus on the indirect detection of DM from DM-rich astrophysical objects. Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are among the most promising targets for such searches. In this work, we aim to investigate the expected DM capture rate from the stellar component of ten nearby DM-rich dSphs, assuming that the accumulated DM eventually annihilates into light, long-lived mediators (LLLMs) which decay into gamma rays outside the dSphs. We analyze nearly 16 years of {\it Fermi}-LAT data to search for DM annihilation through LLLMs, and, from the observed stacked flux upper limits, set limits on the DM-nucleon scattering cross section for the case of a generic DM scenario. Additionally, we incorporate the Sommerfeld enhancement (SE) effect into the DM annihilation process assuming scalar DM model, and obtain bounds on the DM-nucleon scattering cross section of $\sim~10^{-36} {\rm cm}^2$ for DM masses around 100 GeV. This allows us to explore an alternative avenue for exploring DM phenomena from dSphs and compare our results with the bounds reported by direct DM detection experiments and other celestial bodies.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap: OPTICAM Reveals the Hidden Spin of the WZ Sge Star GOTO 065054.49+593624.51</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: WZ Sge stars are highly evolved accreting white dwarf systems (AWDs) exhibiting remarkably large amplitude outbursts (a.k.a. super-outbursts), typically followed by short rebrightenings/echo outbursts. These systems have some of the lowest mass transfer rates among AWDs, making even low magnetic fields dynamically important. Such magnetic fields are often invoked to explain the phenomenology observed in these systems, such as their X-ray luminosity and long periods of quiescence (30+ years). However, the detection of these is very elusive given the quenching of the accretion columns during outburst and the low luminosity of these systems during quiescence. Here we present high-cadence multi-band observations with {\it OPTICAM} of the recent outburst of the recently discovered WZ Sge star GOTO065054.49+593624.51, during the end of the main outburst and the dip in-between rebrightenings, covering 2 orders of magnitude in brightness. Our observations reveal the presence of a statistically significant signal with $P_{\omega}\simeq148$ seconds in the bluer ($g$) band which is detected only during the dip between the main outburst and the rebrigthenings. We interpret this signal as the spin period of the AWD. If confirmed, GOTO 0650 would bridge the gap between intermediate- and fast-rotating intermediate polars (IPs) below the period gap.</description>

      <title>Study of the IC 443 region with the HAWC observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supernova remnants are one potential source class considered a PeVatron (i.e. capable of accelerating cosmic rays above PeV energies). The shock fronts produced after the explosion of the supernova are ideal regions for particle acceleration. IC 443 is a supernova remnant that has been studied extensively at different wavelengths. Using 2966 days of gamma-ray data from the HAWC observatory, we study the emission of IC 443 with the objective of finding signatures of cosmic-ray acceleration at the PeV scale. Using a maximum likelihood method, we find a point source located at ($\alpha$=94.42$^{\circ}$, $\delta$=22.35$^{\circ}$) that we associate with IC 443. The measured spectrum is a simple power law with an index of $-3.14\pm$0.18, which is consistent with previous TeV observations. Although we cannot confirm that IC 443 is a hadronic PeVatron, we do not find any sign that the spectrum has a cut off at tens of TeV energies, with the spectrum extending to $\sim$30 TeV. Furthermore, we also find a new extended component in the region whose emission is described by a simple power law with an index of $-2.49\pm$0.08 and which we call HAWC J0615+2213. While we show evidence that this new source might be a new TeV halo, we defer a detailed analysis of this new source to another publication.</description>

      <title>Progenitor Dependence of Neutrino-driven Supernova Explosions with the Aid of Heavy Axion-like Particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform spherically symmetric simulations of core-collapse supernovae with the aid of heavy axion-like particles (ALPs) which interact with photons and redistribute energy within supernova matter. We explore a wide ALP parameter space that includes MeV-scale ALP mass $m_{\,a}$ and the ALP-photon coupling constant $g_{\,a \gamma} \sim 10^{\,-10} \, \rm{GeV}^{\,-1}$ , employing three progenitor models with zero-age main-sequence mass of $11.2\,M_\odot$, $20.0\,M_\odot$, and $25.0\,M_\odot$. We find a general trend that, given $m_{\,a}\lesssim 300\,$MeV, heavier ALPs are favorable for the shock wave to be successfully revived, aiding the onset of the neutrino-driven explosion. However, if ALPs are heavier than $\sim 400\,$MeV, the explosion is failed or weaker than that for the models with smaller $m_{\,a}$, because of an insufficient temperature inside the supernova core to produce heavy ALPs. The maximum temperature in the core depends on the initial progenitor structure. Our simulations indicate that the high-temperature environment in the collapsing core of massive progenitors leads to a significant impact of ALPs on the explodability.</description>

      <title>Spatial dependence of the break in the energy spectrum of cosmic rays in the new anisotropic diffusion approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At present, there is no consensus on whether the spectral break in the cosmic ray flux of all elements around 4 PeV is a general characteristic of the Milky Way or is determined by a combination of factors that significantly affect the energy position of the knee. We argue that considering the anisotropic propagation of cosmic rays within a realistically modeled Galactic magnetic field enables an accurate description of the spectral break without invoking a source-related cutoff energy, and naturally predicts a spatial dependence of this phenomenon. To demonstrate this, we constructed a 3D diffusion propagation model with a diffusion tensor within a two-component magnetic field and determined both the local cosmic ray spectrum and the spectra for specific regions of the Milky Way. We found that the spectral break is well reproduced by the energy dependence of the diffusion tensor components and appears at different energies in various regions of the Galaxy due to the inclusion of the turbulent component of the magnetic field. Furthermore, the spectral slope is determined by the degree of anisotropy in cosmic ray diffusion. The model is based on the calculation of the diffusion tensor components using the trajectory method and on the direct solution of the stationary diffusion equation with a fully anisotropic diffusion tensor that includes all nine components in the global Galactic coordinate system, accounting for off-diagonal terms arising from the projection of locally field-aligned diffusion. We calculated the integral flux of diffuse gamma rays in the inner and outer regions of the Galaxy based on the cosmic ray proton and nuclei spectra obtained within our model, which features a spatially dependent position of the knee. The resulting spectral shape of the diffuse gamma-ray flux is consistent with experimental data from LHAASO and Fermi-LAT.</description>

Abstract: Based on well-grounded Galactic neutron star populations formed from radio pulsar population syntheses of canonical pulsars (CPs) and millisecond pulsars (MSPs), we use the latest Fermi-LAT catalog (4FGL-DR4) to investigate the implications of proposed $\gamma-$ray luminosity models. Using Monte Carlo techniques, we calculate the number of CPs and MSPs that would comprise the sample of pulsar-like unidentified sources (PLUIDs) in 4FGL-DR4. While radio beaming fractions were used to scale the sizes of the populations, when forming the mock 4FGL-DR4 samples, we make the simplifying assumption that all $\gamma-$ray pulsars are beaming towards the Earth. We then explore the observable outcomes of seven different $\gamma-$ray luminosity models. Four of the models provide a good match to the observed number of PLUIDs, while three others significantly over-predict the number of PLUIDs. For these latter models, either the average beaming fraction of $\gamma-$ray pulsars is more like 25--50\%, or a revision in the luminosity scaling is required. Most of the radio detectable MSPs that our models predict as part of the PLUIDs within 4FGL-DR4 are, unsurprisingly, fainter than the currently observed sample and at larger dispersion measures. For CPs, in spite of an excellent match to the observed radio population, none of the $\gamma-$ray models we investigated could replicate the observed sample of 150 $\gamma-$ray CPs. Further work is required to understand this discrepancy. For both MSPs and CPs, we provide encouraging forecasts for targeted radio searches of PLUIDs from 4FGL-DR4 to elucidate the issues raised in this study.</description>

      <title>The EMPI Code for Plasma-Induced Effects on Radio Waves I: Non-Magnetized Media and Applications to Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electromagnetic waves undergo modifications as they propagate through plasma. We present EMPI (ElectroMagnetic-wave Plasma Interaction), a three-dimensional numerical framework designed to simulate the interaction between radio signals and cold plasma. With input plasma density profiles, intrinsic radio signals, and the time and frequency resolutions of the telescope, the code synthesizes observed signals using first-principles calculations. EMPI is capable of modeling a wide range of plasma distributions, spanning analytically described smooth functions (e.g., Gaussian or exponential profiles), statistical models (e.g., turbulent screens), and discrete macroscopic structures like isolated plasma clumps, which are difficult to model both analytically and statistically. Validation tests demonstrate excellent agreement with established plasma propagation effects, such as dispersion, lensing, scintillation, and scattering. This code provides an efficient method for handling both analytical and statistical scenarios, bridging the gap between these descriptions. Thanks to its comprehensive capabilities, EMPI is particularly useful for studying radio sources with cosmological origin, especially pulse-like signals such as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). As these signals travel through diverse and complex plasma environments across the universe, their properties are inevitably altered, resulting in observable changes. In this context, EMPI serves as a valuable tool for studying the propagation effects of these sources, helping to advance the understanding of their essence and the intervening plasma environments.</description>

      <title>A Novel Method of Modeling Extended Emission of Compact Jets: Application to Swift J1727.8-1613</title>

Abstract: Flat radio spectra of compact jets launched by both supermassive and stellar-mass black holes are explained by an interplay of self-absorbed synchrotron emission up to some distance along the jet and optically thin synchrotron at larger distances (Blandford &amp; Konigl 1979). Their spatial structure is usually studied using core shifts, in which the position of the peak (core) of the emission depends on the frequency. Here, we propose a novel method to fit the spatial dependence of the flux density at a given frequency of the jet and counterjet (when observed) using the theoretical spatial dependencies, which we provide as simple analytical formulae. We apply our method to the spatial structure of the jets in the luminous hard spectral state of the black hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8-1613. It was the most resolved continuous jet from an X-ray binary ever observed. We find that the observed approaching jet is significantly intrinsically stronger than the receding one, which we attribute to an increase in the emission of both jets with time (observationally confirmed), together with the light travel effect, causing the receding jet to be observed at an earlier epoch than the approaching one. The jets are relatively slow, with the velocity $\sim(0.3$-$0.4)c$. Our findings imply that the magnetic field strength increased with time. Also, the magnetic flux is much lower than in jets launched by `Magnetically Arrested Disks'. Our method is general, and we propose that it be applied to jets launched by stellar-mass and supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>All-sky search for individual Primordial Black Hole bursts with LHAASO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial Black Holes~(PBHs) are hypothetical black holes with a wide range of masses that formed in the early universe. As a result, they may play an important cosmological role and provide a unique probe of the early universe. A PBH with an initial mass of approximately $10^{15}$~g is expected to explode today in a final burst of Hawking radiation. In this work, we conduct an all-sky search for individual PBH burst events using the data collected from March 2021 to July 2024 by the Water Cherenkov Detector Array of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). Three PBH burst durations, 10~s, 20~s, and 100~s, are searched, with no significant PBH bursts observed. The upper limit on the local PBH burst rate density is set to be as low as 181~pc$^{-3}$~yr$^{-1}$ at 99$\%$ confidence level, representing the most stringent limit achieved to date.</description>

      <title>Nuclear matter properties from chiral-scale effective theory including a dilatonic scalar meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19023v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral effective theory has become a powerful tool for studying the low-energy properties of QCD. In this work, we apply an extended chiral effective theory -- chiral-scale effective theory -- including a dilatonic scalar meson to study nuclear matter and find that the properties around saturation density can be well reproduced. Compared to the traditionally used Walecka-type models in nuclear matter studies, our approach improves the behavior of symmetry energy and the incompressibility coefficient in describing empirical data without introducing additional freedoms. Moreover, the predicted neutron star structures fall within the constraints of GW170817, PSR J0740+6620, and PSR J0030+0451, while the maximum neutron star mass can reach about $~3M_{\odot}$ with a pure hadronic phase. Additionally, we find that symmetry patterns of the effective theory significantly impact neutron star structures. %In chiral-scale effective theory, effective operators are well organized by chiral-scale orders and freedoms induced by QCD symmetry patterns. We believe that introducing this type of theory into nuclear matter studies can lead to a deeper understanding of QCD, nuclear matter, and compact astrophysical objects.</description>

      <title>Effects of asymmetric dark matter on a magnetized neutron star: A two-fluid approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the interaction between dark matter (DM) and highly magnetized neutron stars (NSs), focusing on how DM particle mass, mass fraction, and magnetic field (MF) strength affect NS structure and stability. We consider self-interacting, nonannihilating, asymmetric fermionic DM that couples to NSs only through gravitational interaction. Using the Quantum Monte Carlo Relativistic Mean Field (QMC-RMF4) model with density-dependent magnetic fields, we investigate the magnetized equation of state and examine the accumulation of DM under various conditions. Our results show that as the DM fraction increases, the maximum gravitational mass of the NS decreases, especially for heavier DM particles, while lighter DM particles can induce a transition from a dark core to a halo structure, increasing the maximum mass. Strong MFs soften the equation of state and reduce the dark mass a NS core can retain before transitioning to a halo. By comparing our results with observations from Neutro Star Interior Composition Explorer and GW170817, we identify the possible range of DM parameters for these objects. We find that the magnetic field slightly changes these limits, mainly affecting the maximum NS mass and tidal deformability. These findings provide key insights into how DM and MF jointly shape the mass-radius relation and the stability of DM-admixed magnetized NSs.</description>

      <title>An SS433 flare caught by TESS. Fast rise times and evidence for a 13 hours quasi-period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SS433 is an exotic Galactic microquasar in which there is a supercritical inflow of matter into a compact object of likely black hole nature. Here we report on an SS433 flare that occurred during a TESS observation of Sector 54 in June of 2022. The flare lasted for about 10 days and culminated in a flux increase by a factor of three relative to quiescence. The unprecedented continuous photometric coverage of the flare afforded by TESS shows that the flux can rise and fall by up to a factor of two within 4 to 7 hours. Furthermore, there is evidence that the flare peaks occur with a quasi-period $P_{\mathrm{QPO}} = 13.3$ hours. The flare can be most naturally explained by accretion rate ($\dot{M}$) variations due to oscillations in the donor star mass loss rate. We estimate $\dot{M}$ variations up to a factor of two with an increase in the photospheric radius of the accretion disk by about the same factor, implying that a transient ``common envelope'' enshrouds the binary system during the flares. If the flares are due to radial pulsations in the donor star envelope then their quasi-period $P_{\mathrm{QPO}}$ could imply a mean density $\left &lt; \rho \right &gt; \sim 18 \text{ kg} \text{ m}^{-3}$ for the donor star, compared to $\left &lt; \rho_{\mathrm{RL}} \right &gt; = 0.7-1 \text{ kg} \text{ m}^{-3}$ for a synchronized Roche-lobe filling donor star. Another SS433 lightcurve from a Sector 80 TESS observation in 2024 hints that there may be an outflow from behind the donor star.</description>

      <title>Properties of general stationary axisymmetric spacetimes: circularity and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse properties of general stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes, with a particular focus on circularity -- an accidental symmetry enjoyed by the Kerr metric, and therefore widely assumed when searching for rotating black hole solutions in alternative theories of gravity as well as when constructing models of Kerr mimickers. Within a gauge specified by seven (or six) free functions, the local existence of which we prove, we solve the differential circularity conditions and translate them into algebraic relations among the metric components. This result opens the way to investigating the consequences of circularity breaking in a controlled manner. In particular, we construct two simple analytical examples of non-circular deformations of the Kerr spacetime. The first one is "minimal", since the horizon and the ergosphere are identical to their Kerr counterparts, except for the fact that the horizon is not Killing and its surface gravity is therefore not constant. The second is "not so minimal", as the horizon's profile can be chosen arbitrarily and the difference between the horizon and the so-called rotosurface can be appreciated. Our findings thus pave the way for further research into the phenomenology of non-circular stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes.</description>
