      <title>Variants of thick-restart Lanczos for the Bethe-Salpeter eigenvalue problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian Bethe-Salpeter eigenvalue problem is a structured eigenproblem, with real eigenvalues coming in pairs $\{\lambda,-\lambda\}$ where the corresponding pair of eigenvectors are closely related, and furthermore the left eigenvectors can be trivially obtained from the right ones. We exploit these properties to devise three variants of structure-preserving Lanczos eigensolvers to compute a subset of eigenvalues (those of either smallest or largest magnitude) together with their corresponding right and left eigenvectors. For this to be effective in real applications, we need to incorporate a thick-restart technique in a way that the overall computation preserves the problem structure. The new methods are validated in an implementation within the SLEPc library using several test matrices, some of them coming from the Yambo materials science code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and discuss a generalization of the popular MINI mixed finite element for the 2D Stokes equation by means of conforming virtual elements on polygonal meshes. We prove optimal error estimates for both velocity and pressure. Theoretical results are confirmed by several numerical tests performed with different choices of polynomial accuracy and meshes.</description>

      <title>Centroidal Voronoi Refinement in the Geometric Refinement Transform: Symmetry, Stability, and Optimal Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the Geometric Refinement Transform (GRT) by introducing centroidal Voronoi tessellations (CVTs) into the refinement process, enhancing symmetry, reconstruction accuracy, and numerical stability. By applying Lloyds algorithm at each refinement level, we minimize centroidal energy and generate Voronoi regions that better align with the functions underlying structure. This approach reduces geometric distortion, suppresses reconstruction error, and provides a natural framework for adaptive refinement. We analyze convergence properties, quantify the reduction in reconstruction error using Taylor-based estimates and Lipschitz continuous functions, and propose perturbation strategies to escape symmetry-preserving local minima. The resulting transform offers improved accuracy for applications in medical imaging, signal processing, and physics simulations, while preserving the theoretical completeness and stability guarantees of the original GRT framework.</description>

      <title>ConicCurv: A curvature estimation algorithm for planar polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ConicCurv is a new derivative-free algorithm to estimate the curvature of a plane curve from a sample of data points. It is based on a known tangent estimator method grounded on classic results of Projective Geometry and B\'ezier rational conic curves. The curvature values estimated by ConicCurv are invariant to Euclidean changes of coordinates and reproduce the exact curvature values if the data are sampled from a conic.
  We show that ConicCurv&lt; has convergence order $3$ and, if the sample points are uniformly arc-length distributed, the convergence order is $4$. The performance of ConicCurv is compared with some of the most frequently used algorithms to estimate curvatures and its performance is illustrated in the calculation of the elastic energy of subdivision curves and the location of L-curves corners.</description>

      <title>Sub-ODEs Simplify Taylor Series Algorithms for Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Taylor method for solving an ordinary differential equation initial-value problem $\dot x = f(t,x)$, $x(t_0) = x_0$, computes the Taylor series (TS) of the solution at the current point, truncated to some order, and then advances to the next point by summing the TS with a suitable step size.
  A standard ODE method (e.g. Runge-Kutta) treats function $f$ as a black box, but a Taylor solver requires $f$ to be preprocessed into a code-list of elementary operations that it interprets as operations on (truncated) TS.
  The trade-off for this extra work includes arbitrary order, typically enabling much larger step sizes.
  For a standard function, such as $\exp$, this means evaluating $v(t)=\exp(u(t))$, where $u(t),v(t)$ are TS.
  The sub-ODE method applies the ODE $d v/d u=v$, obeyed by $v=\exp(u)$, to in-line this operation as $\dot v=v\dot u$.
  This gives economy of implementation: each function that satisfies a simple ODE goes into the "Taylor library" with a few lines of code--not needing a separate recurrence relation, which is the typical approach.
  Mathematically, however, the use of sub-ODEs generally transforms the original ODE into a differential-algebraic system, making it nontrivial to ensure a sound system of recurrences for Taylor coefficients.
  We prove that, regardless of how many sub-ODEs are incorporated into $f$, this approach guarantees a sound system.
  We introduce our sub-ODE-based Matlab ODE solver and show that its performance compares favorably with solvers from the Matlab ODE suite.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transportation for the Far-field Reflector Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse reflector problem aims to design a freeform reflecting surface that can direct the light from a specified source to produce the desired illumination in the target area, which is significant in the field of geometrical non-imaging optics. Mathematically, it can be formulated as an optimization problem, which is exactly the optimal transportation problem (OT) when the target is in the far field. The gradient of OT is governed by the generalized Monge-Amp`ere equation that models the far-field reflector system. Based on the gradient, this work presents a Sobolev gradient descent method implemented within a finite element framework to solve the corresponding OT. Convergence of the method is established and numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.</description>

      <title>Continuous Data Assimilation for the Navier-Stokes Equations with Nonlinear Slip Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on continuous data assimilation (CDA) for the Navier-Stokes equations with nonlinear slip boundary conditions. CDA methods are typically employed to recover the original system when initial data or viscosity coefficients are unknown, by incorporating a feedback control term generated by observational data over a time period. In this study, based on a regularized form derived from the variational inequalities of the Navier-Stokes equations with nonlinear slip boundary conditions, we first investigate the classical CDA problem when initial data is absent. After establishing the existence, uniqueness and regularity of the solution, we prove its exponential convergence with respect to the time. Additionally, we extend the CDA to address the problem of missing viscosity coefficients and analyze its convergence order, too. Furthermore, utilizing the predictive capabilities of partial evolutionary tensor neural networks (pETNNs) for time-dependent problems, we propose a novel CDA by replacing observational data with predictions got by pETNNs. Compared with the classical CDA, the new one can achieve similar approximation accuracy but need much less computational cost. Some numerical experiments are presented, which not only validate the theoretical results, but also demonstrate the efficiency of the CDA.</description>

      <title>Explicit error bounds and guaranteed convergence of the Koopman-Hill projection stability method for linear time-periodic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Koopman-Hill projection method is used to approximate the fundamental solution matrix of linear time-periodic ordinary differential equations, possibly stemming from linearization around a periodic solution of a nonlinear dynamical system. By expressing both the true fundamental solution and its approximation as series, we derive an upper bound for the approximation error that decays exponentially with the size of the Hill matrix. Exponential decay of the Fourier coefficients of the system dynamics is key to guarantee convergence. The paper also analyzes a subharmonic formulation that improves the convergence rate. Two numerical examples, including a Duffing oscillator, illustrate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Computing adjoint mismatch of linear maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of detecting adjoint mismatch for two linear maps. To clarify, this means that we aim to calculate the operator norm for the difference of two linear maps, where for one we only have a black-box implementation for the evaluation of the map, and for the other we only have a black-box for the evaluation of the adjoint map. We give two stochastic algorithms for which we prove the almost sure convergence to the operator norm. The algorithm is a random search method for a generalization of the Rayleigh quotient and uses optimal step sizes. Additionally, a convergence analysis is done for the corresponding singular vector and the respective eigenvalue equation.</description>

      <title>Numerical solution of locally loaded Volterra integral equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volterra's integral equations with local and nonlocal loads represent the novel class of integral equations that have attracted considerable attention in recent years. These equations are a generalisation of the classic Volterra integral equations, which were first introduced by Vito Volterra in the late 19th century. The loaded Volterra integral equations are characterised by the presence of a load which complicates the process of their theoretical and numerical study. Sometimes these equation are called the equations with ``frozen'' argument. The present work is devoted to the study of Volterra equations with locally loaded integral operators. The existence and uniquness theorems are proved. Among the main contributions is the collocation method for approximate solution of such equations based on the piecewise linear approximation. To confirm the convergence of the method, a number of numerical results for solving model problems are provided.</description>

      <title>A shifted Laplace rational filter for large-scale eigenvalue problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a rational filter for computing all eigenvalues of a symmetric definite eigenvalue problem lying in an interval on the real axis. The linear systems arising from the filter embedded in the subspace iteration framework, are solved via a preconditioned Krylov method.
  The choice of the poles of the filter is based on two criteria. On the one hand, the filter should enhance the eigenvalues in the interval of interest, which suggests that the poles should be chosen close to or in the interval. On the other hand, the choice of poles has an important impact on the convergence speed of the iterative method. For the solution of problems arising from vibrations, the two criteria contradict each other, since fast convergence of the eigensolver requires poles to be in or close to the interval, whereas the iterative linear system solver becomes cheaper when the poles lie further away from the eigenvalues. In the paper, we propose a selection of poles inspired by the shifted Laplace preconditioner for the Helmholtz equation.
  We show numerical experiments from finite element models of vibrations. We compare the shifted Laplace rational filter with rational filters based on quadrature rules for contour integration.</description>

      <title>Inverse Lax-Wendroff boundary treatment for solving conservation laws with finite difference HWENO methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel inverse Lax-Wendroff (ILW) boundary treatment for finite difference Hermite weighted essentially non-oscillatory (HWENO) schemes to solve hyperbolic conservation laws on arbitrary geometries. The complex geometric domain is divided by a uniform Cartesian grid, resulting in challenge in boundary treatment. The proposed ILW boundary treatment could provide high order approximations of both solution values and spatial derivatives at ghost points outside the computational domain. Distinct from existing ILW approaches, our boundary treatment constructs the extrapolation via optimized through a least squares formulation, coupled with the spatial derivatives at the boundary obtained via the ILW procedure. Theoretical analysis indicates that compared with other ILW methods, our proposed one would require fewer terms by using the relatively complicated ILW procedure and thus improve computational efficiency while preserving accuracy and stability. The effectiveness and robustness of the method are validated through numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Message-Passing Monte Carlo (MPMC) was recently introduced as a novel low-discrepancy sampling approach leveraging tools from geometric deep learning. While originally designed for generating uniform point sets, we extend this framework to sample from general multivariate probability distributions with known probability density function. Our proposed method, Stein-Message-Passing Monte Carlo (Stein-MPMC), minimizes a kernelized Stein discrepancy, ensuring improved sample quality. Finally, we show that Stein-MPMC outperforms competing methods, such as Stein Variational Gradient Descent and (greedy) Stein Points, by achieving a lower Stein discrepancy.</description>

      <title>Multi-fidelity Learning of Reduced Order Models for Parabolic PDE Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article builds on the recently proposed RB-ML-ROM approach for parameterized parabolic PDEs and proposes a novel hierarchical Trust Region algorithm for solving parabolic PDE constrained optimization problems. Instead of using a traditional offline/online splitting approach for model order reduction, we adopt an active learning or enrichment strategy to construct a multi-fidelity hierarchy of reduced order models on-the-fly during the outer optimization loop. The multi-fidelity surrogate model consists of a full order model, a reduced order model and a machine learning model. The proposed hierarchical framework adaptively updates its hierarchy when querying parameters, utilizing a rigorous a posteriori error estimator in an error aware trust region framework. Numerical experiments are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Strong convergence and stability of stochastic theta method for time-changed stochastic differential equations with local Lipschitz coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the stochastic theta (ST) method is investigated for a class of stochastic differential equations driven by a time-changed Brownian motion, whose coefficients are time-space-dependent and satisfy the local Lipschitz condition. It is proved that under the local Lipschitz and some additional assumptions, the ST method with $\theta\in[1/2,1]$ is strongly convergent. It is also obtained that, for all positive stepsizes, the ST method with $\theta\in[1/2,1]$ is asymptotically mean square stable under a coercivity condition. With some restrictions on the stepsize, the ST method with $\theta\in[0,1/2)$ is asymptotically mean square stable under a stronger assumption. Some numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of kernel matrices in the flat limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14067</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.14067v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kernel matrices are of central importance to many applied fields. In this manuscript, we focus on spectral properties of kernel matrices in the so-called ``flat limit'', which occurs when points are close together relative to the scale of the kernel. We establish asymptotic expressions for the determinants of the kernel matrices, which we then leverage to obtain asymptotic expressions for the main terms of the eigenvalues. Analyticity of the eigenprojectors yields expressions for limiting eigenvectors, which are strongly tied to discrete orthogonal polynomials. Both smooth and finitely smooth kernels are covered, with stronger results available in the finite smoothness case.</description>

      <title>Robust Eigenvectors of Symmetric Tensors</title>

Abstract: The tensor power method generalizes the matrix power method to higher order arrays, or tensors. Like in the matrix case, the fixed points of the tensor power method are the eigenvectors of the tensor. While every real symmetric matrix has an eigendecomposition, the vectors generating a symmetric decomposition of a real symmetric tensor are not always eigenvectors of the tensor.
  In this paper we show that whenever an eigenvector is a generator of the symmetric decomposition of a symmetric tensor, then (if the order of the tensor is sufficiently high) this eigenvector is robust, i.e., it is an attracting fixed point of the tensor power method. We exhibit new classes of symmetric tensors whose symmetric decomposition consists of eigenvectors. Generalizing orthogonally decomposable tensors, we consider equiangular tight frame decomposable and equiangular set decomposable tensors. Our main result implies that such tensors can be decomposed using the tensor power method.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis of a solver for the linear Poisson--Boltzmann model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.07958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the convergence of a domain decomposition method for the Poisson-Boltzmann model that can be formulated as an interior-exterior transmission problem. To study its convergence, we introduce an interior-exterior constant providing an upper bound of the $L^2$ norm of any harmonic function in the interior, and establish a spectral equivalence for related Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators to estimate the spectrum of interior-exterior iteration operator. This analysis is nontrivial due to the unboundedness of the exterior subdomain, which distinguishes it from the classical analysis of the Schwarz alternating method with nonoverlapping bounded subdomains. It is proved that for the linear Poisson-Boltzmann solvent model in reality, the convergence of interior-exterior iteration is ensured when the relaxation parameter lies between 0 and 2. This convergence result interprets the good performance of ddLPB method developed in [SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 41 (2019), pp. B320-B350] where the relaxation parameter is set to 1. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify our convergence analysis and to investigate the optimal relaxation parameter for the interior-exterior iteration.</description>

      <title>The geometric error is less than the pollution error when solving the high-frequency Helmholtz equation with high-order FEM on curved domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the $h$-version of the finite-element method, where accuracy is increased by decreasing the meshwidth $h$ while keeping the polynomial degree $p$ constant, applied to the Helmholtz equation. Although the question "how quickly must $h$ decrease as the wavenumber $k$ increases to maintain accuracy?" has been studied intensively since the 1990s, none of the existing rigorous wavenumber-explicit analyses take into account the approximation of the geometry. In this paper we prove that for nontrapping problems solved using straight elements the geometric error is order $kh$, which is then less than the pollution error $k(kh)^{2p}$ when $k$ is large; this fact is then illustrated in numerical experiments. More generally, we prove that, even for problems with strong trapping, using degree four (in 2-d) or degree five (in 3-d) polynomials and isoparametric elements ensures that the geometric error is smaller than the pollution error for most large wavenumbers.</description>

      <title>A convergent adaptive finite element stochastic Galerkin method based on multilevel expansions of random fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The subject of this work is an adaptive stochastic Galerkin finite element method for parametric or random elliptic partial differential equations, which generates sparse product polynomial expansions with respect to the parametric variables of solutions. For the corresponding spatial approximations, an independently refined finite element mesh is used for each polynomial coefficient. The method relies on multilevel expansions of input random fields and achieves error reduction with uniform rate. In particular, the saturation property for the refinement process is ensured by the algorithm. The results are illustrated by numerical experiments, including cases with random fields of low regularity.</description>

      <title>Flow updates for domain decomposition of entropic optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09400v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain decomposition has been shown to be a computationally efficient distributed method for solving large scale entropic optimal transport problems. However, a naive implementation of the algorithm can freeze in the limit of very fine partition cells (i.e. it asymptotically becomes stationary and does not find the global minimizer), since information can only travel slowly between cells. In practice this can be avoided by a coarse-to-fine multiscale scheme. In this article we introduce flow updates as an alternative approach. Flow updates can be interpreted as a variant of the celebrated algorithm by Angenent, Haker, and Tannenbaum, and can be combined canonically with domain decomposition. We prove convergence to the global minimizer and provide a formal discussion of its continuity limit. We give a numerical comparison with naive and multiscale domain decomposition, and show that the flow updates prevent freezing in the regime of very many cells. While the multiscale scheme is observed to be faster than the hybrid approach in general, the latter could be a viable alternative in cases where a good initial coupling is available. Our numerical experiments are based on a novel GPU implementation of domain decomposition that we describe in the appendix.</description>

      <title>Gaussian process regression with log-linear scaling for common non-stationary kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a fast algorithm for Gaussian process regression in low dimensions, applicable to a widely-used family of non-stationary kernels. The non-stationarity of these kernels is induced by arbitrary spatially-varying vertical and horizontal scales. In particular, any stationary kernel can be accommodated as a special case, and we focus especially on the generalization of the standard Mat\'ern kernel. Our subroutine for kernel matrix-vector multiplications scales almost optimally as $O(N\log N)$, where $N$ is the number of regression points. Like the recently developed equispaced Fourier Gaussian process (EFGP) methodology, which is applicable only to stationary kernels, our approach exploits non-uniform fast Fourier transforms (NUFFTs). We offer a complete analysis controlling the approximation error of our method, and we validate the method's practical performance with numerical experiments. In particular we demonstrate improved scalability compared to to state-of-the-art rank-structured approaches in spatial dimension $d&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>Multiple scales analysis of a nonlinear timestepping instability in simulations of solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The susceptibility of timestepping algorithms to numerical instabilities is an important consideration when simulating partial differential equations (PDEs). Here we identify and analyze a pernicious numerical instability arising in pseudospectral simulations of nonlinear wave propagation resulting in finite-time blow-up. The blow-up time scale is independent of the spatial resolution and spectral basis but sensitive to the timestepping scheme and the timestep size. The instability appears in multi-step and multi-stage implicit-explicit (IMEX) timestepping schemes of different orders of accuracy and has been found to manifest in simulations of soliton solutions of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation and traveling wave solutions of a nonlinear generalized Klein-Gordon equation. Focusing on the case of KdV solitons, we show that modal predictions from linear stability theory are unable to explain the instability because the spurious growth from linear dispersion is small and nonlinear sources of error growth converge too slowly in the limit of small timestep size. We then develop a novel multi-scale asymptotic framework that captures the slow, nonlinear accumulation of timestepping errors. The framework allows the solution to vary with respect to multiple time scales related to the timestep size and thus recovers the instability as a function of a slow time scale dictated by the order of accuracy of the timestepping scheme. We show that this approach correctly describes our simulations of solitons by making accurate predictions of the blow-up time scale and transient features of the instability. Our work demonstrates that studies of long-time simulations of nonlinear waves should exercise caution when validating their timestepping schemes.</description>

      <title>Nonnegative Biquadratic Tensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An M-eigenvalue of a nonnegative biquadratic tensor is referred to as an M$^+$-eigenvalue if it has a pair of nonnegative M-eigenvectors. If furthermore that pair of M-eigenvectors is positive, then that M$^+$-eigenvalue is called an M$^{++}$-eigenvalue. A nonnegative biquadratic tensor has at least one M$^+$ eigenvalue, and the largest M$^+$-eigenvalue is both the largest M-eigenvalue and the M-spectral radius. For irreducible nonnegative biquadratic tensors, all the M$^+$-eigenvalues are M$^{++}$-eigenvalues. Although the M$^+$-eigenvalues of irreducible nonnegative biquadratic tensors are not unique in general, we establish a sufficient condition to ensure their uniqueness. For an irreducible nonnegative biquadratic tensor, the largest M$^+$-eigenvalue has a max-min characterization, while the smallest M$^+$-eigenvalue has a min-max characterization. A Collatz algorithm for computing the largest M$^+$-eigenvalues is proposed. Numerical results are reported.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.05183v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop data-driven methods incorporating geometric and topological information to learn parsimonious representations of nonlinear dynamics from observations. The approaches learn nonlinear state-space models of the dynamics for general manifold latent spaces using training strategies related to Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). Our methods are referred to as Geometric Dynamic (GD) Variational Autoencoders (GD-VAEs). We learn encoders and decoders for the system states and evolution based on deep neural network architectures that include general Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and other architectures. Motivated by problems arising in parameterized PDEs and physics, we investigate the performance of our methods on tasks for learning reduced dimensional representations of the nonlinear Burgers Equations, Constrained Mechanical Systems, and spatial fields of Reaction-Diffusion Systems. GD-VAEs provide methods that can be used to obtain representations in manifold latent spaces for diverse learning tasks involving dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the Computational Power of Particle Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10286v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the computational power of particle methods, a well-established class of algorithms with applications in scientific computing and computer simulation. The computational power of a compute model determines the class of problems it can solve. Automata theory allows describing the computational power of abstract machines (automata) and the problems they can solve. At the top of the Chomsky hierarchy of formal languages and grammars are Turing machines, which resemble the concept on which most modern computers are built. Although particle methods can be interpreted as automata based on their formal definition, their computational power has so far not been studied. We address this by analyzing Turing completeness of particle methods. In particular, we prove two sets of restrictions under which a particle method is still Turing powerful, and we show when it loses Turing powerfulness. This contributes to understanding the theoretical foundations of particle methods and provides insight into the powerfulness of computer simulations.</description>

      <title>Homotopy Methods for Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convex optimization encompasses a wide range of optimization problems that contain many efficiently solvable subclasses. Interior point methods are currently the state-of-the-art approach for solving such problems, particularly effective for classes like semidefinite programming, quadratic programming, and geometric programming. However, their success hinges on the construction of self-concordant barrier functions for feasible sets. In this work, we investigate and develop a homotopy-based approach to solve convex optimization problems. While homotopy methods have been considered in optimization before, their potential for general convex programs remains underexplored. This approach gradually transforms the feasible set of a trivial optimization problem into the target one while tracking solutions by solving a differential equation, in contrast to traditional central path methods. We establish a criterion that ensures that the homotopy method correctly solves the optimization problem and prove the existence of such homotopies for several important classes, including semidefinite and hyperbolic programs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach numerically outperforms state-of-the-art methods in hyperbolic programming, highlighting its practical advantages.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model for a universal digital quantum computer with an application to the Grover-Rudolph algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13388v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel mathematical framework for universal digital quantum computation using algebraic probability theory. We rigorously define quantum circuits as finite sequences of elementary quantum gates and establish their role in implementing unitary transformations. A key result demonstrates that every unitary matrix in \(\mathrm{U}(N)\) can be expressed as a product of elementary quantum gates, leading to the concept of a universal dictionary for quantum computation. We apply this framework to the construction of quantum circuits that encode probability distributions, focusing on the Grover-Rudolph algorithm. By leveraging controlled quantum gates and rotation matrices, we design a quantum circuit that approximates a given probability density function. Numerical simulations, conducted using Qiskit, confirm the theoretical predictions and validate the effectiveness of our approach. These results provide a rigorous foundation for quantum circuit synthesis within an algebraic probability framework and offer new insights into the encoding of probability distributions in quantum algorithms. Potential applications include quantum machine learning, circuit optimization, and experimental implementations on real quantum hardware.</description>
