      <title>Killing versus branching: Unexplored facets of diffusive relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the relaxation dynamics of Feynman-Kac path integral kernel functions in terms of branching diffusion processes with killing. This sheds new light on the admissible path-wise description of the relaxation to equilibrium for conditioned Brownian motions, and diffusion processes with absorbing boundaries, where Feynman-Kac kernels appear as the building blocks of inferred transition probability density functions.</description>

      <title>An Exactly Solvable Model for Single-Lane Unidirectional Ant Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2002, Chowdhury et al. introduced a simplified model aimed at depicting the dynamics of single-lane unidirectional ant traffic. Despite efforts, an exact solution for the stationary state of this ant-trail model remains elusive. The primary challenge arises from inherent fluctuations in the total amount of pheromone along the ant-trail. These fluctuations significantly influence ant movement. Consequently, unlike conventional models involving driven interacting particles, the average velocity exhibits non-monotonic behavior with ant density. In this study, we propose an exactly solvable model for ant traffic whose dynamics is based on the one in Chowdhury et al.'s model, and then discuss the circumstances under which the non-monotonic trend of average velocity arises.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of Complex Networks with Partition Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While renormalization groups are fundamental in physics, renormalization of complex networks remains vague in its conceptual definition and methodology. Here, we propose a novel strategy to renormalize complex networks. Rather than resorting to handling the bare structure of a network, we overlay it with a readily renormalizable physical model, which reflects real-world scenarios with a broad generality. From the renormalization of the overlying system, we extract a rigorous and simple renormalization group transformation of arbitrary networks. In this way, we obtain a transparent, model-dependent physical meaning of the network renormalization, which in our case is a scale transformation preserving the transition dynamics of low-density particles. We define the strength of a node in accordance with the physical model and trace the change of its distribution under our renormalization process. This analysis demonstrates that the strength distributions of scale-free networks remain scale-invariant, whereas those of homogeneous random networks do not.</description>

      <title>Self-phoretic oscillatory motion in a harmonic trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the motion of a harmonically trapped overdamped particle, which is submitted to a self-phoretic force, that is proportional to the gradient of a diffusive field for which the particle itself is the source. In agreement with existing results for free particles or particles in a bounded domain, we find that the system exhibits a transition between an immobile phase, where the particle stays at the center of the trap, and an oscillatory state. We perform an exact analysis giving access to the bifurcation threshold, as well as the frequency of oscillations and their amplitude near the threshold. Our analysis also characterizes the shape of two-dimensional oscillations, that take place along a circle or a straight line. Our results are confirmed by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Time evolution of the Boltzmann entropy for a nonequilibrium dilute gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the time evolution of the Boltzmann entropy of a dilute gas of N particles, N&gt;&gt;1, as it undergoes a free expansion doubling its volume. The microstate of the system, a point in the 4N dimensional phase space, changes in time via Hamiltonian dynamics. Its entropy, at any time $t$, is given by the logarithm of the phase space volume of all the microstates giving rise to its macrostate at time $t$. The macrostates that we consider are defined by coarse graining the one-particle phase space into cells $\Delta_\alpha$. The initial and final macrostates of the system are equilibrium states in volumes $V$ and $2V$, with the same energy $E$ and particle number $N$. Their entropy per particle is given, for sufficiently large systems, by the thermodynamic entropy as a function of the particle and energy density, whose leading term is independent of the size of the $\Delta_\alpha$. The intermediate (non-equilibrium) entropy does however depend on the size of the cells $\Delta_\alpha$. Its change with time is due to (i) dispersal in physical space from free motion and to (ii) the collisions between particles which change their velocities. The former depends strongly on the size of the velocity coarse graining $\Delta v$: it produces entropy at a rate proportional to $\Delta v$. This dependence is investigated numerically and analytically for a dilute two-dimensional gas of hard discs. It becomes significant when the mean free path between collisions is of the same order or larger than the length scale of the initial spatial inhomogeneity. In the opposite limit, the rate of entropy production is essentially independent of $\Delta v$ and is given by the Boltzmann equation for the limit $\Delta v\rightarrow 0$. We show that when both processes are active the time dependence of the entropy has a scaling form involving the ratio of the rates of its production by the two processes.</description>

      <title>Trade-offs and thermodynamics of energy-relay proofreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological processes that are able to discriminate between different molecules consume energy and dissipate heat. They operate at different levels of fidelity and speed, and as a consequence there exist fundamental trade-offs between these quantities and the entropy production rate. Usually, the energy source required to operate in a high-fidelity regime comes from the consumption of external energetic molecules, e.g., GTP hydrolysis in protein translation . In this work, we study trade-offs between several kinetic and thermodynamic observables for Hopfield's energy-relay mechanism, which does not consume external molecules and is able to operate in depleted regions, at the cost of a higher error rate. The trade-offs are obtained both analytically and numerically via Pareto optimal fronts. We find that the scheme is able to operate in three distinct regimes: an energy relay regime, a mixed relay-Michaelis-Menten regime, and a Michaelis-Menten regime, depending on the kinetic and energetic parameters that tune transitions between states. The mixed regime features a dynamical phase transition in the error-entropy production Pareto trade-off, while the pure energy relay regime contains a region where this type of proofreading energetically outperforms standard kinetic proofreading.</description>

      <title>Discrete Laplacian thermostat for flocks and swarms: the fully conserved Inertial Spin Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments on bird flocks and midge swarms reveal that these natural systems are well described by an active theory in which conservation laws play a crucial role. By building a symplectic structure that couples the particles' velocities to the generator of their internal rotations (spin), the Inertial Spin Model (ISM) reinstates a second-order temporal dynamics that captures many phenomenological traits of flocks and swarms. The reversible structure of the ISM predicts that the total spin is a constant of motion, the central conservation law responsible for all the novel dynamical features of the model. However, fluctuations and dissipation introduced in the original model to make it relax, violate the spin conservation law, so that the ISM aligns with the biophysical phenomenology only within finite-size regimes, beyond which the overdamped dynamics characteristic of the Vicsek model takes over. Here, we introduce a novel version of the ISM, in which the irreversible terms needed to relax the dynamics strictly respect the conservation of the spin. We perform a numerical investigation of the fully conservative model, exploring both the fixed-network case, which belongs to the equilibrium class of Model G, and the active case, characterized by self-propulsion of the agents and an out-of-equilibrium reshuffling of the underlying interaction network. Our simulations not only capture the correct spin wave phenomenology of the ordered phase, but they also yield dynamical critical exponents in the near-ordering phase that agree very well with the theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Many-sided Poisson-Voronoi cells with only Gabriel neighbors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p_n^G$ be the probability for a planar Poisson-Voronoi cell to be $n$-sided {\it and\,} have only Gabriel neighbors. Using an exact coordinate transformation followed by scaling arguments and a mean-field type calculation, we obtain the asymptotic expansion of $\log p_n^G$ in the limit of large $n$. We determine several statistical properties of a many-sided cell obeying this `Gabriel condition.' In particular, the cell perimeter, when parametrized as a function $\tau(\theta)$ of the polar angle $\theta$, behaves as a Brownian bridge on the interval $0\le\theta\le 2\pi$. We point out similarities and differences with related problems in random geometry.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Localization in the Age of Classical Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical mechanics provides a framework for describing the physics of large, complex many-body systems using only a few macroscopic parameters to determine the state of the system. For isolated quantum many-body systems, such a description is achieved via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which links thermalization, ergodicity and quantum chaotic behavior. However, tendency towards thermalization is not observed at finite system sizes and evolution times in a robust many-body localization (MBL) regime found numerically and experimentally in the dynamics of interacting many-body systems at strong disorder. Although the phenomenology of the MBL regime is well-established, the central question remains unanswered: under what conditions does the MBL regime give rise to an MBL phase in which the thermalization does not occur even in the asymptotic limit of infinite system size and evolution time?
  This review focuses on recent numerical investigations aiming to clarify the status of the MBL phase, and it establishes the critical open questions about the dynamics of disordered many-body systems. Persistent finite size drifts towards ergodicity consistently emerge in spectral properties of disordered many-body systems, excluding naive single-parameter scaling hypothesis and preventing comprehension of the status of the MBL phase. The drifts are related to tendencies towards thermalization and non-vanishing transport observed in the dynamics of many-body systems, even at strong disorder. These phenomena impede understanding of microscopic processes at the ETH-MBL crossover. Nevertheless, the abrupt slowdown of dynamics with increasing disorder strength suggests the proximity of the MBL phase. This review concludes that the questions about thermalization and its failure in disordered many-body systems remain a captivating area open for further explorations.</description>

      <title>Operator size growth in Lindbladian SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the growth of operator size in the Lindbladian SYK model with $q$-body interaction terms and linear jump terms at finite dissipation strength. We compute the operator size as well as its distribution numerically at finite $q$ and analytically at large $q$. With dissipative (productive) jump terms, the size converges to a value smaller (larger) than half the number of Majorana fermions. At weak dissipation, the evolution of operator size displays a quadratic-exponential-plateau behavior. The plateau value is determined by the ratios between the coupling of the interaction and the linear jump term in the large $q$ limit. The operator size distribution remains localized in the finite size region even at late times, contrasting with the unitary case. Moreover, we also derived the time-independent orthogonal basis for operator expansion which exhibits the ``operator size concentration'' at finite dissipation. Finally, we observe that the uncertainty relation for operator size growth is saturated at large $q$, leading to a classical dynamics of the operator size growth with dissipation.</description>

      <title>From the Fokker-Planck equation to a contact Hamiltonian system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fokker-Planck equation is one of the fundamental equations in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, and this equation is known to be derived from the Wasserstein gradient flow equation with a free energy. This gradient flow equation describes relaxation processes and is formulated on Riemannian manifolds. Meanwhile contact Hamiltonian systems are also known to describe relaxation processes. Hence a relation between these two equations is expected to be clarified, which gives a solid foundation in geometric statistical mechanics. In this paper a class of contact Hamiltonian systems is derived from a class of the Fokker-Planck equations on Riemannian manifolds. In the course of the derivation, the Fokker-Planck equation is shown to be written as a diffusion equation with a weighted Laplacian without any approximation, which enables to employ a theory of eigenvalue problems.</description>

      <title>Steady Granular Flow in a Rotating Drum: Universal description of stress, velocity and packing fraction profiles covering grain shape effects from convex to very concave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The flow behavior of granular matter is significantly influenced by the shape of constituent particles. This effect is particularly pronounced for very concave particles, which exhibit unique flow characteristics such as higher porosity and sharper phase transitions between jamming and unjamming states. Despite the richness and ubiquitousness of these systems, our understanding of their intricate flow behavior and the local mechanisms driving these behaviors remains incomplete. In this work, we investigate the effect of particle shape, ranging from spherical to highly concave, on steady flows in a rotating drum - a system that facilitates a continuous phase transition from a jamming state at greater depths to an unjamming state at shallower regions. We develop an analytical model to elucidate granular behavior within the rotating drum: (i) Firstly, by decomposing the shear stress, we reconcile the discrepancy between simulation data and theoretical predictions, establishing a relationship with the angle of repose. (ii)Secondly, we extend the generalized Bagnold scaling , coupled with a non-local fluidity relation based on packing fraction, providing a framework for a correlation between shear stress, shear rate, and packing fraction. Additionally, we introduce a characteristic length to quantify the influence of particle shape and drum speed. This analytical model offers explicit functional forms for physical quantity profiles, which are validated experimentally in a thin rotating drum and numerically in a two-dimensional rotating drum. Our results demonstrate that this model accurately describes the change of velocity due to the phase transition of granular flow within a rotating drum. Moreover, for different shapes of particle and drum speeds, the characteristic length captures the interplay between shear stress, shear rate, and the variation of packing fraction.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic critical slowing down in complex systems: from statics to dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider second-order phase transitions in which the order parameter is a replicated overlap matrix. We focus on a tricritical point that occurs in a variety of mean-field models and that, more generically, describes higher order liquid-liquid or liquid-glass transitions. We show that the static replicated theory implies slowing down with a logarithmic decay in time. The dynamical equations turn out to be those predicted by schematic Mode Coupling Theory for supercooled viscous liquids at a $A_3$ singularity, where the parameter exponent is $\lambda=1$. We obtain a quantitative expression for the parameter $\mu$ of the logarithmic decay in terms of cumulants of the overlap, which are physically observable in experiments or numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce protocols to prepare many-body quantum states with quantum circuits assisted by local operations and classical communication. First, we show that by lifting the requirement of exact preparation, one can substantially save resources. In particular, the so-called $W$ and, more generally, Dicke states require a circuit depth and number of ancillas that are independent of the system size. We also show how one can save resources in the preparation of eigenstates of well-known spin models, both free and interacting. As a biproduct of our work, we introduce an efficient scheme to implement certain non-local, non-Clifford unitary operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In $4$-dimensional pure compact $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory, we analyse topological aspects of the dynamics of monopoles across the deconfinement phase transition. We do this using tools from Topological Data Analysis (TDA). We demonstrate that observables constructed from the zeroth and first homology groups of monopole current networks may be used to quantitatively and robustly locate the critical inverse coupling $\beta_{c}$ through finite-size scaling. Our method provides a mathematically robust framework for the characterisation of topological invariants related to monopole currents, putting on firmer ground earlier investigations. Moreover, our approach can be generalised to the study of Abelian monopoles in non-Abelian gauge theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a scheme for investigating arbitrary thermal observables in spatially inhomogeneous many-body systems. Extending the equilibrium ensemble yields any given observable as an explicit hyper-density functional. Associated local fluctuation profiles follow from an exact hyper-Ornstein-Zernike equation. Simulation-based supervised machine learning trains neural networks that act as hyper-direct correlation functionals which facilitate efficient and accurate predictions. We exemplify the approach for the cluster statistics of hard rods and square well particles. The theory provides access to complex order parameters, as is impossible in standard density functional theory.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium symmetry-protected topological order: emergence of semilocal Gibbs ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.02221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider nonequilibrium time evolution in quantum spin chains after a global quench. Usually a nonequilibium quantum many-body system locally relaxes to a (generalised) Gibbs ensemble built from conserved operators with quasilocal densities. Here we exhibit explicit examples of local Hamiltonians that possess conservation laws with densities that are not quasilocal but act as such in the symmetry-restricted space where time evolution occurs. Because of them, the stationary state emerging at infinite time can exhibit exceptional features. We focus on a specific example with a spin-flip symmetry, which is the commonest global symmetry encountered in spin-$1/2$ chains. Among the exceptional properties, we find that, at late times, the excess of entropy of a spin block triggered by a local perturbation in the initial state grows logarithmically with the subsystem's length. We establish a connection with symmetry-protected topological order in equilibrium at zero temperature and study the melting of the order induced either by a (symmetry-breaking) rotation of the initial state or by an increase of the temperature.</description>

      <title>Melting of the two-dimensional solid phase in the Gaussian-core model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.02802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A general theory for the melting of two dimensional solids explaining the universal and non-universal properties is an open problem up to date. Although the celebrated KTHNY theory have been able to predict the critical properties of the melting transition in a variety cases, it is already known that it is not able to capture the occurrence of first order transitions observed in certain systems as well as it doesn't provide a clear way to calculate the melting temperature for a specific model. In the present work we have developed an analytical method that combines Self Consistent Variational Approximation with the Renormalization Group in order to deal simultaneously with the phonon fluctuations and the topological defects present in the melting process of two dimensional crystals. The method was applied with impressive success to the study of the phase diagram of the Gaussian-core model, capturing not only the reentrant feature of its 2D solid phase, but also the related critical temperatures as a function of the density in quantitative detail. The developed method can be directly applied to study the melting of any hexagonal simple crystal formed by particles interacting through any finite pairwise interaction potential. Additionally, it has the potential to explain the occurrence of first order transitions in the melting process of two dimensional crystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04975v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Harvesting free energy from the environment is essential for the operation of many biological and artificial systems. We investigate the maximum rate of harvesting achievable by optimizing a set of reactions in a Markovian system, possibly given topological, kinetic, and thermodynamic constraints. We show that the maximum harvesting rate can be expressed as a variational principle, which we solve in closed-form for three physically meaningful regimes. Our approach is relevant for optimal design and for quantifying efficiency of existing reactions. Our results are illustrated on bacteriorhodopsin, a light-driven proton pump from Archae, which is found to be close to optimal under realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>The nonequilibrium evolution near the phase boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18468v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the single-spin flipping dynamics, we study the nonequilibrium evolution near the entire phase boundary of the 3D Ising model, and find that the average of relaxation time (RT) near the first-order phase transition line (1st-PTL) is significantly larger than that near the critical point (CP). As the system size increases, the average of RT near the 1st-PTL increases at a higher power compared to that near the CP. We further show that RT near the 1st-PTL is not only non-self-averaging, but actually self-diverging: relative variance of RT increases with system size. The presence of coexisting and metastable states results in a substantial increase in randomness near the 1st-PTL, and therefore makes the equilibrium more difficult to achieve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic resetting is a protocol of starting anew, which can be used to facilitate the escape kinetics. We demonstrate that restarting can accelerate the escape kinetics from a finite interval restricted by two absorbing boundaries also in the presence of heavy-tailed, L\'evy type, $\alpha$-stable noise. However, the width of the domain where resetting is beneficial depends on the value of the stability index $\alpha$ determining power-law decay of jump length distribution. For heavier (smaller $\alpha$) distributions the domain becomes narrower in comparison to lighter tails. Additionally, we explore connections between L\'evy flights and L\'evy walks in presence of stochastic resetting. First of all, we show that for L\'evy walks, the stochastic resetting can be beneficial also in the domain where coefficient of variation is smaller than 1. Moreover, we demonstrate that in the domain where LW are characterized by a finite mean jump duration/length, with the increasing width of the interval LW start to share similarities with LF under stochastic resetting.</description>

Abstract: Building on parallels between geometric quantum mechanics and classical mechanics, we explore an alternative basis for quantum thermodynamics that exploits the differential geometry of the underlying state space. We develop both microcanonical and canonical ensembles, introducing continuous mixed states as distributions on the manifold of quantum states. We call out the experimental consequences for a gas of qudits. We define quantum heat and work in an intrinsic way, including single-trajectory work, and reformulate thermodynamic entropy in a way that accords with classical, quantum, and information-theoretic entropies. We give both the First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics and Jarzynki's Fluctuation Theorem. The result is a more transparent physics, than conventionally available, in which the mathematical structure and physical intuitions underlying classical and quantum dynamics are seen to be closely aligned.</description>

      <title>Quantum Information Dimension and Geometric Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.06374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geometric quantum mechanics, through its differential-geometric underpinning, provides additional tools of analysis and interpretation that bring quantum mechanics closer to classical mechanics: state spaces in both are equipped with symplectic geometry. This opens the door to revisiting foundational questions and issues, such as the nature of quantum entropy, from a geometric perspective. Central to this is the concept of geometric quantum state -- the probability measure on a system's space of pure states. This space's continuity leads us to introduce two analysis tools, inspired by Renyi's information theory, to characterize and quantify fundamental properties of geometric quantum states: the quantum information dimension that is the rate of geometric quantum state compression and the dimensional geometric entropy that monitors information stored in quantum states. We recount their classical definitions, information-theoretic meanings, and physical interpretations, and adapt them to quantum systems via the geometric approach. We then explicitly compute them in various examples and classes of quantum system. We conclude commenting on future directions for information in geometric quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Kinetically constrained models out of equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.08437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the full class of kinetically constrained models in arbitrary dimension and out of equilibrium, in the regime where the density $q$ of facilitating sites in the equilibrium measure (but not necessarily in the initial measure) is close to $1$. For these models, we establish exponential convergence to equilibrium in infinite volume and linear time precutoff in finite volume with appropriate boundary condition. Our results are the first out-of-equilibrium results that hold for any model in the so-called critical class, which is covered in its entirety by our treatment, including e.g. the Fredrickson-Andersen 2-spin facilitated model. In addition, they generalise, unify and sometimes simplify several previous works in the field. As byproduct, we recover and generalise exponential tails for the connected component of the origin in the upper invariant trajectory of perturbed cellular automata and in the set of eventually infected sites in subcritical bootstrap percolation models. Our approach goes through the study of cooperative contact processes, last passage percolation, Toom contours, as well as a very convenient coupling between contact processes and kinetically constrained models.</description>

      <title>Diagnostics of mixed-state topological order and breakdown of quantum memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.05689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological quantum memory can protect information against local errors up to finite error thresholds. Such thresholds are usually determined based on the success of decoding algorithms rather than the intrinsic properties of the mixed states describing corrupted memories. Here we provide an intrinsic characterization of the breakdown of topological quantum memory, which both gives a bound on the performance of decoding algorithms and provides examples of topologically distinct mixed states. We employ three information-theoretical quantities that can be regarded as generalizations of the diagnostics of ground-state topological order, and serve as a definition for topological order in error-corrupted mixed states. We consider the topological contribution to entanglement negativity and two other metrics based on quantum relative entropy and coherent information. In the concrete example of the 2D Toric code with local bit-flip and phase errors, we map three quantities to observables in 2D classical spin models and analytically show they all undergo a transition at the same error threshold. This threshold is an upper bound on that achieved in any decoding algorithm and is indeed saturated by that in the optimal decoding algorithm for the Toric code.</description>

      <title>A Solvable Model of Quantum Darwinism-Encoding Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03694v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a solvable model of Quantum Darwinism to encoding transitions -- abrupt changes in how quantum information spreads in a many-body system under unitary dynamics. We consider a random Clifford circuit on an expanding tree, whose input qubit is entangled with a reference. The model has a Quantum Darwinism phase, where one classical bit of information about the reference can be retrieved from an arbitrarily small fraction of the output qubits, and an encoding phase where such retrieval is impossible. The two phases are separated by a mixed phase and two continuous transitions. We compare the exact result to a two-replica calculation. The latter yields a similar ``annealed'' phase diagram, which applies also to a model with Haar random unitaries. We relate our approach to measurement induced phase transitions (MIPTs), by solving a modified model where an environment eavesdrops on an encoding system. It has a sharp MIPT only with full access to the environment.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the great success of classical generative models in machine learning, enthusiastic exploration of their quantum version has recently started. To depart on this journey, it is important to develop a relevant metric to evaluate the quality of quantum generative models; in the classical case, one such example is the inception score. In this paper, we propose the quantum inception score, which relates the quality to the Holevo information of the quantum channel that classifies a given dataset. We prove that, under this proposed measure, the quantum generative models provide better quality than their classical counterparts because of the presence of quantum coherence, characterized by the resource theory of asymmetry, and entanglement. Furthermore, we harness the quantum fluctuation theorem to characterize the physical limitation of the quality of quantum generative models. Finally, we apply the quantum inception score to assess the quality of the one-dimensional spin chain model as a quantum generative model, with the quantum convolutional neural network as a quantum classifier, for the phase classification problem in the quantum many-body physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Darwinism (QD) proposes that classical objectivity emerges from the broadcast of information about a microscopic degree of freedom into multiple fractions of a many-body environment. Such a broadcast of information is in sharp contrast with its scrambling under strong interaction. It was recently shown that quantum dynamics interpolating between broadcasting and scrambling may display sharp phase transitions of information propagation, named QD-encoding transitions. Here, we initiate their systematic study in generic, non-Clifford settings. First, in a general theoretical setup where the information propagation is modeled as an isometry, whose input qudit is entangled with a reference, we propose a probe of the transitions -- the distribution of the density matrix of the reference after measuring an environment fraction. This probe measures the classical correlation between the fraction and the injected information. We then apply the framework to two similar models defined by a tensor network on an expanding tree, modeling a noisy apparatus that attempts to broadcast the $z$ component of a spin-half. We derive an exact recursion relation of the density matrix distribution, which we analyze analytically and numerically. As a result we find three phases: QD, intermediate and encoding, and two continuous transitions. The encoding-intermediate transition describes the establishment of nonzero correlation between the reference and a small environment fraction, and can be probed by a ``coarse-grained'' measure of the total spin-$z$ of the fraction, which becomes non-Gaussian and symmetry breaking in the intermediate space. The QD-intermediate transition is about whether the correlation is perfect. It must be probed by fined-grained measures, and corresponds to a more subtle symmetry breaking in the replica space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building upon recent research in spin systems with non-local interactions, this study investigates operator growth using the Krylov complexity in different non-local versions of the Ising model. We find that the non-locality results in a faster scrambling of the operator to all sites. While the saturation value of Krylov complexity of local integrable and local chaotic theories differ by a significant margin, this difference is much suppressed when non-local terms are introduced in both regimes. This results from the faster scrambling of information in the presence of non-locality. In addition, we investigate the behavior of level statistics and spectral form factor as probes of quantum chaos to study the integrability breaking due to non-local interactions. Our numerics indicate that in the non-local case, late time saturation of Krylov complexity distinguishes between different underlying theories, while the early time complexity growth distinguishes different degrees of non-locality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14007v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the hydrodynamics of integrable models, diffusion is a subleading correction to ballistic propagation. Here we quantify the diffusive contribution for one-dimensional Bose gases and find it most influential in the crossover between the main thermodynamic regimes of the gas. Analysing the experimentally measured dynamics of a single density mode, we find diffusion to be relevant only for high wavelength excitations. Instead, the observed relaxation is solely caused by a ballistically driven dephasing process, whose time scale is related to the phonon lifetime of the system and is thus useful to evaluate the applicability of the phonon bases typically used in quantum field simulators.</description>
