      <title>Warping labeling for twisted knots and twisted virtual braids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of the warping degree for twisted knots, construct an invariant for them, and utilize it to establish a labeling scheme for these knots, known as ``warping labeling". We have identified that a warping labeling can be extended to twisted virtual braids, enabling the creation of a function that remains invariant under all R-moves except the R2 move. By limiting the labeling set to $\mathbb{Z}_2$, we can develop invariants for twisted virtual braids.</description>

      <title>On Fox's trapezoidal conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Fox's trapezoidal conjecture for alternating links. We show that it holds for diagrammatic Murasugi sums of special alternating links, where all sums involved have length less than three (which includes diagrammatic plumbing). It also holds for links containing a large twist region, which we call twist-concentrated. Furthermore, we show some weaker inequalities between consecutive coefficients of the Alexander polynomial of an alternating 3-braid closure, and extend this to arbitrary alternating links. We then study an extension of the trapezoidal conjecture due to Hirasawa and Murasugi, which states that the stable length of the Alexander polynomial of an alternating link can be bounded from above using the signature. We estabilish this and determine when equality holds for diagrammatic Murasugi sums of special alternating knots where each sum has length less than three, and also for twist-concentrated 3-braids. Finally, we study the behavior of the Hirasawa-Murasugi inequality under concordance.</description>

      <title>On a generalization of Cannon's conjecture for cubulated hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that cubulated hyperbolic groups with spherical boundary of dimension 3 or at least 5 are virtually fundamental groups of closed, orientable, aspherical manifolds, provided that there are sufficiently many quasi-convex, codimension-1 subgroups whose limit sets are locally flat subspheres. The proof is based on ideas used by Markovic in his work on Cannon's conjecture for cubulated hyperbolic groups with 2-sphere boundary.</description>

      <title>Smooth structures on four-manifolds with finite cyclic fundamental groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each nonnegative integer m we show that any closed, oriented topological four-manifold with fundamental group Z_{4m+2} and odd intersection form, with possibly seven exceptions, either admits no smooth structure or admits infinitely many distinct smooth structures up to diffeomorphism. Moreover, we construct infinite families of non-complex irreducible fake projective planes with diverse fundamental groups.</description>

      <title>The Brownian loop measure on Riemann surfaces and applications to length spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a simple identity relating the length spectrum of a Riemann surface to that of the same surface with an arbitrary number of additional cusps. Our proof uses the Brownian loop measure introduced by Lawler and Werner. In particular, we express the total mass of Brownian loops in a fixed free homotopy class on any Riemann surface in terms of the length of the geodesic representative for the complete constant curvature metric. This expression also allows us to write the electrical thickness of a compact set in $\mathbb C$ separating $0$ and $\infty$, or the Velling--Kirillov K\"ahler potential, in terms of the Brownian loop measure and the zeta-regularized determinant of Laplacian as a renormalization of the Brownian loop measure with respect to the length spectrum.</description>

      <title>Topological isotopy and finite type invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1974, D. Rolfsen asked: If two PL links in $S^3$ are isotopic (=homotopic through embeddings), then are they PL isotopic? We prove that they are PL isotopic to another pair of links which are indistinguishable from each other by finite type invariants. Thus if finite type invariants separate PL links in $S^3$, then Rolfsen's problem has an affirmative solution. In fact, we show that finite type invariants separate PL links in $S^3$ if and only if certain 6 rather diverse conjectures hold simultaneously.
  We also show that if $v$ is a finite type invariant (or more generally a colored finite type invariant) of PL links, and $v$ is invariant under PL isotopy, then $v$ assumes the same value on all sufficiently close $C^0$-approximations of any given topological link; moreover, the extension of $v$ by continuity to topological links is an invariant of isotopy. Some specific invariants of this kind are discussed.</description>

      <title>Is every knot isotopic to the unknot?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1974, D. Rolfsen asked: Is every knot in $S^3$ isotopic (=homotopic through embeddings) to a PL knot or, equivalently, to the unknot? In particular, is the Bing sling isotopic to a PL knot? We show that the Bing sling is not isotopic to any PL knot: (1) by an isotopy which extends to an isotopy of $2$-component links with $lk=1$; (2) through knots that are intersections of nested sequences of solid tori.
  There are also stronger versions of these results. In (1), the additional component may be allowed to self-intersect, and even to get replaced by a new one as long as it represents the same conjugacy class in $G/[G',G'']$, where $G$ is the fundamental group of the complement to the original component. In (2), the "solid tori" can be replaced by "boundary-link-like handlebodies", where a handlebody $V\subset S^3$ of genus $g$ is called boundary-link-like if $\pi_1(\overline{S^3-V})$ admits a homomorphism to the free group $F_g$ such that the composition $\pi_1(\partial V)\to\pi_1(\overline{S^3-V})\to F_g$ is surjective.</description>

      <title>Finite subgroups of the profinite completion of good groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a residually finite, good group of finite virtual cohomological dimension. We prove that the natural monomorphism $G\hookrightarrow\hat{G}$ induces a bijective correspondence between conjugacy classes of finite $p$-subgroups of $G$ and those of its profinite completion $\hat{G}$. Moreover, we prove that the centralizers and normalizers in $\hat{G}$ of finite $p$-subgroups of $G$ are the closures of the respective centralizers and normalizers in $G$. With somewhat more restrictive hypotheses, we prove the same results for finite solvable subgroups of $G$. In the last section, we give a few applications of this theorem to hyperelliptic mapping class groups and virtually compact special toral relatively hyperbolic groups (these include fundamental groups of $3$-orbifolds and of uniform standard arithmetic hyperbolic orbifolds).</description>

      <title>Skein Categories in Non-semisimple Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a version of skein categories which depends on a tensor ideal in a ribbon category, thereby extending the existing theory to the setting of non-semisimple TQFTs. We obtain modified notions of skein algebras of surfaces and skein modules of 3-cobordisms for non-semisimple ribbon categories. We prove that these skein categories built from ideals coincide with factorization homology, shedding new light on the similarities and differences between the semisimple and non-semisimple settings. As a consequence, we get a skein-theoretic description of factorization homology for a large class of balanced braided categories in Pr, precisely all those which are expected to induce an oriented categorified 3-TQFT.</description>

      <title>Surgery and Excision for Furuta-Ohta invariants on Homology $S^1 \times S^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.04197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a surgery formula and an excision formula for the Furuta-Ohta invariant $\lambda_{FO}$ defined on homology $S^1 \times S^3$, which provides more evidence on its equivalence with the Casson-Seiberg-Witten invariant $\lambda_{SW}$. These formulae are applied to compute $\lambda_{FO}$ of certain families of manifolds obtained as mapping tori under diffeomorphisms of $3$-manifolds. In the course of the proof, we give a complete description of the degree-zero moduli space of ASD instantons on $4$-manifolds of homology $H_*(D^2 \times T^2; \mathbb{Z})$ with a cylindrical end modeled on $[0, \infty) \times T^3$.</description>

      <title>Connecting 3-manifold triangulations with monotonic sequences of elementary moves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.02398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key result in computational 3-manifold topology is that any two triangulations of the same 3-manifold are connected by a finite sequence of bistellar flips, also known as Pachner moves. One limitation of this result is that little is known about the structure of this sequence; knowing more about the structure could help both proofs and algorithms. Motivated by this, we consider sequences of moves that are "monotonic" in the sense that they break up into two parts: first, a sequence that monotonically increases the size of the triangulation; and second, a sequence that monotonically decreases the size. We prove that any two one-vertex triangulations of the same 3-manifold, each with at least two tetrahedra, are connected by a monotonic sequence of 2-3 and 2-0 moves. We also study the practical utility of monotonic sequences; specifically, we implement an algorithm to find such sequences, and use this algorithm to perform some detailed computational experiments.</description>

      <title>Extending free actions of finite groups on unoriented surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the unoriented version of the Schur and Bogomolov multiplier associated with a finite group $G$. We show that the unoriented Schur multiplier is isomorphic to the second cohomology group $H^2(G;\mathbb{F}_2)$. We define the unoriented Bogomolov multiplier as the quotient of the unoriented Schur multiplier by the subgroup generated by classes over the disjoint union of tori, Klein bottles, and projective spaces. Disregarding the subgroup generated by the trivial $G$-bundle over the projective space, we show that the unoriented Bogomolov multiplier is a complete obstruction. This means that a free surface action over an unoriented surface equivariantly bounds if and only if the class in the unoriented Bogomolov multiplier is trivial. We show that the unoriented Bogomolov multiplier is trivial for abelian, dihedral, and symmetric groups. Because the group cohomology $H^2(G;\mathbb{F}_2)$ is trivial for a group of odd order, there are plenty of examples where the usual Bogomolov multiplier is not trivial while the unoriented Bogomolov multiplier is trivial. However, we show that there is a group of order $64$ where the unoriented Bogomolov multiplier is non-trivial.</description>

      <title>Two-variable Conway polynomial and Cochran's derived invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0312007</link>
      <description>arXiv:math/0312007v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We note that the Conway potential function $\Omega_L$ of an $m$-component link $L$, $m&gt;1$, can be expressed as $\Omega_L(x_1,\dots,x_m)=\Theta_L(\nabla_L(x_1-x_1^{-1},\dots,x_m-x_m^{-1}))$ for a unique $\nabla_L\in\mathbb Z[z_1,\dots,z_m]$, where $\Theta_L$ is a certain endomorphism of the additive group of $\mathbb Z[x_1^{\pm1},\dots,x_m^{\pm1}]$ which depends only on the pairwise linking numbers of the components of $L$. Motivated by applications to topological isotopy, we study the formal power series $\bar\nabla_L$, obtained by dividing $\nabla_L$ by the Conway polynomials of the components of $L$.
  For a $2$-component link with $lk(L)=0$, the coefficient $\alpha_{1,2k-1}$ of $\bar\nabla_L(u,v)$ at $uv^{2k-1}$ equals Cochran's derived invariant $(-1)^{k+1}\beta^k(L)$. While this can be deduced from a result of G.-T. Jin, which he proved using the surgical view of the Alexander polynomial, we provide an alternative proof, using Seifert matrices. Our main result is a formula for the same coefficient $\alpha_{1,2k-1}$ in the geometrically subtler case $lk(L)=1$. Namely we express it in terms of generalized Cochran invariants $\beta_F^{ij}(P,Q)$, which were studied by Gilmer--Livingston (when $P=Q$) and by Tsukamoto--Yasuhara (when $j=0$) and are closely related to the Cochran pairing in the infinite cyclic covering of a knot.</description>
