      <title>Lattice study of correlators for quarkonium decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While there has been a lot of progress in developing a
  formalism for the study of quarkonia in QGP, a nonperturbative
  study is still difficult. For bottomonia, where the system size
  is much less than the inverse temperature, the interaction of the
  system with the medium can be approximated by a dipole interaction with
  the color electric field. The decay of the quarkonia can be connected to
  a correlation function of the color electric field.
  We present preliminary results from a lattice study of the relevant color
  electric field correlator. The structure of the correlator, and its
  difference from the corresponding correlator studied for heavy quark
  diffusion, is discussed.</description>

      <title>A generalized definition of the isothermal compressibility in (2+1)-flavor QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a generalized definition of the isothermal compressibility ($\kappa_{T,\sigma_Q^2}$) calculable by keeping net conserved charge fluctuations rather than total number densities constant. We present lattice QCD results for this isothermal compressibility, expressed in terms of fluctuations of conserved charges that are related to baryon ($B$), electric charge ($Q$) and strangeness ($S$) quantum numbers. This generalized isothermal compressibility is compared with hadron resonance gas model calculations as well as with heavy-ion collision data obtained at RHIC and the LHC. We find $\kappa_{T,\sigma_Q^2}=13.8(1.3)$~fm$^3$/GeV at $T_{pc,0}=156.5(1.5)$~MeV and $\hat{\mu}_B=0$. This finding is consistent with the rescaled result of the ALICE Collaboration, where we replaced the number of charged hadrons ($N_{\rm ch}$) by the total number of hadrons ($N_{\rm tot}$) at freeze-out. Normalizing this result with the QCD pressure ($P$) we find that the isothermal compressibility on the pseudo-critical line stays close to that of an {\it ideal gas}, {\it i.e.} $P \kappa_{T,\sigma_Q^2}\simeq 1$.</description>

      <title>Implications of Yukawa interactions in scalar sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a field theory model containing a real scalar singlet and an SU(2) symmetry preserving complex doublet is studied using the method of lattice simulations. The model considers all quartic vertices along with the Yukawa vertex between a real scalar singlet and an SU(2) symmetry preserving complex doublet field. Machine learning is used to extract representative functions of the field propagators, lattice regulator, and the Yukawa vertex. In the considered renormalization scheme the field propagators are found enhanced compared to their respective tree level structure. It is found that mixing of operators containing scalar singlet with SU(2) invariant field operators results in $0^{+}$ states with a peculiar scarcity in hundreds of $GeV$s. The Yukawa vertex shows weak dependence on the field momenta while the theory remain interactive as found by the renormalized field propagators. The impact of the real scalar quartic self interaction is found mitigated due to other interaction vertices. The field expectation values exhibit a certain classification despite no conclusive signal of phase transition.</description>

      <title>Comment on "LaMET's Asymptotic Extrapolation vs. Inverse Problem"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In arXiv:2504.17706 {Dutrieux:2025jed} we criticized the excessive model-dependence introduced by rigid few-parameter fits to extrapolate lattice data in the large momentum effective theory (LaMET) when the data are noisy and lose signal before an exponential asymptotic behavior of the space-like correlators is established. In reaction, arXiv:2505.14619 {Chen:2025cxr} claims that even when the data is of poor quality, rigid parametrizations are better than attempts at representing the uncertainty using what they call "inverse problem methods". We clarify the fundamental differences in our perspectives regarding how to meaningfully handle noisy lattice matrix elements, especially when they exhibit a strong sensitivity to the choice of regularization in the inverse problem. We additionally correct misunderstandings of {Chen:2025cxr} on our message and methods.</description>

      <title>A strange contribution to the neutron EDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the contribution of hypothetical quark electric dipoles to the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the neutron. Particular emphasis is devoted to the strange quark contribution. Considerations based on perturbative QCD, the large N expansion, a critic reassessment of the non-relativistic quark model as well as a next to leading order calculation in heavy baryon effective field theory, all consistently indicate that, barring accidental cancellations, the matrix element of the strange quark dipole should be of order a tenth of those of the valence quarks. This implies that the strange EDM provides the dominant contribution to the neutron EDM in many scenarios beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Relational entanglement entropies and quantum reference frames in gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been shown that defining gravitational entanglement entropies relative to quantum reference frames (QRFs) intrinsically regularizes them. Here, we demonstrate that such relational definitions also have an advantage in lattice gauge theories, where no ultraviolet divergences occur. To this end, we introduce QRFs for the gauge group via Wilson lines on a lattice with global boundary, realizing edge modes on the bulk entangling surface. Overcoming challenges of previous nonrelational approaches, we show that defining gauge-invariant subsystems associated with subregions relative to such QRFs naturally leads to a factorization across the surface, yielding distillable relational entanglement entropies. Distinguishing between extrinsic and intrinsic QRFs, according to whether they are built from the region or its complement, leads to extrinsic and intrinsic relational algebras ascribed to the region. The "electric center algebra" of previous approaches is recovered as the algebra that all extrinsic QRFs agree on, or by incoherently twirling any extrinsic algebra over the electric corner symmetry group. Similarly, a generalization of previous proposals for a "magnetic center algebra" is obtained as the algebra that all intrinsic QRFs agree on, or, in the Abelian case, by incoherently twirling any intrinsic algebra over a dual magnetic corner group. Altogether, this leads to a compelling regional algebra and relative entropy hierarchy. Invoking the corner twirls, we also find that the extrinsic/intrinsic relational entanglement entropies are upper bounded by the non-distillable electric/magnetic center entropies. Finally, using extrinsic QRFs, we discuss the influence of "asymptotic" symmetries on regional entropies. Our work thus unifies and extends previous approaches and reveals the interplay between entropies and regional symmetry structures.</description>

      <title>A basis of the gradient flow exact renormalization group for gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gradient flow exact renormalization group (GFERG) is a variant of the exact renormalization group (ERG) for gauge theory that is aimed to preserve gauge invariance as manifestly as possible. It achieves this goal by utilizing the Yang--Mills gradient flow or diffusion for the block-spin process. In this paper, we formulate GFERG by the Reuter equation in which the block spinning is done by Gaussian integration. This formulation provides a simple understanding of various points of GFERG, unresolved thus far. First, there exists a unique ordering of functional derivatives in the GFERG equation that remove ambiguity of contact terms. Second, perturbation theory of GFERG suffers from unconventional ultraviolet (UV) divergences if no gauge fixing is introduced. This explains the origin of some UV divergences we have encountered in perturbative solutions to GFERG. Third, the modified correlation functions calculated with the Wilson action in GFERG coincide with the correlation functions of diffused or flowed fields calculated with the bare action. This shows the existence of a Wilson action that reproduces precisely the physical quantities computed by the gradient flow formalism (up to contact terms). We obtain a definite ERG interpretation of the gradient flow. The formulation given in this paper provides a basis for further perturbative/non-perturbative computations in GFERG, preserving gauge invariance maximally.</description>

      <title>Nucleon mass: trace anomaly and $\sigma$-terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a pedagogical introduction to the origin of the mass of the nucleon. We first review the trace anomaly of the energy-momentum tensor, which generates most of the nucleon mass via the gluon fields and thus contributes even in the case of vanishing quark masses. We then discuss the contributions to the nucleon mass that do originate from the Higgs mechanism via the quark masses, reviewing the current status of nucleon $\sigma$-terms that encode the corresponding matrix elements.</description>

      <title>Finite Gaussian assistance protocols and a conic metric for extremizing spacelike vacuum entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a pure Gaussian tripartition, a range of entanglement between two parties ($AB$) can be purified through classical communication of Gaussian measurements performed within the third ($C$). To begin, this work introduces a direct method to calculate a hierarchic series of projective $C$ measurements for the removal of any $AB$ Gaussian noise, circumventing divergences in prior protocols. Next, a multimode conic framework is developed for pursuing the maximum (Gaussian entanglement of assistance, GEOA) or minimum (Gaussian entanglement of formation, GEOF) pure entanglement that may be revealed or required between $AB$. Within this framework, a geometric necessary and sufficient entanglement condition emerges as a doubly-enclosed conic volume, defining a novel distance metric for conic optimization. Extremizing this distance for spacelike vacuum entanglement in the massless and massive free scalar fields yields (1) the highest known lower bound to GEOA, the first that remains asymptotically constant with increasing vacuum separation and (2) the lowest known upper bound to GEOF, the first that decays exponentially mirroring the mixed $AB$ negativity. Furthermore, combination of the above with a generalization of previous partially-transposed noise filtering techniques allows calculation of a single $C$ measurement that maximizes the purified $AB$ entanglement. Beyond expectation that these behaviors of spacelike GEOA and GEOF persist in interacting theories, the present measurement and optimization techniques are applicable to physical many-body Gaussian states beyond quantum fields.</description>

      <title>Scaling behaviors at quantum and classical first-order transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08238v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum and classical first-order transitions, at equilibrium and under out-of-equilibrium conditions, mainly focusing on quench and slow quasi-adiabatic protocols. For these phenomena, we review the finite-size scaling theory appropriate to describe the general features of the large-scale, and long-time for dynamic phenomena, behavior of finite-size systems.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Corrections to Quark TMDPDFs in the Background-Field Method: Gauge Invariance, Equations of Motion, and Multiple Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the perturbative corrections in the strong coupling to the unpolarized quark transverse-momentum dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF) operator within a background-field framework, extending the approach of Ref. [1]. We focus on ensuring gauge invariance, identifying two key components needed: a gauge-invariant TMDPDF operator with a transverse gauge link at spatial infinity, and accounting of the equations of motion (EoM) of the background fields. We go beyond next-to-leading order in strong coupling expansion, considering multiple interactions with the background field at all orders of strong coupling. By examining the interplay between quark and gluon contributions, we show that spurious singularities, proportional to EoM, can be misinterpreted as genuine divergences in QCD factorization unless properly identified and removed.</description>
