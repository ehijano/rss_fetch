      <title>Scalable Similarity Search over Large Attributed Bipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bipartite graphs are widely used to model relationships between entities of different types, where nodes are divided into two disjoint sets. Similarity search, a fundamental operation that retrieves nodes similar to a given query node, plays a crucial role in various real-world applications, including machine learning and graph clustering. However, existing state-of-the-art methods often struggle to accurately capture the unique structural properties of bipartite graphs or fail to incorporate the informative node attributes, leading to suboptimal performance. Besides, their high computational complexity limits scalability, making them impractical for large graphs with millions of nodes and tens of thousands of attributes. To overcome these challenges, we first introduce Attribute-augmented Hidden Personalized PageRank (AHPP), a novel random walk model designed to blend seamlessly both the higher-order bipartite structure proximity and attribute similarity. We then formulate the similarity search over attributed bipartite graphs as an approximate AHPP problem and propose two efficient push-style local algorithms with provable approximation guarantees. Finally, extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of AHPP and the efficiency of our proposed algorithms when compared with fifteen competitors.</description>

      <title>New Entropy Measures for Tries with Applications to the XBWT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropy quantifies the number of bits required to store objects under certain given assumptions. While this is a well established concept for strings, in the context of tries the state-of-the-art regarding entropies is less developed. The standard trie worst-case entropy considers the set of tries with a fixed number of nodes and alphabet size. However, this approach does not consider the frequencies of the symbols in the trie, thus failing to capture the compressibility of tries with skewed character distributions. On the other hand, the label entropy [FOCS '05], proposed for node-labeled trees, does not take into account the tree topology, which has to be stored separately. In this paper, we introduce two new entropy measures for tries - worst-case and empirical - which overcome the two aforementioned limitations. Notably, our entropies satisfy similar properties of their string counterparts, thereby becoming very natural generalizations of the (simpler) string case. Indeed, our empirical entropy is closely related to the worst-case entropy and is reachable through a natural extension of arithmetic coding from strings to tries. Moreover we show that, similarly to the FM-index for strings [JACM '05], the XBWT of a trie can be compressed and efficiently indexed within our k-th order empirical entropy plus o(n) bits, with n being the number of nodes. Interestingly, the space usage of this encoding includes the trie topology and the upper-bound holds for every k sufficiently small, simultaneously. This XBWT encoding is always strictly smaller than the original one [JACM '09] and we show that in certain cases it is asymptotically smaller.</description>

      <title>The parameterized complexity of Strong Conflict-Free Vertex-Connection Colorability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper continues the study of a new variant of graph coloring with a connectivity constraint recently introduced by Hsieh et al. [COCOON 2024]. A path in a vertex-colored graph is called conflict-free if there is a color that appears exactly once on its vertices. A connected graph is said to be strongly conflict-free vertex-connection $k$-colorable if it admits a (proper) vertex $k$-coloring such that any two distinct vertices are connected by a conflict-free shortest path. Among others, we show that deciding, for a given graph $G$ and an integer $k$, whether $G$ is strongly conflict-free $k$-colorable is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the vertex cover number. But under the standard complexity-theoretic assumption NP $\not\subseteq$ coNP/poly, deciding, for a given graph $G$, whether $G$ is strongly conflict-free $3$-colorable does not admit a polynomial kernel, even for bipartite graphs. This kernel lower bound is in stark contrast to the ordinal $k$-Coloring problem which is known to admit a polynomial kernel when parameterized by the vertex cover number.</description>

      <title>Shortest Paths on Convex Polyhedral Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the surface of a convex polyhedron with $n$ vertices. We consider the two-point shortest path query problem for $\mathcal{P}$: Constructing a data structure so that given any two query points $s$ and $t$ on $\mathcal{P}$, a shortest path from $s$ to $t$ on $\mathcal{P}$ can be computed efficiently. To achieve $O(\log n)$ query time (for computing the shortest path length), the previously best result uses $O(n^{8+\epsilon})$ preprocessing time and space [Aggarwal, Aronov, O'Rourke, and Schevon, SICOMP 1997], where $\epsilon$ is an arbitrarily small positive constant. In this paper, we present a new data structure of $O(n^{6+\epsilon})$ preprocessing time and space, with $O(\log n)$ query time. For a special case where one query point is required to lie on one of the edges of $\mathcal{P}$, the previously best work uses $O(n^{6+\epsilon})$ preprocessing time and space to achieve $O(\log n)$ query time. We improve the preprocessing time and space to $O(n^{5+\epsilon})$, with $O(\log n)$ query time. Furthermore, we present a new algorithm to compute the exact set of shortest path edge sequences of $\mathcal{P}$, which are known to be $\Theta(n^4)$ in number and have a total complexity of $\Theta(n^5)$ in the worst case. The previously best algorithm for the problem takes roughly $O(n^6\log n\log^*n)$ time, while our new algorithm runs in $O(n^{5+\epsilon})$ time.</description>

      <title>Universal entrywise eigenvector fluctuations in delocalized spiked matrix models and asymptotics of rounded spectral algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the distribution of the top eigenvector $\widehat{v}$ of a spiked matrix model of the form $H = \theta vv^* + W$, in the supercritical regime where $H$ has an outlier eigenvalue of comparable magnitude to $\|W\|$. We show that, if $v$ is sufficiently delocalized, then the distribution of the individual entries of $\widehat{v}$ (not, we emphasize, merely the inner product $\langle \widehat{v}, v\rangle$) is universal over a large class of generalized Wigner matrices $W$ having independent entries, depending only on the first two moments of the distributions of the entries of $W$. This complements the observation of Capitaine and Donati-Martin (2018) that these distributions are not universal when $v$ is instead sufficiently localized. Further, for $W$ having entrywise variances close to constant and thus resembling a Wigner matrix, we show by comparing to the case of $W$ drawn from the Gaussian orthogonal or unitary ensembles that averages of entrywise functions of $\widehat{v}$ behave as they would if $\widehat{v}$ had Gaussian fluctuations around a suitable multiple of $v$. We apply these results to study spectral algorithms followed by rounding procedures in dense stochastic block models and synchronization problems over the cyclic and circle groups, obtaining the first precise asymptotic characterizations of the error rates of such algorithms.</description>

      <title>The Query Complexity of Local Search and Brouwer in Rounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.00061v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the query complexity of finding a local minimum of a function defined on a graph. This abstract problem is fundamental to many optimization tasks, such as finding a local minimum of the loss function when training deep neural networks. In such applications, each query is an expensive loss evaluation, making it crucial to parallelize computations. This motivates our study of local search where at most $k$ rounds of interaction (aka adaptivity) with the oracle are allowed.
  We focus on the $d$-dimensional grid $\{1, 2, \ldots, n \}^d$, where the dimension $d \geq 2$ is a constant. Our main contribution is to give algorithms and lower bounds that characterize the query complexity of finding a local minimum in $k$ rounds, when $k$ is constant and polynomial in $n$, respectively.
  Our proof technique for lower bounding the query complexity in rounds may be of independent interest as an alternative to the classical relational adversary method of Aaronson from the fully adaptive setting. The local search analysis also enables us to characterize the query complexity of computing a Brouwer fixed point in rounds.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Quantiles with Smaller Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the approximate quantiles problem, the goal is to output $m$ quantile estimates, the ranks of which are as close as possible to $m$ given quantiles $0 \leq q_1 \leq\dots \leq q_m \leq 1$. We present a mechanism for approximate quantiles that satisfies $\varepsilon$-differential privacy for a dataset of $n$ real numbers where the ratio between the distance between the closest pair of points and the size of the domain is bounded by $\psi$. As long as the minimum gap between quantiles is sufficiently large, $|q_i-q_{i-1}|\geq \Omega\left(\frac{m\log(m)\log(\psi)}{n\varepsilon}\right)$ for all $i$, the maximum rank error of our mechanism is $O\left(\frac{\log(\psi) + \log^2(m)}{\varepsilon}\right)$ with high probability. Previously, the best known algorithm under pure DP was due to Kaplan, Schnapp, and Stemmer~(ICML '22), who achieved a bound of $O\left(\frac{\log(\psi)\log^2(m) + \log^3(m)}{\varepsilon}\right)$. Our improvement stems from the use of continual counting techniques which allows the quantiles to be randomized in a correlated manner. We also present an $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differentially private mechanism that relaxes the gap assumption without affecting the error bound, improving on existing methods when $\delta$ is sufficiently close to zero. We provide experimental evaluation which confirms that our mechanism performs favorably compared to prior work in practice, in particular when the number of quantiles $m$ is large.</description>

      <title>Improved quantum algorithms for linear and nonlinear differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.01054v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present substantially generalized and improved quantum algorithms over prior work for inhomogeneous linear and nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODE). Specifically, we show how the norm of the matrix exponential characterizes the run time of quantum algorithms for linear ODEs opening the door to an application to a wider class of linear and nonlinear ODEs. In Berry et al., (2017), a quantum algorithm for a certain class of linear ODEs is given, where the matrix involved needs to be diagonalizable. The quantum algorithm for linear ODEs presented here extends to many classes of non-diagonalizable matrices. The algorithm here is also exponentially faster than the bounds derived in Berry et al., (2017) for certain classes of diagonalizable matrices. Our linear ODE algorithm is then applied to nonlinear differential equations using Carleman linearization (an approach taken recently by us in Liu et al., (2021)). The improvement over that result is two-fold. First, we obtain an exponentially better dependence on error. This kind of logarithmic dependence on error has also been achieved by Xue et al., (2021), but only for homogeneous nonlinear equations. Second, the present algorithm can handle any sparse, invertible matrix (that models dissipation) if it has a negative log-norm (including non-diagonalizable matrices), whereas Liu et al., (2021) and Xue et al., (2021) additionally require normality.</description>
