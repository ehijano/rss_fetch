      <title>Gaussian process surrogate models for the properties of micro-tearing modes in spherical tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spherical tokamaks (STs) have many desirable features that make them a suitable choice for fusion power plants. To understand their confinement properties, accurate calculation of turbulent micro-instabilities is necessary for tokamak design. Presented is a novel surrogate model for Micro-tearing modes (MTMs), the micro-instability thought to be dominant in high beta STs. Direct numerical calculation of micro-instabilities is computationally expensive and is a significant bottleneck in integrated plasma modelling. The considerable number of geometric and thermodynamic parameters, the interactions that influence these coefficients and the resolutions needed to accurately resolve these modes, makes direct numerical simulation for parameter space exploration computationally extremely challenging. However, this and the dearth of accurate reduced physics models for MTMs makes it suitable for surrogate modelling using Gaussian Process Regression, a modern machine learning technique. This paper outlines the further development of a data-driven reduced-order model across a spherical tokamak reactor-relevant parameter space utilising Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and classification; techniques from machine learning. To build the original simple GP model these two components were used in an active learning loop to maximise the efficiency of data acquisition thus minimising computational cost. The `simple' GP was seen to show a plateau of fidelity with more data and to be under-confident, particular in areas of parameter space close to marginal stability. It is postulated that the presence of multiple sub-types of MTM could be the root cause, with the underlying function being less smooth than expected. An expansion of the model using clustering algorithms to find optimal sub models using a mixture of experts approach is shown to greatly improve the variances in the outputs of the GP model.</description>

      <title>Revisiting shear stress tensor evolution: Non-resistive magnetohydrodynamics with momentum-dependent relaxation time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to develop second-order relativistic viscous magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) derived from kinetic theory within an extended relaxation time approximation (momentum/energy dependent) for the collision kernel. The investigation involves a detailed examination of shear stress tensor evolution equations and associated transport coefficients. The Boltzmann equation is solved using a Chapman-Enskog-like gradient expansion for a charge-conserved conformal system, incorporating a momentum-dependent relaxation time. The derived relativistic non-resistive, viscous second-order MHD equations for the shear stress tensor reveal significant modifications in the coupling with dissipative charge current and magnetic field due to the momentum dependence of the relaxation time. By utilizing a power law parametrization to quantify the momentum dependence of the relaxation time, the anisotropic magnetic field-dependent shear coefficients in the Navier-Stokes limit have been investigated. The resulting viscous coefficients are seen to be sensitive to the momentum dependence of the relaxation time.</description>

      <title>Circularly-polarized nanoshot pairs from the Crab pulsar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discover that multiple nanoshot pairs separated uniformly by about 21{\mu}s exist in a giant radio pulse from the Crab pulsar. In a few of such pairs, two nanoshots are left-hand and righthand circularly polarized, respectively. This nanoshot pair with both signs of circular polarization is proposed to produce through splitting of a linearly-polarized nanoshot by the extreme Faraday effect, which relies on highly-asymmetrical pair plasma and intense fields of nanoshots. Asymmetrical pair plasmas should be related to discharge activities in the pulsar. Nanoshot fields are strong enough to induce cyclotron resonance in the magnetosphere, which significantly reduces the speed of right-circularly polarized mode. This work implies that nanoshots are generated in the inner magnetosphere, and can also explain the circular polarization and reversed Faraday rotation of fast ratio bursts from magnetars.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium and Self-Organization Evolution in Hot-Spot Ignition Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to disparate formation mechanisms, as for central hot-spot ignition and fast ignition, the initial temperatures of electron and ions usually differs from each other in the hot spot. Considering the percipient dependence of fusion cross-section and energy losses on temperature, this difference manifests the inadequacy of the equilibrium theoretical model in accurately depicting the ignition condition and evolution of the hot-spot. In this work, we studied a non-equilibrium model and extended this model to both isobaric and isochoric scenarios, characterized by varying hot-spot densities, temperatures and expansion velocities. In both cases, a spontaneous self-organization evolution was observed, manifesting as the bifurcation of ion and electron temperatures. Notably, the ion temperature is particularly prominent during the ignition process. This inevitability can be traced to the preponderant deposition rates of alpha-particles into D-T ions and the decreasing rate of energy exchange between electrons and D-T ions at elevated temperatures. The inherent structure, characterized by higher ion temperature and lower electron temperature during ignition, directly contributes to the augmentation of D-T reactions and mitigates energy losses through electron conduction and bremsstrahlung, thereby naturally facilitating nuclear fusions.</description>

      <title>Broadening of the Divertor Heat Flux Profile in High Confinement Tokamak Fusion Plasmas with Edge Pedestals Limited by Turbulence in DIII-D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-machine empirical scaling predicts an extremely narrow heat exhaust layer in future high magnetic field tokamaks, leading to disastrous damage. In the experiments presented, the width of this exhaust layer is nearly doubled by using actuators to increase turbulent transport in the plasma edge. This is achieved in low collisionality, high confinement edge pedestals with their gradients limited by turbulent transport instead of large-scale, coherent instabilities. The exhaust heat flux profile width and divertor leg diffusive spreading both double as a high frequency band of fluctuations propagating in the electron diamagnetic direction doubles in amplitude. The results are quantitatively reproduced in comprehensive electromagnetic XGC particle-in-cell simulations which show the heat flux carried by electrons emerges to broaden the heat flux profile.</description>
