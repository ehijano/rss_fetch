      <title>UNAGI: A Conceptual Electrodynamic Tethered Spacecraft Demonstration Mission for Propellantless Landing on Io</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents UNAGI, a novel spacecraft mission developed by Spartan Space Systems, a student engineering team at San Jose State University, aiming for the first controlled landing on Jupiter's volcanically active moon Io. Inspired by the Japanese freshwater eel's agility, UNAGI employs an electrodynamic tether system that interacts with Jupiter's magnetic field to generate Lorentz forces, enabling dynamic modulation of the spacecraft's velocity without the need for traditional propellant. This system allows the spacecraft to precisely match Io's orbital velocity, similar to a surfer riding a wave. By optimizing tether current and orientation, UNAGI transitions from an outer Jovian insertion orbit to an orbit around Io, achieving a controlled landing for on-surface science operations. The landing is strategically timed, leveraging the gravitational influence of Jupiter and its moons to decelerate descent and mitigate impact forces.
  UNAGI leverages technologies from missions like Juno, JUICE, and Europa Clipper to ensure reliable operation in the challenging Jovian environment. The mission follows a phased approach, including cruise, orbital insertion, tether deployment, Jovian orbital operations, and final descent, with extensive risk mitigation through simulations and experimental validation. The concept supports rideshare integration on future NASA or ESA missions or a dedicated launch, emphasizing cost effectiveness and adaptability. UNAGI carries a scientific payload including infrared spectrometers, magnetometers, seismometers, and chromatographs, designed to probe Io's interior dynamics, volcanic activity, tectonic deformation, and magnetospheric interactions. This mission aims to advance understanding of Io's geophysical processes and Jupiter system dynamics, setting a new standard for deep space exploration of extreme environments.</description>

      <title>Technical Memo: The impact of Nancy Grace Roman Telescope's default image processing on the detectability of moving Solar system objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nancy Grace Roman Telescope is scheduled to launch in 2026 to conduct a wide-field survey of the sky at near-infrared wavelengths. Although Roman is unable to track objects moving at non-sidereal rates, there is recent interest in the potential capability of the telescope to support planetary defense by tracking and characterizing asteroids and comets (Holler et al, 2025, arXiv:2508.14412). However, the standard pipeline image processing scheme that the mission is planning to implement for the majority of its survey data will preferentially reject flux from all moving objects during the process of cosmic ray rejection. Here we describe the impact of the default Wide Field Imager (WFI) processing on moving object detection, and possible mitigations that could be employed to recover moving object observations.</description>

      <title>The impact of the point spread function fitting radius on photometric uncertainty based on the Fisher information matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In point spread function (PSF) photometry, the selection of the fitting aperture radius plays a critical role in determining the precision of flux and background estimations. Traditional methods often rely on maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) as a criterion for aperture selection. However, S/N-based approaches do not necessarily provide the optimal precision for joint estimation problems as they do not account for the statistical limits imposed by the Fisher information in the context of the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB). This study aims to establish an alternative criterion for selecting the optimal fitting radius based on Fisher information rather than S/N. Fisher information serves as a fundamental measure of estimation precision, providing theoretical guarantees on the achievable accuracy for parameter estimation. By leveraging Fisher information, we seek to define an aperture selection strategy that minimizes the loss of precision. We conducted a series of numerical experiments that analyze the behavior of Fisher information and estimator performance as a function of the PSF aperture radius. Specifically, we revisited fundamental photometric models and explored the relationship between aperture size and information content. We compared the empirical variance of classical estimators, such as maximum likelihood and stochastic weighted least squares, against the theoretical CRLB derived from the Fisher information matrix. Our results indicate that aperture selection based on the Fisher information provides a more robust framework for achieving optimal estimation precision.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Strategy for Coordinated Interstellar Signaling: Linking the Galactic Center and Extragalactic Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) is largely limited by the vastness of the signaling parameter space. The concurrent signaling scheme offers a framework in which civilizations can coordinate their transmission and reception by referring to a common astrophysical event. Building on this idea, I propose a hybrid strategy that combines the Galactic Center as a spatial reference with an extragalactic burst as a temporal marker. If such a scheme is indeed employed, the sky area to be surveyed in SETI could be reduced by more than two orders of magnitude, based solely on existing astronomical data. I examine records of three types of extragalactic bursts (supernovae, neutron star mergers, and gamma-ray bursts [GRBs]) to identify suitable temporal markers. Among them, GRB 221009A is particularly notable due to its high fluence and favorable sky location.</description>

      <title>Techniques for Continuous Wave Identification and Filtering in the Askaryan Radio Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA), located near the South Pole, is among the first experiments there designed to detect ultra-high energy neutrinos through the Askaryan effect. When such neutrinos interact in dense media like ice, they initiate particle cascades that generate coherent radio pulses. Operating in the 150-850 MHz band, ARA is deployed 80-200 meters deep in Antarctic ice, where the radio background is exceptionally low. Despite this, experiments such as ARA must still account for continuous wave (CW) signals, which can originate from anthropogenic sources, instrumental noise, and other environmental factors. These CW signals can obscure faint neutrino-induced pulses, complicating data analysis and event identification. Over the years, ARA has developed and refined techniques for CW filtering and identification, including spectral analysis, notch filtering, and phase-variance methods. These approaches exploit CW characteristics such as their narrowband nature and persistence to separate contamination from genuine impulsive events. We review the main CW identification and filtering techniques developed within the ARA collaboration and present recent improvements in adaptive, multi-stage filtering pipelines. These advances have led to faster processing, simpler operation, and more accurate CW suppression, improving data analysis quality. Their efficacy is demonstrated across all ARA stations, underscoring their role in reducing event misclassification and enhancing performance. By refining these techniques, this work not only improves the sensitivity of ARA but also highlights the importance of robust CW filtering for current and future neutrino radio detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Towards the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND): the GRANDProto300 and GRAND@Auger prototypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is a proposed multi-messenger observatory of ultra-high-energy (UHE) particles of cosmic origin. Its main goal is to find the long-sought origin of UHE cosmic rays by detecting large numbers of them and the secondary particles created by their interaction -- gamma rays, and, especially, neutrinos. GRAND will do so using large arrays of radio antennas that look for the radio signals emitted by the air showers initiated by the interactions of the UHE particles in the atmosphere. Since 2023, three small-scale prototype GRAND arrays have been in operation: GRAND@Nan\c{c}ay in France, GRAND@Auger in Argentina, and GRANDProto300 in China. Together, their goal is to validate the detection principle of GRAND under prolonged field conditions, achieving efficient, autonomous radio-detection of air showers. We describe the hardware, software, layout, and operation of the GRAND prototypes and show the first radio spectra measured by them. Despite challenges, the successful operation of the prototypes confirms that the GRAND instrumentation is apt to address the goals of the experiment and lays the groundwork for its ensuing stages.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks as Surrogate Solvers for Time-Dependent Accretion Disk Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accretion disks are ubiquitous in astrophysics, appearing in diverse environments from planet-forming systems to X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei. Traditionally, modeling their dynamics requires computationally intensive (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations. Recently, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising alternative. This approach trains neural networks directly on physical laws without requiring data. We for the first time demonstrate PINNs for solving the two-dimensional, time-dependent hydrodynamics of non-self-gravitating accretion disks. Our models provide solutions at arbitrary times and locations within the training domain, and successfully reproduce key physical phenomena, including the excitation and propagation of spiral density waves and gap formation from disk-companion interactions. Notably, the boundary-free approach enabled by PINNs naturally eliminates the spurious wave reflections at disk edges, which are challenging to suppress in numerical simulations. These results highlight how advanced machine learning techniques can enable physics-driven, data-free modeling of complex astrophysical systems, potentially offering an alternative to traditional numerical simulations in the future.</description>

      <title>HWO Target Stars and Systems: A Prioritized Community List of Potential Stellar Targets for the Habitable Worlds Observatory's ExoEarth Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The HWO Target Stars and Systems 2025 (TSS25) list is a community-developed catalog of potential stellar targets for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) in its survey to directly image Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone. The TSS25 list categorizes potential HWO targets into priority tiers based on their likelihood to be surveyed and the necessity of obtaining observations of their stellar properties prior to the launch of the mission. This target list builds upon previous efforts to identify direct imaging targets and incorporates the results of multiple yield calculations assessing the science return of current design concepts for HWO. The TSS25 list identifies a sample of target stars that have a high probability to be observed by HWO (Tiers 1 and 2), independent of assumptions about the mission's final architecture. These stars should be the focus of community precursor science efforts in order to mitigate risks and maximize the science output of HWO. This target list is publicly available and is a living catalog that will be continually updated leading up to the mission.</description>

      <title>A Passive UV-Based System for Discharging the Test Masses of Ground Based Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a passive ultraviolet charge management system for the fused silica test masses in ground-based laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors. The system uses photoelectron emission from low work-function gold coatings illuminated by 275 to 285 nm UV light to neutralize unwanted electric charges on the electrically floating test masses, maintaining them at zero potential relative to surrounding components. Two implementation schemes are described: 1. distributed discharge tabs illuminated by UV LEDs mounted at the eight surrounding earthquake stops, and 2. a conductively linked tab design enabling a centralized discharge on the test mass barrel, with potential extension to annular coatings around the high-reflectivity and anti-reflective surfaces. Experimental results show photoelectric currents greater or equal to 10 pA for 1.0 mW of incident UV, enabling discharge rates greater than 10V/s for a 1 pF capacitance. With 0.2 mW UV power, charge neutralization to less or equal to 1 pC can be achieved in 5 to 75 minutes. This technique offers a vacuum-compatible alternative to ion sprayers, significantly reducing operational downtime. For the conductive-barrel configuration, we also propose a balanced electrostatic actuator using four parallel-plate capacitors for combined control of TM axial displacement, tilt, and azimuth, with reduced drive voltages.</description>

      <title>Regression of Suspension Violin Modes in KAGRA O3GK Data with Kalman Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suspension thermal modes in interferometric gravitational-wave detectors produce narrow, high-Q spectral lines that can contaminate gravitational searches and bias parameter estimation. In KAGRA, cryogenic mirrors are held by thick suspension fibers, designed to sustain such low-temperature environment, which may further affects inharmonicity modes, fiber dimensions, and mechanical behavior compared to typical interferometers. Remaining a prominent source of narrowband contamination, we implement a Kalman filter to model and track violin lines, building on the methodology introduced in [1], and apply subtraction to KAGRA O3GK data. Using gravitational-wave template injections, we validate that the subtraction preserves matched-filter SNR while effectively suppressing line power. Comparisons of power spectral densities and residual analyses confirm that the method removes deterministic line contributions without introducing waveform distortions. This approach provides a cleaner strain channel for searches and parameter estimation and will become increasingly important for future low-temperature detectors with higher-Q suspensions, such as the Einstein Telescope.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15-Year Data Set: Improved Timing Precision With VLBI Astrometric Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate pulsar astrometric estimates play an essential role in almost all high-precision pulsar timing experiments. Traditional pulsar timing techniques refine these estimates by including them as free parameters when fitting a model to observed pulse time-of-arrival measurements. However, reliable sub-milliarcsecond astrometric estimations require years of observations and, even then, power from red noise can be inadvertently absorbed into astrometric parameter fits, biasing the resulting estimations and reducing our sensitivity to red noise processes, including gravitational waves (GWs). In this work, we seek to mitigate these shortcomings by using pulsar astrometric estimates derived from Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) as priors for the timing fit. First, we calibrated a frame tie to account for the offsets between the reference frames used in VLBI and timing. Then, we used the VLBI-informed priors and timing-based likelihoods of several astrometric solutions consistent with both techniques to obtain a maximum-posterior astrometric solution. We found offsets between our results and the timing-based astrometric solutions, which, if real, would lead to absorption of spectral power at frequencies of interest for single-source GW searches. However, we do not find significant power absorption due to astrometric fitting at the low-frequency domain of the GW background.</description>

      <title>StrCGAN: A Generative Framework for Stellar Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce StrCGAN (Stellar Cyclic GAN), a generative model designed to enhance low-resolution astrophotography images. Our goal is to reconstruct high-fidelity ground truth-like representations of celestial objects, a task that is challenging due to the limited resolution and quality of small-telescope observations such as the MobilTelesco dataset. Traditional models such as CycleGAN provide a foundation for image-to-image translation but are restricted to 2D mappings and often distort the morphology of stars and galaxies. To overcome these limitations, we extend the CycleGAN framework with three key innovations: 3D convolutional layers to capture volumetric spatial correlations, multi-spectral fusion to align optical and near-infrared (NIR) domains, and astrophysical regularization modules to preserve stellar morphology. Ground-truth references from multi-mission all-sky surveys spanning optical to NIR guide the training process, ensuring that reconstructions remain consistent across spectral bands. Together, these components allow StrCGAN to generate reconstructions that are not only visually sharper but also physically consistent, outperforming standard GAN models in the task of astrophysical image enhancement.</description>
