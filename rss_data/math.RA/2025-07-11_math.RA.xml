      <title>Restricted graph Lie algebras in even characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate restricted Lie algebras arising as analogues of (twisted) right-angled Artin groups and right-angled Coxeter groups over fields of characteristic two. These algebras are defined via quadratic relations determined by decorated graphs. We compute their cohomology rings with trivial coefficients and uncover phenomena specific to characteristic two: unlike in zero/odd characteristics, where quadratically defined ordinary and restricted Lie algebras have equivalent cohomology theories, the characteristic two case exhibits dependence on the base field. In particular, we prove that the ground field being the prime field $\mathbb F_2$ characterizes when a Lie-theoretic analogue of the twisted Droms theorem holds. Generalizations of graph Lie algebras are also discussed.</description>

      <title>The integro-differential closure of a commutative differential ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An integro-differential ring is a differential ring that is closed under an integration operation satisfying the fundamental theorem of calculus. Via the Newton--Leibniz formula, a generalized evaluation is defined in terms of integration and differentiation. The induced evaluation is not necessarily multiplicative, which allows to model functions with singularities and leads to generalized shuffle relations. In general, not every element of a differential ring has an antiderivative in the same ring. Starting from a commutative differential ring and a direct decomposition into integrable and non-integrable elements, we construct the free integro-differential ring. This integro-differential closure contains all nested integrals over elements of the original differential ring. We exhibit the relations satisfied by generalized evaluations of products of nested integrals. Investigating these relations of constants, we characterize in terms of Lyndon words certain evaluations of products that determine all others. We also analyze the relation of the free integro-differential ring with the shuffle algebra. To preserve integrals in the original differential ring for computations in its integro-differential closure, we introduce the notion of quasi-integro-differential rings and give an adapted construction of the free integro-differential ring. Finally, in a given integro-differential ring, we consider the internal integro-differential closure of a differential subring and identify it as quotient of the free integro-differential ring by certain constants.</description>

      <title>Cohomology and Extensions of $C_p$-Green Functors of Lie Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of $C_p$-Green functors of Lie type, unifying the axiomatic framework of Green functors with the structure of Lie algebras under the action of a cyclic group $C_p$ of prime order. Extending classical notions from representation theory and topology, we define tensor and exterior products, introduce an equivariant Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology, and construct cup products that endow the cohomology with a graded Green functor of Lie type structure. A key result establishes a correspondence between equivalence classes of singular extensions and second cohomology groups, generalizing classical Lie algebra extension theory to the equivariant setting. This framework enriches the toolkit for studying equivariant algebraic structures and paves the way for further applications in deformation theory, homotopical algebra, and representation theory.</description>

      <title>New properties of weighted generalized core-EP inverse in Banach algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the generalized weighted core-EP inverse via the canonical decomposition, utilizing a weighted core-EP invertible element and a quasinilpotent. We then offer a polar-like characterization for the generalized weighted core-EP invertible element. The representations of the generalized weighted core-EP inverse by leveraging the weighted generalized Drazin inverse are thereby presented. These lead to new properties for the weighted core-EP inverse.</description>

      <title>Rank-stability of polynomial equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extending the thoroughly studied theory of group stability, we study Ulam stability type problems for associative and Lie algebras; namely, we investigate obstacles to rank-approximation of almost solutions by exact solutions for systems of polynomial equations. This leads to a rich theory of stable associative and Lie algebras, with connections to linear soficity, amenability, growth, and group stability. We develop rank-stability and instability tests, examine the effect of algebraic constructions on rank-stability, and prove that while finite-dimensional associative algebras are rank-stable, `most' finite-dimensional Lie algebras are not.</description>

      <title>On Isotropy Groups of Quantum Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the isotropy groups of derivations on the Quantum Plane $\Bbbk_q[x, y]$, defined by the relation $yx = qxy$, where $q \in \Bbbk^*$, with $q^2\neq 1$. The main goal is to determine the automorphisms of the Quantum Plane that commutes with a fixed derivation $\delta$. We describe conditions under which the isotropy group $\text{Aut}_\delta(A)$ is trivial, finite, or infinite, depending on the structure of $\delta$ and whether $q$ is a root of unity: additionally, we present the structure of the group in the finite case. A key tool is the analysis of polynomial equations of the form $\mu_1^a \mu_2^b = 1$, arising from monomials in the inner part of $\delta$. We also make explicit which finite subgroups of $Aut(\Bbbk_q[x, y])$ are isotropy groups of some derivation: either $q$ root of unity or not. Techniques from algebraic geometry, such as intersection multiplicity, are also employed in the classification of the finite case.</description>

      <title>Symmetry groups of origami structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Origami is the art of folding paper into various patterns without cutting or tearing the paper. By viewing the paper as the complex plane, we iteratively compute and record all intersection points to construct mathematical origami sets. Additionally, we include the various lines to create a repeating pattern that can be viewed as a wallpaper group if the angle set contains fewer than 3 angles. There are 17 wallpaper groups up to isomorphism, so we determine which such groups can be constructed in this way, depending on the rotational and reflectional symmetries present in the given pattern. If the angle set contains more than 4 angles, the resulting pattern will be dense and hence no longer a wallpaper group. In this case, the classification of the symmetry group is done algorithmically.</description>

      <title>Lifting of locally initial objects and universal (co)acting Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The universal (co)acting bi/Hopf algebras introduced by Yu. I. Manin, M. Sweedler and D. Tambara, the universal Hopf algebra of a given (co)module structure, as well as the universal group of a grading, introduced by J. Patera and H. Zassenhaus, find their applications in the classification of quantum symmetries. Typically, universal (co)acting objects are defined as initial or terminal in the corresponding categories and, as such, they do not always exist. In order to ensure their existence, we introduce the support of a given object, which generalizes the support of a grading and is used to restrict the class of objects under consideration. The existence problems for universal objects are formulated and studied in a purely categorical manner by seeing them as particular cases of the lifting problem for a locally initial object. We prove the existence of a lifting and, consequently, of the universal (co)acting objects under some assumptions on the base (braided or symmetric monoidal) category. In contrast to existing constructions, our approach is self-dual in the sense that we can use the same proof to obtain the existence of universal actions and coactions. In particular, when the base category is the category of vector spaces over a field, the category of sets or their duals, we recover known existence results for the aforementioned universal objects. The proposed approach allows us to apply our results not only to the classical categories of sets and vectors spaces and their duals but also to (co)modules over bi/Hopf algebras, differential graded vector spaces, $G$-sets and graded sets.</description>

      <title>Dualities for universal (co)acting Hopf monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In general, universal (co)measuring (co)monoids and universal (co)acting bi/Hopf monoids, which prove to be a useful tool in the classification of quantum symmetries, do not always exist. In order to ensure their existence, the support of a given object was recently introduced in \cite{AGV3} and used to restrict the class of objects considered when defining universal (co)acting objects. It is well-known that, in contrast with the universal coacting Hopf algebra, for actions on algebras over a field it is usually difficult to describe the universal acting Hopf algebra explicitly and this turns the duality theorem into an important investigation tool. In the present paper we establish duality results for universal (co)measuring (co)monoids and universal (co)acting bi/Hopf monoids in pre-rigid braided monoidal categories $\mathcal{C}$. In addition, when the base category $\mathcal{C}$ is closed monoidal, we provide a convenient uniform approach to the aforementioned universal objects in terms of the cosupports, which in this case become subobjects of internal hom-objects. In order to explain our constructions, we use the language of locally initial objects. Known results from the literature are recovered when the base category is the category of vector spaces over a field. New cases where our results can be applied are explored, including categories of (co)modules over (co)quasitriangular Hopf algebras, Yetter-Drinfeld modules and dg-vector spaces.</description>

      <title>Hochschild (Co)homology of D-modules on rigid analytic spaces II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth $p$-adic Stein space with free tangent sheaf. We use the notion of Hochschild cohomology for sheaves of Ind-Banach algebras developed in our previous work to study the Hochschild cohomology of the algebra of infinite order differential operators $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap. In particular, we show that the Hochschild cohomology complex of $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap is a strict complex of nuclear Fr\'echet spaces which is quasi-isomorphic to the de Rham complex of $X$. We then use this to compare the first Hochschild cohomology group of $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap with a wide array of Ext functors. Finally, we investigate the relation of the Hochschild cohomology of $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap with the deformation theory of $\mathcal{D}_X(X)$-cap. Assuming some finiteness conditions on the de Rham cohomology of $X$, we define explicit isomorphisms between the first Hochschild cohomology group of $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap and the space of bounded outer derivations of $\mathcal{D}_X(X)$-cap, and between the second Hochschild cohomology group of $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap and the space of infinitesimal deformations of $\mathcal{D}_X(X)$-cap.</description>
