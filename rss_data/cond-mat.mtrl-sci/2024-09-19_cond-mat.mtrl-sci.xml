      <title>Anomalous Hall effect from nonlinear magnetoelectric coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is a topology-related transport phenomenon being of potential interest in spintronics, because this effect enables the efficient probe of magnetic orders (i.e., data readout in memory devices). It is well known that AHE spontaneously occurs in ferromagnets or antiferromagnets with magnetization. While recent studies reveal electric-field induced AHE (via linear magnetoelectric coupling), an AHE originating from nonlinear magnetoelectric coupling remains largely unexplored. Here, by symmetry analysis, we establish the phenomenological theory regarding the spontaneous and electric-field driven AHE in magnets. We show that a large variety of magnetic point groups host an AHE that is driven by uni-axial, bi-axial, or tri-axial electric field and that comes from nonlinear magnetoelectric coupling. Such electric-field driven anomalous Hall conductivities are reversible by reversing the magnetic orders. Furthermore, our first-principles calculations suggest Cr2O3 and CoF2 as candidates hosting the aforementioned AHE. Our work emphasizes the important role of nonlinear magnetoelectric coupling in creating exotic transport phenomena, and offers alternative avenues for the probe of magnetic orders.</description>

      <title>Hybridization gap approaching the two-dimensional limit of topological insulator Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bismuth antimony alloys (Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$) provide a tuneable materials platform to study topological transport and spin-polarized surface states resulting from the nontrivial bulk electronic structure. In the two-dimensional limit, it is a suitable system to study the quantum spin Hall effect. In this work we grow epitaxial, single orientation thin films of Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$ on an InSb(111)B substrate down to two bilayers where hybridization effects should gap out the topological surface states. Supported by a tight-binding model, spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy data shows pockets at the Fermi level from the topological surface states disappear as the bulk gap increases from confinement. Evidence for a gap opening in the topological surface states is shown in the ultrathin limit. Finally, we observe spin-polarization approaching unity from the topological surface states in 10 bilayer films. The growth and characterization of ultrathin Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$ alloys suggest ultrathin films of this material system can be used to study two-dimensional topological physics as well as applications such as topological devices, low power electronics, and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Smart Data-Driven GRU Predictor for SnO$_2$ Thin films Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In material physics, characterization techniques are foremost crucial for obtaining the materials data regarding the physical properties as well as structural, electronics, magnetic, optic, dielectric, and spectroscopic characteristics. However, for many materials, ensuring availability and safe accessibility is not always easy and fully warranted. Moreover, the use of modeling and simulation techniques need a lot of theoretical knowledge, in addition of being associated to costly computation time and a great complexity deal. Thus, analyzing materials with different techniques for multiple samples simultaneously, still be very challenging for engineers and researchers. It is worth noting that although of being very risky, X-ray diffraction is the well known and widely used characterization technique which gathers data from structural properties of crystalline 1d, 2d or 3d materials. We propose in this paper, a Smart GRU for Gated Recurrent Unit model to forcast structural characteristics or properties of thin films of tin oxide SnO$_2$(110). Indeed, thin films samples are elaborated and managed experimentally and the collected data dictionary is then used to generate an AI -- Artificial Intelligence -- GRU model for the thin films of tin oxide SnO$_2$(110) structural property characterization.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the Training and Improving the Reliability of Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials for Strongly Anharmonic Materials through Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) employing machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) serve as an efficient, urgently needed complement to ab initio molecular dynamics (aiMD). By training these potentials on data generated from ab initio methods, their averaged predictions can exhibit comparable performance to ab initio methods at a fraction of the cost. However, insufficient training sets might lead to an improper description of the dynamics in strongly anharmonic materials, because critical effects might be overlooked in relevant cases, or only incorrectly captured, or hallucinated by the MLIP when they are not actually present. In this work, we show that an active learning scheme that combines MD with MLIPs (MLIP-MD) and uncertainty estimates can avoid such problematic predictions. In short, efficient MLIP-MD is used to explore configuration space quickly, whereby an acquisition function based on uncertainty estimates and on energetic viability is employed to maximize the value of the newly generated data and to focus on the most unfamiliar but reasonably accessible regions of phase space. To verify our methodology, we screen over 112 materials and identify 10 examples experiencing the aforementioned problems. Using CuI and AgGaSe$_2$ as archetypes for these problematic materials, we discuss the physical implications for strongly anharmonic effects and demonstrate how the developed active learning scheme can address these issues.</description>

      <title>Anionic disorder and its impact on the surface electronic structure of oxynitride photoactive semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conversion of solar energy into chemical energy, stored in the form of hydrogen, bears enormous potential as a sustainable fuel for powering emerging technologies. Photoactive oxynitrides are promising materials for splitting water into molecular oxygen and hydrogen. However, one of the issues limiting widespread commercial use of oxynitrides is the degradation during operation. While recent studies have shown the loss of nitrogen, its relation to the reduced efficiency has not been directly and systematically addressed with experiments. In this study, we demonstrate the impact of the anionic stoichiometry of BaTaO$_x$N$_y$ on its electronic structure and functional properties. Through experimental ion scattering, electron microscopy, and photoelectron spectroscopy investigations, we determine the anionic composition ranging from the bulk towards the surface of BaTaO$_x$N$_y$ thin films. This further serves as input for band structure computations modeling the substitutional disorder of the anion sites. Combining our experimental and computational approaches, we reveal the depth-dependent elemental composition of oxynitride films, resulting in downward band bending and the loss of semiconducting character towards the surface. Extending beyond idealized systems, we demonstrate the relation between the electronic properties of real oxynitride photoanodes and their performance, providing guidelines for engineering highly efficient photoelectrodes and photocatalysts for clean hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>Designing a minimal Landau theory to stabilize desired quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interparticle interactions with multiple length scales play a pivotal role in the formation and stability of quasicrystals. Choosing a minimal set of length scales to stabilize a given quasicrystal is a challenging problem. To address this challenge, we propose an intelligent screening method (ISM) to design a Landau theory with a minimal number of length scales -- referred to as the minimal Landau theory -- that includes only the essential length scales necessary to stabilize quasicrystals. Based on a generalized multiple-length-scale Landau theory, ISM first evaluates various spectral configurations of candidate structures under a hard constraint. It then identifies the configuration with the lowest free energy. Using this optimal configuration, ISM calculates phase diagrams to explore the thermodynamic stability of desired quasicrystals. ISM can design a minimal Landau theory capable of stabilizing the desired quasicrystals by incrementally increasing the number of length scales. Our application of ISM has not only confirmed known behaviors in 10- and 12-fold quasicrystals but also led to a significant prediction that quasicrystals with 8-, 14-, 16-, and 18-fold symmetry could be stable within three-length-scale Landau models.</description>

      <title>How does Goldene Stack?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent synthesis of Goldene, a 2D atomic monolayer of gold, has opened new avenues in exploring novel materials. However, the question of when multilayer Goldene transitions into bulk gold remains unresolved. This study used density functional theory calculations to address this fundamental question. Our findings reveal that multilayer Goldene retains an AA-like stacking configuration of up to six layers, with no observation of Bernal-like stacking as seen in graphene. Goldene spontaneously transitions to a bulk-like gold structure at seven layers, adopting a rhombohedral (ABC-like) stacking characteristic of bulk face-centered cubic (FCC) gold. The atomic arrangement converges entirely to the bulk gold lattice for more than ten layers. Quantum confinement significantly impacts the electronic properties, with monolayer and bulk Goldene exhibiting a single Dirac cone at the X-point of the Brillouin zone. In contrast, multilayer Goldene shows two Dirac cones at the X- and Y-points. Additionally, monolayer Goldene exhibits anisotropic optical absorption, which is absent in bulk gold. This study provides a deeper understanding of multilayer Goldene's structural and electronic properties and stacked 2D materials in general.</description>

      <title>High stability 2D electron gases formed in Si3N4/Al//KTaO3 heterostructures: synthesis and in-depth interfacial characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) found in KTaO3-based interfaces has garnered attention due to its remarkable electronic properties. In this study, we investigated the conducting system embedded at the Si3N4/Al//KTO(110) heterostructure. We demonstrate that the Al/KTO interface supports a conducting system, with the Si3N4 passivation layer acting as a barrier to oxygen diffusion, enabling ex-situ characterization. Our findings reveal that the mobility and carrier density of the system can be tuned by varying the Al layer thickness. Using scanning transmission electron microscopy, electron energy-loss spectroscopy, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, we characterized the structural and chemical composition of the interface. We found that the Al layer fully oxidizes into AlOx, drawing oxygen from the KTaO3 substrate. The oxygen depletion zone extends 3-5 nm into the substrate and correlates to the Al thickness. Heterostructures with thicker Al layers exhibit higher carrier densities but lower mobilities, likely due to interactions with the oxygen vacancies that act as scattering centers. These findings highlight the importance of considering the effect and extent of the oxygen depletion zone when designing and modeling two-dimensional electron systems in complex oxides.</description>

      <title>Influence of dislocations in multilayer graphene stacks: A phase field crystal study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work the influence of $5|7$ dislocations in multiplayer graphene stacks (up to six layers) is examined. The study is conducted through a recently developed Phase Field Crystal (PFC) model for multilayer systems incorporating out-of-plane deformations and parameterized to match to density functional theory calculations for graphene bilayers and other systems. The specific configuration considered consists of one monolayer containing four $5|7$ dislocations (i.e., two dislocation dipoles) sandwiched in between perfect graphene layers. The study reveals how the strain field from the dislocations in the defected layer leads to out-of-plane deformations that in turn cause deformations of neighboring layers. Quantitative predictions are made for the defect free energy of the multilayer stacks as compared to a defect-free system, which is shown to increase with the number of layers and system size. Furthermore it is predicted that system defect energy saturates by roughly ten sheets in the stack, indicating the range of defect influence across the multilayer. Variations of stress field distribution and layer height profiles in different layer of the stack are also quantitatively identified.</description>

      <title>Uncovering liquid-substrate fluctuation effects on crystal growth and disordered hyperuniformity of two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the growth of two-dimensional (2D) crystals on fluctuating surfaces using a phase field crystal model that is relevant on atomic length and diffusive time scales. Motivated by recent experiments which achieved unprecedented fast growth of large-size high-quality 2D crystals on liquid substrates, we uncover novel effects of liquid surfaces on microstructural ordering. We find that substrate fluctuations generate short-ranged noise that speeds up crystallization and grain growth of the overlayer, surpassing that of free-standing system. Coupling to the liquid substrate fluctuations can also modulate local randomness, leading to intriguing disordered structures with hidden spatial order, i.e., disordered hyperuniformity. These results reveal the physical mechanisms underlying the fast growth of 2D crystals on liquid surfaces and demonstrate a novel strategy for synthesizing disordered hyperuniform thin film structures.</description>

      <title>Crack Dynamics in Rotating, Initially Stressed Material Strips: A Mathematical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current study explores the analysis of crack in initially stressed, rotating material strips, drawing insights from singular integral equations. In this work, a self-reinforced material strip with finite thickness and infinite extent, subjected to initial stress and rotational motion, has been considered to examine the Griffith fracture. The edges of the strip are pushed by constant loads from punches moving alongside it. This study makes waves in the material that affect the fracture's movement. A distinct mathematical technique is utilized to streamline the resolution of a pair of singular integral equations featuring First-order singularities. These obtained equations help us understand how the fracture behaves. The force acting at the fracture's edge is modeled using the Dirac delta function. Then, the Hilbert transformation method calculates the stress intensity factor (SIF) at the fracture's edge. Additionally, the study explores various scenarios, including constant intensity force without punch pressure, rotation parameter, initial stress, and isotropy in the strip, deduced from the SIF expression. Numerical computations and graphical analyses are conducted to assess the influence of various factors on SIF in the study. Finally, a comparison is made between the behavior of fractures in the initially stressed and rotating reinforced material strip and those in a standard material strip to identify any differences.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Analyzing Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) Images Generated from Polymer Blends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a new machine learning workflow with unsupervised learning techniques to identify domains within atomic force microscopy images obtained from polymer films. The goal of the workflow is to identify the spatial location of the two types of polymer domains with little to no manual intervention and calculate the domain size distributions which in turn can help qualify the phase separated state of the material as macrophase or microphase ordered or disordered domains. We briefly review existing approaches used in other fields, computer vision and signal processing that can be applicable for the above tasks that happen frequently in the field of polymer science and engineering. We then test these approaches from computer vision and signal processing on the AFM image dataset to identify the strengths and limitations of each of these approaches for our first task. For our first domain segmentation task, we found that the workflow using discrete Fourier transform or discrete cosine transform with variance statistics as the feature works the best. The popular ResNet50 deep learning approach from computer vision field exhibited relatively poorer performance in the domain segmentation task for our AFM images as compared to the DFT and DCT based workflows. For the second task, for each of 144 input AFM images, we then used an existing porespy python package to calculate the domain size distribution from the output of that image from DFT based workflow. The information and open source codes we share in this paper can serve as a guide for researchers in the polymer and soft materials fields who need ML modeling and workflows for automated analyses of AFM images from polymer samples that may have crystalline or amorphous domains, sharp or rough interfaces between domains, or micro or macrophase separated domains.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Electron Trapping by Defect Midgap State and Quantum Confinement to Optimize Hot Carrier Effect in a Nanowire Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hot carrier effect, a phenomenon where charge carriers generated by photon absorption remain energetic by not losing much energy, has been one of the leading strategies in increasing solar cell efficiency. Nanostructuring offers an effective approach to enhance hot carrier effect via the spatial confinement, as occurring in a nanowire structure. The recent experimental study by Esmaielpour et al. [ACS Applied Nano Materials 7, 2817 (2024)] reveals a fascinating non-monotonic dependence of the hot carrier effect in nanowire array on the diameter of the nanowire, contrary to what might be expected from quantum confinement alone. We show that this non-monotonic behavior can be explained by a simple model for electron energy loss that involves two principal mechanisms. First, electron-phonon scattering, that increases with nanowire diameter, leading to hot carrier effect that decreases with increasing diameter. Second, electron capture by a defect level within band gap, that is, a midgap state, that decreases with nanowire diameter, leading to hot carrier effect that increases with increasing diameter. The two mechanisms balance at a certain diameter corresponding to optimal hot carrier effect. Our result offers a guideline to optimize hot carrier effect in nanowire solar cells and ultimately their efficiency by adjusting the dimensions and micro-structural properties of nanowires.</description>

Abstract: Metallic bismuth is both non-toxic and cost-effective. Bi-based catalysts have demonstrated the ability to efficiently produce HCOOH through CO2RR while effectively inhibiting the HER. Although many experiments have been reported concerning its performance towards CO2 reduction, the impact its valence states and crystal faces on CO2RR selectivity (e.g. HCOOH versus CO) it still under debate. Here, we performed a comprehensive study via density functional theory, by including three typical valence states of Bi, such as 0 (Bi), +3 (Bi2O3) and +5 (Bi2O5), as well as their often-studied crystal facets. The results show that metallic Bi demonstrates a poor selectivity for HCOOH, but boasts a higher conversion rate for CO2. While Bi2O3 exhibits a good selectivity for HCOOH production, yet it displays a lower conversion rate for CO2. For Bi2O5, all studied surfaces show high energy barriers in both cases of HCOOH and CO production, and lower energy barriers for HER reactions, indicating that Bi at +5 valence state is not the good choice for 2e transfer reactions. Subsequently, we further examined the effects of oxygen contents on the selectivity of HCOOH and the conversion rate for CO2. Interestingly, we found that partial oxidization of Bi benefits both the selectivity and the conversion rate. With these observations, we suggest that a mixture of Bi (0) and Bi2O3 (+3) phases would be a better choice than single crystals for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional topological valley photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological valley photonics, which exploits valley degree of freedom to manipulate electromagnetic waves, offers a practical and effective pathway for various classical and quantum photonic applications across the entire spectrum. Current valley photonics, however, has been limited to two dimensions, which typically suffer from out-of-plane losses and can only manipulate the flow of light in planar geometries. Here, we have theoretically and experimentally developed a framework of three-dimensional (3D) topological valley photonics with a complete photonic bandgap and vectorial valley contrasting physics. Unlike the two-dimensional counterparts with a pair of valleys characterized by scalar valley Chern numbers, the 3D valley systems exhibit triple pairs of valleys characterized by valley Chern vectors, enabling the creation of vectorial bulk valley vortices and canalized chiral valley surface states. Notably, the valley Chern vectors and the circulating propagation direction of the valley surface states are intrinsically governed by the right-hand-thumb rule. Our findings reveal the vectorial nature of the 3D valley states and highlight their potential applications in 3D waveguiding, directional radiation, and imaging.</description>

      <title>Multifold Majorana corner modes arising from multiple pairs of helical edge states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall insulators with a pair of helical edge states and proximity-induced superconductivity have been shown to support second-order topological superconductors with Majorana corner modes. As the Majorana corner modes are originated from the helical edge states of the quantum spin Hall insulators, whether quantum spin Hall insulators with multiple pairs of helical edge states and proximity-induced superconductivity can give rise to second-order topological superconductors with multifold Majorana corner modes is an interesting question to address. In this work, we consider a quantum spin Hall insulator with two pairs of helical edge states. We find robust twofold Majorana corner modes can be achieved when the helical edge states are gapped by a combined action of a magnetic exchange field and an $s$-wave pairing, or an $s+p$ mixed-parity pairing. The stability of two Majorana zero modes per corner under the action of magnetic exchange fields is attributed to the protection from the chiral symmetry. Our study reveals that heterostructures composed of superconductors and quantum spin Hall insulators with multiple pairs of helical edge states could serve as a platform to pursue multifold Majorana corner modes.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic QED and noise currents in time-varying media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Macroscopic QED (MQED) is the field theory for computing quantum electromagnetic effects in dispersive media. Here we extend MQD to treat time-varying, dispersive media. For a time dependent Drude model, we find that the expected replacement ${\epsilon}({\omega}) {\to} {\epsilon}(t,{\omega})$ within standard MQED leads to nonphysical polarization currents, becoming singular in the limit of a step change in the carrier density. We show this singular behaviour can be removed through modifying the reservaoir dynamics, quantizing the resulting theory and finding the non-equilibrium, time-varying noise currents, which exhibit extra correlations due to temporal reflections within the material dynamics.</description>

      <title>Sampling Latent Material-Property Information From LLM-Derived Embedding Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vector embeddings derived from large language models (LLMs) show promise in capturing latent information from the literature. Interestingly, these can be integrated into material embeddings, potentially useful for data-driven predictions of materials properties. We investigate the extent to which LLM-derived vectors capture the desired information and their potential to provide insights into material properties without additional training. Our findings indicate that, although LLMs can be used to generate representations reflecting certain property information, extracting the embeddings requires identifying the optimal contextual clues and appropriate comparators. Despite this restriction, it appears that LLMs still have the potential to be useful in generating meaningful materials-science representations.</description>

      <title>Ramp reversal memory in bulk crystals of 1T-TaS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ramp reversal memory (RRM) is a non-volatile memory effect previously observed in correlated oxides exhibiting temperature-driven metal-insulator transitions (MITs). In essence, when a system displaying RRM is heated to a specific temperature within the MIT regime - where metallic and insulating domains coexist - and then cooled by reversing the temperature ramp, the resistance increases in the subsequent heating cycle. Crucially, this increase occurs only in the vicinity of the reversal temperature, indicating that the system 'remembers' this temperature. However, this memory is erased in the next heating loop. While such an effect could potentially manifest in various systems, to date, it has only been reported in thin films of correlated transition metal oxides, including VO2, V2O3, and NdNiO3. In this work, we report the observation of RRM in macroscopic crystals of the layered material 1T-TaS2, which undergoes an MIT near 190 K along charge-density wave transitions. Our findings provide compelling evidence that RRM is a general phenomenon, extending beyond the previously studied oxides. Interestingly, the RRM in TaS2 displays significantly different characteristics: it is observed when reversing from cooling to heating (as opposed to heating to cooling), and its magnitude - representing the 'strength' of the memory - is nearly an order of magnitude larger than in correlated oxides. While we discuss potential mechanisms for the RRM in TaS2, a comprehensive first-principles model is still lacking. We hope that this study will prompt further investigation into the underlying mechanisms of ramp reversal memory, enhancing our understanding of this intriguing phenomenon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dislocations in van der Waals materials are linear defects confined to the interfaces between consecutive stoichiometric monolayers of a bulk layered crystal. Here, we present a mesoscale model for the description of interlayer dislocations in thin films of transition metal dichalcogenides. Taking 2H-MoS${}_2$ as a representative material, we compute the dependence of the dislocation energy on the film thickness, from few-layer MoS$_2$ to the bulk crystal, and analyse the strain field in the layers surrounding a dislocation. We also analyse the influence of strain field on the band edge profiles for electrons and holes, and conclude that the resulting energy profiles are incapable of localising charge carriers, in particular at room temperature.</description>

Abstract: We explore the possibility of obtaining new superconductor candidates from functionalized MXene compounds Zr$_2$NS$_2$, Zr$_2$NCl$_2$, and Sc$_2$NCl$_2$ from $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations with density functional theory for superconductors (SCDFT). The predicted superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ at ambient pressure may reach up to 11.23 K (Zr$_2$NS$_2$). Strain-induced $T_c$ enhancement is demonstrated with an example case for Zr$_2$NCl$_2$. We note a correlation between the profiles of superconducting gap $\Delta$ and the electron-phonon coupling $\lambda$ across the Fermi surface for all compounds, which are likely influenced by their modified electronic bandstructure components.</description>

      <title>LifeGPT: Topology-Agnostic Generative Pretrained Transformer Model for Cellular Automata</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Game of Life (Life), a well known algorithm within the broader class of cellular automata (CA), exhibits complex emergent dynamics, with extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. Modeling and predicting such intricate behavior without explicit knowledge of the system's underlying topology presents a significant challenge, motivating the development of algorithms that can generalize across various grid configurations and boundary conditions. We develop a decoder-only generative pretrained transformer model to solve this problem, showing that our model can simulate Life on a toroidal grid with no prior knowledge on the size of the grid, or its periodic boundary conditions (LifeGPT). LifeGPT is topology-agnostic with respect to its training data and our results show that a GPT model is capable of capturing the deterministic rules of a Turing-complete system with near-perfect accuracy, given sufficiently diverse training data. We also introduce the idea of an `autoregressive autoregressor' to recursively implement Life using LifeGPT. Our results pave the path towards true universal computation within a large language model (LLM) framework, synthesizing of mathematical analysis with natural language processing, and probing AI systems for situational awareness about the evolution of such algorithms without ever having to compute them. Similar GPTs could potentially solve inverse problems in multicellular self-assembly by extracting CA-compatible rulesets from real-world biological systems to create new predictive models, which would have significant consequences for the fields of bioinspired materials, tissue engineering, and architected materials design.</description>

      <title>TR-ARPES Signal in Pumped Semiconductors within Dynamical Projective Operatorial Approach (DPOA)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, after discussing in detail the internals of our recently developed method, the dynamical projective operatorial approach (DPOA), we provide the framework to apply this method to pumped semiconductor lattice systems and, in particular, to study and analyze their electronic excitations and TR-ARPES signal. The expressions for relevant out-of-equilibrium Green's functions and TR-ARPES signal are given within the DPOA framework and, defining a retarded TR-ARPES signal, it is shown that it is possible to obtain an out-of-equilibrium version of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We clarify how single- and multi-photon resonances, rigid shifts, band dressings, and different types of sidebands emerge in the TR-ARPES signal. We also propose protocols for evaluating the strength of single- and multi-photon resonances and for assigning the residual excited electronic population at each crystal momentum and band to a specific excitation process. Hamiltonians, where intra- and inter-band transitions are selectively inhibited, are defined and used to analyze the effects on the TR-ARPES signal and the residual electronic excited population. Three relevant cases of light-matter coupling are examined within the dipole gauge: only a local dipole, only the Peierls substitution in the hopping term, and both terms at once. The transient and residual pump effects are studied in detail, including the consequences of the lattice symmetries at different crystal momenta on the TR-ARPES signal. A detailed study of the dependence of the TR-ARPES signal on the probe-pulse characteristics is also reported. To provide a guideline for understanding the complex effects and interplays and the variety of possible physical phenomena without being limited by the characteristics of a single particular real material, we have chosen to study a prototypical pumped two-band semiconductor lattice system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An accurate description of information is relevant for a range of problems in atomistic machine learning (ML), such as crafting training sets, performing uncertainty quantification (UQ), or extracting physical insights from large datasets. However, atomistic ML often relies on unsupervised learning or model predictions to analyze information contents from simulation or training data. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework that provides a rigorous, model-free tool to quantify information contents in atomistic simulations. We demonstrate that the information entropy of a distribution of atom-centered environments explains known heuristics in ML potential developments, from training set sizes to dataset optimality. Using this tool, we propose a model-free UQ method that reliably predicts epistemic uncertainty and detects out-of-distribution samples, including rare events in systems such as nucleation. This method provides a general tool for data-driven atomistic modeling and combines efforts in ML, simulations, and physical explainability.</description>

      <title>Edge-selective reconfiguration in polarized lattices with magnet-enabled bistability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The signature topological feature of Maxwell lattices is their polarization, which manifests as an unbalance in stiffness between opposite edges of a finite domain. The manifestation of this asymmetry is especially dramatic in the case of soft lattices undergoing large nonlinear deformation under concentrated loads, where the excess of softness at the soft edge can result in the activation of sharp indentations. This study explores how this mechanical dichotomy between edges can be tuned and possibly extremized by working with soft magneto-mechanical metamaterials. The magneto-mechanical coupling is obtained by endowing the lattice sites with permanent magnets, which activate a network of magnetic forces that can interact with (either augmenting or competing with) the elasticity of the material. Specifically, under sufficiently large deformation that macroscopically alters the equilibrium positions of the sites, the attractive forces between the magnets can trigger bistable reconfiguration mechanisms. The strength of such mechanisms depends on the landscapes of elastic reaction forces exhibited by the edges, which are different due to the polarization, and is therefore inherently edge-selective. We show that, on the soft edge, the addition of magnets simply enhances the softness of the edge. In contrast, on the stiff edge, the magnets activate snapping mechanisms that locally reconfigure the cells and produce a lattice response reminiscent of plasticity, characterized by residual deformation that persists upon unloading.</description>

      <title>Selective incorporation of antimony into gallium nitride</title>

Abstract: Dilute concentrations of antimony (Sb) incorporation into GaN induce strong band-gap bowing and tunable room-temperature photoluminescence from the UV to the green spectral regions. However, the atomistic details of the incorporation of Sb into the GaN host remain unclear. In this work, we use first-principles calculations to understand the thermodynamics of Sb substitution into GaN, and its effect on the optical and Raman spectra. Although it is empirically considered that Sb is preferentially incorporated as an anion ($\mathrm{Sb^{3-}}$) into the N sublattice, we demonstrate that Sb can also be incorporated as a cation ($\mathrm{Sb^{3+}}$, $\mathrm{Sb^{5+}}$) into the metal sublattice. Our thermodynamic analysis demonstrates that $\mathrm{Sb_N^0}$, $\mathrm{Sb_{Ga}^{2+}}$, and $\mathrm{Sb_{Ga}^0}$ can co-exist under Ga-rich conditions in n-type samples. We further confirm the dual incorporation of Sb by calculating the vibrational frequencies of different anionic and cation substitutions to explain the origins of experimentally observed additional Raman peaks of Sb-doped GaN. Moreover, the calculated band structures of different Sb substitutions into GaN explain the experimental photoluminescence and optical absorption spectra. Overall, our analysis suggests that the coexistence of $\mathrm{Sb^{3-}}$, $\mathrm{Sb^{3+}}$, and $\mathrm{Sb^{5+}}$ substitutions into GaN explains the totality of experimental measurements. Our results demonstrate that the selective incorporation of Sb into GaN (and potentially other group-V elements such as As, P, or Bi) by tuning the growth conditions can drastically modify the electronic properties, for applications in visible light emitters and photocatalysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Co3Sn2S2, a ferromagnetic Weyl semi-metal with Co atoms on a kagome lattice, has generated much recent attention. Experiments have identified a temperature scale below the Curie temperature. Here, we find that this magnet keeps a memory, when not exposed to a magnetic field sufficiently large to erase it. We identify the driver of this memory effect as a small secondary population of spins, whose coercive field is significantly larger than that of the majority spins. The shape of the magnetization hysteresis curve has a threshold magnetic field set by the demagnetizing factor. These two field scales set the hitherto unidentified temperature scale, which is not a thermodynamic phase transition, but a crossing point between meta-stable boundaries. Global magnetization is well defined, even when it is non-uniform, but drastic variations in local magnetization point to a coarse energy landscape, with the thermodynamic limit not achieved at micrometer length scales.</description>

Abstract: In-situ diffuse neutron scattering experiments revealed that when electric current is passed through single crystals of rutile TiO2 under conditions conducive to flash sintering, it induces the formation of parallel planes of oxygen vacancies. Specifically, a current perpendicular to the c-axis generates planes normal to the (132) reciprocal lattice vector, whereas currents aligned with the c-axis form planes normal to the (132) and to the (225) vector. The concentration of defects increases with incresing current. The structural modifications are linked to the appearance of signatures of interacting Ti3+ moments in magnetic susceptibility, signifying a structural collapse around the vacancy planes. Electrical conductivity measurements of the modified material reveal several electronic transitions between semiconducting states (via a metal-like intermediate state) with the smallest gap being 27 meV. Pristine TiO2 can be restored by heating followed by slow cooling in air. Our work suggests a novel paradigm for achieving switching of electrical conductivity related to the flash phenomenon</description>

      <title>On the Onset of Coherent Phonon Motion in Peierls-Distorted Antimony by Attosecond Transient Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attosecond extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy measurements on the Peierls-distorted phase of the semimetal antimony (Sb) are presented. After excitation by an ultrashort, broad band near-infrared (NIR) pulse, the distortion is (partly) lifted causing the well-known coherent phonon motion of the lattice. While the overall observed dynamics generally follow a displacive excitation model, a delayed onset of the pump-induced carrier dynamics due to hot-carrier thermalization is observed, as well as a large spectral phase dependence in the coherent phonon oscillation. This is attributed to significantly different carrier relaxation timescales for carrier energies above and near the Fermi level of the semimetal and corroborated by a simple theoretical model that considers the carrier relaxation timescales in the displacive phonon model to explain the observed dynamics. Our results provide direct experimental evidence about the role of carrier-relaxation in the origin of displacive coherent phonon motion.</description>

      <title>Dark-Field X-ray Microscopy for 2D and 3D imaging of Microstructural Dynamics at the European X-ray Free Electron Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03916</link>

Abstract: Dark field X-ray microscopy (DXFM) can visualize microstructural distortions in bulk crystals. Using the femtosecond X-ray pulses generated by X-ray free-electron lasers (XFEL), DFXM can achieve sub-{\mu}m spatial resolution and &lt;100 fs time resolution simultaneously. In this paper, we demonstrate ultrafast DFXM measurements at the European XFEL to visualize an optically-driven longitudinal strain wave propagating through a diamond single crystal. We also present two DFXM scanning modalities that are new to the XFEL sources: spatially 3D and 2D axial-strain scans with sub-{\mu}m spatial resolution. With this progress in XFEL-based DFXM, we discuss new opportunities to study multi-timescale spatio-temporal dynamics of microstructures.</description>

      <title>Scoring Anomalous Vertices Through Quantum Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the constant flow of data from vast sources over the past decades, a plethora of advanced analytical techniques have been developed to extract relevant information from different data types ranging from labeled data, quasi-labeled data, and data with no labels known a priori. For data with at best quasi-labels, graphs are a natural representation of these data types and have important applications in many industries and scientific disciplines. Specifically, for unlabeled data, anomaly detection on graphs is a method to determine which data points do not posses the latent characteristics that is present in most other data. There have been a variety of classical methods to compute an anomalous score for the individual vertices of a respected graph, such as checking the local topology of a node,random walks, and complex neural networks. Leveraging the structure of the graph, we propose a first quantum algorithm to calculate the anomaly score of each node by continuously traversing the graph with a uniform starting position of all nodes. The proposed algorithm incorporates well-known characteristics of quantum random walks, and, taking into consideration the NISQ era and subsequent ISQ era, an adjustment to the algorithm is given to mitigate the increasing depth of the circuit. This algorithm is rigorously shown to converge to the expected probability, with respect to the initial condition.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry dictated topology in periodic gauge fields and realization in strained and twisted 2D materials</title>

Abstract: Supersymmetry (SUSY) of Hamiltonian dictates double degeneracy between a pair of superpartners (SPs) transformed by supercharge, except at zero energy where modes remain unpaired in many cases. Here we explore a SUSY of complete isospectrum between SPs -- with paired zero modes -- realized by 2D electrons in zero-flux periodic gauge fields, which can describe twisted or periodically strained 2D materials. We find their low-energy sector containing zero (or threshold) modes must be topologically non-trivial, by proving that Chern numbers of the two SPs have a finite difference dictated by the number of zero modes and energy dispersion in their vicinity. In $30^\circ$ twisted bilayer (double bilayer) transition metal dichalcogenides subject to periodic strain, we find one SP is topologically trivial in its lowest miniband, while the twin SP of identical dispersion has a Chern number of $1$ ($2$), in stark contrast to time-reversal partners that have to be simultaneously trivial or nontrivial. For systems whose physical Hamiltonian corresponds to the square root of a SUSY Hamiltonian, such as twisted or strained bilayer graphene, we reveal that topological properties of the two SUSY SPs are transferred respectively to the conduction and valence bands, including the contrasted topology in the low-energy sector and identical topology in the high-energy sector. This offers a unified perspective for understanding topological properties in many flat-band systems described by such square-root models. Both types of SUSY systems provide unique opportunities for exploring correlated and topological phases of matter.</description>

      <title>A High-Temperature Thermocouple Development by Additive Manufacturing: Tungsten-Nickel (W-Ni) and Molybdenum (Mo) Integration with Ceramic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Additive manufacturing holds more potential to enable the development of ceramic-based components. Ceramics offer high resistance to heat, high fracture toughness, and are extremely corrosion resistant. Thus, ceramics are widely used in sectors such as the aerospace industry, automotive, microelectronics, and biomedicine. Using various additive manufacturing platforms, ceramics with complex and uniquely designed geometry can be developed to suit specific applications. This project aims at innovating high-temperature thermocouples by embedding conductive metal pastes into a ceramic structure. The paste used includes tungsten, molybdenum, and antimony. The metal pastes are precisely extruded into a T-shaped trench inside the ceramic matrix. Following specific temperature ranges, the ceramic matrix is sintered to improve the properties of the material. The sensors produced can function at extremely high temperatures and are thereby suitable for high-temperature environments. Comparative testing of the 3D sintered sensors with conventional temperature sensors shows high correlation between the two classes of sensors. The resulting R-squared value of 0.9885 is satisfactory which implies the reliability and accuracy of 3D sintering sensors are satisfactory in temperature sensing applications.</description>

      <title>All-Electrical Layer-Spintronics in Altermagnetic Bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrical manipulation of spin-polarized current is highly desirable yet tremendously challenging in developing ultracompact spintronic device technology. Here we propose a scheme to realize the all-electrical manipulation of spin-polarized current in an altermagnetic bilayer. Such a bilayer system can host layer-spin locking, in which one layer hosts a spin-polarized current while the other layer hosts a current with opposite spin polarization. An out-of-plane electric field breaks the layer degeneracy, leading to a gate-tunable spin-polarized current whose polarization can be fully reversed upon flipping the polarity of the electric field. Using first-principles calculations, we show that CrS bilayer with C-type antiferromagnetic exchange interaction exhibits a hidden layer-spin locking mechanism that enables the spin polarization of the transport current to be electrically manipulated via the layer degree of freedom. We demonstrate that sign-reversible spin polarization as high as 87% can be achieved at room temperature. This work presents the pioneering concept of layer-spintronics which synergizes altermagnetism and bilayer stacking to achieve efficient electrical control of spin.</description>

      <title>The Properties of Glass Fiber Reinforced Polypropylene Filaments Recycled from Fishing Gear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plastic pollution, mainly from lost fishing gear composed of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP), poses a significant environmental obstacle. This study evaluates the potential of recycling PP from fishnet/rope and reinforcing it with glass fiber (GF) in the form of 3D printer filaments as a way to reduce/prevent ocean plastic. Two materials, one virgin (vPP-GF) and one made up of recycled polypropylene and virgin glass fibers (rPP-GF), were analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry, tensile, and Charpy impact tests. From the results, it was found that rPP-GF often outperformed vPP-GF. rPP-GF had a higher melting and crystallization point, likely a higher crystallinity, and could withstand a higher tensile stress, while vPP-GF could withstand a higher tensile strain. Further analysis revealed the potential presence of HDPE within the rPP-GF composite, which was not reported by the manufacturer. This significantly affected the Charpy test and made it difficult to draw conclusions from the resulting data. Nevertheless, their comparability in terms of mechanical and material properties indicates the strong potential of recycling polypropylene fishnet/rope and reinforcing it with glass fibers to extend their lifespan and reduce ocean plastic.</description>
