      <title>The Effects of Time Since Fire On Bird Community Composition in Chaparral Ecosystems Across Los Angeles County</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of time since fire on bird community composition in Southern California chaparral ecosystems. We surveyed avian richness and abundance across 14 sites representing a 0 to 25 year post-fire chronosequence in Los Angeles County. Sites burned within the last five years supported fewer species, primarily dominated by generalists, while mid- to late-successional sites exhibited greater richness and a higher proportion of specialists. These patterns corresponded with increases in vegetation structural complexity over time. However, no consistent relationships were found between bird communities and abiotic variables, such as weather, temperature, and elevation, likely due to the single-visit sampling design. Our results align with successional theory and underscore the ecological importance of fire return intervals that allow full chaparral recovery. Restoration and management should prioritize long-term structural development, invasive grass control, and post-fire heterogeneity to support diverse and resilient avian communities.</description>

      <title>Scarce Data, Noisy Inferences, and Overfitting: The Hidden Flaws in Ecological Dynamics Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metagenomic data has significantly advanced microbiome research by employing ecological models, particularly in personalised medicine. The generalised Lotka-Volterra (gLV) model is commonly used to understand microbial interactions and predict ecosystem dynamics. However, gLV models often fail to capture complex interactions, especially when data is limited or noisy. This study critically assesses the effectiveness of gLV and similar models using Bayesian inference and a model reduction method based on information theory. We found that ecological data often leads to non-interpretability and overfitting due to limited information, noisy data, and parameter sloppiness. Our results highlight the need for simpler models that align with the available data and propose a distribution-based approach to better capture ecosystem diversity, stability, and competition. These findings challenge current bottom-up ecological modelling practices and aim to shift the focus toward a Statistical Mechanics view of ecology based on distributions of parameters.</description>

      <title>Gonosomic algebras: an extension of gonosomal algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce gonosomic algebras to algebraically translate the phenomenon of genetic sterility. Gonosomic algebras extend the concept of gonosomal algebras used as algebraic model of genetic phenomena related to sex-determination and sex-linked gene transmission by allowing genetic sterility to be taken into account. Conditions under which gonosomic algebras are not gonosomal and several algebraic constructions of gonosomic algebras are given. To each gonosomic algebra, an evolution operator noted W is associated that gives the state of the offspring population at the birth stage. Next from W we define the operator V which gives the frequency distribution of genetic types. We show that the various stability notions of equilibrium points are preserved by passing from W to V .</description>

      <title>Ecosystem Recovery to Historical Targets Becomes Unattainable Under Modelled Fishing and Climate in the Barents Sea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change and fisheries jointly shape the resilience of the Barents Sea marine ecosystem, yet the recovery of key fish populations to climate and anthropogenic disturbances requires further investigation. This study examines how fishing pressure and climate change, driven by the NEMO-MEDUSA Earth system model, influence the recovery times of Demersal and Planktivorous fish in the Barents Sea. We used the StrathE2EPolar end-to-end ecosystem model to simulate transient dynamics under increasing fishing pressure scenarios, and quantified recovery times for Demersal, Planktivorous, and ecosystem-wide groups relative to a shifting unfished baseline. Recovery times increased with both fishing intensity and climate change, by as much as 18 years for Demersal fish and 54 years for Planktivorous fish across all fishing scenarios. At the ecosystem level, recovery was constrained by the slow rebound of top predators, many of which experienced biomass collapse under climate change, preventing recovery to a shifting baseline. Our results suggest that fishing pressure in tandem with climate change substantially reduces ecosystem resilience, highlighting the importance of sustainable harvest strategies in a changing climate.</description>

      <title>Learning Pareto-Optimal Pandemic Intervention Policies with MORL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic underscored a critical need for intervention strategies that balance disease containment with socioeconomic stability. We approach this challenge by designing a framework for modeling and evaluating disease-spread prevention strategies. Our framework leverages multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) - a formulation necessitated by competing objectives - combined with a new stochastic differential equation (SDE) pandemic simulator, calibrated and validated against global COVID-19 data. Our simulator reproduces national-scale pandemic dynamics with orders of magnitude higher fidelity than other models commonly used in reinforcement learning (RL) approaches to pandemic intervention. Training a Pareto-Conditioned Network (PCN) agent on this simulator, we illustrate the direct policy trade-offs between epidemiological control and economic stability for COVID-19. Furthermore, we demonstrate the framework's generality by extending it to pathogens with different epidemiological profiles, such as polio and influenza, and show how these profiles lead the agent to discover fundamentally different intervention policies. To ground our work in contemporary policymaking challenges, we apply the model to measles outbreaks, quantifying how a modest 5% drop in vaccination coverage necessitates significantly more stringent and costly interventions to curb disease spread. This work provides a robust and adaptable framework to support transparent, evidence-based policymaking for mitigating public health crises.</description>

      <title>Non-Monotone Traveling Waves of the Weak Competition Lotka-Volterra System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate traveling wave solutions in the two-species reaction-diffusion Lotka-Volterra competition system under weak competition. For the strict weak competition regime $(b&lt;a&lt;1/c,\,d&gt;0)$, we construct refined upper and lower solutions combined with the Schauder fixed point theorem to establish the existence of traveling waves for all wave speeds $s\geq s^*:=\max\{2,2\sqrt{ad}\}$, and provide verifiable sufficient conditions for the emergence of non-monotone waves. Such conditions for non-monotonic waves have not been explicitly addressed in previous studies. It is interesting to point out that our result for non-monotone waves also hold for the critical speed case $s=s^*$. In addition, in the critical weak competition case $(b&lt;a=1/c,\,d&gt;0)$, we rigorously prove, for the first time, the existence of front-pulse traveling waves.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Darwinian selection in molecular replicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.02809v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the relationship between thermodynamics, fitness, and Darwinian selection in autocatalytic molecular replicators. We uncover a thermodynamic bound that relates fitness, replication rate, and thermodynamic affinity of replication. This bound applies to a broad range of systems, including elementary and non-elementary autocatalytic reactions, polymer-based replicators, and certain kinds of autocatalytic sets. In addition, we show that the critical selection coefficient (the minimal fitness difference visible to selection) is bounded by a simple function of the affinity. Our results imply fundamental thermodynamic bounds on selection strength in molecular evolution, complementary to other bounds that arise from finite population sizes and error thresholds. These bounds may be relevant for understanding thermodynamic constraints faced by early replicators at the origin of life. We illustrate our approach on several examples, including a classic model of replicators in a chemostat.</description>

      <title>Towards a less spherical cow: Species differences dilute the stabilizing effect of higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ecological models traditionally explain stability and coexistence through pairwise interactions among species. These interactions can also involve groups of three or more species, higher-order interactions, which recent theory suggests can by themselves stabilize communities. However, ecological communities exhibit both pairwise and higher-order interactions, and how their interplay governs stability and coexistence remains unknown. This work addresses this gap by analyzing a model of competitive communities that incorporates a proportion of pairwise and higher-order interactions. Using empirical data, numerical simulations, and analytical methods, we show that higher-order interactions alone cannot guarantee coexistence. We find that, while a small fraction of higher-order interactions can stabilize dynamics in communities of identical species, this effect disappears under more realistic conditions -such as heterogeneity in birth and death rates, empirically derived rates, or explicit interaction structures. Our results challenge the prevailing view of higher-order interactions as a universal stabilizing mechanism, providing quantitative evidence of the joint importance of both pairwise and higher-order interactions, together with network structure and species parameters, for understanding ecological stability.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Re-Analysis of the Phylogenetic Topology of Early SARS-CoV-2 Case Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A much-cited 2022 paper by Pekar et al. claimed that Bayesian analysis of the molecular phylogeny of early SARS-CoV-2 cases indicated that it was more likely that two successful introductions to humans had occurred than that just one had. Here I show that after correcting a fundamental error in Bayesian reasoning the results in that paper give larger likelihood for a single introduction than for two.</description>
