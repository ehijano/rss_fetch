      <title>Quantum Sensing of Broadband Spin Dynamics and Magnon Transport in Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical detection of magnetic resonance using quantum spin sensors (QSS) provides a spatially local and sensitive technique to probe spin dynamics in magnets. However, its utility as a probe of antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR), wherein the characteristic resonant frequencies substantially exceed the QSS probing frequency, remains an open question. Here, using the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond as a QSS, we report the first experimental demonstration of optically detected AFMR in layered van der Waals antiferromagnets up to frequencies of 24 GHz, significantly higher than the sensor's spin resonance frequency of 2.87 GHz. To achieve this, we leverage the enhancement of the QSS spin relaxation rate due to low-frequency magnetic field fluctuations that arise from collective late-time dynamics of finite-wavevector magnons excited by the driven uniform AFMR mode. Using optically detected AFMR, we first characterize the temperature and magnetic field dependence on the AFMR modes, which shed light on the intrinsic exchange fields and magnetic anisotropies. Second, we exploit the highly localized sensitivity of the QSS to demonstrate efficient magnon transport over tens of micrometers. Finally, we find that optical detection efficiency in fact increases with increasing frequency, enabling broadband detection of magnetization dynamics. Our work showcases the dual capabilities of QSS as detectors of both high frequency magnetization dynamics and magnon transport, paving the way for understanding and controlling magnetism in Neel states in antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Influence of Carrier-Carrier Interactions on the Sub-threshold Swing of Band-to-Band Tunnelling Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Band-to-band tunnelling field-effect transistors (TFETs) have long been considered as promising candidates for future low-power logic applications. However, fabricated TFETs rarely reach sub-60 mV/dec sub-threshold swings (SS) at room temperature. Previous theoretical studies identified Auger processes as possible mechanisms for the observed degradation of SS. Through first-principles quantum transport simulations incorporating carrier-carrier interactions within the Non-equilibrium Green's Function formalism and self-consistent GW approximation, we confirm here that Auger processes are indeed at least partly responsible for the poor performance of TFETs. Using a carbon nanotube TFET as testbed, we show that carrier-carrier scattering alone significantly increases the OFF-state current of these devices, thus worsening their sub-threshold behavior.</description>

      <title>Physics Origin of Universal Unusual Magnetoresistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of the unusual magnetoresistance (UMR) during the rotation of magnetization in the plane perpendicular to the electric current, which has been typically attributed to magnetization-dependent interfacial reflection of spin current, has brought remarkable impacts on the understanding and application of a variety of spintronic phenomena. Here, we report that giant UMR occurs also in single-layer magnetic metals and exhibits high-order contributions and a universal sum rule, which agree well with the physics origin of the recently proposed two-vector magnetoresistance that simply considers electron scattering by the magnetization vector and interfacial electric field, without the need for any relevance to spin current. Revisiting of the literature data reveals that the most representative data that were used to claim spin Hall magnetoresistance or other magnetoresistances related or unrelated to spin current can be understood unifiedly by the two-vector MR theory. Experimental and theoretical results against spin-current-related magnetoresistances, but not the two-vector magnetoresistance, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear edge transport in a quantum Hall system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear transport phenomena in condensed matter reflect the geometric nature, quantum coherence, and many-body correlation of electronic states. Electric currents in solids are classified into (i) Ohmic current, (ii) supercurrent, and (iii) geometric or topological current. While the nonlinear current-voltage $(I$-$V)$ characteristics of the former two categories have been extensive research topics recently, those of the last category remains unexplored. Among them, the quantum Hall current is a representative example. Realized in two-dimensional electronic systems under a strong magnetic field, the topological protection quantizes the Hall conductance in the unit of $e^2/h$ ($e$: elementary charge, $h$: Planck constant), of which the edge transport picture gives a good account. Here, we theoretically study the nonlinear $I$-$V_\text{H}$ characteristic of the edge transport up to third order in $V_\text{H}$. We find that nonlinearity arises in the Hall response from electron-electron interaction between the counterpropagating edge channels with the nonlinear energy dispersions. We also discuss possible experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional topological Anderson insulator in a HgTe-based semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In strongly disordered HgTe quantum wells with a semimetallic spectrum we have experimentally discovered Anderson localization of two-dimensional (2D) electrons and holes in the bulk of the quantum well, exhibiting an exponentially strong increase in resistance as the temperature decreases. Conversely, for the one-dimensional (1D) edge current states we observed a very weak temperature dependence of the resistance, indicating the absence of localization. Initially the system is a bulk conductor, but a strong disorder opens the mobility gap in the bulk, which leads to the formation of a 2D topological Anderson insulator (TAI) state. This state turned out to be very sensitive to the applied perpendicular to the system's plane magnetic field. Firstly, a small magnetic field of 30mT breaks the topological protection of 1D edge channels turning the system into an ordinary Anderson insulator. Secondly, the magnetic field of 0.5T delocalizes 2D bulk electrons, transitioning the system into a quantum Hall liquid.</description>

      <title>Localization-delocalization transition in non-integer-charged electron wave packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the wave function of electrons and holes injected by voltage pulses with non-integer flux quantum. We find that the wave function can be delocalized in the time domain, which is measured by using the inverse participation ratio. As the flux approaches an integer multiples of flux quantum, the wave function can either remain delocalized or undergo a localization-delocalization transition. The former case occurs for the neutral electron-hole pairs, while the latter case occurs for electrons and holes which are injected individually. We perform the finite-size scaling analysis of the inverse participation ratio to further clarify the nature of the localization-delocalization transition. The scaling function and critical exponent are determined numerically by the data collapse method. We find that the localization-delocalization transition is universal in the sense that the scaling function and critical exponent is insensitive to the pulse profile when the pulse is sufficiently sharp. In contrast, they exhibit quantitatively different behavior for the Lorentzian pulse, indicating the corresponding localization-delocalization transition belongs to a different universality class.</description>

      <title>Temperature and Electron Concentration Dependences of 1/f Noise in Hg$_{1-x}$Cd$_x$Te -- Evidence for a Mobility Fluctuations Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hg$_{1-x}$Cd$_x$Te is a unique material with the band-gap tunable by the temperature, pressure, and cadmium content in a wide range, from 1.6 eV to inverted band-gap of -0.3 eV. This makes Hg$_{1-x}$Cd$_x$Te one of the key materials for infrared and terahertz detectors, whose characteristics largely depend on the material noise properties. In this work, we investigated the low-frequency 1/f noise in a thick (800 nm) HgCdTe layer and in a field effect transistor (FET) with an 8 nm wide HgTe quantum well. Both structures exhibited a small contribution from contact noise and showed weak noise dependences on temperature. Investigation of the 1/f noise in HgTe quantum well FET as a function of gate voltage revealed that the noise also depends weakly on electron concentration. These findings indicate that the noise properties of Hg$_{1-x}$Cd$_x$Te are similar to those of graphene, where mobility fluctuations were found to be the dominant mechanism of the 1/f noise.</description>

      <title>Control of 2D plasmons in the topological insulator Bi2Se3 with highly crystalline C60 overlayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological Insulators (TIs) present an interesting materials platform for nanoscale, high frequency devices because they support high mobility, low scattering electronic transport within confined surface states. However, a robust methodology to control the properties of surface plasmons in TIs has yet to be developed. We propose that charge transfer between Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and crystalline C$_{60}$ films may provide tunable control of the two-dimensional plasmons in Bi$_2$Se$_3$. We have grown heterostructures of Bi$_2$Se$_3$/C$_{60}$ with exceptional crystallinity. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) reveals significant hybridisation of $\pi$ states at the interface, despite the expectation for only weak van der Waals interactions, including quenching of 2D plasmons. Momentum-resolved EELS measurements are used to probe the plasmon dispersion, with Density Functional Theory predictions providing an interpretation of results based on interfacial charge dipoles. Our measurements suggest a robust methodology for tuneable TI interfaces that can be engineered for plasmonic applications in computing, communications and sensing.</description>

      <title>Magnetic proximity effect in biphenylene monolayer from first-principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-surface chemistry has emerged as a key technique for designing novel low-dimensional materials, enabling precise manipulation of their electronic and magnetic properties at the atomic scale. It also proves highly effective for the fabrication of heterostructures. Leveraging these benefits, herein, we perform a first principles study of the magnetic proximity effect (MPE) in a heterostructure formed by a monolayer of the two-dimensional carbon allotrope biphenylene network (BPN) deposited on the surface of the above-room-temperature ferrimagnet yttrium iron garnet (YIG). Our results reveal strong hybridization between BPN orbitals and YIG surface states, resulting in non-homogeneous electron transfer and robust MPE. The proposed methodology accurately describes YIG magnetic interactions, allowing us to study the tuning effects of BPN on the magnetic properties of the substrate for the first time. Additionally, we explore the impact of van der Waals (vdW) distance at the interface, finding enhanced spin splitting up to 30% under external pressure. These findings highlight a promising strategy for inducing spin polarization in BPN without chemical modifications, opening new possibilities for BPN-based spintronic devices through the creation of heterostructures with magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Injection locking in DC-driven spintronic vortex oscillators via surface acoustic wave modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control of the microwave signal generated by spin-transfer torque oscillators (STOs) is crucial for their applications in spin wave generation and neuromorphic computing. This study investigates injection locking of a DC-driven vortex STO using surface acoustic waves (SAWs) to enhance the STO's signal and allow for its synchronization with external inputs. We employ a simplified model based on Thiele's formalism and highlight the role of vortex deformations in achieving injection locking. Micromagnetic simulations are conducted to validate our theoretical predictions, revealing how the locking bandwidth depends on SAW amplitude, as well as on the amplitude and direction of an applied external field. Our findings are pivotal for advancing experimental research and developing efficient low-power synchronization methods for large-scale STO networks.</description>

      <title>Topological phase transition and its stability against an applied magnetic field in a class of low dimensional decorated lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility of topological phase transition with or without a magnetic flux trapped in the cells of a class of decorated lattices is explored in details.Using a tight binding Hamiltonian and a real space decimation scheme we analytically obtain the non-dispersive and dispersive energy bands, and exactly locate the eigenvalues at which energy gaps close.We find that despite the local breaking of the time reversal symmetry, as a magnetic field is turned on, the topological invariant exhibits quantization, and a clear appearance of edge localized modes is observed exactly at the gap-closing energy eigenvalues in the topologically non-trivial insulating phase.The bulk boundary correspondence is obeyed. The protection of the edge states by a chiral symmetry is confirmed for both the presence and absence of magnetic flux. Our studies have been extended to other kinds of decorated lattices where topological phase transition is possible only above a threshold value of the hopping integral describing these lattice. Our results are analytically exact.</description>

      <title>Identification and Control of Neutral Anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond the well-known fermions and bosons, anyons-an exotic class of particles-emerge in the fractional quantum Hall effect and exhibit fractional quantum statistics. Anyons can be categorized by their charge, with extensive research focused on those carrying fractional charge, while charge-neutral anyons in 2D electron liquids remain largely unexplored. Here, we introduce bilayer excitons as a new pathway to realizing charge-neutral anyons. By pairing quasiparticles and quasiholes from Laughlin states, we report bilayer excitons that obey fractional quantum statistics. Through layer-asymmetric field-effect doping, we achieve precise control of the anyon population, stabilizing anyonic dipoles at temperatures below the charge gap. Furthermore, we investigate neutral anyons in even-denominator FQHE states, which are likely described by non-Abelian wavefunctions. These findings open the door to exploring non-Abelian statistics in neutral anyons, with the potential to reshape future research in topological quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Digital logic from high-efficiency superconducting diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in the realizations of superconducting diodes have pushed the diode coefficient $\eta$ towards its theoretical maximum of $\eta=1$. In this work, we describe the construction of logic gates NOT, AND, OR, NAND and NOR using superconducting diodes with $\eta\approx1$ by exploiting their dynamically tunable polarity. We then argue that fundamental theorems suppress $\eta$ in intrinsic superconductors, rendering them likely unsuitable for the proposed devices, and point out that several previous proposals and platforms, remarkably, bypassed this suppression unwittingly. We discuss the realization of the digital logic in one such platform -- Josephson triodes that yielded $\eta\approx1$ -- and argue that phases with spontaneous spatial or magnetic order can overcome some of its drawbacks. Thus, this work provides guiding principles for future platforms and develops the building blocks for superconductors-based digital electronics.</description>

      <title>Orbital-spin Locking and its Optical Signatures in Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets, magnetic materials with zero magnetization and spin-split band structure, have gained tremendous attention recently for their rich physics and potential applications. Here, we report on a microscopic tight-binding model that unveils a unique coupling between orbitals and spins in $d$-wave altermagnets which gives rise to momentum-dependent and spin-selective optical absorption. This coupling promotes the controlled optical excitation of up or down spins depending on the polarization direction of linearly polarized light. Such an effect originates from the coupling of orbitals to the sublattice degree of freedom through the crystal field, which is then coupled to spins through the antiferromagnetic interaction. Our crystal field analysis, which is general to any type of altermagnet, helps understand the onset of altermagnetism from a microscopic point of view, and we use our results to propose clear magneto-optical signatures of our predictions. Our findings shine light on the interplay between orbitals and spins in altermagnets, thus paving the way towards novel orbitronic and opto-spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Enhancing light-matter coupling with electric fields in polar semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the prevailing notion that spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization fields are inherently detrimental to light emission in polar semiconductor heterostructures. Here, we demonstrate that polarization can enhance light-matter coupling in quantum wells through the quantum-confined Stark effect, by enabling a reduction in well width without shifting the emission to shorter wavelengths. We illustrate this with the paradigmatic example of red-emitting (644 nm-698 nm) AlInGaN heterostructures, which are essential for achieving polychromatic micron-scale pixels. By systematically exploring their design space with machine learning, we uncover that the globally optimal designs feature extreme internal electric fields exceeding 8 MV/cm. Structural and compositional engineering of electric fields not only offers precise control over the emission wavelength but also boosts the light-emission probability by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Observation of chiral domain walls in an octupole-ordered antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin chirality in antiferromagnets offers new opportunities for spintronics. The kagome antiferromagnet Mn3Sn is a paradigmatic material in which the antiferromagnetic order parameter can be detected and controlled by electrical means. However, direct investigation of the magnetic texture of Mn3Sn has been challenging because of the tiny moment hosted in its magnetic octupole, hindering further clarification of this unique material. Here, we address this issue by observing the stray magnetic field from Mn3Sn using a diamond quantum scanning magnetometer. The spatially-resolved intrinsic domains and domain walls in a high-quality single-crystalline Mn3Sn film quantitatively reveal the polarization angle of the magnetic octupole in the kagome plane, the domain's local magnetization, the domain wall's width and chirality, and the octupole order in domain walls. Our nanoscale investigation of Mn3Sn, a powerful complement to macroscopic measurements, paves the road for developing chiral antiferromagnetism and its potential for spintronic applications.</description>

Abstract: The first-principles theory of lasing in a rectangular lattice of spherical metal nanoparticles is developed in a fully analytical form in the dipole approximation. The lasing conditions are obtained for different diffraction orders, both propagating and evanescent. Their analysis reveals that besides usual lasing there can be lasing without population inversion which is invisible in conventional experiments, but can be observed in total internal reflection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Raman active G mode in graphene exhibits strong coupling to electrons, yet the comprehensive treatment of this interaction in the calculation of its temperature-dependent Raman spectrum remains incomplete. In this study, we calculate the temperature dependence of the G mode frequency and linewidth, and successfully explain the experimental trend, by accounting for the contributions arising from the first-order electron-phonon coupling, electron-mediated phonon-phonon coupling, and standard lattice anharmonicity. The generality of our approach enables its broad applicability to study phonon dynamics in materials where both electron-phonon coupling and anharmonicity are important.</description>

      <title>The non-Hermitian skin effect: A perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian (NH) skin effect is a truly NH feature, which manifests itself as an accumulation of states, known as skin states, on the boundaries of a system. In this perspective, we discuss several aspects of the NH skin effect focusing on the most interesting facets of this phenomenon. Non-normality and non-reciprocity are reviewed as necessary requirements to see the NH skin effect. We further discuss the NH skin effect as a topological effect that can be seen as a manifestation of a truly NH bulk-boundary correspondence, and show how topological boundary states can be distinguished from skin states. As most theoretical work has focused on studying the NH skin effect in the one-dimensional single-particle picture, recent developments of studying this effect in higher dimensions as well as in the many-body case are also highlighted. Lastly, experimental realizations and applications of the NH skin effect are reviewed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrafast transmission electron microscopy (UTEM) has emerged as a versatile technique for the time-resolved imaging of nanoscale dynamics on timescales down to few-hundred attoseconds but the temporal and spatial resolutions are still limited by the coherence properties of pulsed electron sources. Here, we report the development of a novel laser-driven linear cold-field electron emitter integrated in a state-of-the-art UTEM system. Illuminating the sharp tungsten emitter tip with a UV light pulse generates ultrashort femtosecond electron pulses of 220 fs pulse duration, with energy widths as low as 360 meV. The photoelectron emitter demonstrates exceptional spatial coherence, achieving focal spot sizes down to 2 $\mathring {\mathrm A}$ and a peak normalized brightness exceeding 6.7 $\times 10^{13}$ A/m$^2$sr. With an order-of-magnitude improvement compared to previously employed laser-driven Schottky field emitters, the present development opens up the field of ultrafast atomic-scale electron probing.</description>

      <title>Modeling Brownian Motion as a Timelapse of the Physical, Persistent, Trajectory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While it is very common to model diffusion as a random walk by assuming memorylessness of the trajectory and diffusive step lengths, these assumptions can lead to significant errors. This paper describes the extent to which a physical trajectory of a Brownian particle can be described by a random flight. Analysis of simple timelapses of physical trajectories (calculated over collisional timescales using a velocity autocorrelation function that captures the hydrodynamic and acoustic effects induced by the solvent) gave us two observations: (i) subsampled trajectories become genuinely memoryless only when the time step is ~200 times larger than the relaxation time, and (ii) the distribution of the step lengths has variances that remain significantly smaller than 2Dt (usually by a factor of ~2). This last fact is due to the combination of two effects: diffusional MSD is mathematically superballistic at short timescales and subsampled trajectories are moving averages of the underlying physical trajectory. In other words, the MSD of the physical trajectory at long time intervals asymptotically approaches 2Dt, but the MSD of the subsampled steps does not, even when the associated time interval is several hundred times larger than the relaxation time. I discuss how to best account for this effect in computational approaches.</description>

      <title>Quantitative measure of topological protection in Floquet systems through the spectral localizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard understanding of topological protection from band theory is that a system's topology cannot change without first closing the bulk band gap. However, in Floquet systems, this typical definition of topological protection is one step removed from the experimentally accessible system parameters, as the relationship between the disorder in a system's instantaneous Hamiltonian and its Floquet Hamiltonian that defines its topology is not straightforward. Here, we demonstrate that the spectral localizer framework for classifying material topology can be applied to Floquet systems and prove that its associated measure of topological protection can be understood in terms of the integrated disorder across the system's instantaneous Hamiltonians. As such, we have derived a quantitative bound on a Floquet system's topological protection in terms of the instantaneous system. Moreover, we show the utility of these bounds in both ordinary an anomalous Floquet Chern insulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.12162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As CMOS technologies face challenges in dimensional and voltage scaling, the demand for novel logic devices has never been greater, with spin-based devices offering scaling potential, at the cost of significantly high switching energies. Alternatively, magnetoelectric materials are predicted to enable low-power magnetization control, a solution with limited device-level results. Here, we demonstrate voltage-based magnetization switching and reading in nanodevices at room temperature, enabled by exchange coupling between multiferroic BiFeO$_3$ and ferromagnetic CoFe, for writing, and spin-to-charge current conversion between CoFe and Pt, for reading. We show that upon the electrical switching of the BiFeO$_3$, the magnetization of the CoFe can be reversed, giving rise to different voltage outputs. Through additional microscopy techniques, magnetization reversal is linked with the polarization state and antiferromagnetic cycloid propagation direction in the BiFeO$_3$. This study constitutes the building block for magnetoelectric spin-orbit logic, opening a new avenue for low-power beyond-CMOS technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A promising approach to attain long-distance coherent spin propagation is accessing topological spin-polarized edge states in graphene. Achieving this without external magnetic fields necessitates engineering graphene band structure, obtainable through proximity effects in van der Waals heterostructures. In particular, proximity-induced staggered potentials and spin-orbit coupling are expected to form a topological bulk gap in graphene with gapless helical edge states that are robust against disorder. In this work, we detect the spin-polarized helical edge transport in graphene at zero external magnetic field, allowed by the proximity of an interlayer antiferromagnet, CrPS$_4$. We show the coexistence of the quantum spin Hall (QSH) states and magnetism in graphene, where the induced spin-orbit and exchange couplings also give rise to a large anomalous Hall (AH) effect. The detection of the QSH states at zero external magnetic field, together with the AH signal that persists up to room temperature, opens the route for practical applications of magnetic graphene in quantum spintronic circuitries.</description>

Abstract: The evolution of complex correlated quantum systems such as random circuit networks is governed by the dynamical buildup of both entanglement and entropy. We here introduce a real-time field theory approach -- essentially a fusion of the $G \Sigma$-functional of the SYK-model and the field theory of disordered systems -- enigneered to microscopically describe the full range of such crossover dynamics: from initial product states to a maximum entropy ergodic state. To showcase this approach in the simplest nontrivial setting, we consider a tensor product of coupled random matrices, and compare to exact diagonalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnon dynamics in skyrmion lattices have garnered significant interest due to their potential applications in topological magnonics. Existing theories often follow a single-momentum approach, assuming significant Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction (DMI) to minimize the skyrmion's dimensions, which can lead to oversimplification in describing magnon behavior. This study introduces a multi-momentum operator theory for magnons in large 2D skyrmions, where each skyrmion encompasses several thousand spins. The proposed theory fully transforms the magnon Hamiltonian into momentum space, incorporating off-diagonal terms to capture umklapp scattering caused by the skyrmion wave vectors. Our results reveal deviations from single-momentum theories, demonstrating that flat bands are not universal features of the skyrmionic magnon spectrum. Additionally, we find that manipulating the skyrmion size with an external magnetic field induces multiple topological phase transitions. At high magnetic fields, the low-energy magnon spectrum becomes densely packed and entirely topological, resembling a topological band continuum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thouless pumping is an emblematic manifestation of topology in physics, referring to the ability to induce a quantized transport of charge across a system by simply varying one of its parameters periodically in time. The original concept of Thouless pumping involves a non-interacting system, and has been implemented in several platforms. One current challenge in the field is to extend this concept to interacting systems. In this article, we propose a Thouless pump that solely relies on nonlinear physics, within a chain of coupled Kerr resonators. Leveraging the driven-dissipative nature of the system, we modulate in space and time the onsite Kerr interaction energies, and generate 1+1-dimensional topological bands in the Bogoliubov spectrum of excitations. These bands present the same topology as the ones obtained within the Harper-Hofstadter framework, and the Wannier states associated to each band experience a net displacement and show quantized transport according to the bands Chern numbers. Remarkably, we find driving configurations leading to band inversion, revealing an interaction-induced topological transition. Our numerical simulations are performed using realistic parameters inspired from exciton polaritons, which form a platform of choice for investigating driven topological phases of matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10931v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By theoretically analyzing the recent temperature dependent transport data in pentalayer graphene [Lu et al., arXiv:2408.10203], we establish that the experimentally observed transition from low-temperature quantum anomalous Hall effect to higher-temperature fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect is a crossover phenomenon arising from the competition between interaction and disorder energy scales, with the likely zero temperature ground state of the system being either a localized insulator or a Chern insulator with a quantized anomalous Hall effect. In particular, the intriguing suppression of FQAHE in favor of QAHE with decreasing temperature is explained as arising from the low-temperature localization of the carriers where disorder overcomes the interaction effects. We provide a detailed analysis of the data in support of the crossover scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major challenge in materials science is the determination of the structure of nanometer sized objects. Here we present a novel approach that uses a generative machine learning model based on diffusion processes that is trained on 45,229 known structures. The model factors both the measured diffraction pattern as well as relevant statistical priors on the unit cell of atomic cluster structures. Conditioned only on the chemical formula and the information-scarce finite-size broadened powder diffraction pattern, we find that our model, PXRDnet, can successfully solve simulated nanocrystals as small as 10 angstroms across 200 materials of varying symmetry and complexity, including structures from all seven crystal systems. We show that our model can successfully and verifiably determine structural candidates four out of five times, with average error among these candidates being only 7% (as measured by post-Rietveld refinement R-factor). Furthermore, PXRDnet is capable of solving structures from noisy diffraction patterns gathered in real-world experiments. We suggest that data driven approaches, bootstrapped from theoretical simulation, will ultimately provide a path towards determining the structure of previously unsolved nano-materials.</description>

Abstract: The physics of superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) is a topic of keen interest in moir\'e systems research, and it may provide insight into the pairing mechanism of other strongly correlated materials such as high-$T_{\mathrm{c}}$ superconductors. Here, we use DC-transport and microwave circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) to measure directly the superfluid stiffness of superconducting MATBG via its kinetic inductance. We find the superfluid stiffness to be much larger than expected from conventional Fermi liquid theory; rather, it is comparable to theoretical predictions involving quantum geometric effects that are dominant at the magic angle. The temperature dependence of the superfluid stiffness follows a power-law, which contraindicates an isotropic BCS model; instead, the extracted power-law exponents indicate an anisotropic superconducting gap, whether interpreted within the Fermi liquid framework or by considering quantum geometry of flat-band superconductivity. Moreover, a quadratic dependence of the superfluid stiffness on both DC and microwave current is observed, which is consistent with Ginzburg-Landau theory. Taken together, our findings indicate that MATBG is an unconventional superconductor with an anisotropic gap and strongly suggest a connection between quantum geometry, superfluid stiffness, and unconventional superconductivity in MATBG. The combined DC-microwave measurement platform used here is applicable to the investigation of other atomically thin superconductors.</description>

Abstract: Understanding surface collective dynamics in quantum materials is crucial for advancing quantum technologies. For example, surface phonon modes in quantum paraelectrics are thought to play an essential role in facilitating interfacial superconductivity. However, detecting these modes, especially below 1 terahertz (THz), is challenging due to limited sampling volumes and the need for high spectroscopic resolution. Here, we report surface soft transverse optical (TO1) phonon dynamics in KTaO3 and SrTiO3 by developing surface-sensitive spintronic THz spectroscopy that can sense the collective modes only a few nanometers deep from the surface. In KTaO3, the TO1 mode softens and sharpens with decreasing temperature, leveling off at 0.7 THz. In contrast, this mode in SrTiO3 broadens significantly below the quantum paraelectric crossover and coincides with the hardening of a sub-meV phonon mode related to the antiferrodistortive transition. These observations that deviate from their bulk properties may have implications for interfacial superconductivity and ferroelectricity. The developed technique opens opportunities for sensing low-energy surface excitations.</description>

      <title>R-Ising: Effective resistance in random magnetic nanowires networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21999</link>

Abstract: Random assemblies of magnetic nanowires represent a unique class of materials with promising applications in spintronics and information storage. These assemblies exhibit complex behavior due to the combination of magnetic dipolar interactions between the nanowires and electronic transport properties governed by tunneling barriers at magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). The intricate interplay of these phenomena makes the study of magnetic nanowire networks a rich area of research. In this study, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze the resistive behavior of random magnetic nanowire networks. By employing a combination of graph theoretical approaches and mean-field theory, we derive an effective resistance model that encapsulates the contributions of magnetic interactions between the nanowires. Our findings show the importance of considering both the magnetic and electrical properties of nanowire networks in the design and optimization of amorphous resistive devices.</description>
