      <title>The Equivalence Problem of E-Pattern Languages with Regular Constraints is Undecidable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patterns are words with terminals and variables. The language of a pattern is the set of words obtained by uniformly substituting all variables with words that contain only terminals. Regular constraints restrict valid substitutions of variables by associating with each variable a regular language representable by, e.g., finite automata. Pattern languages with regular constraints contain only words in which each variable is substituted according to a set of regular constraints. We consider the membership, inclusion, and equivalence problems for erasing and non-erasing pattern languages with regular constraints. Our main result shows that the erasing equivalence problem, one of the most prominent open problems in the realm of patterns, becomes undecidable if regular constraints are allowed in addition to variable equality.</description>

      <title>Vulnerabilities Analysis and Secure Controlling for Unmanned Aerial System Based on Reactive Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex Cyber-Physical System (CPS) such as Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) got rapid development these years, but also became vulnerable to GPS spoofing, packets injection, buffer-overflow and other malicious attacks. Ensuring the behaviors of UAS always keeping secure no matter how the environment changes, would be a prospective direction for UAS security. This paper aims at introducing a pattern-based framework to describe the security properties of UAS, and presenting a reactive synthesis-based approach to implement the automatic generation of secure UAS controller. First, we study the operating mechanism of UAS and construct a high-level model consisting of actuator and monitor. Besides, we analyze the security threats of UAS from the perspective of hardware, software and cyber physics, and then summarize the corresponding specification patterns of security properties with LTL formulas. With the UAS model and security specification patterns, automatons for controller can be constructed by General Reactivity of Rank 1 (GR(1)) synthesis algorithm, which is a two-player game process between Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and its environment. Finally, we expand the function of LTLMoP platform to implement the control simulation in multi-robot systems, providing secure behavior strategies under several attack scenarios.</description>

      <title>Pushing the Limit: Verified Performance-Optimal Causally-Consistent Database Transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern web services crucially rely on high-performance distributed databases, where concurrent transactions are isolated from each other using concurrency control protocols. Relaxed isolation levels, which permit more complex concurrent behaviors than strong levels like serializability, are used in practice for higher performance and availability.
  In this paper, we present Eiger-PORT+, a concurrency control protocol that achieves a strong form of causal consistency, called TCCv (Transactional Causal Consistency with convergence). We show that Eiger-PORT+ also provides performance-optimal read transactions in the presence of transactional writes, thus refuting an open conjecture that this is impossible for TCCv. We also deductively verify that Eiger-PORT+ satisfies this isolation level by refining an abstract model of transactions. This yields the first deductive verification of a complex concurrency control protocol. Furthermore, we conduct a performance evaluation showing Eiger-PORT+'s superior performance over the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Can adversarial attacks by large language models be attributed?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attributing outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) in adversarial settings-such as cyberattacks and disinformation-presents significant challenges that are likely to grow in importance. We investigate this attribution problem using formal language theory, specifically language identification in the limit as introduced by Gold and extended by Angluin. By modeling LLM outputs as formal languages, we analyze whether finite text samples can uniquely pinpoint the originating model. Our results show that due to the non-identifiability of certain language classes, under some mild assumptions about overlapping outputs from fine-tuned models it is theoretically impossible to attribute outputs to specific LLMs with certainty. This holds also when accounting for expressivity limitations of Transformer architectures. Even with direct model access or comprehensive monitoring, significant computational hurdles impede attribution efforts. These findings highlight an urgent need for proactive measures to mitigate risks posed by adversarial LLM use as their influence continues to expand.</description>

      <title>Extended Stone Duality via Monoidal Adjunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08219v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extensions of Stone-type dualities have a long history in algebraic logic and have also been instrumental for proving results in algebraic language theory. We show how to extend abstract categorical dualities via monoidal adjunctions, subsuming various incarnations of classical extended Stone and Priestley duality as special cases. Guided by these categorical foundations, we investigate residuation algebras, which are algebraic models of language derivatives, and show the subcategory of derivation algebras to be dually equivalent to the category of profinite ordered monoids, restricting to a duality between boolean residuation algebras and profinite monoids. We further refine this duality to capture relational morphisms of profinite ordered monoids, which dualize to natural morphisms of residuation algebras. As a special case of the discrete version of the duality between monoids and complete residuation algebras, we obtain a novel concrete description for the dual of the category of all small categories and functors.</description>

      <title>The Power of Hard Attention Transformers on Data Sequences: A Formal Language Theoretic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Formal language theory has recently been successfully employed to unravel the power of transformer encoders. This setting is primarily applicable in Natural Language Processing (NLP), as a token embedding function (where a bounded number of tokens is admitted) is first applied before feeding the input to the transformer. On certain kinds of data (e.g. time series), we want our transformers to be able to handle arbitrary input sequences of numbers (or tuples thereof) without a priori limiting the values of these numbers. In this paper, we initiate the study of the expressive power of transformer encoders on sequences of data (i.e. tuples of numbers). Our results indicate an increase in expressive power of hard attention transformers over data sequences, in stark contrast to the case of strings. In particular, we prove that Unique Hard Attention Transformers (UHAT) over inputs as data sequences no longer lie within the circuit complexity class $AC^0$ (even without positional encodings), unlike the case of string inputs, but are still within the complexity class $TC^0$ (even with positional encodings). Over strings, UHAT without positional encodings capture only regular languages. In contrast, we show that over data sequences UHAT can capture non-regular properties. Finally, we show that UHAT capture languages definable in an extension of linear temporal logic with unary numeric predicates and arithmetics.</description>

      <title>Categorical Foundations of Formalized Condensed Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Condensed mathematics, developed by Clausen and Scholze over the last few years, proposes a  generalization of topology with better categorical properties. It replaces the concept of a topological space by that of a condensed set, which can be defined as a sheaf for the coherent topology on a certain category of compact Hausdorff spaces. In this case, the sheaf condition has a fairly simple explicit description, which arises from studying the relationship between the coherent, regular and extensive topologies. In this paper, we establish this relationship under minimal assumptions on the category, going beyond the case of compact Hausdorff spaces. Along the way, we also provide a characterization of sheaves and covering sieves for these categories. All results in this paper have been fully formalized in the Lean proof assistant.</description>
