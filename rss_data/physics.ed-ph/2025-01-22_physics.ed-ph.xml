      <title>Physics Teachers' Perceptions about Diagnostic Assessment of Students' Physics Misconceptions: A Phenomenological Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Misconception is the difference between a student's idea and his scientific concept. Physics learning needs to be designed by teachers to minimize misconceptions. Different diagnostic tools have been developed and used by researchers to identify student misconceptions. This study addressed to uncover the experiences of eight physics teachers on how they apply diagnostic tools to detect misconceptions experienced by students investigated through phenomenological studies. Physics teachers are invited to volunteer to participate in this research. Physics teachers involved in this research have diversity based on the period of experience teaching physics, geographical area, and the level of students faced. A semi-structured interview (duration of 40 to 60 minutes) through virtually was conducted by the author for all physics teachers involved in this study. Personal Practice Theories (PPTs) by Cornett was chosen as a framework to reveal the experiences and perspectives of physics teachers in making judgments about students' misconceptions of Physics. The findings revealed that four themes were obtained. These themes are (1) personal experiences of Physics teachers, (2) Physics teachers' knowledge, (3) practices in assessing Physics misconceptions, and (4) teachers' reflections on future assessment practice.</description>

      <title>Improving Student Self-Efficacy in Quantum Computing with the Qubit Touchdown Board Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qubit Touchdown is a two-player, competitive board game that was developed to introduce students to quantum computing. A quantum computer is a new kind of computer that is based on the laws of quantum physics, and it can solve certain problems faster than normal computers because it follows a different set of rules. Qubit Touchdown's game play mirrors the rules of (American) football, with players taking turns moving the football to score the most touchdowns, and no knowledge of quantum computing is needed to play the game. We evaluated the game with 107 public high school students in Precalculus, Advanced Placement (AP) Statistics, and/or AP Physics 1 courses, assessing whether their interest in and self-efficacy toward quantum computing changed as a result of playing the game and learning about its connections to quantum computing. We also assessed whether the game was easy to learn and enjoyable. We found that students' self-efficacy was improved by 33.4%, and they widely considered the game accessible and fun. Thus, Qubit Touchdown could be an effective resource to introduce students to Quantum Computing and boost their confidence in learning about the field. Free printables of the game are available, and professionally produced copies can be purchased on demand.</description>

      <title>Rising Stargirls: Benefits of a Creative Arts-Based Approach to Astronomy Education for Middle-School Girls from Underrepresented Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Women from historically marginalized groups in the sciences continue to be severely underrepresented in the fields of physics and astronomy. Young girls identifying with these groups often lose interest in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields well before college. Middle school (grades 6-8) emerges as a pivotal phase for nurturing science identities among girls. The educational program Rising Stargirls offers creative arts-based astronomy workshops for middle-school girls, with the aim of cultivating their science identities. We retrospectively analyze participants' responses to four key assessment items through which their engagement in science and their science identities before and after the workshops are assessed. Our findings overwhelmingly indicate that girls exhibit heightened engagement in science and enhanced science identities after engaging in the Rising Stargirls program. These outcomes underscore the merits of fostering creativity and integrating the arts into science education.</description>

      <title>History and presentation of the Cavendish experiment in textbooks in the 20th century</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The experiment performed by Henry Cavendish to measure the density of the earth, is in numerous textbooks described as a measurement of the universal gravitational constant, G, even if we know that this was not true. In this paper, a study on how common this "myth" is based on the checklist developed by Leite on a total of 84 textbooks. The prevalence of the myth in most textbooks throughout the 20th century indicates a focus on the contemporary interests of authors and the physics community in presenting the development of physics. An explanation of the prevalence of the myth and a different approach</description>

      <title>Active charge and discharge of a capacitor: scaling solution and energy optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capacitors are ubiquitous in electronic and electrical devices. In this article, we study -- both theoretically and experimentally -- the charging and discharging of capacitors using active control of a voltage source. The energy of these processes is analyzed in terms of work and heat. We show how to approach the quasistatic regime by slowing down the charging or discharging processes. Conversely, we study the price to be paid in terms of Joule heat when we speed up these processes. Finally, we develop optimal processes that minimize energy consumption for a finite charging time. Our work combines fundamental concepts from thermodynamics, classical mechanics and electrical circuits, thus blurring the artificial frontiers at the undergraduate level between these disciplines. Also, it provides a simple example of a prominent problem in current science, the optimization of energy resources. Moreover, our study lends itself well to an experimental project in the classroom, involving computer control of a voltage source, data acquisition, and processing.</description>
