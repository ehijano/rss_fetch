      <title>Segre surfaces and geometry of the Painlev\'e equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a six parameter family of affine Segre surfaces embedded in $\mathbb C^6$. For generic values of the parameters, this family is associated to the $q$-difference sixth Painlev\'e equation. We show that different limiting forms of this family give Segre surfaces that are isomorphic as affine varieties to the the monodromy manifolds of each Painlev\'e differential equation.</description>

      <title>Spectral energy of Dirac operators for fermion scattering on topological solitons in the nonlinear $O(3)$ $\sigma$-model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a criteria affirming the existence of discrete ground states of the Dirac operators which describe the fermion scattering on topological solitons in the nonlinear $O(3)$ $\sigma$-model. Additionally, we investigate a sufficient condition that elucidates the phenomenon of supersymmetry breaking within the supersymmetric quantum mechanics associated with this Dirac operator.</description>

      <title>Localization and unique continuation for non-stationary Schr\"odinger operators on the 2D lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend methods of Ding and Smart from their breakthrough paper in 2020 which showed Anderson localization for certain random Schr\"odinger operators on $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z}^2)$ via a quantitative unique continuation principle and Wegner estimate. We replace the requirement of identical distribution with the requirement of a uniform bound on the essential range of potential and a uniform positive lower bound on the variance of the variables giving the potential. Under those assumptions, we recover the unique continuation and Wegner lemma results, using Bernoulli decompositions and modifications of the arguments therein. This leads to a localization result at the bottom of the spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hodograph equations for the n-dimensional Euler equations with the constant pressure and external force linear in velocity are presented. They provide us with solutions of the Euler in implicit form and information on existence or absence of gradient catastrophes. It is shown that in even dimensions the constructed solutions are periodic in time for particular subclasses of external forces. Several particular examples in one, two and three dimensions are considered, including the case of Coriolis external force.</description>

      <title>Symplectic duality via log topological recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the notion of symplectic duality earlier introduced in the context of topological recursion. We show that the transformation of symplectic duality can be expressed as a composition of $x-y$ dualities in a broader context of log topological recursion. As a corollary, we establish nice properties of symplectic duality: various convenient explicit formulas, invertibility, group property, compatibility with topological recursion and KP integrability. As an application of these properties, we get a new and uniform proof of topological recursion for large families of weighted double Hurwitz numbers; this encompasses and significantly extends all previously known results on this matter.</description>

      <title>Internal symmetries in Kaluza-Klein models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01049v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The usual approach to Kaluza-Klein considers a spacetime of the form $M_4 \times K$ and identifies the isometry group of the internal vacuum metric, $g_K^0$, with the gauge group in four dimensions. In these notes we discuss a variant approach where part of the gauge group does not come from full isometries of $g_K^0$, but instead comes from weaker internal symmetries that only preserve the Einstein-Hilbert action on $K$. Then the weaker symmetries are spontaneously broken by the choice of vacuum metric and generate massive gauge bosons within the Kaluza-Klein framework, with no need to introduce ad hoc Higgs fields. Using the language of Riemannian submersions, the classical mass of a gauge boson is calculated in terms of the Lie derivatives of $g_K^0$. These massive bosons can be arbitrarily light and seem able to evade the standard no-go arguments against chiral fermionic interactions in Kaluza-Klein. As a second main theme, we also question the traditional assumption of a Kaluza-Klein vacuum represented by a product Einstein metric. This should not be true when that metric is unstable. In fact, we argue that the unravelling of the Einstein metric along certain instabilities is a desirable feature of the model, since it generates inflation and allows some metric components to change length scale. In the case of the Lie group $K = SU(3)$, the unravelling of the bi-invariant metric along an unstable perturbation also breaks the isometry group from $( SU(3) \times SU(3)) / Z_3$ down to $( SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1) )/ Z_6$, the gauge group of the Standard Model. We briefly discuss possible ways to stabilize the internal metric after that first symmetry breaking and produce an electroweak symmetry breaking at a different mass scale.</description>

      <title>A holographic global uniqueness in passive imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a radiation solution $\psi$ for the Helmholtz equation in an exterior region in $\mathbb R^3$. We show that the restriction of $\psi$ to any ray $L$ in the exterior region is uniquely determined by its imaginary part $\Im\psi$ on an interval of this ray. As a corollary, the restriction of $\psi$ to any plane $X$ in the exterior region is uniquely determined by $\Im\psi$ on an open domain in this plane. These results have holographic prototypes in the recent work [Novikov, arXiv:2310.11127]. In particular, these and known results imply a holographic type global uniqueness in passive imaging and for the Gelfand-Krein-Levitan inverse problem in the monochromatic case. Some other surfaces for measurements instead of the planes $X$ are also considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article studies the uniqueness of the weak solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations in the 3-dimensional case. Here, the investigation is provided using two different approaches. The first (the main) result is obtained for given functions possessing a certain smoothness using the new approach. The second result is without the complementary conditions but is, in some sense, the "local" result investigated by another approach. In addition, here the solvability and uniqueness of the weak solutions to auxiliary problems lead out from the main problem are investigated.</description>

      <title>A Relativistic Formula for the Multiple Scattering of Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have discovered analytical expressions for the probability density function (PDF) of photons that are multiply scattered in relativistic flows, under the assumption of isotropic and inelastic scattering. These expressions characterize the collective dynamics of these photons, ranging from free-streaming to diffusion regions. The PDF, defined within the light cone to ensure the preservation of causality, is expressed in a three-dimensional space at a constant time surface. This expression is achieved by summing the PDFs of photons that have been scattered $n$ times within four-dimensional spacetime. We have confirmed that this formulation accurately reproduces the results of relativistic Monte Carlo simulations.We found that the PDF in three-dimensional space at a constant time surface can be represented in a separable variable form. We demonstrate the behavior of the PDF in the laboratory frame across a wide range of Lorentz factors for the relativistic flow. When the Lorentz factor of the fluid is low, the behavior of scattered photons evolves sequentially from free propagation to diffusion, and then to dynamic diffusion, where the mean effective velocity of the photons equates to that of the fluid. On the other hand, when the Lorentz factor is large, the behavior evolves from anisotropic ballistic motion, characterized by a mean effective velocity approaching the speed of light, to dynamic diffusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a simple variational model describing the ground state of a superconducting charge qubit. The model gives rise to a shape optimization problem that aims at maximizing the number of qubit states at a given gating voltage. We show that for small values of the charge optimal shapes exist and are $C^{2,\alpha}$-nearly spherical sets. In contrast, for large values of the charge the optimal shape does not exist, with the energy favoring disjoint collections of sets.</description>

      <title>A \emph{$\Gamma$}-convergence of level-two large deviation for metastable systems: The case of zero-range processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the relationship between the precise asymptotics of the level-two large deviation rate function and the behavior of metastable stochastic systems. Initially identified for overdamped Langevin dynamics (Ges{\`u} et al., \textit{SIAM J Math Anal} 49(4), 3048-3072, 2017), this connection has been validated across various models, including random walks in a potential field. We extend this connection to condensing zero-range processes, a complex interacting particle system.
  Specifically, we investigate a certain class of zero-range processes on a fixed graph $G$ with $N &gt; 0$ particles and interaction parameter $\alpha &gt; 1$. On the time scale $N^2$, this process behaves like an absorbing-type diffusion and converges to a condensed state where all particles occupy a single vertex of $G$ as $N$ approaches infinity. Once condensed, on the time scale $N^{1+\alpha}$, the condensed site moves according to a Markov chain on $G$, showing metastable behavior among condensed states. The time scales $N^2$ and $N^{1+\alpha}$ are called the pre-metastable and metastable time scales. It is conjectured that this behavior is encapsulated in the level-two large deviation rate function $\mathcal{I}_N$ of the zero-range process. Specifically, it is expected that the $\Gamma$-expansion of $\mathcal{I}_N$ can be expressed as:$$\mathcal{I}_N = \frac{1}{N^2} \mathcal{K} + \frac{1}{N^{1+\alpha}} \mathcal{J},$$ where $\mathcal{K}$ and $\mathcal{J}$ are the level-two large deviation rate functions of the absorbing diffusion processes and the Markov chain on $G$. We rigorously prove this $\Gamma$-expansion by developing a methodology for $\Gamma$-convergence in the pre-metastable time scale and establishing a link between the resolvent approach to metastability (Landim et al., \textit{J Eur Math Soc}, 2023. \texttt{arXiv:2102.00998}) and the $\Gamma$-expansion in the metastable time scale.</description>

      <title>A metaplectic perspective of uncertainty principles in the Linear Canonical Transform domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive Heisenberg uncertainty principles for pairs of Linear Canonical Transforms of a given function, by resorting to the fact that these transforms are just metaplectic operators associated with free symplectic matrices. The results obtained synthesize and generalize previous results found in the literature, because they apply to all signals, in arbitrary dimension and any metaplectic operator (which includes Linear Canonical Transforms as particular cases). Moreover, we also obtain a generalization of the Robertson-Schr\"odinger uncertainty principle for Linear Canonical Transforms. We also propose a new quadratic phase-space distribution, which represents a signal along two intermediate directions in the time-frequency plane. The marginal distributions are always non-negative and permit a simple interpretation in terms of the Radon transform. We also give a geometric interpretation of this quadratic phase-space representation as a Wigner distribution obtained upon Weyl quantization on a non-standard symplectic vector space. Finally, we derive the multidimensional version of the Hardy uncertainty principle for metaplectic operators and the Paley-Wiener theorem for Linear Canonical Transforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model an overdamped Brownian particle that is subject to resetting facilitated by a periodic ratchet potential. This asymmetric potential switches on with a constant rate, but switches off again only upon the particle's first passage to a resetting point at the minimum of the potential. Repeating this cycle sustains a non-equilibrium steady-state, as well as a directed steady-state current which can be harnessed to perform useful work. We derive exact analytic expressions for the probability densities of the free-diffusion and resetting phases, the associated currents for each phase, and an efficiency parameter that quantifies the return in current for given power input. These expressions allow us to fully characterise the system and obtain experimentally relevant results such as the optimal current and efficiency. Our results are corroborated by simulations, and have implications for experimentally viable finite-time resetting protocols.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group and elliptic homogenization in high contrast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a quantitative estimate on the homogenization length scale in terms of the ellipticity ratio $\Lambda/\lambda$ of the coefficient field. This upper bound is applicable to high contrast elliptic equations demonstrating near-critical behavior. Specifically, we show that, given a suitable decay of correlation, the length scale at which homogenization is observed is at most $\exp(C \log^3(1+\Lambda/\lambda))$. The proof introduces the new concept of coarse-grained ellipticity, which measures the effective ellipticity ratio of the equation -- and thus the strength of the disorder -- after integrating out smaller scales. By a direct analytic argument, we obtain an approximate differential inequality for this coarse-grained ellipticity as a function of the length scale. This approach can be interpreted as a rigorous renormalization group argument, and provides a quantitative framework for homogenization that can be iteratively applied across an arbitrary number of length scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain a formal integral solution to the 3+1 D Boltzmann Equation in relaxation time approximation. The gradient series obtained from this integral solution contains exponentially decaying non-hydrodynamic terms. It is shown that this gradient expansion can have a finite radius of convergence under certain assumptions of analyticity. We then argue that, in the relaxation time model, proximity to local thermal equilibrium is not necessary for the system to be described by hydrodynamic equations.</description>

Abstract: Volumes of moduli spaces of hyperbolic cone surfaces were previously defined and computed when the angles of the cone singularities are at most 2pi. We propose a general definition of these volumes without restriction on the angles. This construction is based on flat geometry as our proposed volume is a limit of Masur-Veech volumes of moduli spaces of multi-differentials. This idea generalizes the observation in quantum gravity that the Jackiw-Teitelboim partition function is a limit of minimal string partition functions from Liouville gravity. Finally, we use the properties of these volumes to recover Mirzakhani's recursion formula for Weil-Petersson polynomials. This provides a new proof of Witten-Kontsevich's theorem.</description>

      <title>Topological recursion for Kadomtsev-Petviashvili tau functions of hypergeometric type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.14723v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $n$-point differentials corresponding to Kadomtsev-Petviashvili tau functions of hypergeometric type (also known as Orlov-Scherbin partition functions), with an emphasis on their $\hbar^2$-deformations and expansions. Under the naturally required analytic assumptions, we prove certain higher loop equations that, in particular, contain the standard linear and quadratic loop equations, and thus imply the blobbed topological recursion. We also distinguish two large families of the Orlov-Scherbin partition functions that do satisfy the natural analytic assumptions, and for these families we prove in addition the so-called projection property and thus the full statement of the Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin topological recursion. A particular feature of our argument is that it clarifies completely the role of $\hbar^2$-deformations of the Orlov-Scherbin parameters for the partition functions, whose necessity was known from a variety of earlier obtained results in this direction but never properly understood in the context of topological recursion. As special cases of the results of this paper one recovers new and uniform proofs of the topological recursion to all previously studied cases of enumerative problems related to weighted double Hurwitz numbers. By virtue of topological recursion and the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch formula this, in turn, gives new and uniform proofs of almost all ELSV-type formulas discussed in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An approach to renormalization of scalar fields on the Doplicher-Fredenhagen-Roberts (DFR) quantum spacetime is presented. The effective non-local theory obtained through the use of states of optimal localization for the quantum spacetime is reformulated in the language of (perturbative) Algebraic Quantum Field Theory. The structure of the singularities associated to the non-local kernel that codifies the effects of noncommutativity is analyzed using the tools of microlocal analysis.</description>

      <title>Degenerate conformal blocks for the $W_3$ algebra at c=2 and Specht polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a homogeneous system of $d+8$ linear partial differential equations (PDEs) in $d$ variables arising from two-dimensional Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) with a $W_3$-symmetry algebra. In the CFT context, $d$ PDEs are third order and correspond to the null-state equations, whereas the remaining 8 PDEs (five being second order and three being first order) correspond to the $W_3$ global Ward identities. In the case of central charge $c=2$, we construct a subspace of the space of all solutions which grow no faster than a power law. We call this subspace the space of $W_3$ conformal blocks, and we provide a basis expressed in terms of Specht polynomials associated with column-strict, rectangular Young tableaux with three columns. The dimension of this space is a Kotska number and it coincides with CFT predictions, hence we conjecture that it exhausts the space of all solutions having a power law bound. Moreover, we prove that the space of $W_3$ conformal blocks is an irreducible representation of a certain diagram algebra defined from $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ webs that we call Kuperberg algebra. Finally, we formulate a precise conjecture relating the $W_3$ conformal blocks at $c=2$ to scaling limits of probabilities in the triple dimer model recently studied by Kenyon and Shi. We verify the conjecture for explicit examples up to $d=6$. For more general central charges, we expect that $W_3$ conformal blocks are related to scaling limits of probabilities in lattice models based on $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ webs.</description>

      <title>The Asymptotic Behavior of the Mayer Series Coefficients for a Dimer Gas on a Rectangular Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first 20 Mayer series coefficients for a dimer gas on a rectangular lattice are now known in every dimension, by the work of Butera, Pernici, and the author, [1]. In the present work we initiate a numerical study of a very promising asymptotic form. In a restricted setup we study the following limited precise problem. We note eqs. (A1) and (A2).
  \begin{equation} \label{A1} \tag{A1} b(n) \sim f(n)=\bigg((-1)^{n+1}\bigg)\left(\frac{1}{n}\right) \left(\dfrac{n!}{\left(\left(\frac{n}{2d}\right)!\right)^{2d}}\right)ft(n) \end{equation}
  \begin{equation} \label{A2} \tag{A2} ft(n)=\hat{c} \prod\limits_{k}^{n}\left(c_0+\frac{c_1}{n} +\ldots+ \frac{c_r}{n^{r}}\right) \end{equation}
  For $d \le 20$ and $n \le 20$ we define $\hat{b}(n)$ so that $\hat{b}(n)$ equals $b(n)$ if $n \leq N+1$, and equals $f(n)$ if $ n \geq N - r$. We pick $k=N- r$ and then $\hat{c}$, $c_{0}$. $c_{1}$,...,$c_{r}$ are uniquely determined. $N$ and $r$ must be chosen satisfying $N &lt; 20$ and $N - r &gt; 0$. In fact we work with $N = 10$ and $r \leq 6$ in this note and hope further exploration in many directions will follow. We have not explicitly indicated $d$ dependence of many of the variables. We will see that $\hat{b}(n)$ is a good approximation to $b(n)$, in a sense we will define. Theoretical analysis of these approximations, we envision, will be very difficult. We will indicate the form of theorems we should want to have proved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1211.0529v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geometric and algebraic properties of Gray categories with duals are investigated by means of a diagrammatic calculus. The diagrams are three-dimensional stratifications of a cube, with regions, surfaces, lines and vertices labelled by Gray category data. These can be viewed as a generalisation of ribbon diagrams. The Gray categories present two types of duals, which are extended to functors of strict tricategories with natural isomorphisms, and correspond directly to symmetries of the diagrams. It is shown that these functors can be strictified so that the symmetries of a cube are realised exactly. A new condition on Gray categories with duals called the spatial condition is defined. A class of diagrams for which the evaluation for spatial Gray categories is invariant under homeomorphisms is exhibited. This relation between the geometry of the diagrams and structures in the Gray categories proves useful in computations and has potential applications in topological quantum field theory.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the spectrum of a class of weighted Laplacians on Cayley graphs and determine under what conditions the corresponding eigenspaces are generically irreducible. Specifically, we analyze the spectrum on left-invariant Cayley graphs endowed with an invariant metric, and we give some criteria for generically irreducible eigenspaces. Additionally, we introduce an operator that is comparable to the Laplacian and show that the same criterion holds.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Dualities and Asymptotics of Dynamic Stochastic Higher Spin Vertex Models, using the Drinfeld Twister</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17602v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new, algebraic method to construct duality functions for integrable dynamic models. This method will be implemented on dynamic stochastic higher spin vertex models, where we prove the duality functions are the $ _3 \varphi_2$ functions. A degeneration of these duality functions are orthogonal polynomial dualities of Groenevelt--Wagener arXiv:2306.12318. The method involves using the universal twister of $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, viewed as a quasi--triangular, quasi--$^*$--Hopf algebra. The algebraic method is presented very generally and is expected to produce duality functions for other dynamic integrable models. As an application of the duality, we prove that the asymptotic fluctuations of the dynamic stochastic six vertex model with step initial conditions are governed by the Tracy--Widom distribution.</description>

      <title>Large N instantons from topological strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01104v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $1/N$ expansion of matrix models is asymptotic, and it requires non-perturbative corrections due to large $N$ instantons. Explicit expressions for large $N$ instanton amplitudes are known in the case of Hermitian matrix models with one cut, but not in the multi-cut case. We show that the recent exact results on topological string instanton amplitudes provide the non-perturbative contributions of large $N$ instantons in generic multi-cut, Hermitian matrix models. We present a detailed test in the case of the cubic matrix model by considering the asymptotics of its $1/N$ expansion, which we obtain at relatively high genus for a generic two-cut background. These results can be extended to certain non-conventional matrix models which admit a topological string theory description. As an application, we determine the large $N$ instanton corrections for the free energy of ABJM theory on the three-sphere, which correspond to D-brane instanton corrections in superstring theory. We also illustrate the applications of topological string instantons in a more mathematical setting by considering orbifold Gromov-Witten invariants. By focusing on the example of $\mathbb{C}^3/\mathbb{Z}_3$, we show that they grow doubly-factorially with the genus and we obtain and test explicit asymptotic formulae for them.</description>

      <title>Gaussian deconvolution and the lace expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give conditions on a real-valued function $F$ on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, for $d&gt;2$, which ensure that the solution $G$ to the convolution equation $(F*G)(x) = \delta_{0,x}$ has Gaussian decay $|x|^{-(d-2)}$ for large $|x|$. Precursors of our results were obtained in the 2000s, using intricate Fourier analysis. In 2022, a very simple deconvolution theorem was proved, but its applicability was limited. We extend the 2022 theorem to remove its limitations while maintaining its simplicity -- our main tools are H\"older's inequality and basic Fourier theory in $L^p$ space. Our motivation comes from critical phenomena in equilibrium statistical mechanics, where the convolution equation is provided by the lace expansion and the deconvolution $G$ is a critical two-point function. Our results significantly simplify existing proofs of critical $|x|^{-(d-2)}$ decay in high dimensions for self-avoiding walk, Ising and $\varphi^4$ models, percolation, and lattice trees and lattice animals. We also improve previous error estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new proof of $|x|^{-(d-2)}$ decay of critical two-point functions for spread-out statistical mechanical models on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ above the upper critical dimension, based on the lace expansion and assuming appropriate diagrammatic estimates. Applications include spread-out models of the Ising model and self-avoiding walk in dimensions $d&gt;4$, and spread-out percolation for $d&gt;6$. The proof is based on an extension of the new Gaussian deconvolution theorem we obtained in a recent paper. It provides a technically simpler and conceptually more transparent approach than the method of Hara, van der Hofstad and Slade (2003).</description>

      <title>Invisibility of the integers for the discrete Gaussian chain via a Caffarelli-Silvestre extension of the discrete fractional Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Discrete Gaussian Chain is a model of interfaces $\Psi : \mathbf{Z} \to \mathbf{Z}$ governed by the Hamiltonian $$ H(\Psi)= \sum_{i\neq j} J_\alpha(|i-j|) |\Psi_i -\Psi_j|^2 $$ with long-range coupling constants $J_\alpha(k)\asymp k^{-\alpha}$. For any $\alpha\in [2,3)$ and at high enough temperature, we prove an invariance principle for such an $\alpha$-Discrete Gaussian Chain towards a $H(\alpha)$-fractional Gaussian process where the Hurst index $H$ satisfies $H=H(\alpha)=\frac {\alpha-2} 2$. This result goes beyond a conjecture by Fr\"ohlich and Zegarlinski [FZ91] which conjectured fluctuations of order $n^{\tfrac 1 2 (\alpha-2) \wedge 1}$ for the Discrete Gaussian Chain.
  More surprisingly, as opposed to the case of the $2D$ Discrete Gaussian $\Psi : \mathbf{Z}^2 \to \mathbf{Z}$, we prove that the integers do not affect the {\em effective temperature} of the discrete Gaussian Chain at large scales. Such an {\em invisibility of the integers} had been predicted by Slurink and Hilhorst in the special case $\alpha_c=2$ in [SH83]. We also identify a similar invisibility of integers when a $2D$ Gaussian Free Field at high temperature is conditioned to take integer values on a dilute enough "fractal subset" of $\mathbf{Z}^2$.
  Our proof relies on four main ingredients:
  (1) A Caffareli-Silvestre extension for the discrete fractional Laplacian (which may be of independent interest)
  (2) A localisation of the chain in a smoother sub-domain
  (3) A Coulomb gas-type expansion in the spirit of Fr\"ohlich-Spencer [FS82]
  (4) Controlling the amount of Dirichlet Energy supported by a $1D$ band for the Green functions of $\mathbf{Z}^2$ Bessel-type random walks
  Finally, we also analyse the (easier) regime $\alpha\in(1,2) \cup (3,\infty)$ as well as the $2D$ Discrete Gaussian with long-range coupling constants (for any $\alpha&gt;\alpha_c=4$).</description>

Abstract: The Ozawa's Intersubjectivity Theorem (OIT) proved within quantum measurement theory supports the new postulate of relational quantum mechanics (RQM), the postulate on internally consistent descriptions. We remark that this postulate was proposed only recently to resolve the problem of intersubjectivity of information in RQM. In contrast to RQM for which OIT is a supporting theoretical statement, QBism is challenged by OIT.</description>

      <title>On the linear stability of nonrelativistic selfinteracting boson stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the linear stability of selfinteracting boson stars in the nonrelativistic limit of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon theory. For this purpose, based on a combination of analytic and numerical methods, we determine the behavior of general linear perturbations around the stationary and spherically symmetric solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson system. In particular, we conclude that ground state configurations are linearly stable if the selfinteraction is repulsive, whereas there exist a state of maximum mass that divides the stable and the unstable branches in case the selfinteraction is attractive. Regarding the excited states, they are in general unstable under generic perturbations, although we identify a stability band in the first excited states of the repulsive theory. This result is independent of the mass of the scalar field and the details of the selfinteraction potential, and it is in contrast to the situation of vanishing selfinteraction, in which excited states are always unstable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We carry out the homogenization of a fluid-structure interaction problem consisting in the periodic inclusions of a viscous fluid in an elastic body. We get a macrostructure model where the body behaves as a viscoelastic material with a long-range memory term. Our aim is not only to get this limit problem but also to study its main properties. Using the micro-structure variables it is simple to check that it satisfies an energy conservation law assuring in particular the existence and uniqueness of solution. The difficulty is to characterize these properties using only the macroscopic system. We prove that the nonlocal term is given through a convolution kernel which exponentially decreases to zero and satisfies some positive conditions which we write in terms of the Laplace transform. These conditions can be used to directly prove the existence and uniqueness of solution. The results apply to modeling the mechanical behavior of skin as an indicator of what kind of models we should use. In a naive interpretation the fluid inclusions represent the cells and the elastic medium the extracellular matrix.</description>

      <title>Minimal Elements of the Causal Boundary with Applications to Spacetime Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1972, Geroch, Kronheimer, and Penrose introduced what is now called the causal boundary of a spacetime. This boundary is constructed out of Terminal Indecomposable Past sets (TIPs) and their future analogues (TIFs), which are the pasts and futures of inextendible causal curves. The causal boundary is a key tool to understand the global structure of a spacetime. In this paper, we show that in a spacetime with compact Cauchy surfaces, there is always at least one minimal TIP and one minimal TIF, minimal meaning that it does not contain another TIP (resp.\ TIF) as a proper subset. We then study the implications of the minimal TIP and TIF meeting each other. This condition generalizes some of the "no observer horizon" conditions that have been used in the literature to obtain partial solutions of the Bartnik splitting conjecture. We also show that such a no observer horizons condition is satisfied when the spacetime has a (possibly discrete) timelike conformal symmetry, generalizing a result of Costa e Silva, Flores, and Herrera about conformal Killing vector fields.</description>

Abstract: Hagedorn functions are carefully constructed generalizations of Hermite functions to the setting of many-dimensional squeezed and coupled harmonic systems. Wavepackets formed by superpositions of Hagedorn functions have been successfully used to solve the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation exactly in harmonic systems and variationally in anharmonic systems. For evaluating typical observables, such as position or kinetic energy, it is sufficient to consider orthonormal Hagedorn functions with a single Gaussian center. Here, we instead derive various relations between Hagedorn bases associated with different Gaussians, including their overlaps, which are necessary for evaluating quantities nonlocal in time, such as time correlation functions needed for computing spectra. First, we use the Bogoliubov transformation to obtain commutation relations between the ladder operators associated with different Gaussians. Then, instead of using numerical quadrature, we employ these commutation relations to derive exact recurrence relations for the overlap integrals between Hagedorn functions with different Gaussian centers. Finally, we present numerical experiments that demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our algebraic method as well as its suitability to treat problems in spectroscopy and chemical dynamics.</description>
