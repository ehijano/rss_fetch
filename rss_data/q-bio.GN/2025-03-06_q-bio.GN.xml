      <title>Enabling Fast, Accurate, and Efficient Real-Time Genome Analysis via New Algorithms and Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has revolutionized genome analysis by enabling the rapid and cost-effective sequencing of large genomes. Despite these advancements, the increasing complexity and volume of genomic data present significant challenges related to accuracy, scalability, and computational efficiency. These challenges are mainly due to various forms of unwanted and unhandled variations in sequencing data, collectively referred to as noise. In this dissertation, we address these challenges by providing a deep understanding of different types of noise in genomic data and developing techniques to mitigate the impact of noise on genome analysis.
  First, we introduce BLEND, a noise-tolerant hashing mechanism that quickly identifies both exactly matching and highly similar sequences with arbitrary differences using a single lookup of their hash values. Second, to enable scalable and accurate analysis of noisy raw nanopore signals, we propose RawHash, a novel mechanism that effectively reduces noise in raw nanopore signals and enables accurate, real-time analysis by proposing the first hash-based similarity search technique for raw nanopore signals. Third, we extend the capabilities of RawHash with RawHash2, an improved mechanism that 1) provides a better understanding of noise in raw nanopore signals to reduce it more effectively and 2) improves the robustness of mapping decisions. Fourth, we explore the broader implications and new applications of raw nanopore signal analysis by introducing Rawsamble, the first mechanism for all-vs-all overlapping of raw signals using hash-based search. Rawsamble enables the construction of de novo assemblies directly from raw signals without basecalling, which opens up new directions and uses for raw nanopore signal analysis.</description>

      <title>RNA-FrameFlow: Flow Matching for de novo 3D RNA Backbone Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce RNA-FrameFlow, the first generative model for 3D RNA backbone design. We build upon SE(3) flow matching for protein backbone generation and establish protocols for data preparation and evaluation to address unique challenges posed by RNA modeling. We formulate RNA structures as a set of rigid-body frames and associated loss functions which account for larger, more conformationally flexible RNA backbones (13 atoms per nucleotide) vs. proteins (4 atoms per residue). Toward tackling the lack of diversity in 3D RNA datasets, we explore training with structural clustering and cropping augmentations. Additionally, we define a suite of evaluation metrics to measure whether the generated RNA structures are globally self-consistent (via inverse folding followed by forward folding) and locally recover RNA-specific structural descriptors. The most performant version of RNA-FrameFlow generates locally realistic RNA backbones of 40-150 nucleotides, over 40% of which pass our validity criteria as measured by a self-consistency TM-score &gt;= 0.45, at which two RNAs have the same global fold.
