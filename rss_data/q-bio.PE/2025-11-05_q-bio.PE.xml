      <title>The impact of nonheritable variation in division rates on population growth across environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse a series of bacterial growth models with in-built inter-individual variation in rates of cell division. We show that this variation leads to reduced population growth in favorable regimes and reduced population killing in detrimental environments. By treating environmental stress as a model parameter, we then show that the reduction in population growth aggravates with stress. We apply these models to data on growth rates for populations of green algae {\em Clamydomonas reinhardtii}. Specifically, we compare growth rates of two ancestral strains and respective mutation accumulation lines, measured along a stress gradient. The data had previously shown mutants growing consistently slower than ancestors, and this effect aggravating with stress. Here we show that this trend is expected if mutants are more variable than ancestors in individual rates of cell division, even if their means are higher. This can open new prospects for prediction of how populations respond to environmental changes.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Models and Estimation of Undetected Infections in the Transmission of Zika Virus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zika fever, a mosquito-borne viral disease with potential severe neurological complications and birth defects, remains a significant public health concern. The epidemiological models often oversimplify the dynamics of Zika transmission by assuming immediate detection of all infected cases. This study provides an enhanced SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model to incorporate partial information by distinguishing between detected and undetected Zika infections (also known as "dark figures"). By distinguishing the compartments, the model captures the complexities of disease spread by accounting for uncertainties about transmission and the number of undetected infections. This model implements the Kalman filter technique to estimate the hidden states from the observed states. Numerical simulations were performed to understand the dynamics of Zika transmission and real-world data was utilized for parameterization and validation of the model. The study aims to provide information on the impact of undetected Zika infections on disease spread within the population, which will contribute to evidence-based decision making in public health policy and practice.</description>

      <title>Epidemic Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infectious disease outbreaks have precipitated a profusion of mathematical models. We introduce a unifying concept of "epidemic momentum" -- prevalence weighted by the capacity to infect in the future -- and use it to reveal a common underlying geometry that corresponds to contours of a generic first integral. Exploiting this conserved quantity, we show that it is possible to (i) disentangle the basic reproduction number $R_0$ from the population proportion that was immune before a disease invasion or re-emergence and (ii) infer both from observed data. This separation enables us to revise the classical estimate of the epidemic final size, incorporating prior population immunity. To illustrate the utility of these insights, we present a novel reappraisal of the main wave of the 1918 influenza pandemic.</description>

      <title>From the RNA world to land plants: Evolutionary insights from tRNA genes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are universal adaptors of the genetic code, yet their evolutionary dynamics across photosynthetic eukaryotes remain underexplored. Here, we present the largest comparative re-analysis integrating the PlantRNA database with published data to explore tRNA gene evolution. We find that tRNA gene repertoires have been deeply shaped by ecological transitions, genome architecture, and translational demands. Terrestrialization marks a major shift in tRNA evolution, characterized by the loss of selenoproteins and their dedicated selenocysteine tRNAs in land plants compared to algae. Patterns of intron prevalence, position, and structure diverged among lineages, with extensive intron loss occurring around the origin of land plants. Organellar genomes exhibit divergent trajectories: mitochondrial tRNA sets are highly labile due to recurrent gene losses, imports, and horizontal transfers, whereas plastid repertoires are comparatively stable with lineage-specific exceptions. In parallel, angiosperm nuclear tRNA genes exhibit reinforced cis-regulatory elements, consistent with increased and developmentally complex translational demands, and their copy number correlates tightly with codon usage and amino acid composition. Finally, conserved yet family-biased clustering of nuclear tRNA genes reveals contrasting organizational principles in plants versus metazoans. Together, these findings establish tRNA gene evolution as a major determinant of translational capacity and a key driver of photosynthetic diversification.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior for a general class of spreading models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing literatures on epidemic and rumor dynamics show that infection and information coevolve. We present a unified framework for modeling the spread of infection and information: a general class of interaction-driven fluid-limit models expressed as coupled ODEs. The class includes the SIR epidemic model, the Daley-Kendall rumor model, and many extensions. For this general class, we derive theoretical results: under explicit graph-theoretic conditions, we obtain a classification of asymptotic behavior and motivate a conjecture of exponential decay for vanishing states. When these conditions are violated, the classification can fail, and decay may become non-exponential (e.g., algebraic). In deriving the main result, we establish asymptotic stability and $L^1$-integrability properties for state variables. Alongside these results, we introduce the dependency graph that captures outflow dependencies and offers a new angle on the structure of this model class. Finally, we illustrate the results with several examples, including a heterogeneous rumor model and a rumor-dependent SIR model, showing how small changes to the dependency graph can flip asymptotic behavior and reshape epidemic trajectories.</description>

      <title>Optimization of sequential therapies to maximize extinction of resistant bacteria through collateral sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01808v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) threatens global health. A promising and underexplored strategy to tackle this problem are sequential therapies exploiting collateral sensitivity (CS), whereby resistance to one drug increases sensitivity to another. Here, we develop a four-genotype stochastic birth-death model with two bacteriostatic antibiotics to identify switching periods that maximize bacterial extinction under subinhibitory concentrations. We show that extinction probability depends nonlinearly on switching period, with stepwise increases aligned to discrete switch events: fast sequential therapies are suboptimal as they do not allow for the evolution of resistance, a key ingredient in these therapies. A geometric distribution framework accurately predicts cumulative extinction probabilities, where the per-switch extinction probability rises with switching period. We further derive a heuristic approximation for the extinction probability based on times to fixation of single-resistant mutants. Sensitivity analyses reveal that strong reciprocal CS is required for this strategy to work, and we explore how increasing antibiotic doses and higher mutation rates modulate extinction in a nonmonotonic manner. Finally, we discuss how longer therapies maximize extinction but also cause higher resistance, leading to a Pareto front of optimal switching periods. Our results provide quantitative design principles for in vitro and clinical sequential antibiotic therapies, underscoring the potential of CS-guided regimens to suppress resistance evolution and eradicate infections.</description>
