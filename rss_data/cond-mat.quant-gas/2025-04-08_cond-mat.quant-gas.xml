      <title>The effects of elastic and inelastic collisions in two- and three-body interactions on the stability of 3D Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the stability of three-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates of finite temperatures at which both elastic and inelastic collisions are taken into account. The modeled governing Gross-Pitaevski equation reveals inclusion of both real and imaginary components in the nonlinear terms. We find the stability region for a wide range of two- and three-body interaction terms with the inclusion of both gain and loss effects by using the Jacobian matrix. We investigate the stability of the system for possible different state of those cases. The stability properties of three-dimensional condensates are strongly altered by tuning the gain rate of their elastic collisions. These strong losses impose severe limitations for using Feshbach resonances. We finally sustain our semi analytical findings with the results of inclusive numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium Dynamics and Universality of 4D Quantum Vortices and Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of quantum vortices provides critical insights into non-equilibrium dynamics across diverse physical systems. While previous research has focused on point-like vortices in two dimensions(2D) and line-like vortices in three dimensions(3D), quantum vortices in four spatial dimensions(4D) are expected to take the form of extended vortex surfaces, thereby fundamentally enriching dynamics. Here, we conduct a comprehensive numerical study of 4D quantum vortices and turbulence. Using a special visualization scheme, we discovered the decay of topological numbers that does not exist in low dimensions, as well as the high-dimensional counterpart of the vortex reconnection process. We further explore quench dynamics across phase transitions in four dimensions and verify the applicability of the higher-dimensional Kibble-Zurek mechanism, including both slow and fast quenches. Our simulations provide numerical evidence of quantum turbulence in four dimensions, characterized by universal power-law behavior: vortex decay scaling as $t^{-1}$, an energy spectrum consistent with the classical Kolmogorov law $k^{-5/3}$, and a velocity distribution exhibiting a distinct $v^{-3}$ tail. These findings reveal universal principles governing topological defects in higher dimensions, broadening our understanding of quantum physics in high-dimensional spaces and offering insights for future experimental realizations using synthetic dimensions.</description>

      <title>Stability of spin dynamics in a driven non-Hermitian double well</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of spin dynamics for a spin-orbit (SO) coupled boson held in a driven non-Hermitian double-well potential. It is surprising to find that when the ratio of the Zeeman field strength to the driving frequency is even, the SO coupling strength can take any value, and suitable parameters can be found to stabilize the quantum spin dynamics of the system. However, when the ratio of the Zeeman field strength to the driving frequency is odd, the SO coupling strength can only take integer or half-integer values for the spin dynamics of the system to possibly be stable.</description>

      <title>Frustrated Rydberg Atom Arrays Meet Cavity-QED: Emergence of the Superradiant Clock Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atom triangular arrays in an optical cavity serve as an ideal platform for understanding the interplay between geometric frustration and quantized photons. Using a large-scale quantum Monte Carlo method, we obtain a rich ground state phase diagram. Around half-filling, the infinite long-range light-matter interaction lifts the ground state degeneracy, resulting in a novel order-coexisted superradiant clock (SRC) phase that completely destroys the fragile order-by-disorder (OBD) phase observed in classical light fields. According to the Ginzburg-Landau theory, this replacement may result from the competition between threefold and sixfold clock terms. Similar to the spin supersolid, the clear first-order phase transition at the $Z_2$ symmetry line is attributed to the nonzero photon density, which couples to the threefold clock term. Finally, we discuss the low-energy physics in the dimer language and propose that cavity-mediated nonlocal ring exchange interactions may play a critical role in the rich physics induced by the attachment of cavity-QED. Our work opens a new arena of research on the emergent phenomena of quantum phase transitions in many-body quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Nontrivial saddle points for spectral form factors of flat band superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the spectral form factor of a flat band superconductor in two different ways. In the first approach, we diagonalize the Hamiltonian of this system exactly and numerically sum over the exact eigenstates to find the spectral form factor. In the second approach, we use mean field theory to evaluate the same spectral form factor. We demonstrate that both methods produce the same answer. Mean field theory for spectral form factors possesses features not previously seen in the theory of superconductivity, in particular complex gap functions and non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonians. We explicitly show that these features are indeed necessary to obtain the correct spectral form factor.</description>

      <title>Observation of non-Hermitian bulk-boundary correspondence in non-chiral non-unitary quantum dynamics of single photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The breakdown of conventional bulk-boundary correspondence, a cornerstone of topological physics, is one of counter-intuitive phenomena in non-Hermitian systems, that is deeply rooted in symmetry. In particular, preserved chiral symmetry is one of the key ingredients, which plays a pivotal role in determining non-Hermitian topology. Nevertheless, chiral symmetry breaking in non-Hermitian systems disrupts topological protection, modifies topological invariants, and substantially reshapes spectral and edge-state behavior. The corresponding fundamentally important bulk-boundary correspondence thus needs to be drastically reconstructed. However, it has so far eluded experimental efforts. Here, we theoretically predict and experimentally demonstrate the bulk-boundary correspondence of a one-dimensional (1D) non-Hermitian system with chiral symmetry breaking in discrete-time non-chiral non-unitary quantum walks of single photons. Through constructing a domain-wall configuration, we experimentally observe the photon localization at the interface of domain-wall structure, clearly indicating the presence of the topological edge mode. The appearance of that matches excellently with the prediction of our introduced non-chiral non-Bloch topological invariants pair. Our work thus unequivocally builds the non-Hermitian bulk-boundary correspondence as a general principle for studying topological physics in non-Hermitian systems with chiral symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Controlled bit-flip of period-doubling and discrete time crystalline states in open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the robustness of a bit-flip operation against thermal and quantum noise for bits represented by the symmetry-broken pairs of the period-doubled (PD) states in a classical parametric oscillator and discrete time crystal (DTC) states in a fully-connected open spin-cavity system, respectively. The bit-flip operation corresponds to switching between the two PD and DTC states induced by a defect in a periodic drive, introduced in a controlled manner by linearly ramping the phase of the modulation of the drive. In the absence of stochastic noise, strong dissipation results in a more robust bit-flip operation in which slight changes to the defect parameters do not significantly lower the success rate of bit-flips. The operation remains robust even in the presence of stochastic noise when the defect duration is sufficiently large. The fluctuations also enhance the success rate of the bit-flip below the critical defect duration needed to induce a switch. By considering parameter regimes in which the DTC states in the spin-cavity system do not directly map to the PD states, we reveal that this robustness is due to the system being quenched by the defect towards a new phase that has enough excitation to suppress the effects of the stochastic noise. This allows for precise control of the bit-flip operations by tuning into the preferred intermediate state that the system will enter during a bit-flip operation. We demonstrate this in a modified protocol based on precise quenches of the driving frequency.</description>

      <title>Measuring R\'enyi entropy using a projected Loschmidt echo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present efficient and practical protocols to measure the second R\'enyi entropy (RE), whose exponential is known as the purity. We achieve this by establishing a direct connection to a Loschmidt echo (LE) type measurement sequence, applicable to quantum many-body systems. Notably, our approach does not rely on random-noise averaging, a feature that can be extended to protocols to measure out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs), as we demonstrate. By way of example, we show that our protocols can be practically implemented in superconducting qubit-based platforms, as well as in cavity-QED trapped ultra-cold gases.</description>

      <title>Self-organized cavity bosons beyond the adiabatic elimination approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The long-time behavior of weakly interacting bosons moving in a two-dimensional optical lattice and coupled to a lossy cavity is investigated numerically via the truncated Wigner method, which allows us to take into full account the dynamics of the cavity mode, quantum fluctuations, cavity-boson correlations, and self-organization of individual runs. We first compare our results for small systems with quasi-exact calculations based on quantum trajectories, finding a remarkably good agreement for experimentally relevant boson fillings that improves further with system size. For large systems, we observe metastability at very long times and superfluid quasi-long range order, in sharp contrast with the true long range order found in the ground state of the approximate Bose-Hubbard model with extended interactions, obtained by adiabatically eliminating the cavity field. As the strength of the light-matter coupling increases, the system first becomes supersolid at the Dicke superradiant transition and then turns into a charge-density wave via the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless mechanism. The two phase transitions are characterized via an accurate finite-size scaling analysis.</description>

      <title>Fate of Two-Particle Bound States in the Continuum in non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We unveil the existence of two-particle bound state in the continuum (BIC) in a one-dimensional interacting nonreciprocal lattice with a generalized boundary condition. By applying the Bethe-ansatz method, we can exactly solve the wavefunction and eigenvalue of the bound state in the continuum band, which enable us to precisely determine the phase diagrams of BIC. Our results demonstrate that the non-reciprocal hopping can delocalize the bound state and thus shrink the region of BIC. By analyzing the wavefunction, we identify the existence of two types of BICs with different spatial distributions and analytically derive the corresponding threshold values for the breakdown of BICs. The BIC with similar properties is also found to exist in another system with an impurity potential.</description>

      <title>Exact spectral properties of Fermi polarons in one-dimensional lattices: Anomalous Fermi singularities and polaron quasiparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the exact spectral function of a single impurity repulsively interacting with a bath of fermions in one-dimensional lattices, by deriving the explicit expression of the form factor for both regular Bethe states and the irregular spin-flip state and $\eta$-pairing state, based on the exactly solvable Lieb-Wu model. While at low impurity momentum $Q\sim0$ the spectral function is dominated by two power-law Fermi singularities, at large momentum we observe that the two singularities develop into two-sided distributions and eventually become anomalous Fermi singularities at the boundary of the Brillouin zone (i.e., $Q=\pm\pi$), with the power-law tails extending towards low energy. Near the quarter filling of the Fermi bath, we also find two broad polaron peaks at large impurity momentum, collectively contributed by many excited many-body states with non-negligible form factors. Our exact results of those distinct features in one-dimensional Fermi polarons, which have no correspondences in two and three dimensions, could be readily probed in cold-atom laboratories by trapping highly imbalanced two-component fermionic atoms into one-dimensional optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stage of modulational instability in repulsive two-component Bose-Einstein condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17083v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modulational instability (MI) is a fundamental phenomenon in the study of nonlinear dynamics, spanning diverse areas such as shallow water waves, optics, and ultracold atomic gases. In particular, the nonlinear stage of MI has recently been a topic of intense exploration, and has been shown to manifest, in many cases, in the generation of dispersive shock waves (DSWs). In this work, we experimentally probe the MI dynamics in an immiscible two-component ultracold atomic gas with exclusively repulsive interactions, catalyzed by a hard-wall-like boundary produced by a repulsive optical barrier. We analytically describe the expansion rate of the DSWs in this system, generalized to arbitrary inter-component interaction strengths and species ratios. We observe excellent agreement among the analytical results, an effective 1D numerical model, full 3D numerical simulations, and experimental data. Additionally, we extend this scenario to the interaction between two counterpropagating DSWs, which leads to the production of Peregrine soliton structures. These results further demonstrate the versatility of atomic platforms towards the controlled realization of DSWs and rogue waves.</description>

      <title>Soliton resuscitations: asymmetric revivals of the breathing mode of an atomic bright soliton in a harmonic trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the collective modes of an atomic bright soliton realised in a quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate, using Bogoliubov-de Gennes theory. In particular we focus on the breathing mode of the soliton, which is not a single linearized normal mode but a common component of many modes, and therefore decays within a $t^{-1/2}$ envelope due to dispersion. If the soliton is held in the center of a harmonic trap, we show that the breathing amplitude revives periodically, as atoms shed from the vibrating soliton oscillate in the trap, and return. After each revival the breathing amplitude again decays, and this cycle repeats every trap half-period. The amplitude envelope of these breathing revivals shows a curious asymmetry, however, with a gradual increase in breathing followed by sudden drop in breathing amplitude that becomes more and more pronounced in later revivals. We explain this asymmetrical revival pattern by deriving a close analytical approximation to the Bogoliubov-de Gennes frequency spectrum, and offer this coherent Bogoliubov-de Gennes phenomenon as a background against which to compare possible quantum many-body effects, including decoherence over trap-period time scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report direct measurement of the dispersion relation of polaritons in GaAs/AlGaAs microcavity structures at room temperature, which clearly shows that the polaritons are in the strong coupling limit. The Rabi splitting of the polariton states decreases as the polariton gas increases in density, but even when the polariton gas becomes a coherent, Bose-condensate-like state, the polaritons retain a strong exciton component, as seen in the nonlinear energy shift of the light emission. This opens up the possibility of polaritonic devices at room temperature in a material system which can be grown with very high quality and uniformity.</description>

      <title>The Moving Born-Oppenheimer Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a mixed quantum-classical framework, dubbed the Moving Born-Oppenheimer Approximation (MBOA), to describe the dynamics of slow degrees of freedom (DOFs) coupled to fast ones. As in the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation (BOA), the fast degrees of freedom adiabatically follow a state that depends on the slow ones. Unlike the BOA, this state depends on both the positions and the momenta of the slow DOFs. We study several model systems: a spin-1/2 particle and a spinful molecule moving in a spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field, and a gas of fast particles coupled to a piston. The MBOA reveals rich dynamics for the slow degree of freedom, including reflection, dynamical trapping, and mass renormalization. It also significantly modifies the state of the fast DOFs. For example, the spins in the molecule are entangled and squeezed, while the gas of fast particles develops gradients that are synchronized with the motion of the piston for a long time. The MBOA can be used to describe both classical and quantum systems and has potential applications in molecular dynamics, state preparation, and quantum sensing.</description>
