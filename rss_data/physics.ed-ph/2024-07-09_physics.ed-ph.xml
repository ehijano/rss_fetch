      <title>Exploring the Educational Landscape of AI: Large Language Models' Approaches to Explaining Conservation of Momentum in Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in education offers both opportunities and challenges, particularly in fields like physics that demand precise conceptual understanding. This study examines the capabilities of six state-of-the-art LLMs in explaining the law of conservation of momentum, a fundamental principle in physics. By analyzing responses to a consistent, simple prompt in Japanese, we assess the models' explanatory approaches, depth of understanding, and adaptability to different educational levels.Our comprehensive analysis, encompassing text characteristics, response similarity, and keyword usage, unveils significant diversity in explanatory styles across models. ChatGPT4.0 and Coral provided more comprehensive and technically detailed explanations, while Gemini models tended toward more intuitive approaches. Key findings include variations in the treatment of critical concepts such as net force, and differing emphases on mathematical rigor and real-world applications.The results indicate that different AI models may be more suitable for various educational contexts, ranging from introductory to advanced levels. ChatGPT4.0 and Coral demonstrated potential for advanced discussions, while Gemini models appeared more appropriate for introductory explanations. Importantly, the study underscores the necessity of educator guidance in effectively leveraging these AI tools, as models varied in their ability to convey nuanced aspects of physical principles.This research establishes a foundation for understanding the educational potential of LLMs in physics, providing insights for educators on integrating these tools into their teaching practices. It also highlights the need for further investigation into AI-assisted learning in STEM fields, paving the way for more sophisticated applications of AI in physics education.</description>

      <title>Design of a multisensory planetarium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design and the prototype of a multisensory planetarium. The goal of this project is to offer a common perceptual and cognitive framework to all users, both sighted, deaf, and blind or visually impaired, concerning the experience of observing the night sky, but also to provide all equal access to scientific data regarding the observed objects, going beyond what can be sensed. The planetarium will consist of a Plexiglas hemisphere on which stars up to the fourth magnitude are represented by a brass bar that, when touched, activates visual, haptic, and acoustic stimuli. We mapped the magnitude of stars on acoustic and visual stimuli, while the distance of the star from us is mapped on a vibration. All the stimuli have been evaluated in pilot experiments using Plexiglas tablets representing some constellations, to assess their usability, intelligibility, and consistency with possible intuitive interpretations.</description>

      <title>Prevalence of a growth mindset among introductory astronomy students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While many previous studies have indicated that encouraging a growth mindset can improve student learning outcomes, this conclusion's applicability to college-level astronomy classrooms remains poorly understood owing to the variation in students' overall and domain-specific learning attitudes. To address this, we surveyed undergraduate students in an introductory astronomy class about their attitudes towards learning astronomy over the course of five semesters. Overall, students felt an affinity for astronomy, felt moderately competent, perceived astronomy to be intermediate in terms of difficulty, and agreed strongly with standard statements reflecting a "growth mindset," i.e., the belief that intelligence is malleable rather than fixed from birth. Their responses were stable over the course of the semester and did not appear to depend strongly on student demographics. The unexpected start of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated shift to all-virtual learning correlated with a drop in their affinity for astronomy, a small decrease in their perceived competence, and an increase in the perceived difficulty of the topic. Their overall learning mindset showed negligible change during this time, emphasizing the stability of their belief in a growth mindset as compared to other measured learning attitudes. However, more nuanced questions about their behaviors and interpretations in the classroom, about how they felt "in the moment", and about what factors were most important for their success in the class revealed significantly lower alignment with a growth mindset. This suggests that while introductory astronomy students may believe that they have a growth mindset, this mindset is not necessarily reflected in their self-reported classroom behaviors or measured responses to actual learning challenges.</description>
