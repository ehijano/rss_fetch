      <title>Analysis of thermochemical non-equilibrium hypersonic flow over a waverider with uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The objective of this work is to assess the impact of parameter uncertainty on hypersonic aerothermal surface heating predictions in Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations using non-intrusive uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques. RANS-based models are considered indispensable tools in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis for the iterative and cost-effective exploration of innovative design concepts. However, these RANS models heavily rely on empirical constants that often require tuning due to the lack of physical knowledge and complexity of the problem, introducing significant uncertainties that hinder their predictive capabilities. Therefore, this research investigates the influence of the turbulent Prandtl number uncertainty, that governs the level of shear stress and heat flux present in the turbulent flow, on key output quantities of interest (QoIs). The US3D hypersonics solver is employed to simulate aeroheating over a hypersonic waverider configuration using the classical Menter Shear Stress Transport (SST) turbulence model. A polynomial chaos expansion (PEC) framework is presented that enables a global sensitivity analysis and forward propagation of uncertainty for a range of turbulent prandtl number, generating statistics including skewness and kurtosis of the QoIs. In addition, Sobol indices are calculated to quantify the relative contribution of the turbulent prandtl number to the overall uncertainty in the heat flux and surface pressure outputs. The results provide valuable insights into the underlying aeroheating behavior in RANS simulations under hypersonic non-equilibrium flow conditions over a waverider previously studied at the Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC) facility. These findings will inform future design processes and improve the reliability of RANS-based predictions in hypersonic applications.</description>

      <title>Identifying Extreme Events in the Stock Market: A Topological Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper employs Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to detect extreme events (EEs) in the stock market at a continental level. Previous approaches, which analyzed stock indices separately, could not detect EEs for multiple time series in one go. TDA provides a robust framework for such analysis and identifies the EEs during the crashes for different indices. The TDA analysis shows that $L^1$, $L^2$ norms and Wasserstein distance ($W_D$) of the world leading indices rise abruptly during the crashes, surpassing a threshold of $\mu+4*\sigma$ where $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the mean and the standard deviation of norm or $W_D$, respectively. Our study identified the stock index crashes of the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic across continents as EEs. Given that different sectors in an index behave differently, a sector-wise analysis was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic for the Indian stock market. The sector-wise results show that after the occurrence of EE, we have observed strong crashes surpassing $\mu+2*\sigma$ for an extended period for the banking sector. While for the pharmaceutical sector, no significant spikes were noted. Hence, TDA also proves successful in identifying the duration of shocks after the occurrence of EEs. This also indicates that the Banking sector continued to face stress and remained volatile even after the crash. This study gives us the applicability of TDA as a powerful analytical tool to study EEs in various fields.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference with Deep Weakly Nonlinear Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show at a physics level of rigor that Bayesian inference with a fully connected neural network and a shaped nonlinearity of the form $\phi(t) = t + \psi t^3/L$ is (perturbatively) solvable in the regime where the number of training datapoints $P$ , the input dimension $N_0$, the network layer widths $N$, and the network depth $L$ are simultaneously large. Our results hold with weak assumptions on the data; the main constraint is that $P &lt; N_0$. We provide techniques to compute the model evidence and posterior to arbitrary order in $1/N$ and at arbitrary temperature. We report the following results from the first-order computation:
  1. When the width $N$ is much larger than the depth $L$ and training set size $P$, neural network Bayesian inference coincides with Bayesian inference using a kernel. The value of $\psi$ determines the curvature of a sphere, hyperbola, or plane into which the training data is implicitly embedded under the feature map.
  2. When $LP/N$ is a small constant, neural network Bayesian inference departs from the kernel regime. At zero temperature, neural network Bayesian inference is equivalent to Bayesian inference using a data-dependent kernel, and $LP/N$ serves as an effective depth that controls the extent of feature learning.
  3. In the restricted case of deep linear networks ($\psi=0$) and noisy data, we show a simple data model for which evidence and generalization error are optimal at zero temperature. As $LP/N$ increases, both evidence and generalization further improve, demonstrating the benefit of depth in benign overfitting.</description>

      <title>Digital Signal Processing Techniques for Noise Characterization of Lasers and Optical Frequency Combs: A Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Performing noise characterizations of lasers and optical frequency combs on sampled and digitized data offers numerous advantages compared to analog measurement techniques. One of the main advantages is that the measurement setup is greatly simplified. Only a balanced detector followed by an analog-to-digital converter is needed, allowing all the complexity to be moved to the digital domain. Secondly, near-optimal phase estimators are efficiently implementable, providing accurate phase noise estimation in the presence of the measurement noise. Finally, joint processing of multiple comb lines is feasible, enabling computation of phase noise correlation matrix, which includes all information about the phase noise of the optical frequency comb. This tutorial introduces a framework based on digital signal processing for phase noise characterization of lasers and optical frequency combs. The framework is based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and automatic differentiation. The EKF is a near-optimal estimator of the optical phase in the presence of measurement noise, making it very suitable for phase noise measurements. Automatic differentiation is key to efficiently optimizing many parameters entering the EKF framework. More specifically, the combination of EKF and automatic differentiation enables the efficient optimization of phase noise measurement for optical frequency combs with arbitrarily complex noise dynamics that may include many free parameters. We show the framework's efficacy through simulations and experimental data, showcasing its application across various comb types and in dual-comb measurements, highlighting its accuracy and versatility. Finally, we discuss its capability for digital phase noise compensation, which is highly relevant to free-running dual-comb spectroscopy applications.</description>

      <title>Learning to solve Bayesian inverse problems: An amortized variational inference approach using Gaussian and Flow guides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.20004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.20004v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems, i.e., estimating parameters of physical models from experimental data, are ubiquitous in science and engineering. The Bayesian formulation is the gold standard because it alleviates ill-posedness issues and quantifies epistemic uncertainty. Since analytical posteriors are not typically available, one resorts to Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling or approximate variational inference. However, inference needs to be rerun from scratch for each new set of data. This drawback limits the applicability of the Bayesian formulation to real-time settings, e.g., health monitoring of engineered systems, and medical diagnosis. The objective of this paper is to develop a methodology that enables real-time inference by learning the Bayesian inverse map, i.e., the map from data to posteriors. Our approach is as follows. We parameterize the posterior distribution as a function of data. This work outlines two distinct approaches to do this. The first method involves parameterizing the posterior using an amortized full-rank Gaussian guide, implemented through neural networks. The second method utilizes a Conditional Normalizing Flow guide, employing conditional invertible neural networks for cases where the target posterior is arbitrarily complex. In both approaches, we learn the network parameters by amortized variational inference which involves maximizing the expectation of evidence lower bound over all possible datasets compatible with the model. We demonstrate our approach by solving a set of benchmark problems from science and engineering. Our results show that the posterior estimates of our approach are in agreement with the corresponding ground truth obtained by Markov chain Monte Carlo. Once trained, our approach provides the posterior distribution for a given observation just at the cost of a forward pass of the neural network.</description>
