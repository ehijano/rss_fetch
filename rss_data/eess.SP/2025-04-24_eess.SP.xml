      <title>Automotive Radar Multi-Frame Track-Before-Detect Algorithm Considering Self-Positioning Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for the joint detection and tracking of weak targets in automotive radars using the multi-frame track-before-detect (MF-TBD) procedure. Generally, target tracking in automotive radars is challenging due to radar field of view (FOV) misalignment, nonlinear coordinate conversion, and self-positioning errors of the ego-vehicle, which are caused by platform motion. These issues significantly hinder the implementation of MF-TBD in automotive radars. To address these challenges, a new MF-TBD detection architecture is first proposed. It can adaptively adjust the detection threshold value based on the existence of moving targets within the radar FOV. Since the implementation of MF-TBD necessitates the inclusion of position, velocity, and yaw angle information of the ego-vehicle, each with varying degrees of measurement error, we further propose a multi-frame energy integration strategy for moving-platform radar and accurately derive the target energy integration path functions. The self-positioning errors of the ego-vehicle, which are usually not considered in some previous target tracking approaches, are well addressed. Numerical simulations and experimental results with real radar data demonstrate large detection and tracking gains over standard automotive radar processing in weak target environments.</description>

      <title>DualAttWaveNet: Multiscale Attention Networks for Satellite Interference Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The escalating overlap between non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) and geostationary orbit (GSO) satellite frequency allocations necessitates accurate interference detection methods that address two pivotal technical gaps: computationally efficient signal analysis for real-time operation, and robust anomaly discrimination under varying interference patterns. Existing deep learning approaches employ encoder-decoder anomaly detectors that threshold input-output discrepancies for robustness. While the transformer-based TrID model achieves state-of-the-art performance (AUC: 0.8318, F1: 0.8321), its multi-head attention incurs prohibitive computation time, and its decoupled training of time-frequency models overlooks cross-domain dependencies. To overcome these problems, we propose DualAttWaveNet. A bidirectional attention fusion layer dynamically correlates time-domain samples using parameter-efficient cross-attention routing. A wavelet-regularized reconstruction loss enforces multi-scale consistency. We train the model on public dataset which consists of 48 hours of satellite signals. Experiments show that compared to TrID, DualAttWaveNet improves AUC by 12% and reduces inference time by 50% to 540ms per batch while maintaining F1-score.</description>

      <title>CKMDiff: A Generative Diffusion Model for CKM Construction via Inverse Problems with Learned Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) is a promising technology to enable environment-aware wireless communications and sensing with greatly enhanced performance, by offering location-specific channel prior information for future wireless networks. One fundamental problem for CKM-enabled wireless systems lies in how to construct high-quality and complete CKM for all locations of interest, based on only limited and noisy on-site channel knowledge data. This problem resembles the long-standing ill-posed inverse problem, which tries to infer from a set of limited and noisy observations the cause factors that produced them. By utilizing the recent advances of solving inverse problems with learned priors using generative artificial intelligence (AI), we propose CKMDiff, a conditional diffusion model that can be applied to perform various tasks for CKM constructions such as denoising, inpainting, and super-resolution, without having to know the physical environment maps or transceiver locations. Furthermore, we propose an environment-aware data augmentation mechanism to enhance the model's ability to learn implicit relations between electromagnetic propagation patterns and spatial-geometric features. Extensive numerical results are provided based on the CKMImageNet and RadioMapSeer datasets, which demonstrate that the proposed CKMDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming various benchmark methods.</description>

      <title>Introducing Combined Effects of Filtering and ASE Noise in Optical Links Supposing Different Equalization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analytical framework for evaluating filtering penalties in ASE-noise-limited coherent optical links. The model accounts for the cumulative effects of cascaded optical filters, amplifier-induced ASE noise, and transceiver noise, alongside digital equalization at the receiver. By developing a generalized channel representation, we derive closed-form expressions for signal-to-noise ratio degradation under various equalization strategies, including Zero-Forcing Equalizer, Minimum Mean Square Error Equalizer, and Fractionally Spaced Equalizer. These models capture the impact of colored noise resulting from linear filtering and provide both time and frequency-domain insights. The proposed framework is validated through experimental comparisons using accurately modeled optical filters, demonstrating close agreement between theory and practice and offering a robust foundation for system-level performance evaluation in metro-access networks.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted Noncoherent Wireless System: Error Analysis with Optimal Receiver and Multi-level ASK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided wireless communication system where the transmitter employs one-sided amplitude-shift keying (ASK) for data modulation and the receiver employs an optimal noncoherent maximum-likelihood rule for symbol detection. A novel statistical analysis is presented to approximate the weighted sum of a central and a non-central chi-squared random variable, which is used to derive a novel closed-form expression for the symbol error probability (SEP) of the noncoherent system. Furthermore, an optimization problem to minimize the system's SEP under transmission energy constraint is proposed, and novel algorithms are presented to obtain the optimal ASK constellation minimizing the SEP. Numerical results indicate that the noncoherent system achieves superior error performance and higher diversity order with the optimal ASK constellation compared to the traditional equispaced ASK constellation. Further, the optimal ASK significantly differs from the traditional one, with the difference becoming significant with an increase in the average signal-to-noise ratio and at a lower number of RIS's reflecting elements.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Hybrid Precoding Optimization Approaches for Millimeter Wave Massive MIMO System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conventional digital beamforming technique needs one radio frequency (RF) chain per antenna element. High power consumption, significantly high cost of RF chain components per antenna and complex signal processing task at base band makes digital beamforming unsuitable for implementation in massive MIMO system. Hybrid beamforming takes the benefits of both analog and digital beamforming schemes. Near optimal performance can be achieved using very few RF chains in hybrid beamforming method. By optimizing the hybrid transmit and receive beamformers, the spectral efficiency of a system can be maximized. The hybrid beamforming optimization problem is non-convex optimization problem due to the non-convexity of the constraints. In this research work, the millimeter wave massive MIMO system performance implementing the hybrid precoding based on the conventional methods and deep neural network is studied considering the spectral efficiency, bit error rate and complexity. It is shown that the deep neural network based approach for hybrid precoding optimization outperforms conventional techniques by solving the non-convex optimization problem. Moreover, the DNN model accuracy is also analyzed by observing the training accuracy and test accuracy.</description>

      <title>Semi-Blind Strategies for MMSE Channel Estimation Utilizing Generative Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates semi-blind channel estimation for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. To this end, we first estimate a subspace based on all received symbols (pilot and payload) to provide additional information for subsequent channel estimation. We show how this additional information enhances minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimation. Two variants of the linear MMSE (LMMSE) estimator are formulated, where the first one solves the estimation within the subspace, and the second one uses a subspace projection as a preprocessing step. Theoretical derivations show the superior estimation performance of the latter method in terms of mean square error for uncorrelated Rayleigh fading. Subsequently, we introduce parameterizations of this semi-blind LMMSE estimator based on two different conditional Gaussian latent models, i.e., the Gaussian mixture model and the variational autoencoder. Both models learn the underlying channel distribution of the propagation environment based on training data and serve as generative priors for semi-blind channel estimation. Extensive simulations for real-world measurement data and spatial channel models show the superior performance of the proposed methods compared to state-of-the-art semi-blind channel estimators with respect to the MSE.</description>

      <title>UNILoc: Unified Localization Combining Model-Based Geometry and Unsupervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate mobile device localization is critical for emerging 5G/6G applications such as autonomous vehicles and augmented reality. In this paper, we propose a unified localization method that integrates model-based and machine learning (ML)-based methods to reap their respective advantages by exploiting available map information. In order to avoid supervised learning, we generate training labels automatically via optimal transport (OT) by fusing geometric estimates with building layouts. Ray-tracing based simulations are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves positioning accuracy for both line-of-sight (LoS) users (compared to ML-based methods) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) users (compared to model-based methods). Remarkably, the unified method is able to achieve competitive overall performance with the fully-supervised fingerprinting, while eliminating the need for cumbersome labeled data measurement and collection.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised EEG-based decoding of absolute auditory attention with canonical correlation analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a fully unsupervised algorithm that detects from encephalography (EEG) recordings when a subject actively listens to sound, versus when the sound is ignored. This problem is known as absolute auditory attention decoding (aAAD). We propose an unsupervised discriminative CCA model for feature extraction and combine it with an unsupervised classifier called minimally informed linear discriminant analysis (MILDA) for aAAD classification. Remarkably, the proposed unsupervised algorithm performs significantly better than a state-of-the-art supervised model. A key reason is that the unsupervised algorithm can successfully adapt to the non-stationary test data at a low computational cost. This opens the door to the analysis of the auditory attention of a subject using EEG signals with a model that automatically tunes itself to the subject without requiring an arduous supervised training session beforehand.</description>

      <title>On the feasibility of laser satellite communications from the Martian surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free space optical (FSO) communication using lasers is a rapidly developing field in telecommunications that can offer advantages over traditional radio frequency technology. For example, optical laser links may allow transmissions at far higher data rates, require less operating power and smaller systems and have a smaller risk of interception. In recent years, FSO laser links have been demonstrated, tested or integrated in a range of environments and scenarios. These include FSO links for terrestrial communication, between ground stations and cube-sats in low Earth orbit, between ground and satellite in lunar orbit, as part of scientific or commercial space relay networks, and deep space communications beyond the moon. The possibility of FSO links from and to the surface of Mars could be a natural extension of these developments. In this paper we evaluate some effects of the Martian atmosphere on the propagation of optical communication links, with an emphasis on the impact of dust on the total link budget. We use the output of the Mars Climate Database to generate maps of the dust optical depth for a standard Mars climatology, as well as for a warm (dusty) atmosphere. These dust optical depths are then extrapolated to a wavelength of 1.55 um, and translated into total slant path optical depths to calculate link budgets and availability statistics for a link between the surface and a satellite in a sun-synchronous orbit. The outcomes of this study are relevant to potential future missions to Mars that may require laser communications to or from its surface. For example, the results could be used to constrain the design of communication terminals suitable to the Mars environment, or to assess the link performance as a function of ground station location.</description>

Abstract: The rapid growth of unlabeled time-series data in domains such as wireless communications, radar, biomedical engineering, and the Internet of Things (IoT) has driven advancements in unsupervised learning. This review synthesizes recent progress in applying autoencoders and vision transformers for unsupervised signal analysis, focusing on their architectures, applications, and emerging trends. We explore how these models enable feature extraction, anomaly detection, and classification across diverse signal types, including electrocardiograms, radar waveforms, and IoT sensor data. The review highlights the strengths of hybrid architectures and self-supervised learning, while identifying challenges in interpretability, scalability, and domain generalization. By bridging methodological innovations and practical applications, this work offers a roadmap for developing robust, adaptive models for signal intelligence.</description>

      <title>The Riemannian Means Field Classifier for EEG-Based BCI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A substantial amount of research has demonstrated the robustness and accuracy of the Riemannian minimum distance to mean (MDM) classifier for all kinds of EEG-based brain--computer interfaces (BCIs). This classifier is simple, fully deterministic, robust to noise, computationally efficient, and prone to transfer learning. Its training is very simple, requiring just the computation of a geometric mean of a symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrix per class. We propose an improvement of the MDM involving a number of power means of SPD matrices instead of the sole geometric mean. By the analysis of 20 public databases, 10 for the motor-imagery BCI paradigm and 10 for the P300 BCI paradigm, comprising 587 individuals in total, we show that the proposed classifier clearly outperforms the MDM, approaching the state-of-the art in terms of performance while retaining the simplicity and the deterministic behavior. In order to promote reproducible research, our code will be released as open source.</description>

      <title>Coding for Computation: Efficient Compression of Neural Networks for Reconfigurable Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As state of the art neural networks (NNs) continue to grow in size, their resource-efficient implementation becomes ever more important. In this paper, we introduce a compression scheme that reduces the number of computations required for NN inference on reconfigurable hardware such as FPGAs. This is achieved by combining pruning via regularized training, weight sharing and linear computation coding (LCC). Contrary to common NN compression techniques, where the objective is to reduce the memory used for storing the weights of the NNs, our approach is optimized to reduce the number of additions required for inference in a hardware-friendly manner. The proposed scheme achieves competitive performance for simple multilayer perceptrons, as well as for large scale deep NNs such as ResNet-34.</description>

      <title>Disaggregated Deep Learning via In-Physics Computing at Radio Frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern edge devices, such as cameras, drones, and Internet-of-Things nodes, rely on deep learning to enable a wide range of intelligent applications, including object recognition, environment perception, and autonomous navigation. However, deploying deep learning models directly on the often resource-constrained edge devices demands significant memory footprints and computational power for real-time inference using traditional digital computing architectures. In this paper, we present WISE, a novel computing architecture for wireless edge networks designed to overcome energy constraints in deep learning inference. WISE achieves this goal through two key innovations: disaggregated model access via wireless broadcasting and in-physics computation of general complex-valued matrix-vector multiplications directly at radio frequency. Using a software-defined radio platform with wirelessly broadcast model weights over the air, we demonstrate that WISE achieves 95.7% image classification accuracy with ultra-low operation power of 6.0 fJ/MAC per client, corresponding to a computation efficiency of 165.8 TOPS/W. This approach enables energy-efficient deep learning inference on wirelessly connected edge devices, achieving more than two orders of magnitude improvement in efficiency compared to traditional digital computing.</description>

      <title>Generalized Scattering Matrix of Antenna: Moment Solution, Compression Storage and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08904v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a computation method of generalized scattering matrix (GSM) based on integral equations and the method of moments (MoM), specifically designed for antennas excited through waveguide ports. By leveraging two distinct formulations -- magnetic-type and electric-type integral equations -- we establish concise algebraic relations linking the GSM directly to the impedance matrices obtained from MoM. To address practical challenges in storing GSM data across wide frequency bands and multiple antenna scenarios, we propose a efficient compression scheme. This approach alleviates memory demands by selectively storing the dominant eigencomponents that govern scattering behavior. Numerical validation examples confirm the accuracy of our method by comparisons with full-wave simulation results. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient iterative procedure to predict antenna array performance, highlighting remarkable improvements in computational speed compared to conventional numerical methods. These results collectively demonstrate the GSM framework's strong potential for antenna-array design processes.</description>

      <title>ROMA: ROtary and Movable Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rotary and movable antenna (ROMA) architecture represents a next-generation multi-antenna technology that enables flexible adjustment of antenna position and array rotation angles of the transceiver. In this letter, we propose a ROMA-aided multi-user MIMO communication system to fully enhance the efficiency and reliability of system transmissions. By deploying ROMA panels at both the transmitter and receiver sides, and jointly optimizing the three-dimensional (3D) rotation angles of each ROMA panel and the relative positions of antenna elements based on the spatial distribution of users and channel state information (CSI), we can achieve the objective of maximizing the average spectral efficiency (SE). Subsequently, we conduct a detailed analysis of the average SE performance of the system under the consideration of maximum ratio (MR) precoding. Due to the non-convexity of the optimization problem in the ROMA multi-user MIMO system, we propose an efficient solution based on an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the AO-based ROMA architecture can significantly improve the average SE. Furthermore, the performance improvement becomes more pronounced as the size of the movable region and the transmission power increase.</description>

      <title>Artifact detection and localization in single-channel mobile EEG for sleep research using deep learning and attention mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artifacts in the electroencephalogram (EEG) degrade signal quality and impact the analysis of brain activity. Current methods for detecting artifacts in sleep EEG rely on simple threshold-based algorithms that require manual intervention, which is time-consuming and impractical due to the vast volume of data that novel mobile recording systems generate. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) model incorporating a convolutional block attention module (CNN-CBAM) to detect and identify the location of artifacts in the sleep EEG with attention maps. We benchmarked this model against six other machine learning and signal processing approaches. We trained/tuned all models on 72 manually annotated EEG recordings obtained during home-based monitoring from 18 healthy participants with a mean (SD) age of 68.05 y ($\pm$5.02). We tested them on 26 separate recordings from 6 healthy participants with a mean (SD) age of 68.33 y ($\pm$4.08), with contained artifacts in 4\% of epochs. CNN-CBAM achieved the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.88), sensitivity (0.81), and specificity (0.86) when compared to the other approaches. The attention maps from CNN-CBAM localized artifacts within the epoch with a sensitivity of 0.71 and specificity of 0.67. This work demonstrates the feasibility of automating the detection and localization of artifacts in wearable sleep EEG.</description>

      <title>SeizureFormer: A Transformer Model for IEA-Based Seizure Risk Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present SeizureFormer, a Transformer-based model for long-term seizure risk forecasting using interictal epileptiform activity (IEA) surrogate biomarkers and long episode (LE) biomarkers from responsive neurostimulation (RNS) systems. Unlike raw scalp EEG-based models, SeizureFormer leverages structured, clinically relevant features and integrates CNN-based patch embedding, multi-head self-attention, and squeeze-and-excitation blocks to model both short-term dynamics and long-term seizure cycles. Tested across five patients and multiple prediction windows (1 to 14 days), SeizureFormer achieved state-of-the-art performance with mean ROC AUC of 79.44 percent and mean PR AUC of 76.29 percent. Compared to statistical, machine learning, and deep learning baselines, it demonstrates enhanced generalizability and seizure risk forecasting performance under class imbalance. This work supports future clinical integration of interpretable and robust seizure forecasting tools for personalized epilepsy management.</description>

      <title>QoS-based Beamforming and Compression Design for Cooperative Cellular Networks via Lagrangian Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the quality-of-service (QoS)-based joint beamforming and compression design problem in the downlink cooperative cellular network, where multiple relay-like base stations (BSs), connected to the central processor via rate-limited fronthaul links, cooperatively transmit messages to the users. The problem of interest is formulated as the minimization of the total transmit power of the BSs, subject to all users' signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints and all BSs' fronthaul rate constraints. In this paper, we first show that there is no duality gap between the considered joint optimization problem and its Lagrangian dual by showing the tightness of its semidefinite relaxation (SDR). Then, we propose an efficient algorithm based on the above duality result for solving the considered problem. The proposed algorithm judiciously exploits the special structure of an enhanced Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the considered problem and finds the solution that satisfies the enhanced KKT conditions via two fixed point iterations. Two key features of the proposed algorithm are: (1) it is able to detect whether the considered problem is feasible or not and find its globally optimal solution when it is feasible; (2) it is highly efficient because both of the fixed point iterations in the proposed algorithm are linearly convergent and evaluating the functions in the fixed point iterations are computationally cheap. Numerical results show the global optimality and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Towards Scalable Multi-Chip Wireless Networks with Near-Field Time Reversal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of Wireless Network-on-Chip (WNoC) has emerged as a potential solution to address the escalating communication demands of modern computing systems due to its low-latency, versatility, and reconfigurability. However, for WNoC to fulfill its potential, it is essential to establish multiple high-speed wireless links across chips. Unfortunately, the compact and enclosed nature of computing packages introduces significant challenges in the form of Co-Channel Interference and Inter-Symbol Interference, which not only hinder the deployment of multiple spatial channels but also severely restrict the symbol rate of each individual channel. In this paper, we posit that Time Reversal (TR) could be effective in addressing both impairments in this static scenario thanks to its spatiotemporal focusing capabilities even in the near field. Through comprehensive full-wave simulations and bit error rate analysis in multiple scenarios and at multiple frequency bands, we provide evidence that TR can increase the symbol rate by an order of magnitude, enabling the deployment of multiple concurrent links and achieving aggregate speeds exceeding 100 Gb/s. Finally, we evaluate the impact of reducing the sampling rate of the TR filter on the achievable speeds, paving the way to practical TR-based wireless communications at the chip scale.</description>

      <title>Discrete Cosine Transform Based Decorrelated Attention for Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13901v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Central to the Transformer architectures' effectiveness is the self-attention mechanism, a function that maps queries, keys, and values into a high-dimensional vector space. However, training the attention weights of queries, keys, and values is non-trivial from a state of random initialization. In this paper, we propose two methods. (i) We first address the initialization problem of Vision Transformers by introducing a simple, yet highly innovative, initialization approach utilizing discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients. Our proposed DCT-based \textit{attention} initialization marks a significant gain compared to traditional initialization strategies; offering a robust foundation for the attention mechanism. Our experiments reveal that the DCT-based initialization enhances the accuracy of Vision Transformers in classification tasks. (ii) We also recognize that since DCT effectively decorrelates image information in the frequency domain, this decorrelation is useful for compression because it allows the quantization step to discard many of the higher-frequency components. Based on this observation, we propose a novel DCT-based compression technique for the attention function of Vision Transformers. Since high-frequency DCT coefficients usually correspond to noise, we truncate the high-frequency DCT components of the input patches. Our DCT-based compression reduces the size of weight matrices for queries, keys, and values. While maintaining the same level of accuracy, our DCT compressed Swin Transformers obtain a considerable decrease in the computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Consistent Nonparametric Linkage-Based Clustering of Data Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13922v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider nonparametric clustering of $M$ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data sequences generated from {\em unknown} distributions. The distributions of the $M$ data sequences belong to $K$ underlying distribution clusters. Existing results on exponentially consistent nonparametric clustering algorithms, like single linkage-based (SLINK) clustering and $k$-medoids distribution clustering, assume that the maximum intra-cluster distance ($d_L$) is smaller than the minimum inter-cluster distance ($d_H$). First, in the fixed sample size (FSS) setting, we show that exponential consistency can be achieved for SLINK clustering under a less strict assumption, $d_I &lt; d_H$, where $d_I$ is the maximum distance between any two sub-clusters of a cluster that partition the cluster. Note that $d_I &lt; d_L$ in general. Thus, our results show that SLINK is exponentially consistent for a larger class of problems than previously known. In our simulations, we also identify examples where $k$-medoids clustering is unable to find the true clusters, but SLINK is exponentially consistent. Then, we propose a sequential clustering algorithm, named SLINK-SEQ, based on SLINK and prove that it is also exponentially consistent. Simulation results show that the SLINK-SEQ algorithm requires fewer expected number of samples than the FSS SLINK algorithm for the same probability of error.</description>

      <title>Passive Channel Charting: Locating Passive Targets using Wi-Fi Channel State Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose passive channel charting, an extension of channel charting to passive target localization. As in conventional channel charting, we follow a dimensionality reduction approach to reconstruct a physically interpretable map of target positions from similarities in high-dimensional channel state information. We show that algorithms and neural network architectures developed in the context of channel charting with active mobile transmitters can be straightforwardly applied to the passive case, where we assume a scenario with static transmitters and receivers and a mobile target. We evaluate our method on a channel state information dataset collected indoors with a distributed setup of ESPARGOS Wi-Fi sensing antenna arrays. This scenario can be interpreted as either a multi-static or passive radar system. We demonstrate that passive channel charting outperforms a baseline based on classical triangulation in terms of localization accuracy. We discuss our results and highlight some unsolved issues related to the proposed concept.</description>

      <title>One-Point Sampling for Distributed Bandit Convex Optimization with Time-Varying Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the distributed bandit convex optimization problem with time-varying constraints. In this problem, the global loss function is the average of all the local convex loss functions, which are unknown beforehand. Each agent iteratively makes its own decision subject to time-varying inequality constraints which can be violated but are fulfilled in the long run. For a uniformly jointly strongly connected time-varying directed graph, a distributed bandit online primal-dual projection algorithm with one-point sampling is proposed. We show that sublinear dynamic network regret and network cumulative constraint violation are achieved if the path-length of the benchmark also increases in a sublinear manner. In addition, an $\mathcal{O}({T^{3/4 + g}})$ static network regret bound and an $\mathcal{O}( {{T^{1 - {g}/2}}} )$ network cumulative constraint violation bound are established, where $T$ is the total number of iterations and $g \in ( {0,1/4} )$ is a trade-off parameter. Moreover, a reduced static network regret bound $\mathcal{O}( {{T^{2/3 + 4g /3}}} )$ is established for strongly convex local loss functions. Finally, a numerical example is presented to validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Evaluation of Indoor LoRaWAN Environment-Aware Propagation for 6G: MLR, ANOVA, and Residual Distribution Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling path loss in indoor LoRaWAN technology deployments is inherently challenging due to structural obstructions, occupant density and activities, and fluctuating environmental conditions. This study proposes a two-stage approach to capture and analyze these complexities using an extensive dataset of 1,328,334 field measurements collected over six months in a single-floor office at the University of Siegen's Hoelderlinstrasse Campus, Germany. First, we implement a multiple linear regression model that includes traditional propagation metrics (distance, structural walls) and an extension with proposed environmental variables (relative humidity, temperature, carbon dioxide, particulate matter, and barometric pressure). Using analysis of variance, we demonstrate that adding these environmental factors can reduce unexplained variance by 42.32 percent. Secondly, we examine residual distributions by fitting five candidate probability distributions: Normal, Skew-Normal, Cauchy, Student's t, and Gaussian Mixture Models with one to five components. Our results show that a four-component Gaussian Mixture Model captures the residual heterogeneity of indoor signal propagation most accurately, significantly outperforming single-distribution approaches. Given the push toward ultra-reliable, context-aware communications in 6G networks, our analysis shows that environment-aware modeling can substantially improve LoRaWAN network design in dynamic indoor IoT deployments.</description>
