      <title>Dynamic Locality Sensitive Orderings in Doubling Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In their pioneering work, Chan, Har-Peled, and Jones (SICOMP 2020) introduced locality-sensitive ordering (LSO), and constructed an LSO with a constant number of orderings for point sets in the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space. Furthermore, their LSO could be made dynamic effortlessly under point insertions and deletions, taking $O(\log{n})$ time per update by exploiting Euclidean geometry. Their LSO provides a powerful primitive to solve a host of geometric problems in both dynamic and static settings. Filtser and Le (STOC 2022) constructed the first LSO with a constant number of orderings in the more general setting of doubling metrics. However, their algorithm is inherently static since it relies on several sophisticated constructions in intermediate steps, none of which is known to have a dynamic version. Making their LSO dynamic would recover the full generality of LSO and provide a general tool to dynamize a vast number of static constructions in doubling metrics.
  In this work, we give a dynamic algorithm that has $O(\log{n})$ time per update to construct an LSO in doubling metrics under point insertions and deletions. We introduce a toolkit of several new data structures: a pairwise tree cover, a net tree cover, and a leaf tracker. A key technical is stabilizing the dynamic net tree of Cole and Gottlieb (STOC 2006), a central dynamic data structure in doubling metrics. Specifically, we show that every update to the dynamic net tree can be decomposed into a few simple updates to trees in the net tree cover. As stability is the key to any dynamic algorithm, our technique could be useful for other problems in doubling metrics.
  We obtain several algorithmic applications from our dynamic LSO. The most notably is the first dynamic algorithm for maintaining an $k$-fault tolerant spanner in doubling metrics with optimal sparsity in optimal $O(\log{n})$ time per update.</description>

      <title>Channel allocation revisited through 1-extendability of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the classical problem of channel allocation for Wi-Fi access points (AP). Using mechanisms such as the CSMA/CA protocol, Wi-Fi access points which are in conflict within a same channel are still able to communicate to terminals. In graph theoretical terms, it means that it is not mandatory for the channel allocation to correspond to a proper coloring of the conflict graph. However, recent studies suggest that the structure -- rather than the number -- of conflicts plays a crucial role in the performance of each AP. More precisely, the graph induced by each channel must satisfy the so-called $1$-extendability property, which requires each vertex to be contained in an independent set of maximum cardinality. In this paper we introduce the 1-extendable chromatic number, which is the minimum size of a partition of the vertex set of a graph such that each part induces a 1-extendable graph. We study this parameter and the related optimization problem through different perspectives: algorithms and complexity, structure, and extremal properties. We first show how to compute this number using modular decompositions of graphs, and analyze the running time with respect to the modular width of the input graph. We also focus on the special case of cographs, and prove that the 1-extendable chromatic number can be computed in quasi-polynomial time in this class. Concerning extremal results, we show that the 1-extendable chromatic number of a graph with $n$ vertices is at most $2\sqrt{n}$, whereas the classical chromatic number can be as large as $n$. We are also able to construct graphs whose 1-extendable chromatic number is at least logarithmic in the number of vertices.</description>

      <title>New weighted additive spanners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ahmed, Bodwin, Sahneh, Kobourov, and Spence (WG 2020) introduced additive spanners for weighted graphs and constructed (i) a $+2W_{\max}$ spanner with $O(n^{3/2})$ edges and (ii) a $+4W_{\max}$ spanner with $\tilde{O}(n^{7/5})$ edges, and (iii) a $+8W_{\max}$ spanner with $O(n^{4/3})$ edges, for any weighted graph with $n$ vertices. Here $W_{\max} = \max_{e\in E}w(e)$ is the maximum edge weight in the graph. Their results for $+2W_{\max}$, $+4W_{\max}$, and $+8W_{\max}$ match the state-of-the-art bounds for the unweighted counterparts where $W_{\max} = 1$. They left open the question of constructing a $+6W_{\max}$ spanner with $O(n^{4/3})$ edges. Elkin, Gitlitz, and Neiman (DISC 2021) made significant progress on this problem by showing that there exists a $+(6+\epsilon)W_{\max}$ spanner with $O(n^{4/3}/\epsilon)$ edges for any fixed constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$. Indeed, their result is stronger as the additive stretch is local: the stretch for any pair $u,v$ is $+(6+\epsilon)W_{uv}$ where $W_{uv}$ is the maximum weight edge on the shortest path from $u$ to $v$.
  In this work, we resolve the problem posted by Ahmed et al. (WG 2020) up to a poly-logarithmic factor in the number of edges: We construct a $+6W_{\max}$ spanner with $\tilde{O}(n^{4/3})$ edges. We extend the construction for $+6$-spanners of Woodruff (ICALP 2010), and our main contribution is an analysis tailoring to the weighted setting. The stretch of our spanner could also be made local, in the sense of Elkin, Gitlitz, and Neiman (DISC 2021). We also study the fast constructions of additive spanners with $+6W_{\max}$ and $+4W_{\max}$ stretches. We obtain, among other things, an algorithm for constructing a $+(6+\epsilon)W_{\max}$ spanner of $\tilde{O}(\frac{n^{4/3}}{\epsilon})$ edges in $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ time.</description>

      <title>On Controlling Knockout Tournaments Without Perfect Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last decade, extensive research has been conducted on the algorithmic aspects of designing single-elimination (SE) tournaments. Addressing natural questions of algorithmic tractability, we identify key properties of input instances that enable the tournament designer to efficiently schedule the tournament in a way that maximizes the chances of a preferred player winning. Much of the prior algorithmic work on this topic focuses on the perfect (complete and deterministic) information scenario, especially in the context of fixed-parameter algorithm design. Our contributions constitute the first fixed-parameter tractability results applicable to more general settings of SE tournament design with potential imperfect information.</description>

      <title>Faster Cycle Detection in the Congested Clique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a fast distributed algorithm for detecting $h$-cycles in the \textsf{Congested Clique} model, whose running time decreases as the number of $h$-cycles in the graph increases. In undirected graphs, constant-round algorithms are known for cycles of even length. Our algorithm greatly improves upon the state of the art for odd values of $h$. Moreover, our running time applies also to directed graphs, in which case the improvement is for all values of $h$. Further, our techniques allow us to obtain a triangle detection algorithm in the quantum variant of this model, which is faster than prior work.
  A key technical contribution we develop to obtain our fast cycle detection algorithm is a new algorithm for computing the product of many pairs of small matrices in parallel, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On the parameterized complexity of computing good edge-labelings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A good edge-labeling (gel for short) of a graph $G$ is a function $\lambda: E(G) \to \mathbb{R}$ such that, for any ordered pair of vertices $(x, y)$ of $G$, there do not exist two distinct increasing paths from $x$ to $y$, where ``increasing'' means that the sequence of labels is non-decreasing. This notion was introduced by Bermond et al. [Theor. Comput. Sci. 2013] motivated by practical applications arising from routing and wavelength assignment problems in optical networks. Prompted by the lack of algorithmic results about the problem of deciding whether an input graph admits a gel, called GEL, we initiate its study from the viewpoint of parameterized complexity. We first introduce the natural version of GEL where one wants to use at most $c$ distinct labels, which we call $c$-GEL, and we prove that it is NP-complete for every $c \geq 2$ on very restricted instances. We then provide several positive results, starting with simple polynomial kernels for GEL and $c$-\GEL parameterized by neighborhood diversity or vertex cover. As one of our main technical contributions, we present an FPT algorithm for GEL parameterized by the size of a modulator to a forest of stars, based on a novel approach via a 2-SAT formulation which we believe to be of independent interest. We also present FPT algorithms based on dynamic programming for $c$-GEL parameterized by treewidth and $c$, and for GEL parameterized by treewidth and the maximum degree. Finally, we answer positively a question of Bermond et al. [Theor. Comput. Sci. 2013] by proving the NP-completeness of a problem strongly related to GEL, namely that of deciding whether an input graph admits a so-called UPP-orientation.</description>

      <title>Continuous Optimization for Decoding Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Error-correcting codes are one of the most fundamental objects in pseudorandomness, with applications in communication, complexity theory, and beyond. Codes are useful because of their ability to support decoding, which is the task of recovering a codeword from its noisy copy. List decoding is a relaxation where the decoder is allowed to output a list of codewords, and has seen tremendous progress over the last 25 years. In this thesis, we prove new algorithmic and combinatorial results about list decoding.
  We describe a list decoding framework that reduces the task of efficient decoding to proving distance in certain restricted proof systems. We then instantiate this framework for Tanner codes of Sipser and Spielman [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 1996] and Alon-Edmonds-Luby (AEL) distance amplification [FOCS 1995] of unique decodable base codes to get the first polynomial time list decoding algorithms for these codes. We also show extensions to the quantum version of AEL distance amplification to get polynomial-time list decodable quantum LDPC codes.
  We next give an alternate viewpoint of the above framework based on abstract regularity lemmas. We show how to efficiently implement the regularity lemma for the case of Ta-Shma's explicit codes near the Gilbert-Varshamov bound [STOC 2017]. This leads to a near-linear time algorithm for unique decoding of Ta-Shma's code.
  We also give new combinatorial results that improve known list sizes beyond the Johnson bound. Firstly, we adapt the AEL amplification to construct a new family of explicit codes that can be combinatorially list decoded to the optimal error correction radius. This is the first example of such a code that does not use significant algebraic ingredients. Secondly, we present list size improvements for Folded Reed-Solomon codes, improving the state of the art list size for explicit list decoding capacity achieving codes.</description>

      <title>Fully-Dynamic All-Pairs Shortest Paths: Likely Optimal Worst-Case Update Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02662v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) problem is one of the fundamental problems in theoretical computer science. It asks to compute the distance matrix of a given $n$-vertex graph. We revisit the classical problem of maintaining the distance matrix under a fully dynamic setting undergoing vertex insertions and deletions with a fast worst-case running time and efficient space usage.
  Although an algorithm with amortized update-time $\tilde O(n ^ 2)$ has been known for nearly two decades [Demetrescu and Italiano, STOC 2003], the current best algorithm for worst-case running time with efficient space usage runs is due to [Gutenberg and Wulff-Nilsen, SODA 2020], which improves the space usage of the previous algorithm due to [Abraham, Chechik, and Krinninger, SODA 2017] to $\tilde O(n ^ 2)$ but fails to improve their running time of $\tilde O(n ^ {2 + 2 / 3})$. It has been conjectured that no algorithm in $O(n ^ {2.5 - \epsilon})$ worst-case update time exists. For graphs without negative cycles, we meet this conjectured lower bound by introducing a Monte Carlo algorithm running in randomized $\tilde O(n ^ {2.5})$ time while keeping the $\tilde O(n ^ 2)$ space bound from the previous algorithm. Our breakthrough is made possible by the idea of ``hop-dominant shortest paths,'' which are shortest paths with a constraint on hops (number of vertices) that remain shortest after we relax the constraint by a constant factor.</description>

      <title>Simpler Optimal Sorting from a Directed Acyclic Graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21591v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fredman proposed in 1976 the following algorithmic problem: Given are a ground set $X$, some partial order $P$ over $X$, and some comparison oracle $O_L$ that specifies a linear order $L$ over $X$ that extends $P$. A query to $O_L$ has as input distinct $x, x' \in X$ and outputs whether $x &lt;_L x'$ or vice versa. If we denote by $e(P)$ the number of linear extensions of $P$, then $\log e(P)$ is a worst-case lower bound on the number of queries needed to output the sorted order of $X$.
  Fredman did not specify in what form the partial order is given. Haeupler, Hlad\'ik, Iacono, Rozhon, Tarjan, and T\v{e}tek ('24) propose to assume as input a directed acyclic graph, $G$, with $m$ edges and $n=|X|$ vertices. Denote by $P_G$ the partial order induced by $G$. Algorithmic performance is measured in running time and the number of queries used, where they use $\Theta(m + n + \log e(P_G))$ time and $\Theta(\log e(P_G))$ queries to output $X$ in its sorted order. Their algorithm is worst-case optimal in terms of running time and queries, both. Their algorithm combines topological sorting with heapsort, and uses sophisticated data structures (including a recent type of heap with a working-set bound). Their analysis relies upon sophisticated counting arguments using entropy, recursively defined sets defined over the run of their algorithm, and vertices in the graph that they identify as bottlenecks for sorting.
  In this paper, we do away with sophistication. We show that when the input is a directed acyclic graph then the problem admits a simple solution using $\Theta(m + n + \log e(P_G))$ time and $\Theta(\log e(P_G))$ queries. Especially our proofs are much simpler as we avoid the usage of advanced charging arguments and data structures, and instead rely upon two brief observations.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Spectral Clustering on Quantum and Analog Platforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel hybrid quantum-analog algorithm to perform graph clustering that exploits connections between the evolution of dynamical systems on graphs and the underlying graph spectra. This approach constitutes a new class of algorithms that combine emerging quantum and analog platforms to accelerate computations. Our hybrid algorithm is equivalent to spectral clustering and has a computational complexity of $O(N)$, where $N$ is the number of nodes in the graph, compared to $O(N^3)$ scaling on classical computing platforms. The proposed method employs the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) framework on the data generated by Schr\"{o}dinger dynamics that evolves on the manifold induced by the graph Laplacian. In particular, we prove and demonstrate that one can extract the eigenvalues and scaled eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian by evolving Schr\"{o}dinger dynamics on quantum computers followed by DMD computations on analog devices.</description>

      <title>The merged-staircase property: a necessary and nearly sufficient condition for SGD learning of sparse functions on two-layer neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.08658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is currently known how to characterize functions that neural networks can learn with SGD for two extremal parameterizations: neural networks in the linear regime, and neural networks with no structural constraints. However, for the main parametrization of interest (non-linear but regular networks) no tight characterization has yet been achieved, despite significant developments.
  We take a step in this direction by considering depth-2 neural networks trained by SGD in the mean-field regime. We consider functions on binary inputs that depend on a latent low-dimensional subspace (i.e., small number of coordinates). This regime is of interest since it is poorly understood how neural networks routinely tackle high-dimensional datasets and adapt to latent low-dimensional structure without suffering from the curse of dimensionality. Accordingly, we study SGD-learnability with $O(d)$ sample complexity in a large ambient dimension $d$.
  Our main results characterize a hierarchical property, the "merged-staircase property", that is both necessary and nearly sufficient for learning in this setting.
  We further show that non-linear training is necessary: for this class of functions, linear methods on any feature map (e.g., the NTK) are not capable of learning efficiently. The key tools are a new "dimension-free" dynamics approximation result that applies to functions defined on a latent space of low-dimension, a proof of global convergence based on polynomial identity testing, and an improvement of lower bounds against linear methods for non-almost orthogonal functions.</description>

      <title>On boundedness of zeros of the independence polynomial of tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12934v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study boundedness of zeros of the independence polynomial of tori for sequences of tori converging to the integer lattice. We prove that zeros are bounded for sequences of balanced tori, but unbounded for sequences of highly unbalanced tori. Here balanced means that the size of the torus is at most exponential in the shortest side length, while highly unbalanced means that the longest side length of the torus is super exponential in the product over the other side lengths cubed. We discuss implications of our results to the existence of efficient algorithms for approximating the independence polynomial on tori.
  This project was partially inspired by the relationship between zeros of partition functions and holomorphic dynamics, a relationship that in the last two decades played a prominent role in the field. Besides presenting new results, we survey this relationship and its recent consequences.</description>

Abstract: The kendallknight package introduces an efficient implementation of Kendall's correlation coefficient computation, significantly improving the processing time for large datasets without sacrificing accuracy. The kendallknight package, following Knight (1966) and posterior literature, reduces the computational complexity resulting in drastic reductions in computation time, transforming operations that would take minutes or hours into milliseconds or minutes, while maintaining precision and correctly handling edge cases and errors. The package is particularly advantageous in econometric and statistical contexts where rapid and accurate calculation of Kendall's correlation coefficient is desirable. Benchmarks demonstrate substantial performance gains over the base R implementation, especially for large datasets.</description>
