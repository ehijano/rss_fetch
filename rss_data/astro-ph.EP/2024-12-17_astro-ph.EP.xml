      <title>Circumbinary accretion as a diagnostic for binary--disc misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary star systems can accrete material originating from a circumbinary disc. Since it is common for the circumbinary disc to be tilted with respect to the binary orbital plane, we test whether the accretion dynamics can be a diagnostic for binary-disc misalignment. We present hydrodynamical simulations to model the accretion flow from a circumbinary disc around an eccentric binary with initial tilts ranging from $0^\circ$ to $180^\circ$ in increments of $15^\circ$. Based on the initial tilt, the circumbinary disc will align towards three different configurations: prograde coplanar, polar, or retrograde coplanar. For discs with initial tilts evolving towards prograde coplanar alignment, the accretion rates onto the primary and secondary stars exhibit alternating preferential accretion. Circumbinary discs evolving towards polar alignment exhibit no alternating preferential accretion onto the binary unless the initial tilt is close to the critical tilt that sets the boundary between coplanar or polar alignment. Such cases cause strong disc warping, leading to disc breaking. The inner disc becomes eccentric, leading to alternating preferential accretion onto the binary. As the break propagates outward, the disc tilt damps towards a polar state and the disc eccentricity decreases. As the disc re-circularizes, the accretion rate transitions back from alternating preferential accretion to non-alternating accretion. Lastly, no alternating preferential accretion exists for discs undergoing retrograde coplanar alignment. From the summary of the accretion rates from our suite of SPH simulations, it is evident that the accretion rate evolution can be affected by the initial tilt and subsequent evolution of the circumbinary disc.</description>

      <title>Dust Scattering Albedo at Millimeter-Wavelengths in the TW Hya Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetary bodies are formed by coagulation of solid dust grains in protoplanetary disks. Therefore, it is crucial to constrain the physical and chemical properties of the dust grains. In this study, we measure the dust albedo at mm-wavelength, which depends on dust properties at the disk midplane. Since the albedo and dust temperature are generally degenerate in observed thermal dust emission, it is challenging to determine them simultaneously. We propose to break this degeneracy by using multiple optically-thin molecular lines as a dust-albedo independent thermometer. In practice, we employ pressure-broadened CO line wings that provide an exceptionally high signal-to-noise ratio as an optically thin line. We model the CO $J=2-1$ and $3-2$ spectra observed by the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) at the inner region ($r&lt;6\ {\rm au}$) of the TW Hya disk and successfully derived the midplane temperature. Combining multi-band continuum observations, we constrain the albedo spectrum at $0.9-3$ mm for the first time without assuming a dust opacity model. The albedo at these wavelengths is high, $\sim0.5-0.8$, and broadly consistent with the Ricci et al. (2010), DIANA, and DSHARP dust models. Even without assuming dust composition, we estimate the maximum grain size to be $\sim 340\ \mu m$, the power law index of the grain size distribution to be $&gt;-4.1$, and porosity to be $&lt;0.96$. The derived dust size may suggest efficient fragmentation with the threshold velocity of $\sim 0.08\ {\rm m\ s^{-1}}$. We also note that the absolute flux uncertainty of $\sim10\%$ ($1\sigma$) is measured and used in the analysis, which is approximately twice the usually assumed value.</description>

      <title>Planet formation theory: an overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard model for planet formation is a bottom-up process in which the origin of rocky and gaseous planets can be traced back to the collision of micron-sized dust grains within the gas-rich environment of protoplanetary disks. Key milestones along the way include disk formation, grain growth, planetesimal formation, core growth, gas accretion, and planetary system evolution. I provide an introductory overview of planet formation, emphasizing the main ideas and reviewing current theoretical understanding. Many of the phases of planet formation have a well-developed physical understanding, though the complexity of the problem means that few can be quantitatively modeled with complete confidence. Transformative advances in disk imaging and exoplanet detection provide the first direct information on the initial conditions for planet formation, and have motivated new formation models that are faster, more efficient, and lead to a more diverse set of architectures than their Solar System inspired forebears. Much remains to be learned, and I close with a personal, incomplete list, of open problems.</description>

      <title>Jitter Across 15 Years: Leveraging Precise Photometry from Kepler and TESS to Extract Exoplanets from Radial Velocity Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar activity contamination of radial velocity (RV) data is one of the top challenges plaguing the field of extreme precision RV (EPRV) science. Previous work has shown that photometry can be very effective at removing such signals from RV data, especially stellar activity caused by rotating star spots and plage.The exact utility of photometry for removing RV activity contamination, and the best way to apply it, is not well known. We present a combination photometric and RV study of eight Kepler/K2 FGK stars with known stellar variability. We use NEID RVs acquired simultaneously with TESS photometry, and we perform injection recovery tests to quantify the efficacy of recent TESS photometry versus archival Kepler/K2 photometry for removing stellar variability from RVs. We additionally experiment with different TESS sectors when training our models in order to quantify the real benefit of simultaneously acquired RVs and photometry. We conclude that Kepler photometry typically performs better than TESS at removing noise from RV data when it is available, likely due to longer baseline and precision. In contrast, for targets with available K2 photometry, especially those most active, and with high precision ($\sigma_{NEID}$ $&lt;$ 1 m s$^{-1}$) NEID RVs, TESS may be the more informative dataset. However, contrary to expectations, we have found that training on simultaneous photometry does not always achieve the best results.</description>

      <title>Vortex-Induced Rings and Gaps within Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of protoplanetary disks have revealed the presence of both crescent-shaped and ring-like structures in dust continuum emission. These crescents are thought to arise from dust-trapping vortices generated by the Rossby Wave Instability (RWI), which induces density waves akin to those caused by planets. These vortices have the potential to create gaps and rings within the disk, resulting from the dissipation of their density waves. We carry out 2D hydrodynamic simulations in the shearing box to investigate vortex-disk interaction. We find that long-lived vortices can produce dust rings and gaps in inviscid discs detectable by ALMA, and a more elongated vortex produces rings at larger separations. Vortex-induced density waves carry over two orders of magnitude higher angular momentum flux compared to planet-induced ones that shock at the same location, making the former much more effective at producing dust gaps and rings far away.</description>

      <title>The effect of a biosphere on the habitable timespan of stagnant-lid planets and implications for the atmospheric spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperature-dependent biological productivity controls silicate weathering and thereby extends the potential habitable timespan of Earth. Models and theoretical considerations indicate that the runaway greenhouse on Earth-like exoplanets is generally accompanied by a dramatic increase in atmospheric H$_2$O and CO$_2$, which might be observed with the upcoming generation of space telescopes. If an active biosphere extends the habitable timespan of exoplanets similarly to Earth, observing the atmospheric spectra of exoplanets near the inner edge of the habitable zone could then give insights into whether the planet is inhabited. Here, we explore this idea for Earth-like stagnant-lid planets. We find that while for a reduced mantle, a surface biosphere extends the habitable timespan of the planet by about 1 Gyr, for more oxidising conditions, the biologically enhanced rate of weathering becomes increasingly compensated for by an increased supply rate of CO$_2$ to the atmosphere. Observationally, the resulting difference in atmospheric CO$_2$ near the inner edge of the habitable zone is clearly distinguishable between biotic planets with active weathering and abiotic planets that have experienced a runaway greenhouse. For an efficient hydrological cycle, the increased bioproductivity also leads to a CH$_4$ biosignature observable with JWST. As the planet becomes uninhabitable, the H$_2$O infrared absorption bands dominate, but the 4.3-micron CO$_2$ band remains a clear window into the CO$_2$ abundances. In summary, while the effect of life on the carbonate-silicate cycle leaves a record in the atmospheric spectrum of Earth-like stagnant-lid planets, future work is needed especially to determine the tectonic state and composition of exoplanets and to push forward the development of the next generation of space telescopes.</description>

      <title>Enlargement of depressions on comet 81P/Wild 2: Constraint based on 30-year cometary activity in the inner Solar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The Stardust flyby mission to Jupiter-family comet (JFC) 81P/Wild 2 (hereafter, 81P) captured its dense quasicircular depressions. Nevertheless, the formation mechanism remains a subject of ongoing debate. Aims. We aimed to study how cometary activity contributed to the formation and enlargement of these depressions by analyzing Stardust flyby images and ground-based observation data. Methods. We calculated the time-dependent water production rate of 81P inside the snow line (&lt;3 au) and compared it with the observational data. In addition, we estimated the fallback debris mass using an observation-based model, where a dust ejection from 81P was considered to reproduce ground-based observations of the dust tail. We compared the total excavated volume of water and dust with the total depression volume derived using the 81P shape model. Results. We find that the total excavated volume after 81P was injected into the inner Solar System accounts for up to only 30 % of the depression volume. This insufficiency suggests that a large portion (&gt;70 %) of the depressions had already existed before the comet was injected into the current orbit. In addition, we estimate the dust-to-ice mass ratio for 81P to be 2-14. Conclusions. We suggest that most depressions were formed in the source region of the Kuiper-belt objects.</description>

      <title>Combined analysis of the 12.8 and 15 $\mu m$ JWST/MIRI eclipse observations of TRAPPIST-1 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first JWST/MIRI photometric observations of TRAPPIST-1 b allowed for the detection of the thermal emission of the planet at 15 $\mu m$, suggesting that the planet could be a bare rock with a zero albedo and no redistribution of heat. These observations at 15 $\mu m$ were acquired as part of GTO time that included a twin program at 12.8 $\mu m$ in order to have a measurement in and outside the CO$_2$ absorption band. Here we present five new occultations of TRAPPIST-1 b observed with MIRI in an additional photometric band at 12.8 $\mu m$. We perform a global fit of the 10 eclipses and derive a planet-to-star flux ratio and 1-$\sigma$ error of 452 $\pm$ 86 ppm and 775 $\pm$ 90 ppm at 12.8 $\mu m$ and 15 $\mu m$, respectively.
  We find that two main scenarios emerge. An airless planet model with an unweathered (fresh) ultramafic surface, that could be indicative of relatively recent geological processes fits well the data. Alternatively, a thick, pure-CO2 atmosphere with photochemical hazes that create a temperature inversion and result in the CO2 feature being seen in emission also works, although with some caveats. Our results highlight the challenges in accurately determining a planet's atmospheric or surface nature solely from broadband filter measurements of its emission, but also point towards two very interesting scenarios that will be further investigated with the forthcoming phase curve of TRAPPIST-1 b.</description>

      <title>Convective shutdown in the atmospheres of lava worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric energy transport is central to the cooling of primordial magma oceans. Theoretical studies of atmospheres on lava planets have assumed that convection is the only process involved in setting the atmospheric temperature structure. This significantly influences the ability for a magma ocean to cool. It has been suggested that convective stability in these atmospheres could preclude permanent magma oceans. We develop a new 1D radiative-convective model in order to investigate when the atmospheres overlying magma oceans are convectively stable. Using a coupled interior-atmosphere framework, we simulate the early evolution of two terrestrial-mass exoplanets: TRAPPIST-1 c and HD 63433 d. Our simulations suggest that the atmosphere of HD 63433 d exhibits deep isothermal layers which are convectively stable. However, it is able to maintain a permanent magma ocean and an atmosphere depleted in H2O. It is possible to maintain permanent magma oceans underneath atmospheres without convection. Absorption features of CO2 and SO2 within synthetic emission spectra are associated with mantle redox state, meaning that future observations of HD 63433 d may provide constraints on the geochemical properties of a magma ocean analogous with the early Earth. Simulations of TRAPPIST-1 c indicate that it is expected to have solidified within 100 Myr, outgassing a thick atmosphere in the process. Cool isothermal stratospheres generated by low molecular-weight atmospheres can mimic the emission of an atmosphere-less body. Future work should consider how atmospheric escape and chemistry modulates the lifetime of magma oceans, and the role of tidal heating in sustaining atmospheric convection</description>

      <title>The Fate of Oceans on First-Generation Planets Orbiting White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several groups have recently suggested that small planets orbiting very closely around white dwarf stars could be promising locations for life to arise, even after stellar death. There are still many uncertainties, however, regarding the existence and habitability of these worlds. Here, we consider the retention of water during post-main-sequence evolution of a Sun-like star, and during the subsequent migration of planets to the white dwarf's habitable zone. This inward migration is driven by dynamical mechanisms such as planet-planet interactions in packed systems, which can excite planets to high eccentricities, setting the initial conditions for tidal migration into short-period orbits. In order for water to persist on the surfaces of planets orbiting white dwarfs, the water must first survive the AGB phase of stellar evolution, then avoid being lost due to photoevaporation due to X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) radiation from the newly-formed white dwarf, and then finally survive the tidal migration of the planet inwards to the habitable zone. We find that while this journey will likely desiccate large swaths of post-main-sequence planetary systems, planets with substantial reservoirs of water may retain some surface water, especially if their migration occurs at later white dwarf cooling ages. Therefore, although stellar evolution may pose a challenge for the retention of water on exoplanet surfaces, it is possible for planets to retain surface oceans even as their host stars die and their orbits evolve.</description>

      <title>MOCKA -- A PLATO mock asteroseismic catalogue: Simulations for gravity-mode oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With ESA's PLATO space mission set for launch in December 2026, a new photometric legacy and a future of new scientific discoveries await. In this work we investigate PLATO's potential for observing pulsating stars across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram as part of the PLATO Complimentary Science program (PLATO-CS). Specifically, a PLATO mock asteroseismic catalogue (MOCKA) of intermediate to massive stars is presented as a benchmark to highlight the asteroseismic yield of PLATO-CS in a quantitative way. MOCKA includes simulations of $\beta$~Cephei, slowly pulsating B (SPB), $\delta$~Scuti, $\gamma$~Doradus, RR Lyrae, Cepheid, hot subdwarf, and white dwarf stars. In particular, main-sequence gravity (g) mode pulsators are of interest as some of these stars form an important foundation for the scientific calibration of PLATO. MOCKA is based on a magnitude limited ($G\lesssim17$) \textit{Gaia} catalogue and is a product of realistic end-to-end \texttt{PlatoSim} simulations of stars for the first PLATO pointing field in the Southern hemisphere, which will be observed for a minimally 2-yr duration. We show that an abundant spectrum of frequencies is achievable across a wide range of magnitudes and co-pointing PLATO cameras. Within the magnitude limited regimes simulated ($G \lesssim 14$ for $\gamma$~Doradus stars and $G \lesssim 16$ for SPB stars) the dominant g-mode frequency is recovered in more than $95\%$ of the cases. MOCKA help us to understand the limits of the PLATO mission as well as highlight the opportunities to push astrophysics beyond current stellar models. All data products of this paper are made available to the community for further exploration. The key data products of MOCKA are the magnitude limited \textit{Gaia} catalogue of the first PLATO pointing field, together with fully reduced light curves from multi-camera observations for each pulsation class.</description>

      <title>Symmetric instability in a Boussinesq fluid on a rotating planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetric instability has broad applications in geophysical fluid dynamics. It plays a crucial role in the formation of mesoscale rainbands at mid-latitudes on Earth, instability in the ocean's mixed layer, and slantwise convection on gas giants and in the oceans of icy moons. Here, we apply linear instability analysis to an arbitrary zonally symmetric Boussinesq flow on a rotating spherical planet, with applicability to planetary atmospheres and icy moon oceans. We characterize the instabilities into three types: (1) gravitational instability, occurring when stratification is unstable along angular momentum surfaces, (2) inertial instability, occurring when angular momentum shear is unstable along buoyancy surfaces, and (3) a mixed ``PV'' instability, occurring when the potential vorticity has the opposite sign as planetary rotation. We note that $N^2&gt;0$, where $N$ is the Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency, is neither necessary nor sufficient for stability. Instead, $b_z \sin{\theta}&gt;0$, where $b_z$ is the stratification along the planetary rotation axis and $\theta$ is latitude, is always necessary for stability and also sufficient in the low Rossby number limit. In the low Rossby number limit, applicable to convection in the oceans of icy moons and in the atmospheres of gas giants, the most unstable mode is slantwise convection parallel to the planetary rotation axis.</description>

      <title>ALMA detections of circumstellar disks in the giant Hii region M17. Probing the intermediate- to high-mass pre-main-sequence population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11797</link>

Abstract: Our current understanding is that intermediate- to high-mass stars form in a way similar to low-mass stars, that is, through disk accretion. However, the physical conditions that play a role in disk formation, evolution, and the possibility of (sub)stellar companion formation, are significantly different. We search for the mm counterparts of four intermediate- to high-mass (4-10 Solar mass) young stellar objects (YSOs) in the giant Hii region M17 at a distance of 1.7 kpc. These objects expose their photospheric spectrum such that their location on the pre-main-sequence (PMS) is well established. They have a circumstellar disk that is likely remnant of the formation process. With ALMA we have detected, for the first time, these four YSOs in M17, in Band 6 and 7, as well as four other serendipitous objects. Besides the flux measurements, the source size and spectral index provide important constraints on the physical mechanism(s) producing the observed emission. We apply different models to estimate the dust and gas mass contained in the disks. All our detections are spatially unresolved, constraining the source size to &lt;120 au, and have a spectral index in the range 0.5-2.7. The derived (upper limits on the) disk dust masses are on the order of a few Earth masses and estimations of the upper limits on the gas mass vary between $10^{-5}$ and $10^{-3}$ Solar mass. In two objects (B331 and B268) free-free emission indicates the presence of ionized material around the star. The four serendipitous detections are likely (low-mass) YSOs. We compare the derived disk masses of our M17 targets to those obtained for YSOs in low-mass star-forming regions (SFRs) and Herbig stars, as a function of stellar mass, age, luminosity, and outer disk radius. The M17 sample, though small, is both the most massive and the youngest sample, yet has the lowest mean disk mass.</description>

      <title>The Eclipsing Binaries via Artificial Intelligence. II. Need for Speed in PHOEBE Forward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In modern astronomy, the quantity of data collected has vastly exceeded the capacity for manual analysis, necessitating the use of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to assist scientists with the most labor-intensive tasks. AI can optimize simulation codes where computational bottlenecks arise from the time required to generate forward models. One such example is PHOEBE, a modeling code for eclipsing binaries (EBs), where simulating individual systems is feasible, but analyzing observables for extensive parameter combinations is highly time-consuming.
  To address this, we present a fully connected feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) trained on a dataset of over one million synthetic light curves generated with PHOEBE. Optimization of the ANN architecture yielded a model with six hidden layers, each containing 512 nodes, provides an optimized balance between accuracy and computational complexity. Extensive testing enabled us to establish ANN's applicability limits and to quantify the systematic and statistical errors associated with using such networks for EB analysis. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of dilution effects in parameter estimation for EBs, and we outline methods to incorporate these effects in AI-based models.
  This proposed ANN framework enables a speedup of over four orders of magnitude compared to traditional methods, with systematic errors not exceeding 1\%, and often as low as 0.01\%, across the entire parameter space.</description>

      <title>Most Super-Earths Have Less Than 3% Water</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Super-Earths are highly irradiated, small planets with bulk densities approximately consistent with Earth. We construct combined interior-atmosphere models of super-Earths that trace the partitioning of water throughout a planet, including an iron-rich core, silicate-rich mantle, and steam atmosphere. We compare these models with exoplanet observations to infer a $1\sigma$ upper limit on total water mass fraction of $\lesssim 3\%$ at the population level. We consider end-member scenarios that may change this value, including the efficiency of mantle outgassing, escape of high mean-molecular weight atmospheres, and increased iron core mass fractions. Although our constraints are agnostic as to the origin of water, we show that our upper limits are consistent with its production via chemical reactions of primordial hydrogen-dominated atmospheres with magma oceans. This mechanism has also been hypothesised to explain Earth's water content, possibly pointing to a unified channel for the origins of water on small terrestrial planets.</description>

      <title>An HST Transmission Spectrum of the Closest M-Dwarf Transiting Rocky Planet LTT 1445Ab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Which rocky exoplanets have atmospheres? This presumably simply question is the first that must be answered to understand the prevalence of nearby habitable planets. A mere 6.9 pc from Earth, LTT 1445A is the closest transiting M-dwarf system, and its largest known planet, at $\rm 1.31\; R_{\oplus}$ and 424 K, is one of the most promising targets in which to search for an atmosphere. We use HST/WFC3 transmission spectroscopy with the G280 and G141 grisms to study the spectrum of LTT 1445Ab between $\rm 0.2-1.65\;\mu m$. In doing so, we uncover a UV flare on the neighboring star LTT 1445C that is completely invisible at optical wavelengths; we report one of the first simultaneous near-UV/optical spectra of an M~dwarf flare. The planet spectrum is consistent with a flat line (with median transit depth uncertainties of 128 and 52 ppm for the G280 and G141 observations, respectively), though the infrared portion displays potential features that could be explained by known opacity sources such as HCN. Some atmospheric retrievals weakly favor ($\sim2\sigma$) an atmosphere, but it remains challenging to discern between stellar contamination, an atmosphere, and a featureless spectrum at this time. We do, however, confidently rule out $\leq100\times$ solar metallicity atmospheres. Although stellar contamination retrievals cannot fit the infrared features well, the overall spectrum is consistent with stellar contamination from hot or cold spots. Based on the UV/optical data, we place limits on the extent of stellar variability expected in the near-infrared ($30-40$ ppm), which will be critical for future JWST observations.</description>

      <title>Planetary migration in wind-fed non-stationary accretion disks in binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An accretion disk can be formed around a secondary star in a binary system when the primary companion leaves the Main sequence and starts to lose mass at an enhanced rate. We study the accretion disk evolution and planetary migration in wide binaries. We use a numerical model of a non-stationary alpha-disk with a variable mass inflow. We take into account that the low-mass disk has an extended region that is optically thin along the rotation axis. We consider irradiation by both the host star and the donor. The migration path of a planet in such a disk is determined by the migration rate varying during the disk evolution. Giant planets may open/close the gap several times over the disk lifetime. We identify the new type of migration specific to parts of the growing disk with a considerable radial gradient of an aspect ratio. Its rate is enclosed between the type 2 and the fast type 1 migration rates being determined by the ratio of time and radial derivatives of the disk aspect ratio. Rapid growth of the wind rate just before the envelope loss by the donor leads to the formation of a zone of decretion, which may lead to substantial outward migration. In binaries with an initial separation $a\lesssim 100$\,AU migration becomes most efficient for planets with 60--80 Earth masses. This results in approaching a short distance from the host star where tidal forces become non-negligible. Less massive Neptune-like planets at the initial orbits $r_\mathrm{p} \lesssim 2$\,AU can reach these internal parts in binaries with $a \lesssim 30$\,AU. In binaries, mass loss by the primary component at late evolutionary stages can significantly modify the structure of a planetary system around the secondary component resulting in mergers of relatively massive planets with a host star.</description>

      <title>From Misaligned Sub-Saturns to Aligned Brown Dwarfs: The Highest $M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$ Systems Exhibit Low Obliquities, Even around Hot Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04438v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a pattern emerging from stellar obliquity measurements in single-star systems: planets with high planet-to-star mass ratios ($M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$$&gt;$ $2\times10^{-3}$) -- such as super-Jupiters, brown dwarf companions, and M-dwarfs hosting Jupiter-like planets -- tend to be aligned, even around hot stars. This alignment represents a 3.7$\sigma$ deviation from the obliquity distribution observed in systems with lower mass ratios ($M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$$&lt;$ $2\times10^{-3}$), which predominantly include Jupiters and sub-Saturns. The only known outlier system, XO-3, exhibits misalignment confirmed via our newly collected Rossiter-McLaughlin effect measurement ($\lambda=41.8^{+2.1}_{-2.0}$ degrees). However, the relatively large $\textit{Gaia}$ Renormalized Unit Weight Error (RUWE) of XO-3 suggests that it may harbor an undetected binary companion, potentially contributing to its misalignment. Given that tidal realignment mechanisms are weak for hot stars, the observed alignment in high $M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$ systems is likely $\textit{primordial}$ rather than resulting from tidal interactions. One possible explanation is that only dynamically isolated planets can continue accreting gas and evolve into super-Jupiters while maintaining their primordial alignment. Conversely, planets formed in compact configurations may be unable to grow beyond the gap-opening mass, for which our work suggests an empirical boundary $M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$$=$ $2\times10^{-3}$, identified between aligned high $M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$ systems and misaligned low $M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$ systems, with dynamical instabilities contributing to the diverse spin-orbit misalignments observed in the latter.</description>

      <title>Optimal Celestial Bodies for Dark Matter Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A wide variety of celestial bodies have been considered as dark matter detectors. Which stands the best chance of delivering the discovery of dark matter? Which is the most powerful dark matter detector? We investigate a range of objects, including the Sun, Earth, Jupiter, Brown Dwarfs, White Dwarfs, Neutron Stars, Stellar populations, and Exoplanets. We quantify how different objects are optimal dark matter detectors in different regimes by deconstructing some of the in-built assumptions in these search sensitivities, including observation potential and particle model assumptions. We find new constraints and future sensitivities across a range of dark matter annihilation final states. We quantify mediator properties leading to detectable celestial-body energy injection or Standard Model fluxes, and show how different objects can be expected to deliver corroborating signals. We discuss different search strategies, their opportunities and limitations, and the interplay of regimes where different celestial objects are optimal dark matter detectors. Deconstructing the assumptions of these searches leads us to point out a new search using the Galactic center stellar population that can provide greater sensitivity to the dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section than the Sun, despite being significantly further away in our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>$1/f$ Noise in the Heliosphere: A Target for PUNCH Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a broad review of 1/f noise observations in the heliosphere, and discuss and complement the theoretical background of generic 1/f models as relevant to NASA's PUNCH mission. First observed in the voltage fluctuations of vacuum tubes, the scale-invariant 1/f spectrum has since been identified across a wide array of natural and artificial systems, including heart rate fluctuations and loudness patterns in musical compositions. In the solar wind, the interplanetary magnetic field trace spectrum exhibits 1/f scaling within the frequency range from around 2e-6 Hz to around 1e-3 Hz at 1 au. One compelling mechanism for the generation of 1/f noise is the superposition principle, where a composite 1/f spectrum arises from the superposition of a collection of individual power-law spectra characterized by a scale-invariant distribution of correlation times. In the context of the solar wind, such a superposition could originate from scale-invariant reconnection processes in the corona. Further observations have detected 1/f signatures in the photosphere and corona at frequency ranges compatible with those observed at 1 au, suggesting an even lower altitude origin of 1/f spectrum in the solar dynamo itself. This hypothesis is bolstered by dynamo experiments and simulations that indicate inverse cascade activities, which can be linked to successive flux tube reconnections beneath the corona, and are known to generate 1/f noise possibly through nonlocal interactions at the largest scales. Conversely, models positing in situ generation of $1/f$ signals face causality issues in explaining the low-frequency portion of the 1/f spectrum. Understanding 1/f noise in the solar wind may inform central problems in heliospheric physics, such as the solar dynamo, coronal heating, the origin of the solar wind, and the nature of interplanetary turbulence.</description>

      <title>A Revision for the Draconic Gearing of the Antikythera Mechanism, the eclipse events of Saros spiral and their classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our research is focused on the missing, but important and necessary Draconic gearing of the Antikythera Mechanism. The three Lunar cycles Sidereal, Synodic and Anomalistic are represented on the Mechanism by correlating the Fragments A and C (part of the Front plate), whereas the fourth Lunar cycle Draconic results after correlating the unplaced Fragment D with Fragment A. Considering the deformation of the Mechanism s parts during 2000 years underwater and their shrinkage after their retraction from the sea bottom, we present a revised gearing scheme of the Draconic scale. The existence of the Draconic gearing is crucial, because both the preserved and the missing eclipse events can be precalculated by the phase correlation of three pointers: of the Lunar Disc, of the Golden sphere/Sun-ray and the Draconic. This means that the eclipse events are calculated by pure mechanical processing and that they are not documented observed events. The phase coordination of the three lunar cycles can be used as a quality criterion for a functional model of the Mechanism. Eudoxus papyrus was the key for the lost words completion of the Back Plate inscriptions eclipse events classification of the Antikythera Mechanism.</description>
