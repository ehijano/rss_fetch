      <title>Simulation of atom trajectories in the original Stern-Gerlach experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following a comprehensive analysis of the historical literature, we model the geometry of the Stern$\unicode{x2013}$Gerlach experiment to numerically calculate the magnetic field using the finite-element method. Using this calculated field and Monte Carlo methods, the atomic translational dynamics are simulated to produce the well-known quantized end-pattern with matching dimensions. The finite-element method used provides the most accurate description of the Stern$\unicode{x2013}$Gerlach magnetic field and end-pattern in the literature, matching the historically reported values and figures.</description>

      <title>A novel numerical framework for three-dimensional fully resolved simulation of freely falling particles of arbitrary shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces a novel numerical framework designed to model the interplay between free-falling particles and their surrounding fluid in situations of high particle to fluid density ratio, typically exhibited by atmospheric particles. This method is designed to complement experimental studies in vertical wind tunnels to improve the understanding of the aerodynamic behavior of small atmospheric particles, such as the transport and sedimentation of volcanic particles, cloud ice crystals and other application areas. The solver is based on the lattice Boltzmann method and it addresses the numerical challenges, including the high density ratio and moderate to high Reynolds number, by using an immersed-boundary approach and a recursive-regularized collision model. A predictor-corrector scheme is applied for the robust time integration of the six-degrees-of-freedom (6DOF) rigid-body motion. Finally, the multi-scale nature arising from the long free-fall distances of a particle is addressed through a dynamic memory allocation scheme allowing for a virtually infinite falling distance. This tool allows for the simulation of particles of arbitrary shape represented by a triangularized surface. The framework is validated against the analytical and experimental data for falling spheres and ellipsoids, and is then applied to the case of an actual volcanic particle geometry, the shape of which is obtained from a 3D surface-contour scanning process. The physics of the free-fall of this particle is investigated and described, and its terminal velocity is compared against the experimental data measured with the 3D printed exemplars of the same particle.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Becker-Kistiakowsky-Wilson equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Jones-Wilkins-Lee (JWL) equation of state (EOS) is the most popular equation of state used in hydrocodes to model detonation products thermodynamics resulting from high explosives. However, the JWL EOS presents several major difficulties. Namely, its range of validity and convexity is limited as its parameters are adjusted on a given reference curve. When used in conditions where the thermodynamic state varies significantly, computational failure may happen. It occurs frequently in multiphase flow computations when heat and mass transfers with other phases are present, as the resulting thermodynamic state is far from the reference curve used for adjustment. Moreover, the detonation products composition is absent in the JWL formulation. This is another important limitation when additional physics are involved, such as post-combustion, phase transition, or when dealing with non-ideal explosives. In this work, the Becker-Kistiakowsky-Wilson (BKW) EOS is considered instead. The BKW EOS is widely used in thermochemical codes, as parent EOS to provide the reference data used to fit JWL EOS parameters. The BKW EOS present several advantages. Its formulation considers variable gas species in the detonation products. No specific adjustment is needed for a given explosive, and only the detonation products composition requires computational efforts. Its range of validity is large, as the various parameters have been adjusted for each gas species separately. However, the BKW EOS also present difficulties which limit its application in hydrocodes. These difficulties are the aim of the present work. The BKW EOS is currently restricted to thermochemical codes as its mathematical formulation is computationally expensive. It also requires the gas chemical composition to be computed via an appropriate chemical equilibrium solver. In the present work, the computational cost of the BKW EOS is reduced thanks to the thermodynamic relaxation method of Neron et al. (2023). The variable composition of the detonation products is accounted for through specific relaxation terms computed once, with the help of conventional thermochemical codes. The condensed species, such as solid carbon, are modelled with the Cochran-Chan (CC) EOS, having a simpler thermodynamic formulation and being thermodynamically consistent compared to usual EOSs used for condensed species. This multiphase formulation made of BKW gas mixture with variable composition and condensed phases is considered in temperature and pressure equilibrium. It is embedded in a multiphase flow formulation, with the help of the thermodynamic relaxation method mentioned above. It shows comparable computational cost as the JWL formulation, with significantly enhanced physics capabilities and improved robustness.</description>

      <title>Ionization potential of radium monofluoride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ionization potential (IP) of radium monofluoride (RaF) was measured to be 4.972(2)[14] eV, revealing a relativistic enhancement in the series of alkaline earth monofluorides. The results are in agreement with a relativistic coupled-cluster prediction of 4.978[6] eV, incorporating up to quantum electrodynamics corrections. Using the same computational methodology, an improved calculation for the dissociation energy ($D_{e}$) of 5.56[5] eV is presented. This confirms that radium monofluoride joins the small group of diatomic molecules for which $D_{e}&gt;\mathrm{IP}$, paving the way for precision control and interrogation of its Rydberg states.</description>

      <title>Efficient Simulation of Deformable Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a two dimensional deformation model to describe how soft squishy circular particles respond to external forces and collisions. This model involves formulating mathematical equations and algorithms for the shape of a deformed particle based on the geometrical as well as physical properties of the particles, such as their size and elasticity. The model also accounts for the conservation of energy associated with the particle shape during interaction with other particles as well as with rigid walls. To verify the accuracy of the shape of the deformed particles, we start with a single deformable particle in an overcompressed box which we compare with the numerically simulated deformable polygon (DP) model. Then we extend our method to a jammed packing of deformable particles which we also verify through the DP model. We also provide a protocol to calculate the total force acting on such deformable particles solely based on their deformation and to obtain both athermal jammed packings as well as packings in thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Approach to Learning Optimal Forms of Constitutive Relations in Models Describing Lithium Plating in Battery Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study we construct a data-driven model describing Lithium plating in a battery cell, which is a key process contributing to degradation of such cells. Starting from the fundamental Doyle-Fuller-Newman (DFN) model, we use asymptotic reduction and spatial averaging techniques to derive a simplified representation to track the temporal evolution of two key concentrations in the system, namely, the total intercalated Lithium on the negative electrode particles and total plated Lithium. This model depends on an a priori unknown constitutive relations of the cell as a function of thestate variables. An optimal form of this constitutive relation is then deduced from experimental measurements of the time dependent concentrations of different Lithium phases acquired through Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy. This is done by solving an inverse problem in which this constitutive relation is found subject to minimum assumptions as a minimizer of a suitable constrained optimization problem where the discrepancy between the model predictions and experimental data is minimized. This optimization problem is solved using a state-of-the-art adjoint-based technique. In contrast to some of the earlier approaches to modelling Lithium plating, the proposed model is able to predict non-trivial evolution of the concentrations in the relaxation regime when no current isapplied to the cell. When equipped with an optimal constitutive relation, the model provides accurate predictions of the time evolution of both intercalated and plated Lithium across a wide range of charging/discharging rates. It can therefore serve as a useful tool for prediction and control of degradation mechanism in battery cells.</description>

      <title>Force-Guided Bridge Matching for Full-Atom Time-Coarsened Dynamics of Peptides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are irreplaceable and ubiquitous in fields of materials science, chemistry, pharmacology just to name a few. Conventional MD simulations are plagued by numerical stability as well as long equilibration time issues, which limits broader applications of MD simulations. Recently, a surge of deep learning approaches have been devised for time-coarsened dynamics, which learns the state transition mechanism over much larger time scales to overcome these limitations. However, only a few methods target the underlying Boltzmann distribution by resampling techniques, where proposals are rarely accepted as new states with low efficiency. In this work, we propose a force-guided bridge matching model, FBM, a novel framework that first incorporates physical priors into bridge matching for full-atom time-coarsened dynamics. With the guidance of our well-designed intermediate force field, FBM is feasible to target the Boltzmann-like distribution by direct inference without extra steps. Experiments on small peptides verify our superiority in terms of comprehensive metrics and demonstrate transferability to unseen peptide systems.</description>

      <title>Latent Ewald summation for machine learning of long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) often neglect long-range interactions, such as electrostatic and dispersion forces. In this work, we introduce a straightforward and efficient method to account for long-range interactions by learning a latent variable from local atomic descriptors and applying an Ewald summation to this variable. We demonstrate that in systems including charged, polar, or apolar molecular dimers, bulk water, and water-vapor interface, standard short-ranged MLIPs can lead to unphysical predictions even when employing message passing. The long-range models effectively eliminate these artifacts, with only about twice the computational cost of short-range MLIPs.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Finite-Size Scaling of the Four-Dimensional Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Field-theoretical calculations predict that, at the upper critical dimension $d_c=4$, the finite-size scaling (FSS) behaviors of the Ising model would be modified by multiplicative logarithmic corrections with thermal and magnetic correction exponents $(\hat{y}_t, \hat{y}_h)=(1/6,1/4)$. Using high-efficient cluster algorithms and the lifted worm algorithm, we present a systematic study of the FSS of the four-dimensional Ising model in the Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) bond and loop representations. Our numerical results reveal the FSS behaviors of various geometric and physical quantities in the three representations, offering robust evidence for the logarithmic correction form conjectured by the field theory. In particular, clear evidence is obtained for the existence of $\hat{y}_t=1/6$ in the loop representation, while it is difficult to extract in the spin representations, because of mixing with the Gaussian-fixed-point asymptotics. In the FK-bond representation, the multiplicative logarithmic correction for the second-largest cluster is also numerically observed to be governed by an exponent $\hat{y}_{h2} = -1/4$ with its exact value unknown yet.</description>
