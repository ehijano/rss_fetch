      <title>Impacts of Perfect Fluid Dark Matter on Spacetime Geometry -- the Exponential Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical observations provide compelling evidence for the existence of dark matter, a non-luminous component dominating the universe's mass-energy budget. Its gravitational influence is well-established on galactic scales; however, dark matter's precise nature and effect on spacetime geometry remain open questions. This study investigates modifications to the Schwarzschild metric due to the presence of dark matter, modeled as a perfect fluid with a specific equation of state. We derive an "exponential" metric incorporating this dark matter contribution and calculate its key characteristics: the event horizon, innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), and photon sphere. Comparing these with Schwarzschild predictions reveals distinct deviations dependent on the dark matter distribution. Furthermore, we analyze the orbital velocity profiles derived from the exponential metric, demonstrating its potential to explain the observed flat rotation curves of galaxies. Our results underscore the importance of considering modified metrics in accurately describing spacetime near massive objects and provide a theoretical framework for further investigations into dark matter's role in galactic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Can the universe experience an AdS landscape since matter-radiation equality?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though an anti-de Sitter (AdS) vacuum, corresponding to a negative cosmological constant (NCC), can be not responsible for the acceleration of current universe, it might coexist with one evolving positive dark energy component at low redshift, as well as with early dark energy around the recombination to solve the Hubble tension. In this paper, we investigate the scenario with one AdS vacuum around the recombination and one at low redshift, and from both current observational and theoretical perspectives preliminarily explore the possibility that the universe experienced a landscape with multiple AdS vacua since matter-radiation equality.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes in Kerr spacetime as a 2D Eigenvalue problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the computation of quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the Kerr black hole using a numerical approach exploiting a representation of the Teukolsky equation as a $2D$ elliptic partial differential equation. By combining the hyperboloidal framework with a $m$-mode decomposition, we recast the QNM problem into a genuine eigenvalue problem for each azimuthal mode. This formulation enables the simultaneous extraction of multiple QNMs, traditionally labelled by overtone number $n$ and angular index $\ell$, without requiring prior assumptions about their structure. We advocate for a simplified notation in which each overtone is uniquely labelled by a single index $q$, thereby avoiding the conventional but artificial distinction between regular and mirror modes. We compare two distinct hyperboloidal gauges-radial fixing and Cauchy horizon fixing-and demonstrate that, despite their different geometric properties and behaviour in the extremal limit, they yield numerical values for the QNM spectra with comparable accuracy and exponential convergence. Moreover, we show that strong gradients observed near the horizon in the extremal Kerr regime are coordinate artefacts of specific slicing rather than physical features. Finally, we investigate the angular structure of the QNM eigenfunctions and show that the $m$-mode approach allows flexible projection onto both spin-weighted spheroidal and spherical harmonic bases. These results underscore the robustness and versatility of the hyperboloidal $m$-mode method as a foundation for future studies of QNM stability, pseudospectra, and mode excitation in gravitational wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Generalized Misner-Sharp energy in $f(R,\mathcal{G})$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the formulation of the Misner-Sharp energy within the framework of $f(R, \mathcal{G})$ gravity, a modified theory incorporating the Ricci scalar $R$ and the Gauss-Bonnet scalar $\mathcal{G}$. By extending the quasilocal energy definition to both static spherically symmetric spacetime and the dynamic Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime, we derive explicit expressions for the generalized Misner-Sharp energy using two complementary approaches: the integration method and the conserved charge method based on the Kodama vector. Our analysis shows that the Misner-Sharp energy expression in $f(R, \mathcal{G})$ gravity reduces to standard $f(R)$ gravity results when the Gauss-Bonnet term is absent, revealing how curvature modifications influence the geometric structure and dynamics of cosmic evolution. Furthermore, we investigate the thermodynamic properties at the apparent horizon associated with the FLRW background, and we find a connection to non-equilibrium thermodynamics unique to $f(R, \mathcal{G})$ gravity. These findings underscore the subtle and fundamental role of curvature corrections in determining the energy distribution and thermodynamic behavior of gravitational systems.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum trace-free Einstein cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trace-free Einstein gravity, in the absence of matter fields and using the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric, is solvable both classically and quantum mechanically. This is achieved by using the conformal time as the time variable and the negative or positive of the inverse of the scale factor as configuration variable to write the classical equation of motion, which turns out to be the one of a free particle ($k=0$), a harmonic oscillator ($k=1$), and a repulsive oscillator ($k=-1$) in the real half-line. In all cases, the observable identified as the cosmological constant is six times the Hamiltonian. In particular, for a closed Universe ($k=1$), spacetime exhibits a cyclic evolution along which the scalar curvature is constant and finite, thereby avoiding singularities. The quantum theory is reached by using canonical quantization. We calculate the spectrum of the observable corresponding to the cosmological constant. Remarkably, for the closed Universe ($k=1$), the spectrum is discrete and positive while for flat ($k=0$) and open ($k=-1$) universes, the spectra are continuous. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle imposes limitations on the simultaneous measurement of the Hubble expansion (momentum variable) and the configuration variable. We also report the observable identified as the cosmological constant for inflaton, phantom and perfect fluids coupled to trace-free Einstein gravity in the FRW metric.</description>

      <title>Dust shell in effective loop quantum black hole model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the dynamics of a dust shell in an effective theory of spherically symmetric gravity containing quantum corrections from loop quantum gravity is investigated. To provide a consistent framework for including the dust, we go beyond the standard formulation of the effective theory by introducing an action that includes not only the effective Hamiltonian constraint, but also the diffeomorphism constraint, along with appropriate gauge-fixing and boundary terms. By adding the dust shell action and substituting vacuum solutions for the interior and exterior regions, we derive a reduced action in which only the shell radius $\mathfrak{x}$ and the exterior black hole mass appear as dynamical variables. Varying the reduced action yields the evolution equation for $\mathfrak{x}$, which is then solved numerically to explore the dynamical properties of the dust shell and the continuity properties of the metric. Finally, our approach is compared with previous studies to highlight key differences and improvements.</description>

      <title>Probing Hawking Temperature Threshold via Quantum Depletion in Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the correlation between quantum depletion and Hawking temperature in a ringshaped Bose-Einstein condensate featuring an analog black hole-white hole horizon pair, using the Bogoliubov approach. The presence of horizons is found to enhance the quantum depletion compared to horizon-free configurations, indicating a correlation between depletion and horizon dynamics. Via tuning the Hawking temperature, we observe its effect on the depletion profile. Our results show that depletion increases with Hawking temperature, and beyond a certain threshold, backreaction effects emerge, challenging the validity of the Bogoliubov approximation. We identify a viable parameter regime where the system remains both theoretically controlled and experimentally accessible, offering insight into horizon-induced quantum fluctuations, with implications for future studies of backreaction.</description>

      <title>Causality and thermodynamics in anisotropic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a thermodynamic formalism, within the particle-frame, for the energy-momentum tensor of irreversible anisotropic imperfect fluids subject to causality. Building on the Israel-Stewart extension of Eckart's theory, we further generalize these formalisms to incorporate anisotropic effects while ensuring the preservation of causality. In this framework, the second law of thermodynamics includes an additional term accounting for the system's anisotropy, which we derive explicitly in closed form for both first- and second-order theories. Notably, when anisotropy is removed, our model recovers Eckart's theory at first order and Israel-Stewart's at second order.</description>

      <title>Standardized Constraints on the Shadow Radius and the Instability of Scalar, Electromagnetic, $p$-Form, and Gravitational Perturbations of High-Dimensional Spherically Symmetric Black Holes in Einstein-power-Yang-Mills-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space-time geometry under investigation is chosen to be a high-dimensional, static, spherically symmetric solution in an asymptotically flat background within the Einstein-power-Yang-Mills-Gauss-Bonnet (EPYMGB) gravity. To address the limitations of previous shadow constraints, we construct a standardized framework based on the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini metric to constrain the characteristic parameters of high-dimensional black holes by leveraging observational shadow data. Additionally, we provide a rigorous derivation of the shadow radius formula for a general high-dimensional spherically symmetric black hole. Subsequently, we systematically and comprehensively present the equations of motion and master variables governing spin-0, spin-1, $p$-form, and spin-2 perturbations in high-dimensional static spherically symmetric flat space-time. Our analysis reveals that the Yang-Mills magnetic charge $\mathcal{Q}$ and the power $q$ have a negligible impact on both the shadow radius and perturbations of the black hole when compared to the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant ${\alpha}_2$ in various dimensions. Hence, the physical signatures of the parameters $\mathcal{Q}$ and $q$ in the black hole environment remain undetectable through either perturbation analysis or shadow observations. Cross-validation of the allowable range of ${\alpha}_2$ derived from the high-dimensional constraint on shadow radius and the dynamical stability analysis of gravitational perturbations demonstrates excellent agreement between these independent approaches. The conclusion of this cross-analysis further substantiate the accuracy of the high-dimensional shadow constraint formula proposed in this work, and we argue that this formula may serve as a universal tool for constraining the characteristic parameters of other high-dimensional spherically symmetric black hole solutions.</description>

      <title>Gravitational effects on Hong-Ou-Mandel interference in terrestrial laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the relativistic effects of Earth on Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference experiments conducted in a terrestrial laboratory. Up to the second order, we calculate the relativistic time delay from the null geodesic equation (particle perspective), and the phase shift, along with the associated effective time delay, from the Klein-Gordon equation (wave perspective). Since gravity influences both the temporal and spatial parts of the phase shift, these time delays differ and predict different coincidence probabilities. The previous HOM experiment conducted on a rotating platform shows that the wave perspective can explain the experimental results. We further explore the frame-dragging and redshift effects within an arbitrarily oriented rectangular interferometer in two distinct cases, finding that both effects can be amplified by increasing the number of light loops. Additionally, we emphasize that the next-leading order Sagnac effect, due to the gravitational acceleration, is comparable to the Thomas precession, geodetic effect, and Lense-Thirring effect. To detect the leading-order Sagnac effect and the redshift effect caused by the gravitational acceleration within the current experimental precision, we determine the number of loops photons should travel in the interferometer. Furthermore, we suggest using the difference between any two HOM patterns with different effective time delays as a probe to detect the influence of relativistic effects on quantum systems.</description>

      <title>On the role of the Parity Violating Hojman--Holst term in Gravity Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Parity Violating Gravity Theories whose gravitational Lagrangian is a generic function of the scalar curvature and the parity odd curvature pseudoscalar, commonly known as the Holst (or Hojmann) term. Generalizing some previous results in the literature, we explicitly show that if the Hessian of this function is non-degenerate, the initial non-Riemannian Theory is on-shell equivalent to a metric Scalar-Tensor Theory. The generic form of the kinetic coupling function and the scalar potential of the resulting Theory are explicitly found and reported.</description>

      <title>Conservation Laws and Boundedness for Linearised Einstein--Maxwell Equations on the Reissner--Nordstr\"om Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the linearised Einstein--Maxwell equations on the Reissner--Nordstr\"om spacetime and derive the canonical energy conservation law in double null gauge. In the spirit of the work of Holzegel and the second author, we avoid any use of the hyperbolic nature of the Teukolsky equations and rely solely on the conservation law to establish control of energy fluxes for the gauge-invariant Teukolsky variables, previously identified by the third author, along all outgoing null hypersurfaces, for charge-to-mass ratio $\frac{|Q|}{M} &lt; \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}$. This yields uniform boundedness for the Teukolsky variables in Reissner--Nordstr\"om.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical evolution of a dynamically formed spherical black hole with an inner horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we obtain a numerical self-consistent spherical solution of the semiclassical Einstein equations representing the evaporation of a trapped region which initially has both an outer and an inner horizon. The classical matter source used is a static electromagnetic field, allowing for an approximately Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole as the initial configuration, where the charge sets the initial scale of the inner horizon. The semiclassical contribution is that of a quantum scalar field in the "in" vacuum state of gravitational collapse, as encoded by the renormalised stress-energy tensor in the spherical Polyakov approximation. We analyse the rate of shrinking of the trapped region, both from Hawking evaporation of the outer apparent horizon, as well as from an outward motion of the inner horizon. We also observe that a long-lived anti-trapped region forms below the inner horizon and slowly expands outward. A black-to-white-hole transition is thus obtained from purely semiclassical dynamics.</description>

      <title>On conformal Komar currents in LRS spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For locally rotationally symmetric (LRS) spacetimes, we construct two equivalent forms of the Komar current derived from a conformal Killing vector. One is a kinematic construction and the other is in terms of the matter quantities on the spacetime. The required conservation condition for the current is derived and discussed in various instances, and the implications of the conservation of the current, and in the case of a vanishing current, are analyzed. A relationship between the conservation criterion and the presence of trapped surfaces in the spacetime is found and discussed. We also show that for LRS II metrics with constant metric time component, the current is always conserved. In the presence of a conformal Killing horizon, properties of the current are analyzed and restrictions on, and some implications for the physical spacetime variables, in the vicinity of the horizon, are obtained. Finally, with respect to the conformal Killing horizon, the associated Noether charge is shown to be proportional to the surface gravity, establishing the thermodynamic interpretation of the Noether charge.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) data from observed binary black hole coalescences (BBHC), proven to validate the Hawking Area Theorem (HAT) for black hole horizons, has been demonstrated to unambiguously pick theoretically computed logarithmic corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking Area Formula, which have a {\it negative} coefficient, when combined with the Generalized Second Law of thermodynamics. We propose a composite, `hybrid' approach to quantum gravity black hole entropy calculation, additively combining results from the non-peturbative, background-independent Loop Quantum Gravity method, with those from the perturbative (one loop), background-dependent semiclassical approach (often called `geometric' entropy) based on Euclidean Quantum Gravity. Our goal is to examine under what conditions, {\it absolute} consistency with HAT-validating GW data analyses is guaranteed. As a consequence of this demand for absolute consistency, nontrivial, albeit indirect, constraints appear to emerge on the Beyond-Standard-Model (BSM) part of the spectrum of perturbative elementary particle fluctuations in a classical black hole background. Some species of the constrained, yet-unobserved BSM particle spectrum are currently under active consideration in particle cosmology as candidates for dark matter.</description>

      <title>Shadow constraints of charged black hole with scalar hair and gravitational waves from extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole (BH) shadow observations and gravitational wave astronomy have become crucial approaches for exploring BH physics and testing gravitational theories in extreme environments. This paper investigates the charged black hole with scalar hair (CBH-SH) derived from the Einstein-Maxwell-conformal coupled scalar (EMCS) theory. We first constrain the parameter space $(Q/M, s/M^2)$ of the BH using the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of M87* and Sgr A*. The results show that M87* provides stronger constraints on positive scalar hair, constraining the scalar hair $s$ within $0\le s/M^2\le0.4632$ and the charge $Q$ within the range $0\le Q/M\le0.6806$. In contrast, Sgr A* imposes tighter constraints on negative scalar hair. When $Q$ approaches zero, $s$ is constrained within the range $0\geq s/M^2\geq-0.0277$. Overall, EHT observations can provide constraints at most on the order of $\mathcal{O}\left({10}^{-1}\right)$. Subsequently, we construct extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) systems and calculate their gravitational waves to assess the detection capability of the LISA detector for these BHs. The results indicate that for central BHs of $M={10}^6M_\odot$, LISA is expected to detect scalar hair $s/M^2$ at the $\mathcal{O}\left({10}^{-4}\right)$ level and charge $Q/M$ at the $\mathcal{O}\left({10}^{-2}\right)$ level, with detection sensitivity far exceeding the current EHT capabilities. This demonstrates the immense potential of EMRI gravitational wave observations in testing EMCS theory.</description>

      <title>Periodic Orbits and Gravitational Wave Radiation of Black Holes in 4D-EGB gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we study the dynamical behavior of a particle around a charged black hole within the framework of 4D-EGB gravity theory. Based on the spacetime metric of the black hole, we rigorously derived the effective potential of the particle and analyzed the particle's MBO and ISCO. The results show that the key physical quantities of MBO and ISCO-including orbital radius, angular momentum, and energy-all exhibit significant dependence on parameter $\alpha$ and charge $Q$. As these two parameters increase, the energy-angular momentum ($E, L$) region required for particle bound orbits shifts towards lower ($E, L$) areas. Furthermore, in order to assess the validity of the chosen values for parameter $\alpha$ and charge $Q$, a rigorous constraint on these parameters is imposed in this paper, utilizing observational data from the black hole shadows of $M87^{\ast }$ and $Sgr A^{\ast }$ and precession observations of the $S2$ star. Finally, we analyzed the periodic orbits of particle and their generated gravitational waveforms under different parameter values. We found that changes in parameter $\alpha$ and charge $Q$ lead to significant differences in the periodic trajectories of the particle and their corresponding gravitational waveforms.</description>

Abstract: We present static axially symmetric fluid distributions not producing gravitational field outside their boundaries (i.e. fluid sources which match smoothly on the boundary surface to Minkowski space-time). These solutions provide further examples of ghost stars. A specific model is fully described, and its physical and geometrical properties are analyzed in detail. This includes the multipole moment structure of the source and its complexity factors, both of which vanish for our solution.</description>

      <title>Trust the process: mapping data-driven reconstructions to informed models using stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave astronomy has entered a regime where it can extract information about the population properties of the observed binary black holes. The steep increase in the number of detections will offer deeper insights, but it will also significantly raise the computational cost of testing multiple models. To address this challenge, we propose a procedure that first performs a non-parametric (data-driven) reconstruction of the underlying distribution, and then remaps these results onto a posterior for the parameters of a parametric (informed) model. The computational cost is primarily absorbed by the initial non-parametric step, while the remapping procedure is both significantly easier to perform and computationally cheaper. In addition to yielding the posterior distribution of the model parameters, this method also provides a measure of the model's goodness-of-fit, opening for a new quantitative comparison across models.</description>

      <title>Viscosity in Isotropic Cosmological Backgrounds in General Relativity and Starobinsky Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general analysis of the role of shear viscosity in cosmological backgrounds, focusing on isotropic space-time in both Einstein and $f(R)$ gravity. By computing the divergence of the stress-energy tensor in a general class of isotropic (but not necessarily homogeneous) geometries, we show that shear viscosity does not contribute to the background dynamics when the fluid is comoving. This result holds in both the Jordan and Einstein frames, and implies that shear viscosity cannot affect the electromagnetic luminosity distance which is determined by the background light-like geodesics. As an application of our results, we critically examine recent claims that shear viscosity can alter the Hubble evolution and the electromagnetic luminosity distance in Starobinsky gravity. We demonstrate that the continuity equation used in that work is at odds both with the covariant conservation of the stress-energy tensor and the local second law of thermodynamics. We further show that even in models where such modifications could mimic bulk viscosity, the resulting entropy evolution is inconsistent with standard thermodynamic expectations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new conformal symmetry of stationary, axisymmetric Kerr perturbations. This symmetry is exact but non-geometric (or "hidden"), and each of its generators has an associated infinite family of eigenstate solutions. Tidal perturbations of a black hole form an irreducible highest-weight representation of this conformal group, while the tidal response fields live in a different such representation. This implies that black holes have no tidal deformability, or vanishing Love numbers.</description>

      <title>Ruling out nonlinear modifications of quantum theory with contextuality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear modifications of quantum theory are considered potential candidates for the theory of quantum gravity, with the intuitive argument that since Einstein field equations are nonlinear, quantum gravity should be nonlinear as well. Contextuality is a property of quantum systems that forbids the explanation of prepare-and-measure experiments in terms of classical hidden variable models with suitable properties. We show that some well-known nonlinear modifications of quantum mechanics, namely the Deutsch's map, the Weinberg's model, and the Schr\"odinger - Newton equation, map a contextual set of states to a non-contextual one. That is, the considered nonlinear modifications of quantum theory allow for the existence of classical hidden variable models for certain experimental setups. This enables us to design experiments that would rule out the considered nonlinear modifications of quantum theory by verifying that the system remains contextual, or, equivalently, our results highlight a mechanism how nonlinear modification of quantum theory may lead to weak wave function collapse and ultimately to the solution of the measurement problem.</description>

      <title>Entanglement suppression and quantum scars in a three-oscillator gravitational analogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum correlations in a tripartite system of coupled harmonic oscillators, modeling mediator-induced interactions akin to those in quantum gravity proposals. Surprisingly, despite the system's integrability, we identify regimes where bipartite entanglement between distant oscillators vanishes even with non-zero quantum couplings. In the Heavy Mediator Regime, entanglement is restricted to sharply localized islands in parameter space, surrounded by extended regions of suppression, analogous to quantum scars in non-integrable systems. Fidelity analysis reveal that these low-entanglement states exhibit dynamical stability and spectral signatures reminiscent of quantum scars in non-integrable systems, suggesting a continuous-variable analogue of scarring tied to hidden phase-space symmetries. The Light Mediator Regime, by contrast, displays smooth entanglement generation. These results challenge entanglement-based tests of quantum gravity: the absence of entanglement need not imply classical mediation but may instead reflect a mediator dynamically constrained to a quantum subspace-akin to gravitational memory or decoherence-free subspaces. Our findings emphasize the necessity of probing the mediator's dynamical regime to unambiguously diagnose quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>An apologia for islands</title>

Abstract: Entanglement islands have played a key role in the recent derivation of the Page curve and other progress on the black hole information problem. Arising from the inclusion of connected wormhole saddles in a gravitational replica trick, islands signal that degrees of freedom in the black hole interior are not microscopically independent of the exterior Hawking radiation. Islands were originally discovered in the context of AdS/CFT coupled to an external, nongravitating reservoir, where the coupling gives graviton excitations an anomalous boundary scaling dimension (or "mass"). It has been claimed in the literature that this mass is crucial for the existence of islands and even the Page curve itself. In this paper, however, we explain how entanglement islands can also appear in setups with massless gravitons and no external reservoir, giving a number of examples including the entanglement wedges of boundary CFT regions, of radiation at null infinity in asymptotically flat spacetimes, and of radiation inside a semiclassical but gravitating spacetime. In each case, the Page curve is physically observable and can be determined with sufficiently careful experiments on many copies of the black hole. We give general arguments for the existence of gauge-invariant operators in gravity which are compactly supported to all orders in perturbation theory (whenever no isometries of the background spacetime exist) and refine a recently-proposed explicit construction of such operators. When applied to islands, these results -- together with entanglement wedge reconstruction -- guarantee that semiclassical operators in the island can be approximated by nonperturbative operators on the Hawking radiation.</description>

      <title>Mitigation of the Flexing-Filtering Effect in Time-Delay Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In early 2024, ESA formally adopted the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) space mission with the aim of measuring gravitational waves emitted in the millihertz range. The constellation employs three spacecraft that exchange laser beams to form interferometric measurements over a distance of 2.5 million kilometers. The measurements will then be telemetered down to Earth at a lower sampling frequency. Anti-aliasing filters will be used on board to limit spectral folding of out-of-band laser noise. The dominant noise in these measurements is laser frequency noise which does not cancel naturally in LISA's unequal-arm heterodyne interferometers. Suppression of this noise requires time-shifting of the data using delay operators to build virtual beam paths that simulate equal-arm interferometers. The non-commutativity of these delay operators and on-board filters manifests as a noise (flexing-filtering) that significantly contributes to the noise budget. This non-commutativity is a consequence of the non-flatness of the filter in-band. Attenuation of this noise requires high-order and computationally expensive filters, putting additional demands on the spacecraft. The following work studies an alternative method to reduce this flexing filtering noise via the introduction of a modified delay operator that accounts for the non-commutativity with the filter in the delay operation itself. Our approach allows us to reduce the flexing-filtering noise by over six orders of magnitude whilst reducing the dependency on the flatness of the filter. The work is supplemented by numerical simulations of the data processing chain that compare the results with those of the standard approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new UV-complete dark energy model which is \underbar{\it neither} a cosmological constant nor a slowly rolling scalar field. Our dark energy is the flux of a top form in a hidden sector gauge theory similar to QCD. The top form controls the vacuum energy generated by dark sector CP violation. Its flux discharges by the nucleation of membranes that source it. The tension and charge of the membranes are set by the chiral symmetry breaking scale $\sim 10^{-3} eV$, and the dark energy is a transient. It decays on the order of the current age of the universe. The decays decrease dark energy discretely and randomly, instead of gradually like rolling scalars. Since the decay rate is close to the present Hubble scale, $\Gamma \ga H_0^4$, in a time $\sim {\cal O}(1/H_0)$ the cosmic acceleration may even cease altogether.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Induced Proton Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel theoretical framework in which proton decay is induced by the dark matter. While proton decay requires violation of the $B+L$ symmetry, dark matter stability often relies on the presence of an unbroken symmetry. These seemingly distinct phenomena are unified through the global $U(1)_{B+L}$ symmetry inherent in the Standard Model. Its spontaneous breaking leads to a residual $Z_4$ symmetry, which ensures dark matter stability and forbids proton decay at tree level. Consequently, proton decay occurs at the one-loop level, mediated by dark sector particles. The proton lifetime is linked with the dark matter, the heavier dark matter mass enhancing proton stability, and vice versa. The $\mathcal{O}$(TeV) masses of the mediators remain consistent with current proton lifetime limits, making them accessible to experimental searches. In particular, the leptoquark mediating proton decay, carrying exotic $B+L$ charges, leads to a distinctive signature in collider searches. By intertwining proton decay, dark matter stability, and collider phenomenology, this framework offers distinctive signatures that can be probed in current and future experiments.</description>

      <title>A novel test of gravity: Does spacetime geometry track matter density?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel test of gravity that combines galaxy clustering with gravitational lensing. In general relativity, the evolution of matter density fluctuations and of the Weyl potential -- the sum of spatial and temporal distortions of the geometry -- are governed by the same growth function. In contrast, alternative theories of gravity that modify the relation between geometry and matter content can lead to differences in these two growths. Exploiting a recent method to directly measure the Weyl potential, we construct a null test that deviates from zero if and only if there is a mismatch between the growth rate of density and that of geometry distortions. We show that changes in the background expansion due to alternative dark energy models and additional forces in the dark matter sector induce no deviations in this test, making it a robust probe for detecting departures from general relativity. Applying the test to current data, we find no evidence of deviation. From an initial $z_*=10$ to $z\sim 0.5$, we constrain the evolution of the Weyl potential to track that of the density to within 33\%. Combining stage-IV surveys will improve the precision across a broad redshift range, limiting differences between the two evolutions to below $2-4\%$.</description>

      <title>Reflections on Noether's second theorem and the energy-momentum tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through symmetry of the action under global spacetime translations, Noether's first theorem infamously entails an energy-momentum tensor (EMT) that is neither symmetric nor gauge-invariant. In a prior work [Phys. Rev. D 106, 125012 (2022)], I had obtained a symmetric and gauge-invariant EMT by using Noether's second theorem instead, with local spacetime translations as the symmetry group. However, the derivation therein was flawed, containing a faulty assumption about the transformation rule for spinor fields. In this work, I revisit the derivation of [Phys. Rev. D 106, 125012 (2022)], both correcting the faulty step and simplifying the derivation for broader accessibility. The end result is an EMT for quantum chromodynamics that is gauge-invariant, but not symmetric.</description>

Abstract: We consider a three-dimensional gravity model that includes (non-linear) Maxwell and Chern-Simons-like terms, allowing for the existence of electrically charged rotating black hole solutions with a static electromagnetic potential. We verify that a Cardy-like formula, based not on central charges but on the mass of the uncharged and non-spinning soliton, obtained via a double Wick rotation of the neutral static black hole solution, accurately reproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Furthermore, we show that a slight generalization of this model, incorporating a dilatonic field and extra gauge fields, admits charged and rotating black hole solutions with asymptotic Lifshitz behavior. The entropy of these solutions can likewise be derived using the Cardy-like formula, with the Lifshitz-type soliton serving as the ground state. Based on these results, we propose a generalized Cardy-like formula that successfully reproduces the semiclassical entropy in all the studied cases.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of synthetic null hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a synthetic framework for the geometric and analytic study of null (lightlike) hypersurfaces in non-smooth spacetimes. Drawing from optimal transport and recent advances in Lorentzian geometry and causality theory, we define a synthetic null hypersurface as a triple $(H, G, \mathfrak{m})$: $H$ is a closed achronal set in a topological causal space, $G$ is a gauge function encoding affine parametrizations along null generators, and $\mathfrak{m}$ is a Radon measure serving as a synthetic analog of the rigged measure. This generalizes classical differential geometric structures to potentially singular spacetimes.
  A central object is the synthetic null energy condition ($\mathsf{NC}^e(N)$), defined via the concavity of an entropy power functional along optimal transport, with parametrization given by the gauge $G$. This condition is invariant under changes of gauge and measure within natural equivalence classes. It agrees with the classical Null Energy Condition in the smooth setting and it applies to low-regularity spacetimes. A key property of $\mathsf{NC}^e(N)$ is the stability under convergence of synthetic null hypersurfaces, inspired by measured Gromov--Hausdorff convergence.
  As a first application, we obtain a synthetic version of Hawking's area theorem. Moreover, we obtain various sharpenings of the celebrated Penrose's singularity theorem: for smooth spacetimes we show that the incomplete null geodesic whose existence is guaranteed by Penrose's argument is actually maximizing; we extend Penrose's singularity theorem to continuous spacetimes; we prove the existence of trapped regions in the general setting of topological causal spaces satisfying the synthetic $\mathsf{NC}^e(N)$.</description>

      <title>Diffeomorphism invariance of the effective gravitational action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate on the diffeomorphism invariance of the effective gravitational action, focusing in particular on the path integral measure. In the literature, two different measures are mainly considered, the Fradkin-Vilkovisky and the Fujikawa one. With the help of detailed calculations, we show that, despite claims to the contrary, the Fradkin-Vilkovisky measure is diffeomorphism invariant, while the Fujikawa measure is not. In particular, we see that, contrary to naive expectations, the presence of $g^{00}$ factors in the Fradkin-Vilkovisky measure is necessary to ensure the invariance of the effective gravitational action. We also comment on results recently appeared in the literature, and show that formal calculations can easily miss delicate points.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave constraints on the primordial black hole dominated early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.08151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the gravitational waves (GWs) induced by the density fluctuations due to inhomogeneous distribution of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the case where PBHs eventually dominate and reheat the universe by Hawking evaporation. The initial PBH density fluctuations are isocurvature in nature. We find that most of the induced GWs are generated right after evaporation, when the universe transits from the PBH dominated era to the radiation dominated era and the curvature perturbation starts to oscillate wildly. The strongest constraint on the amount of the produced GWs comes from the big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). We improve previous constraints on the PBH fraction and find that it cannot exceed $10^{-3}$. Furthermore, this maximum fraction decreases as the mass increases and reaches $10^{-9}$ for $M_{\rm PBH}\sim 5\times10^8 {\rm g}$, which is the largest mass allowed by the BBN constraint on the reheating temperature. Considering that PBH may cluster above a given clustering scale, we also derive a lower bound on the scale of clustering. Interestingly, the GW spectrum for $M_{\rm PBH}\sim 10^4 -10^8 {\rm g}$ enters the observational window of LIGO and DECIGO and could be tested in the future. Although we focus on the PBH dominated early universe in this paper, our methodology is applicable to any model with early isocurvature perturbation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Propagation in a Geometric Condensate in Starobinsky Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a new paradigm for cosmology: a time dependent scalar condensate background originated from the quadratic $(R + \alpha R^2)$ Starobinski model, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar and $\alpha$ the coupling constant. In weak gravity limit the system decouples into a conventional graviton and a higher derivative scalar. It was shown earlier through works from our group, \cite{ssg,sg,us}, that the latter can sustain an oscillatory lowest energy configuration or a {\it{Geometric Condensate}} as it consists entirely of metric degrees of freedom. In the present work, we study Gravitational Wave propagation in this condensate background. We show that the explicit time dependent nature of the condensate can generate curvature and radiation-like contributions in the scale factor evolution in FLRW cosmology. Subsequently the condensate leaves its signature on the Gravitational Wave profile as it propagates in the condensate modified FLRW spacetime. The wave profile is calculated analytically in terms of Whittaker functions. The main novelty of the Geometric Condensate scheme is that no external (condensate) matter from outside has been considered.</description>

      <title>The massive BMS character in 3D quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the one-loop partition function for three-dimensional quantum gravity in a finite-radius thermal twisted flat space with a conical defect, reproducing the massive BMS$_3$ character. We perform the computation in both discrete and continuum geometry formulations, showing consistency between them. In the discrete case, we integrate out bulk degrees of freedom in a Regge gravity framework, while in the continuum, we construct a dual non-local boundary field theory encoding geodesic length fluctuations. Our study shows that the additional modes of the massive character, compared to the vacuum case, originate from the explicit breaking of radial diffeomorphism symmetry by the defect. This provides a concrete geometric mechanism in Regge gravity, tracing the appearance of massive BMS$_3$ particles to diffeomorphism breaking by conical defects, and highlights the broader relevance of discrete geometry approaches to quantum gravity with matter.</description>

      <title>Non-Affine Extensions of the Raychaudhuri Equation in the K-essence Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new avenue of the Raychaudhuri Equation (RE) by introducing a non-affine parametrization within the k-essence framework. This modification accounts for non-geodesic flow curves, leading to emergent repulsive effects in cosmic evolution. Using a DBI-type k-essence Lagrangian, we derive a modified RE and demonstrate its ability to address the Hubble tension while predicting a natural emergence of a dynamical dark energy equation of state. Our Bayesian analysis, constrained by cosmological data, supports the theoretical scaling relation of the k-essence field ($\dot{\phi}$) and the cosmic scale factor ($a$). Furthermore, we reinterpret the modified RE as an anti-damped harmonic oscillator, we found a caustic avoidance signature, it may reveal classical or quantum-like effects in cosmic expansion. These results suggest a deep connection between scalar field dynamics and modified gravity, offering new perspectives on the nature of the expansion history of the universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present study, we analyze the effects of violation of Lorentz symmetry for black-bounce solutions in a $k$-essence theory that has the form of a power law for the configuration $n=1/3$. We perform such analysis for a known model explored in previous work $\Sigma^2=x^2+a^2$ and complement the proposal with a new black-bounce model for the area functions $\Sigma^2_1=\sqrt{x^4+d^4}$. This model has the Schwarzschild-de Sitter asymptomatic behavior for $x\to{-\infty}$, and we investigate the scalar field, potential, and energy conditions for both models. We have shown that the violation of Lorentz symmetry can be generated through $k$-essence without the need for an additional field. These results corroborate the validation of other previously investigated wormhole solutions.</description>

      <title>Mapping 1+1-dimensional black hole thermodynamics to finite volume effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Both black hole thermodynamics and finite volume effects in quantum field theory violate the null energy condition. Motivated by this, we compare thermodynamic features between two $1+1$-dimensional systems: (i) a scalar field confined to a periodic spatial interval of length $a$ and tunneling between two degenerate vacua; (ii) a dilatonic black hole at temperature $T$ in the presence of matter fields. If we identify $a\propto T^{-1}$, we find similar thermodynamic behaviour, which suggests some deeper connection arising from the presence of non-trivial boundary conditions in both systems. We then extend our results to $2+1$ and $3+1$-dimensions and, although a more complete study is necessary, the connection found in $1+1$-dimensions seems to be valid in higher dimensions too.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12687v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: : In this note, we study an extra dimension effect on the black hole chemistry in the 8-dimensional Einstein-Yang-Mills-Maxwell theory. The base spacetime contains 4- dimensional compact manifolds and an instanton on top of those. We demonstrate how the extra dimensions affect the phase transition and viable black hole sizes in the 4-dimensional Einstein frame through the black hole chemistry. We focus on asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes for the effective 4-dimensional model obtained by a dimensional reduction. The extra-dimension size determines thermodynamic pressure, and the thermodynamic volume is roughly the horizon size of black holes. Thus, the extra dimension and black hole sizes are related as a conjugate pair of thermodynamic variables.</description>

      <title>Assessing cosmological evidence for non-minimal coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent observational evidence of deviations from the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model points towards the presence of evolving dark energy. The simplest possibility consists of a cosmological scalar field $\varphi$, dubbed quintessence, driving the accelerated expansion. We assess the evidence for the existence of such a scalar field. We find that, if the accelerated expansion is driven by quintessence, the data favour a potential energy $V(\varphi)$ that is concave, i.e., $m^2=d^2V/d\varphi^2&lt;0$. Furthermore, and more significantly, the data strongly favour a scalar field that is non-minimally coupled to gravity (Bayes factor $\log(B) = 7.34 \pm 0.6$), leading to time variations in the gravitational constant on cosmological scales, and the existence of fifth forces on smaller scales. The fact that we do not observe such fifth forces implies that either new physics must come into play on non-cosmological scales or that quintessence is an unlikely explanation for the observed cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Black holes with electroweak hair -- the detailed derivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a very detailed derivation of solutions describing hairy black holes within the gravity-coupled Weinberg-Salam theory, which were previously reported in \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.171402}{Phys.Rev.Lett. 133 (2024) 171402}. These black holes support a strong magnetic field that polarizes the electroweak vacuum and creates a condensate of massive fields carrying superconducting currents along the black hole horizon. The currents, in turn, generate a ``corona'' of magnetic vortex segments attached to the horizon at both ends. The condensate and corona together constitute the black hole hair. The extremal solutions approach, in the far field, the magnetic Reissner-Nordstr\"om configuration, with a total mass that is {\it lower} than the total charge, $M&lt;|Q|$, due to the negative Zeeman energy of the condensate. This makes the removal of the hair energetically unfavorable. The maximally hairy black holes exhibit masses comparable to terrestrial values, with approximately 11\% of their total mass stored in the hair. Given that these solutions arise within a well-tested theoretical framework, they are likely to have physical relevance.</description>

      <title>Thermal Product Formula for Shear Modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the validity of the thermal product formula proposed in [arXiv:2304.12339], for the shear channel fluctuations of R-charged black branes in five-dimensional AdS where the shear mode is coupled with charge diffusion mode at non-zero momentum. When these modes are suitably decoupled, we are able to obtain an exact formula for the two point functions of the boundary current and energy-momentum tensor in terms of the quasinormal modes of this channel. This exact formula is a simple modification of the previous version of the product formula. We also obtain a similar formula for the case involving a boundary global R-symmetry anomaly, when we have a bulk Chern-Simons term which introduces additional couplings in the shear channel. Also based on insights from the quasinormal mode spectrum, we report on an instability as well as the presence of high momentum long-lived modes associated with large values of the anomaly coefficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider 3D and 4D asymptotically flat spacetimes near future null infinity endowed with the most general allowed Carroll geometry. We define a boundary energy-momentum tensor by varying the on-shell action with respect to the Carroll metric data. This requires adding counterterms to the Einstein-Hilbert action. We show that, in 4D, the shear is on par with the Carroll metric data. Their combined response defines a boundary energy-momentum-news complex whose diffeomorphism Ward identity is equivalent to the Bondi mass and angular momentum loss equations. Weyl invariance leads to an identity for the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, and local Carroll boosts are anomalous in 3D and in 4D.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a two-parameter phenomenological extension of the $\Lambda$CDM model in which the equation of state parameter of the ``dust'' fluid becomes different from zero for redshifts below a transition value $z_t$. Using data from DESI DR2 BAO, DESY5 Sn~Ia and CMB distance priors ($R,l_A,\omega_b$) data, we compare our model with the standard CPL parameterization $w_0-w_a$ for dynamical dark energy. Using the Deviance Information Criteria (DIC), we find that the two models are essentially indistinguishable ($\Delta$DIC $&lt;$ 2) and preferred over $\Lambda$CDM with a significance $\geq 3 \sigma$. We discuss how this parameterization finds a natural interpretation in the context of cosmological backreaction and derive a prediction for the evolution of the growth factor, discussing its impact on low redshift $f\sigma_8$ measurements.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Bremsstrahlung in Black-Hole Scattering at $\mathcal{O}(G^3)$: Quadratic-in-Spin Effects</title>

Abstract: We are employing a supersymmetric variant of the worldline quantum field theory (WQFT) formalism to compute the far-field momentum-space gravitational waveform emitted during the scattering of two spinning black holes at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the post-Minkowskian expansion. Our results are accurate up to quadratic-in-spin contributions, which means we report for the very first time the waveform observable at the order $\mathcal{O}(G^3\mathcal{S}^2)$. Our computation is based on mapping $n$-body tree-level amplitudes in such a way that we can obtain the $(n-2)$-loop two-body waveform integrand. We discuss in detail this procedure and highlight the similarity of the resulting structures with those obtained in the scattering-amplitude approach. As a by product of our computational approach, we also obtain, for the first time, the leading-order waveform for three-body scattering of spinning black holes. We validated our results in various ways but most notably, we find exact agreement for the NLO waveform integrand obtained from the WQFT and the classical limit of scattering amplitudes in QFT.</description>

      <title>LSZ ghostbusters in the quadratic gravity stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present letter considers the quantization method developed in [1]-[9], which postulates that, in several situations, negative norm or ghost states can be avoided in order to give positive probabilities. These authors also postulate a candidate for a path integral for those theories, following pioneer works initiated by Dirac [10]} and Pauli \[11]. However, taking into account the non standard oscillator algebra inherent to this method, It is of interest the derivation of the LSZ rules in this context, since it may not be clear at first sight that has the usual form of the textbooks, due to the non standard oscillator algebra and the redefinitions of the states.This is done here, applied to Stelle gravity [12]-[13]. In addition, an equivalent but simpler way to deal with negative norm states is worked out, in which hermiticity is more explicit. As far as we understand, our conclusions fully agree with the arguments and expectations of those authors.</description>
