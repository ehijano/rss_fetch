      <title>Asymptotically rigid mapping class groups of infinite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study asymptotically rigid mapping class groups of certain infinite graphs. We determine their finiteness properties and show that these depend on the number of ends of the underlying graph. In a special case where the graph has finitely many ends, we construct an explicit presentation for the so-called pure graph Houghton group and investigate several of its algebraic and geometric properties. Additionally, we show that the graph Houghton groups are not commensurable with other known Houghton-type groups, namely the classical, surface, braided, handlebody, and doubled handlebody Houghton groups, demonstrating that this graph-based construction defines a genuinely new class of groups.</description>

      <title>On a construction of stable maps from 3-manifolds into surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any link $L$ in the 3-sphere, we give a visual construction of a stable map $f$ from the 3-sphere into the real plane enjoying the following properties; $f$ has no cusp point, the set of definite fold points of $f$ coincides with the given link $L$ and $f$ only has certain type of fibers containing two indefinite fold points. Moreover, this $f$ induces a similar stable map from a 3-manifold $M$ into the 2-sphere, where $M$ is obtained from the 3-sphere by integral Dehn surgery along $L$.</description>

      <title>Colored knot Floer homology: structures and examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the $S^n$ colored version of Khovanov and Khovanov-Rozansky homology, we define a colored version of knot Floer homology by studying the colimit of a directed system of link Floer homology with infinite full twists. Specifically, our $n$-colored knot Floer homology of a knot $K$ is then defined as the colimit of the link Floer homology of $(n, mn)$-cables of $K$ by fixing $n$ and letting $m$ goes to infinity. We show that the colimit of the infinite full twists is a module over the colored knot Floer homology of the unknot. In addition, we give an explicit description of colored Heegaard Floer homology for L-space knots, and maps for colored knot Floer homology of crossing changes.</description>

      <title>In Search of Homology for Quasigroups of Bol-Moufang Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate (co)homology theory for quasigroups of Bol-Moufang type based on analysis of their extensions by affine quasigroups of the same type. We use these extensions to define second and third boundary operations, $\partial_2(x,y)$ and $\partial_3(x,y,z)$, respectively. We use these definitions to compute the second homology groups for several examples from the work of Phillips and Vojtechovsky. We speculate about the relation between these homology groups and those obtained from a small category with coefficients in a functor.</description>

      <title>A framework for proving quantum modularity: Application to Witten's asymptotic expansion conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address two linked problems at the interface of quantum topology and number theory: deriving asymptotic expansions of the Witten--Reshetikhin--Turaev invariants for 3-manifolds and establishing quantum modularity of false theta functions. Previous progress covers Seifert homology 3-spheres for the former and rank-one cases for the latter, both of which rely on single-variable integral representations. We extend these results to negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds and to general false theta functions, respectively. We address this limitation by developing two techniques: a Poisson summation formula with signature and a framework of modular series, both of which enable a precise and explicit analysis of multivariable integral representations. As further applications, our method yields a unified approach to proving quantum modularity for false theta functions, indefinite theta functions, and for Eisenstein series of odd weight.</description>

      <title>Equivariant instanton homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01091</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.01091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define four versions of equivariant instanton Floer homology ($I^+, I^-, I^\infty$ and $\widetilde I$) for a class of 3-manifolds and $SO(3)$-bundles over them including all rational homology spheres. These versions are analogous to the four flavors of monopole and Heegaard Floer homology theories. This construction is functorial for a large class of 4-manifold cobordisms, and agrees with Donaldson's definition of equivariant instanton homology for integer homology spheres. Furthermore, one of our invariants is isomorphic to Floer's instanton homology for admissible bundles, and we calculate $I^\infty$ in all cases it is defined, away from characteristic 2.
  The appendix, possibly of independent interest, defines an algebraic construction of three equivariant homology theories for dg-modules over a dg-algebra, the equivariant homology $H^+(A,M)$, the coBorel homology $H^-(A,M)$, and the Tate homology $H^\infty(A,M)$. The constructions of the appendix are used to define our invariants.</description>

      <title>Random walks and the symplectic representation of the braid group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.00984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the symplectic representation $\rho_n$ of a braid group $B(n)$ in $Sp(2l,\mathbb{Z})$, for $l=\Big[\dfrac{n-1}{2}\Big]$. If $P$ is a polynomial on the $4l^2$ coefficients of the matrices in $Sp(2l,\mathbb{Z})$, we show that the set $\{\beta\in B(n): P(\rho_n(\beta))=0\}$ is transient for non degenerate random walks on $B(n)$.
  We derive that the $n$-braids $\beta$ which close into a loop $\hat{\beta}$ with $0&lt;|det({\hat{\beta}})|\leq C$ for some constant $C$ form a transient set. And given a prime number $p$, we show that the probability for a given braid to close in a $p$-colorable loop is greater than $\dfrac{1}{p}$.
  We also derive that for a random $3$-braid, the quasipositive links $(\beta\sigma_i\beta^{-1}\sigma_j)^p$ have zero signature for every integer $p$ and $1\leq i,j\leq 2$. \\ As an example of such braids, we investigate the signature of the Lissajous toric knots $3$-braids.</description>

Abstract: We present short proofs of Tverberg-type theorems for cell complexes by S. Hasui, D. Kishimoto, M. Takeda, and M. Tsutaya. One of them states that for any prime power $r$, any complex $X$ topologically homeomorphic to $S^{(d+1)(r-1)-1}$, and any continuous map $f:X\to\mathbb R^d$ there are pairwise disjoint faces $\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_r$ of $X$ such that $f(\sigma_1)\cap\ldots f(\sigma_r)\ne\emptyset$.</description>

Abstract: Let $S$ and $S'$ be orientable finite-type surfaces of genus $g\geq 4$ and $g'$, respectively. We prove that every multitwist-preserving map between pure mapping class groups $\text{PMap}(S)\to \text{PMap}(S')$ is induced by a multi-embedding. As an application, we classify all homomorphisms $\text{PMap}(S)\to \text{PMap}(S')$ for $g\geq 4$ and $g' \leq 6\cdot 2^{g-4}$.</description>

      <title>From disc patterns in the plane to character varieties of knot groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13829v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by an experimental study of groups generated by reflections in planar patterns of tangent circles, we describe some methods for constructing and studying representation spaces of holonomy groups of infinite volume hyperbolic $3$-manifolds that arise from unknotting tunnels of links. We include full descriptions of our computational methods, which were guided by simplicity and generality rather than by being particularly efficient in special cases. This makes them easy for non-experts to understand and implement to produce visualisations that can suggest conjectures and support algebraic calculations in the character variety. Throughout, we have tried to make the exposition clear and understandable for graduate students in geometric topology and related fields.</description>

      <title>Spectral Networks: Bridging higher-rank Teichm\"uller theory and BPS states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This book offers a comprehensive introduction to spectral networks from a unified viewpoint that bridges geometry with the physics of supersymmetric gauge theories. It provides the foundational background needed to approach the frontiers of this rapidly evolving field, treating geometric and physical aspects in parallel. After surveying fundamental topics in algebra and geometry, a detailed introduction to higher-rank Teichm\"uller theory is developed, including Fock-Goncharov theory for Hitchin representations, maximal representations and the more recent notion of $\Theta$-positivity. Spectral networks are subsequently introduced, emphasizing their utility in the study of character varieties via the abelianization and non-abelianization maps they define. In parallel, key aspects of four-dimensional gauge dynamics with eight supercharges are explored, including electric-magnetic duality, Seiberg-Witten theory, and class $\mathcal S$ theories. The role of spectral networks as a framework for determining and analyzing BPS spectra in class $\mathcal S$ theories is then examined. The final chapter outlines recent applications of spectral networks across a range of contemporary research areas. This volume is intended for researchers and advanced students in either mathematics or physics who wish to enter the field.</description>

      <title>On geometric bases for A-polynomials II: $\mathfrak{su}_3$ and Kuberberg bracket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of quantum A-polynomials -- equations for knot polynomials with respect to their coloring (representation-dependence) -- as the relations between different links, obtained by hanging additional ``simple'' components on the original knot. Depending on the choice of this ``decoration'', the knot polynomial is either multiplied by a number or decomposes into a sum over ``surrounding'' representations by a cabling procedure. What happens is that these two of decorations, when complicated enough, become dependent -- and this provides an equation. Remarkably it can be made independent of the representation. However, the equivalence of links is not a topological property -- it follows from the properties of $R$-matrices, and strongly depends on the choice the gauge group and particular links. The relatively well studied part of the story concerns $\mathfrak{su}_2$, where $R$-matrices can be chosen in an especially convenient Kauffman form, what makes the derivation of equations rather geometrical. To make these geometric methods somewhat simpler we suggest to use an arcade formalism/representation of the braid group to simplify decorating links universally. Here we attempt to extend this technique to the next case, $\mathfrak{su}_3$, where the Kauffman rule is substituted by a more involved Kuberberg rule, still remains more geometric than generic analysis of MOY-diagrams, needed for higher ranks. Already in this case we encounter a classification problem for possible ``decorations'' and emergence of two-lined Young diagrams in enumeration of representations.</description>
