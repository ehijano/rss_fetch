      <title>Representation of Symmetric Shift Registers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this work is to establish a mathematical framework for the study of symmetric shift registers over the field GF(2). The present paper gives a new approach where the symmetric shift registers are represented by associated systems of nonlinear difference equations. Arithmetical progressions will play a central part. This approach clarifies the underlying structures and makes it easier to determine the minimal periods of the sequences generated by the symmetric shift registers. Key words: Shift registers, nonlinear difference equations, periods, arithmetical progressions, GF(2).</description>

      <title>A Completion Result for Partial Affine and Inversive Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A partial affine plane of order $n$ is a point-line incidence structure with $n^2$ points and $n$ points on each line, such that every two lines meet in at most one point. In this paper, we show that a partial affine plane of order $n$, $n$ sufficiently large, in which parallelism is an equivalence relation, containing more than $n^2-\sqrt{n}$ lines, can be completed to an affine plane, thus improving the $40$-year old bound of [S. Dow. A completion problem for finite affine planes. Combinatorica, 6:321--325, 1986.] Furthermore, we derive a higher-dimensional result about the completion of $2$-$(n^d,n,1)$-designs, as well as for partial inversive spaces. In particular, we show that a partial $3$-$(n^2+1,n+1,1)$-design for which in every derived structure, parallelism is an equivalence relation, and there are at least $n^2+n-\sqrt{n}$ lines, can be completed to an inversive plane.</description>

      <title>A proof of the Fields Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The {\em superspace ring} of rank $n$ is the algebra $\Omega_n$ of differential forms on affine $n$-space. The algebra $\Omega_n$ is bigraded with respect to polynomial and exterior degree and carries a natural action of the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$. Modding out by $\mathfrak{S}_n$-invariants with vanishing constant term yields the {\em superspace coinvariant ring} $SR_n$. We prove that, as an ungraded $\mathfrak{S}_n$-module, the space $SR_n$ is isomorphic to the sign-twisted permutation action of $\mathfrak{S}_n$ on ordered set partitions of $\{1,\dots,n\}$. We refine this result by calculating the bigraded $\mathfrak{S}_n$-isomorphism type of $SR_n$. This proves the Fields Conjectures of N. Bergeron, L. Colmenarejo, S.-X. Li, J. Machacek, R. Sulzgruber, and M. Zabrocki as well as a related conjecture of V. Reiner.</description>

      <title>Code-based $[3,1]$-avoiders in finite affine spaces $\mathrm{AG}(n,2)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The author, together with Nagy, studied the following problem on unavoidable intersections of given size in binary affine spaces. Given an $m$-element set $S\subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^n$, is there guaranteed to be a $[k,t]$-flat, that is, a $k$-dimensional affine subspace of $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ containing exactly $t$ points of $S$? Such problems can be viewed as generalizations of the cap set problem over the binary field. They conjectured that for every fixed pair $(k,t)$ with $k\ge 1$ and $0\le t\le 2^k$, the density of values $m\in \{0,...,2^n\}$ for which a $[k,t]$-flat is guaranteed tends to $1$.
  In this paper, motivated by the study of the smallest open case $(k,t)=(3,1)$, we present explicit constructions of sets in $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ avoiding $[k,1]$-flats for exponentially many sizes. These sets rely on carefully constructed binary linear codes, whose weight enumerators determine the size of the construction.</description>

      <title>Halfway to induced saturation for even cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24100v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For graphs $G$ and $H$, we say that $G$ is $H$-free if no induced subgraph of $G$ is isomorphic to $H$, and that $G$ is $H$-induced-saturated if $G$ is $H$-free but removing or adding any edge in $G$ creates an induced copy of $H$. A full characterization of graphs $H$ for which $H$-induced-saturated graphs exist remains elusive. Even the case where $H$ is a path -- now settled by the collective results of Martin and Smith, Bonamy et al., and Dvo\'{r}\v{a}k -- was already quite challenging.
  What if $H$ is a cycle? The complete answer for odd cycles was given by Behren et al., leaving the case of even cycles (except for the $4$-cycle) wide open. Our main result is the first step toward closing this gap: We prove that for every even cycle $H$, there is a graph $G$ with at least one edge such that $G$ is $H$-free but removing any edge from $G$ creates an induced copy of $H$ (in fact, we construct $H$-induced-saturated graphs for every even cycle $H$ on at most 10 vertices).</description>

      <title>The superspace coinvariant ring of type B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the rank $n$ superspace $\Omega_n$, the ring of polynomial-valued differential forms on $\mathbb C^n$, one can define an action of hyperoctahedral group $\mathfrak B_n$ on it. This leads to a superspace coinvariant ideal $SR_n^B$, defined as the quotient of $\Omega_n$ by two-sided ideal generated by all $\mathfrak B_n$ invariants with vanishing constant terms. We derive the Hilbert series of $SR^B_n$ conjectured by Sagan and Swanson, and prove an operator theorem that yields a concrete description of the superharmonic space $SH^B_n$ associated to $SR^B_n$ as conjectured by Swanson and Wallach. We also derive an explicit basis of $SR^B_n$ using the theory of hyperplane arrangements.</description>

      <title>The stability of independence polynomials of complete bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The independence polynomial of a graph is termed {\it stable} if all its roots are located in the left half-plane $\{z \in \mathbb{C} : \mathrm{Re}(z) \leq 0\}$, and the graph itself is also referred to as stable. Brown and Cameron (Electron. J. Combin. 25(1) (2018) \#P1.46) proved that the complete bipartite graph $K_{1,n}$ is stable and posed the question: \textbf{Are all complete bipartite graphs stable?}
  We answer this question by establishing the following results:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The complete bipartite graphs $K_{2,n}$ and $K_{3,n}$ are stable.
  \item For any integer $k\geq0$, there exists an integer $N(k)\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $K_{m,m+k}$ is stable for all $m&gt;N(k)$.
  \item For any rational $\ell&gt; 1$, there exists an integer $N(\ell) \in \mathbb{N}$ such that whenever $m &gt;N(\ell)$ and $\ell \cdot m$ is an integer, $K_{m, \ell \cdot m}$ is \textbf{not} stable.
  \end{itemize}</description>

      <title>On the maximum number of edges of outer k-planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the maximum number of straight-line segments connecting $n$ points in convex position in the plane, so that each segment intersects at most $k$ others. This question can also be framed as the maximum number of edges of an outer $k$-planar graph on $n$ vertices. We outline several approaches to tackle the problem with the best approach yielding an upper bound of $(\sqrt{2}+\varepsilon)\sqrt{k}n$ edges (with $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$ for sufficiently large $k$). We further investigate the case where the points are arbitrarily bicolored and segments always connect two different colors (i.e., the corresponding graph has to be bipartite). To this end, we also consider the maximum cut problem for the circulant graph $C_n^{1,2,\dots,r}$ which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Generalized chord diagrams and weight systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weight systems are functions on chord diagrams satisfying Vassiliev's $4$-term relations. They originate in the theory of finite type knot invariants. Recent developments in understanding weight systems arising from Lie algebras are based on extending these weight systems from chord diagrams (which can be interpreted as involutions without fixed points, considered modulo cyclic shifts) to arbitrary permutations (also modulo cyclic shifts). We suggest relations for functions on permutations, which generalize Vassiliev's relations. We show that the $gl$- and $so$- weight systems satisfy these relations. We also analyze certain properties of these weight systems and study realted Hopf algebras of permutations.</description>

      <title>The Weak Version of the Graph Complement Conjecture and Partial Results for the Delta Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the transformative workshop by the American Institute of Mathematics on the minimum rank of a graph, two longstanding open problems have captivated the community interested in the minimum rank of graphs: the graph complement conjecture and the $\delta$-conjecture. In this paper, we use a classical result of Mader (1972) to establish a weak version of the graph complement conjecture for all key minimum rank parameters. In addition, again using the same result of Mader, we present some extremal resolutions of the $\delta$-conjecture. Furthermore, we incorporate the assumption of the $\delta$-conjecture and extensive work on graph degeneracy to improve the bound in the weak version of the graph complement conjecture. We conclude with a list of conjectured bounds on the positive semidefinite variant of the Colin de Verdi\`ere number.</description>

      <title>Geometric Littlewood-Offord problems via lattice point counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider nonzero vectors $a_{1},\dots,a_{n}\in\mathbb{C}^{k}$, independent Rademacher random variables $\xi_{1},\dots,\xi_{n}$, and a set $S\subseteq\mathbb{C}^{k}$. What upper bounds can we prove on the probability that the random sum $\xi_{1}a_{1}+\dots+\xi_{n}a_{n}$ lies in $S$? We develop a general framework that allows us to reduce problems of this type to counting lattice points in $S$. We apply this framework with known results from diophantine geometry to prove various bounds when $S$ is a set of points in convex position, an algebraic variety, or a semialgebraic set. In particular, this resolves conjectures of Fox-Kwan-Spink and Kwan-Sauermann.
  We also obtain some corollaries for the polynomial Littlewood-Offord problem, for polynomials that have bounded Chow rank (i.e., can be written as a polynomial of a bounded number of linear forms). For example, one of our results confirms a conjecture of Nguyen and Vu in the special case of polynomials with bounded Chow rank: if a bounded-degree polynomial $F\in\mathbb{C}[x_{1},\dots,x_{n}]$ has bounded Chow rank and ''robustly depends on at least $b$ of its variables'', then $\mathbb{P}[F(\xi_{1},\dots,\xi_{n})=0]\le O(1/\sqrt{b})$. We also prove significantly stronger bounds when $F$ is ''robustly irreducible'', towards a conjecture of Costello.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes sharp bounds for the vulnerability measures of closeness and generalized closeness in graphs and identifies graphs that attain these bounds. It further develops bounds incorporating Zagreb indices for triangle- and quadrangle-free graphs, yielding formulas for closeness and generalized closeness in such graphs with diameter at most 3. Moreover, using Zagreb indices, we derive bounds for trees and connected graphs with girth at least 7, which are attained by graphs with diameter at most 4. Finally, formulas for closeness and generalized closeness in specific trees are established using Zagreb indices.</description>

      <title>A Computational Search for Minimal Obstruction Graphs for the Lov\'{a}sz--Schrijver SDP Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the lift-and-project relaxations of the stable set polytope of graphs generated by $\text{LS}_+$, the SDP lift-and-project operator devised by Lov\'{a}sz and Schrijver. In particular, we focus on searching for $\ell$-minimal graphs, which are graphs on $3\ell$ vertices whose stable set polytope has rank $\ell$ with respect to $\text{LS}_+$. These are the graphs which are the most challenging for the $\text{LS}_+$ operator according to one of the main complexity measures (smallest graphs with largest $\text{LS}_+$-rank). We introduce the notion of $\text{LS}_+$ certificate packages, which is a framework that allows for efficient and reliable verification of membership of points in $\text{LS}_+$-relaxations. Using this framework, we present numerical certificates which (combined with other results) show that there are at least $49$ $3$-minimal graphs, as well as over $4000$ $4$-minimal graphs. This marks a significant leap from the $14$ $3$-minimal and $588$ $4$-minimal graphs known before this work, with many of the newly-discovered graphs containing novel structures which helps enrich and recalibrate our understanding of $\ell$-minimal graphs. Some of this computational work leads to interesting conjectures. We also find all of the smallest vertex-transitive graphs with $\text{LS}_+$-rank $\ell$ for every $\ell \leq 4$.</description>

      <title>Cardinalities of the total number of independent sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the set of numbers the total number of independent sets can admit in $n$-vertex graphs. In this paper, we prove that the cardinality of this set $\mathcal{N}i(n)$ is very close to $2^n$ in the following sense: $\mathcal{N}i(n)/2^n = O(n^{-1/5})$ while for infinitely many $n$, we have $\log_2(\mathcal{N}i(n)/2^n)\ge -2^{(1+o(1)\sqrt{\log_2 n}}$. This set is also precisely the set of possible values of the independence polynomial $I_G(x)$ at $x=1$ for $n$-vertex graphs $G$. As an application, we address an additive combinatorial problem on subsets of a given vector space that avoid certain intersection patterns with respect to subspaces.</description>

      <title>Using Reasoning Models to Generate Search Heuristics that Solve Open Instances of Combinatorial Design Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with reasoning are trained to iteratively generate and refine their answers before finalizing them, which can help with applications to mathematics and code generation. We apply code generation with reasoning LLMs to a specific task in the mathematical field of combinatorial design. This field studies diverse types of combinatorial designs, many of which have lists of open instances for which existence has not yet been determined. The Constructive Protocol CPro1 uses LLMs to generate search heuristics that have the potential to construct solutions to small open instances. Starting with a textual definition and a validity verifier for a particular type of design, CPro1 guides LLMs to select and implement strategies, while providing automated hyperparameter tuning and execution feedback. CPro1 with reasoning LLMs successfully solves long-standing open instances for 7 of 16 combinatorial design problems selected from the 2006 Handbook of Combinatorial Designs, including new solved instances for 3 of these (Bhaskar Rao Designs, Symmetric Weighing Matrices, Balanced Ternary Designs) that were unsolved by CPro1 with non-reasoning LLMs. It also solves open instances for several problems from recent (2025) literature, generating new Covering Sequences, Johnson Clique Covers, Deletion Codes, and a Uniform Nested Steiner Quadruple System.</description>

      <title>A first view on the density of 5-planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $k$-planar graphs are generalizations of planar graphs that can be drawn in the plane with at most $k &gt; 0$ crossings per edge. One of the central research questions of $k$-planarity is the maximum edge density, i.e., the maximum number of edges a $k$-planar graph on $n$ vertices may have. While there are numerous results for the classes of general $k$-planar graphs for $k\leq 2$, there are only very few results for increasing $k=3$ or $4$ due to the complexity of the classes. We make a first step towards even larger $k&gt;4$ by exploring the class of $5$-planar graphs. While our main tool is still the discharging technique, a better understanding of the structure of the denser parts leads to corresponding density bounds in a much simpler way.
  We first apply a simplified version of our technique to outer $5$-planar graphs and use the resulting density bound to assert that the structure of maximally dense $5$-planar graphs differs from the uniform structure when $k$ is small. As the central result of this paper, we then show that simple $5$-planar graphs have at most $\frac{340}{49}(n-2) \approx 6.94(n-2)$ edges, which is a drastic improvement from the previous best bound of $\approx8.3n$. This even implies a small improvement of the leading constant in the Crossing Lemma $cr(G) \ge c \frac{m^3}{n^2}$ from $c=\frac{1}{27.48}$ to $c=\frac{1}{27.19}$. To demonstrate the potential of our new technique, we also apply it to other graph classes, such as 4-planar and 6-planar graphs.</description>

      <title>Hilbert polynomials of configuration spaces over graphs of circumference at most 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $ k $-configuration space $ B_k\Gamma $ of a topological space $ \Gamma $ is the space of sets of $ k $ distinct points in $ \Gamma $. In this paper, we consider the case where $ \Gamma $ is a graph of circumference at most $1$. We show that for all $ k\ge0 $, the $ i $-th Betti number of $ B_k\Gamma $ is given by a polynomial $P_\Gamma^i(k)$ in $ k $, called the Hilbert polynomial of $ \Gamma $. We find an expression for the Hilbert polynomial $P_\Gamma^i(k)$ in terms of those coming from the canonical $1$-bridge decomposition of $ \Gamma $. We also give a combinatorial description of the coefficients of $P_\Gamma^i(k)$.</description>

      <title>From Group Operations to Geometric Structures: Amalgamations, HNN-Extensions, and Twisting in Coset Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coset incidence geometries, introduced by Jacques Tits, provide a versatile framework for studying the interplay between group theory and geometry.
  In this article, we build upon that idea by extending classical group-theoretic constructions (amalgamated products, HNN-extensions, semi-direct products, and twisting) to the setting of coset geometries. This gives a general way to glue together incidence geometries in various ways. This provides a general framework for combining or gluing incidence geometries in different ways while preserving essential properties such as flag-transitivity and residual connectedness.
  Using these techniques, we analyze families of Shephard groups, which generalize both Coxeter and Artin-Tits groups, and their associated simplicial complexes.
  Our results also point to the existence of a Bass-Serre theory for coset geometries and of a fundamental geometry of a graph of coset geometries.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for the harmonic descent chain and applications to critical beta-splitting trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the connection to a probabilistic model of phylogenetic trees introduced by Aldous, we study the recursive sequence governed by the rule $x_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \frac{1}{h_{n-1}(n-i)} x_i$ where $h_{n-1} = \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} 1/j$, known as the harmonic descent chain. While it is known that this sequence converges to an explicit limit $x$, not much is known about the rate of convergence. We first show that a class of recursive sequences including the above are decreasing and use this to bound the rate of convergence. Moreover, for the harmonic descent chain we prove the asymptotic $x_n - x = n^{-\gamma_* + o(1)}$ for an implicit exponent $\gamma_*$. As a consequence, we deduce central limit theorems for various statistics of the critical beta-splitting random tree. This answers a number of questions of Aldous, Janson, and Pittel.</description>

      <title>Some Relations on Paratopisms and An Intuitive Interpretation on the Parastrophes of a Latin Square</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02196</link>
      <description>arXiv:1803.02196v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper will present some intuitive interpretation of the parastrophe transformations of arbitrary Latin square. With this trick, we can generate the parastrophes of arbitrary Latin square directly from the original one without generating the orthogonal array. The relations of isotopisms and parastrophe transformations in composition will also be shown. It will solve the problem that when F1*I1=I2*F2 how can we obtain I2 and F2 from I1 and F1, where I1 and I2 are isotopisms while F1 and F2 are parastrophe transformations and "{*}" is the composition of transformations. These methods could distinctly simplify the computation on a computer for the issues related to main classes of Latin squares. This will improve the efficiency apparently in computation for some related problems.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Functionality and Symmetric Difference -- Two Intriguing Graph Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Functionality ($\mathrm{fun}$) is a graph parameter that generalizes graph degeneracy defined by Alecu et al. [JCTB, 2021]. They research the relation of functionality to many other graphs parameters (tree-width, clique-width, VC-dimension, etc.). Extending their research, we completely characterize the functionality of random graph $G(n,p)$ for all possible $p$. We provide matching (up to a constant factor) lower and upper bound for a large range of $p$. It follows from our bounds for $G(n,p)$, that the maximum functionality (roughly $\sqrt{n}$) is achieved for $p \approx 1/\sqrt{n}$. We complement this by showing that every graph $G$ on $n$ vertices have $\mathrm{fun}(G) \le O(\sqrt{ n \ln n})$ and we give a nearly matching $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$-lower bound provided by incident graphs of projective planes. Previously known lower bounds for functionality were only logarithmic in the number of vertices.
  Further, we study a related graph parameter symmetric difference ($\mathrm{sd}$), the minimum of $|N(u) ~\Delta~ N(v)|$ over all pairs of vertices of the ``worst possible'' induced subgraph. It was observed by Alecu et al. that $\mathrm{fun}(G) \le \mathrm{sd}(G)+1$ for every graph $G$. They asked whether the functionality of interval graphs is bounded. Recently, Dallard et al. [RiM, 2024] answered this positively and they constructed an interval graph $G$ with $\mathrm{sd}(G) = \Theta(\sqrt[4]{n})$ (even though they did not mention the explicit bound), i.e., they separate the functionality and symmetric difference of interval graphs. We show that $\mathrm{sd}$ of interval graphs is at most $O(\sqrt[3]{n})$ and we provide a different example of an interval graph $G$ with $\mathrm{sd}(G) = \Theta(\sqrt[4]{n})$. Further, we show that $\mathrm{sd}$ of circular arc graphs is $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$.</description>

Abstract: The connected domination game is a variation of the domination game where the played vertices must form a connected subgraph at all stages of the game. In this paper we prove that deciding whether the game connected domination number is smaller than a given integer is PSPACE-complete using log-space reductions for both Dominator- and Staller-start connected domination game.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00810v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of p-adic equiangular lines and derive the first fundamental relation between common angle, dimension of the space and the number of lines. More precisely, we show that if $\{\tau_j\}_{j=1}^n$ is p-adic $\gamma$-equiangular lines in $\mathbb{Q}^d_p$, then \begin{align*} (1) \quad\quad \quad \quad |n|^2\leq |d|\max\{|n|, \gamma^2 \}. \end{align*} We call Inequality (1) as the p-adic van Lint-Seidel relative bound. We believe that this complements fundamental van Lint-Seidel \textit{[Indag. Math., 1966]} relative bound for equiangular lines in the p-adic case.</description>

      <title>Induced Saturation of the Poset 2C_2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14648v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a set $X$, the power set $\mathbb{P}(X)$, and a finite poset $P$, a family $F\subset \mathbb{P}(X)$ is said to be induced-$P$-free if there is no injection $\phi: P\rightarrow \mathbb{F}$ such that $\phi(p)\subseteq\phi(q)$ if and only if $p\leq_{P} q$, for all $p, q \in P$. The family $F$ is induced-$P$-saturated if it is maximal with respect to being induced-$P$-free. If $n=|X|$, then the size of the smallest induced-$P$-saturated family in $\mathbb{P}(X)$ is denoted $sat(n,P)$.
  The poset $2C_2$ is two incomparable 2-chains (the Hasse diagram is two vertex-disjoint edges) and Keszegh, Lemons, Martin, P\'alv\"olgyi, and Patk\'os proved that $n+2\leq sat(n,2C_2)\leq 2n$ and gave one isomorphism class of an induced-$2C_2$-saturated family that achieves the upper bound.
  We show that the lower bound can be improved to $3n/2 + 1/2$ by examining the necessary structure of a saturated family. In addition, we provide many examples of induced-$2C_2$-saturated families of size $2n$ in $\mathbb{P}(X)$ where $|X|=n$.</description>

Abstract: A maximal independent set in a graph $G$ is an independent set that cannot be extended to a larger independent set by adding any vertex from $G$. This paper investigates the problem of determining the maximum number of maximal independent sets in terms of the matching number of a graph. We establish the maximum number of maximal independent sets for general graphs, connected graphs, triangle-free graphs, and connected triangle-free graphs with a given matching number, and characterize the extremal graphs achieving these maxima.</description>

      <title>Feedback Arc Sets and Feedback Arc Set Decompositions in Weighted and Unweighted Oriented Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any arc-weighted oriented graph $D=(V(D), A(D),w)$, we write
  ${\rm fas}_w(D)$ to denote the minimum weight of a feedback arc set in $D$. In this paper, we consider upper bounds on ${\rm fas}_w(D)$ for arc-weight oriented graphs $D$ with bounded maximum degrees and directed girth. We obtain such bounds by introducing a new parameter ${\rm fasd}(D)$, which is the maximum integer such that $A(D)$ can be partitioned into ${\rm fasd}(D)$ feedback arc sets. This new parameter seems to be interesting in its own right.
  We obtain several bounds for both ${\rm fas}_w(D)$ and ${\rm fasd}(D)$ when $D$ has maximum degree $\Delta(D)\le \Delta$ and directed girth $g(D)\geq g$. In particular, we show that if $\Delta(D)\leq~4$ and $g(D)\geq 3$, then ${\rm fasd}(D) \geq 3$ and therefore ${\rm fas}_w(D)\leq \frac{w(D)}{3}$ which generalizes a tight bound for an unweighted oriented graph with maximum degree at most 4. We also show that ${\rm fasd}(D)\geq g$ and ${\rm fas}_w(D) \leq \frac{w(D)}{g}$ if $\Delta(D)\leq 3$ and $g(D)\geq g$ for $g\in \{3,4,5\}$ and these bounds are tight. However, for $g=10$ the bound ${\rm fasd}(D)\geq g$ does not always hold when $\Delta(D)\leq 3$. Finally we give some bounds for the cases when $\Delta$ or $g$ are large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using arbitrary bases for the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$, we obtain the generalized M\"obius transformations (GMTs), which are a class of bijections between the projective geometry $PG(n-1,q)$ and the set of roots of unity $\mu_{\frac{q^n-1}{q-1}}\subseteq\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$, where $n\geq 2$ is any integer. We also introduce a class of projective polynomials, using the properties of which we determine the inverses of the GMTs. Moreover, we study the roots of those projective polynomials, which lead to a three-way correspondence between partitions of $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}^\ast,\mu_{\frac{q^n-1}{q-1}}$ and $PG(n-1,q)$. Through this correspondence and the GMTs, we construct permutation polynomials of index $\frac{q^n-1}{q-1}$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.01061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications to the theory of error-correcting codes, we give methods for computing a generating set for the ideal generated by $\beta$-graded polynomials vanishing on certain subsets of a simplicial complete toric variety $X$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, where $\beta$ is a $d\times r$ matrix whose columns generate a subsemigroup $\mathbb{N}\beta$ of $\mathbb{N}^d$. We also give a method for computing the vanishing ideal of the set of $\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of $X$. When $\beta=[w_1 \cdots w_r]$ is a row matrix corresponding to a numerical semigroup $\mathbb{N}\beta=\langle w_1,\dots,w_r \rangle$, $X$ is a weighted projective space and generators of the relevant vanishing ideal is given using generators of defining (toric) ideals of numerical semigroup rings corresponding to semigroups generated by subsets of $\{w_1,\dots,w_r\}$.</description>

Abstract: We construct a novel family of difference-permutation operators and prove that they are diagonalized by the wreath Macdonald $P$-polynomials; the eigenvalues are written in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials of arbitrary degree. Our operators arise from integral formulas for the action of the horizontal Heisenberg subalgebra in the vertex representation of the corresponding quantum toroidal algebra</description>

      <title>Output-sensitive Complexity of Multi-Objective Integer Network Flow Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01786v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the output-sensitive complexity for linear multi-objective integer minimum cost flow (MOIMCF) problems and provides insights about the time complexity for enumerating all supported nondominated vectors. The paper shows that there can not exist an output-polynomial time algorithm for the enumeration of all supported nondominated vectors that determine the vectors in an ordered way in the outcome space unless NP = P. Moreover, novel methods for identifying supported nondominated vectors in bi-objective minimum cost flow (BOIMCF) problems are proposed, accompanied by a numerical comparison between decision- and objective-space methods. A novel, equivalent and more compact formulation of the minimum cost flow ILP formulation used in the e-constrained-scalarization approach is introduced, demonstrating enhanced efficiency in the numerical tests</description>

      <title>Bounds on Discrete Potentials of Spherical (k,k)-Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive universal lower and upper bounds for max-min and min-max problems (also known as polarization) for the potential of spherical $(k,k)$-designs and provide certain examples, including unit-norm tight frames, that attain these bounds. The universality is understood in the sense that the bounds hold for all spherical $(k,k)$-designs and for a large class of potential functions, and the bounds involve certain nodes and weights that are independent of the potential. When the potential function is $h(t)=t^{2k}$, we prove an optimality property of the spherical $(k,k)$-designs in the class of all spherical codes of the same cardinality both for max-min and min-max potential problems.</description>

      <title>Critical scaling profile for trees and connected subgraphs on the complete graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse generating functions for trees and for connected subgraphs on the complete graph, and identify a single scaling profile which applies for both generating functions in a critical window. Our motivation comes from the analysis of the finite-size scaling of lattice trees and lattice animals on a high-dimensional discrete torus, for which we conjecture that the identical profile applies in dimensions $d \ge 8$.</description>

      <title>A Linear Programming Approach to the Super-Stable Roommates Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stable roommates problem is a non-bipartite version of the well-known stable matching problem. Teo and Sethuraman proved that, for each instance of the stable roommates problem in a complete graph, there exists a linear inequality system such that there exists a feasible solution to this system if and only if there exists a stable matching in the given instance. The aim of this paper is to extend the result of Teo and Sethuraman to the stable roommates problem with ties. More concretely, we prove that, for each instance of the stable roommates problem with ties in a complete graph, there exists a linear inequality system such that there exists a feasible solution to this system if and only if there exists a super-stable matching in the given instance.</description>
