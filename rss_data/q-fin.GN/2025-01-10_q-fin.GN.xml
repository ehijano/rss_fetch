      <title>The Intraday Bitcoin Response to Tether Minting and Burning Events: Asymmetry, Investor Sentiment, And "Whale Alerts" On Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tether Limited has the sole authority to create (mint) and destroy (burn) Tether stablecoins (USDT). This paper investigates Bitcoin's response to USDT supply change events between 2014 and 2021 and identifies an interesting asymmetry between Bitcoin's responses to USDT minting and burning events. Bitcoin responds positively to USDT minting events over 5- to 30-minute event windows, but this response begins declining after 60 minutes. State-dependence is also demonstrated, with Bitcoin prices exhibiting a greater increase when the corresponding USDT minting event coincides with positive investor sentiment and is announced to the public by data service provider, Whale Alert, on Twitter.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Bidirectional Causal Relationships Between Transaction Fees and Economic Activity of Subsystems Utilizing the Ethereum Blockchain Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ethereum blockchain network enables transaction processing and smart-contract execution through levies of transaction fees, commonly known as gas fees. This framework mediates economic participation via a market-based mechanism for gas fees, permitting users to offer higher gas fees to expedite pro-cessing. Historically, the ensuing gas fee volatility led to critical disequilibria between supply and demand for block space, presenting stakeholder challenges. This study examines the dynamic causal interplay between transaction fees and economic subsystems leveraging the network. By utilizing data related to unique active wallets and transaction volume of each subsystem and applying time-varying Granger causality analysis, we reveal temporal heterogeneity in causal relationships between economic activity and transaction fees across all subsystems. This includes (a) a bidirectional causal feedback loop between cross-blockchain bridge user activity and transaction fees, which diminishes over time, potentially signaling user migration; (b) a bidirectional relationship between centralized cryptocurrency exchange deposit and withdrawal transaction volume and fees, indicative of increased competition for block space; (c) decentralized exchange volumes causally influence fees, while fees causally influence user activity, although this relationship is weakening, potentially due to the diminished significance of decentralized finance; (d) intermittent causal relationships with maximal extractable value bots; (e) fees causally in-fluence non-fungible token transaction volumes; and (f) a highly significant and growing causal influence of transaction fees on stablecoin activity and transaction volumes highlight its prominence.</description>
