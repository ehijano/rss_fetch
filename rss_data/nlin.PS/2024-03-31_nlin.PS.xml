      <title>One dimensional models for supercritical and subcritical transitions in rotating convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous study on natural and man made systems including rotating convection report the phenomena of supercritical and subcritical transitions from one state to another with the variation of relevant control parameters. However, the complexity of the rotating convection system even under the idealized Rayleigh-B\'enard geometry, hindered the simplest possible description of these transitions to convection. Here we present an one dimensional description of the stationary subcritical and supercritical transitions to rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection both for rigid and free-slip boundary conditions. The analysis of the one dimensional models and performance of three dimensional direct numerical simulations of the system show qualitatively similar results in a wide region of the parameter space. A brief discussion on time dependent convection of overstable origin is also presented.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian aspects of the kinetic equation for soliton gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate Hamiltonian aspects of the integro-differential kinetic equation for dense soliton gas which results as a thermodynamic limit of the Whitham equations. Under a delta-functional ansatz, the kinetic equation reduces to a non-diagonalisable system of hydrodynamic type whose matrix consists of several $2\times 2$ Jordan blocks. We demonstrate that the resulting system possesses local Hamiltonian structures of differential-geometric type, for all standard two-soliton interaction kernels (KdV, sinh-Gordon, hard-rod, Lieb-Liniger, DNLS, and separable cases). In the hard-rod case, we show that the continuum limit of these structures provides a local multi-Hamiltonian formulation of the full kinetic equation.</description>

      <title>Predicting the emergence of localised dihedral patterns in models for dryland vegetation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Localised patterns are often observed in models for dryland vegetation, both as peaks of vegetation in a desert state and as gaps within a vegetated state, known as `fairy circles'. Recent results from radial spatial dynamics show that approximations of localised patterns with dihedral symmetry emerge from a Turing instability in general reaction--diffusion systems, which we apply to several vegetation models. We present a systematic guide for finding such patterns in a given reaction--diffusion model, during which we obtain four key quantities that allow us to predict the qualitative properties of our solutions with minimal analysis. We consider four well-established vegetation models and compute their key predictive quantities, observing that models which possess similar values exhibit qualitatively similar localised patterns; we then complement our results with numerical simulations of various localised states in each model. Here, localised vegetation patches emerge generically from Turing instabilities and act as transient states between uniform and patterned environments, displaying complex dynamics as they evolve over time.</description>
