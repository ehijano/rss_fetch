      <title>Digging into the Interior of Hot Cores with ALMA. VI. The Formation of Low-mass Multiple Systems in High-mass Cluster-forming Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most stars form in multiple systems, with profound implications in numerous astronomical phenomena intrinsically linked to multiplicity. However, our knowledge about the process on how multiple stellar systems form is incomplete and biased toward nearby molecular clouds forming only low-mass stars, which are unrepresentative of the stellar population in the Galaxy. Most stars form within dense cores in clusters alongside high-mass stars (&gt;8 M$_{\odot}$), as likely the Sun did. Here we report deep ALMA 1.33 mm dust continuum observations at ~160 au spatial resolution, revealing 72 low-mass multiple systems embedded in 23 high-mass cluster-forming regions, as part of the Digging into the Interior of Hot Cores with ALMA (DIHCA) survey. We find that the companion separation distribution presents a distinct peak at ~1200 au, in contrast to the one at ~4000 au observed in nearby low-mass regions. The shorter fragmentation scale can be explained by considering the higher pressure exerted by the surrounding medium, which is higher than the one in low-mass regions, due to the larger turbulence and densities involved. Because the peak of the companion separation distribution occurs at much larger scales than the expected disk sizes, we argue that the observed fragmentation is produced by turbulent core fragmentation. Contrary as predicted, the multiplicity fraction remains constant as the stellar density increases. We propose that in the extremely dense environments where high-mass stars form, dynamical interactions play an important role in disrupting weakly bound systems.</description>

      <title>The miniJPAS survey: Dissecting galaxy properties across environments with spatially resolved photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Javalambre-Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS) is an ongoing survey mapping thousands of square degrees in the Northern Hemisphere using 56 narrow-band filters, delivering IFU-like photometric data well suited for studying galaxy properties and evolution. As a precursor, the miniJPAS survey observed a 1 deg$^2$ field with the same filter system, providing an ideal testbed for the study of spatially resolved galaxies. In this work, we investigate the resolved stellar population and emission-line properties of 51 miniJPAS galaxies, classified by spectral type (red or blue) and environment (group or field), and assess the role of environment in galaxy evolution. We use the Py2DJPAS pipeline to process the data, homogenise the images to a common PSF, define galactic regions, and extract photo-spectra. Radial profiles are analysed using elliptical annuli spaced by 0.7 R_EFF, combined with an inside-out segmentation to study star formation histories. Stellar population parameters are derived with the Bayesian SED-fitting code BaySeAGal, while artificial neural networks are used to estimate the equivalent widths of the H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, [NII], and [OIII] emission lines. We find clear trends in a mass density-colour diagram: denser, redder regions are older, more metal-rich, and have lower specific star formation rates, while bluer, less dense regions show stronger emission lines and higher sSFRs. Red and blue galaxies are well separated in these relations, whereas environmental classification shows no clear distinction. Radial profiles support an inside-out formation scenario, with significant differences between red and blue galaxies but no strong environmental dependence. We suggest that the weak environmental effects may be due to the relatively low stellar masses of the galaxy groups in our sample.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Vertical Structure of Active Galactic Nuclei Disks with Transformer Models and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reverberation mapping is one of the main techniques used to study active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disks. Traditional continuum reverberation mapping uses short lags between variability in different wavelength AGN light curves on the light crossing timescale of the disk to measure the radial structure of the disk. The harder-to-detect long negative lag measures lags on the longer inflow timescale, opening up a new window to mapping out the vertical structure of AGN disks. The Vera Rubin Observatory, with its 6 wavebands, long baseline, and high cadence, will revolutionize our ability to detect short and long lags. However, many challenges remain to detect these long lags, such as seasonal gaps in Rubin light curves, the weak signal strength of the long lag relative to the short lag, and the enormous influx of data for millions of AGN from Rubin. Machine learning techniques have the potential to solve many of these issues, but have yet to be applied to the long negative lag problem. We develop and train a transformer-based machine learning model to detect long and short lags in mock Rubin AGN light curves. Our model identifies whether a light curve in our test set has a long negative lag with 96% recall and 0.04% contamination, and is 98% accurate at predicting the true long lag. This accuracy is an enormous improvement over two baseline methods we test on the same mock light curves, the interpolated cross correlation function and javelin, which are only 54% and 21% accurate, respectively.</description>

      <title>Spinning compact object and chaos in galactic centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic centres are highly dynamic regions dominated by a supermassive black hole (BH) surrounded by nuclear star clusters (NSC), molecular gas, and asymmetric matter distributions such as disks or halos. The combined gravitational effects of these components, along with relativistic corrections from the BH's spin, generate strongly nonlinear dynamics and frequent chaotic orbital behaviour. To model this environment, we employ a multipolar expansion potential in which the central compact object is represented by the Artemova-Bjornsson-Novikov pseudo-Newtonian potential, effectively capturing spin-dependent features of a Kerr-like BH. The surrounding halo is treated as an axisymmetric, shell-like mass distribution expanded up to third order in multipolar terms to account for realistic asymmetry. Previous studies have mainly explored the influence of multipolar moments and BH spin using Poincare sections, SALI, and related chaos indicators. In this work, we extend these analyses by incorporating stability analysis and basins of convergence to achieve a more complete understanding of the system's dynamics. Stability analysis around equilibrium points provides insight into local behavior, while basins of convergence highlight sensitivity to initial conditions and expose fractal basin boundaries. Our results show that the BH spin significantly reshapes phase space: depending on its magnitude and orientation, it can either amplify chaotic scattering caused by halo asymmetry or stabilize specific orbital families. These findings enhance our understanding of how relativistic spin effects and multipolar mass distributions jointly govern the dynamical architecture of galactic centers.</description>

      <title>One cloud is not enough: extreme conditions bias chemical abundances in high-redshift galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since its launch, JWST has opened an unprecedented opportunity to characterise the ionised ISM of high-redshift galaxies using well-established rest-frame UV/optical diagnostics from the local Universe. At the same time, these observations challenge the validity of such classical methods when applied to the extreme environments typical at high redshift. We present an in-depth analysis of the ISM in three representative case studies at $z=2 - 6$ (MARTA 4327, the Sunburst Arc and RXCJ2248-ID) conducted within a multi-cloud photoionisation modelling framework (HOMERUN). We show that even a small fraction of unresolved high-density clumps can contribute more than half of the observed flux of auroral lines, while only negligibly to standard optical density tracers. As a result, $T_{\mathrm{e}}$-method metallicities can be underestimated by $\sim 0.15 - 0.3$ dex, as for MARTA 4327. By modelling rest-frame UV and optical data, we demonstrate that discrepancies between abundances obtained from diagnostics tracing different zones do not necessarily imply chemical inhomogeneities. In RXCJ2248-ID, the disagreement between UV and optical N/O may naturally arise from ionisation and density structure alone. In contrast, we find evidence for genuine chemical stratification in the Sunburst Arc, where a component enriched in nitrogen coexists with a chemically normal one. Finally, we argue that very-high-ionisation lines may be explained within a pure star-formation scenario invoking matter-bounded regions. However, in the case of RXCJ2248-ID, we cannot rule out a minor contribution from an AGN based solely on the observed fluxes. These results indicate that classical diagnostics can be significantly biased in high-redshift galaxies and that self-consistent, physically motivated tools are therefore essential to properly interpret the complex ISM conditions and chemical enrichment in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Polarization echoes from past nuclear activity in the quasi-periodic eruption source GSN 069</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are repeating, high-amplitude, soft X-ray bursts observed from the nuclei of a dozen nearby low-mass galaxies. Their origin remains a puzzle in the physics of accretion variability. Observational data indicate that X-ray and/or optical tidal disruption events (TDEs) may precede QPE detections. Although both kinds of outburst are driven by supermassive black holes, they are more frequently detected in faded active galactic nuclei (AGNs), when the TDE is not happening in a dormant galaxy. In the case of the QPE discovery source, GSN 069, it remains debated whether its past activity arose from a previous AGN phase or from an enhanced TDE rate. Aims. We investigated the origin of the past nuclear activity in GSN 069. Methods. Past AGN activity imprints detectable polarization in optical light, due to the expected delay between direct and scattered light. On 6 September 2019, we targeted GSN 069 with VLT/FORS2 in both imaging polarimetry and spectropolarimetry modes so that its optical polarization could be investigated while the first detected QPE phase was still active. Results. We measured a rising polarization, from ~0% to ~1.5%, as moving away from the nucleus of GSN 069. This rise is probed to be intrinsic to the central engine, confirming the already detected extended emission line region (EELR) by integral field unit data. Conclusions. The increasing radial polarization demonstrates a switched-off nucleus. The polarization angle traces an axis aligned with elongated [OIII], [NII], and H{\alpha} gas distributions, revealing an EELR that may be consistent with relic polarization cones, therefore suggesting the presence of a torus-like structure in the past. Thus, optical polarization echoes geometrically favor a faded AGN as the origin of the EELR rather than a past elevated TDE rate, although the latter cannot be excluded.</description>

      <title>Resolved ISM properties and scaling relations in the barred galaxy NGC 3627: constraints from NIKA2 observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between star formation, interstellar medium (ISM) components, and dust properties in NGC 3627 using new NIKA2 1.15 and 2 mm observations from the IMEGIN Large Program. Our goal is to analyze dust and radio emission, decompose contributions in the millimeter-centimeter regime, and explore ISM properties within the galaxy. We perform spectral energy distribution fitting, at both global and spatial scales, using the THEMIS dust model within the HerBIE code, applied to data from 3.4 $\mu$m to 6 cm. We decompose emission into dust, free-free, and synchrotron components, and examine correlations with gas surface density and star formation activity. Additionally, we analyze the small dust grain fraction and its variation across the galaxy. We find $\sim$10% radio emission at 2 mm, peaking at 18% in the southern bar-end, which hosts the highest star formation activity. However, an isolated star-forming region beyond this bar-end is the most efficient, as indicated by its elevated dust production efficiency and effective yield, predicted by our simplistic dust evolution model. The 160 $\mu$m emission shows the strongest correlation with molecular gas, while 1.15 mm better traces the dust mass surface density. Small grains, which make up $\sim$13% of dust mass (2 $\times$ 10$^{7}$ M$_{\odot}$), are depleted in intense radiation fields, with a notable deficit in the southern tidal tail. ISM properties and chemical evolution indicate that dynamical processes, such as bar-driven gas flows and tidal interactions, are crucial in shaping the galactic structure, influencing star formation efficiency, and dust distribution.</description>

      <title>Spatially Resolved Star Formation relations in local LIRGs along the complete merger sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) at ~100 pc scales in a sample of 27 nearby luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) spanning the entire merger sequence. In particular, we study the relations between star-formation (SF) and molecular gas surface density as a function of the interaction stage using two complementary approaches: beam-sized (unresolved, line-of-sight) regions and physically identified molecular gas clumps. To map the distribution of molecular gas we use ALMA CO(2-1) observations, while SF is traced using HST Pa-alpha or Pa-beta images. We derive spatially resolved Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relations for each galaxy. When using beam-sized regions, we find that 67% of galaxies follow a single relation between Sigma_SFR and Sigma_H2. However, in the remaining galaxies, the relation splits into two branches, indicating the presence of a duality in this relation. In contrast, when using physical gas clumps, the duality disappears and all galaxies show a single trend. We also study other ISM/clump properties as a function of the merger stage. We find that isolated galaxies and systems in early stages of interaction exhibit lower amounts of gas and SF. As the merger progresses, however, the amount of gas in the central kpc of the galaxy undergoing the merger increases, along with the SFR, and the slope of the KS relation becomes steeper, indicating an increase in SF efficiency of the gas clumps. Clumps in late-stage mergers are predominantly located at small distances from the nucleus, confirming that most of the activity is concentrated in the central regions. Finally, the relation between the SF efficiency and the boundedness parameter evolves from being roughly flat in the early stages of the merger to becoming positive in the final phases, indicating that clump self-gravity only starts to regulate the SF process between the early- and mid-merger stages.</description>

      <title>Wind-fed Supermassive Black Hole Accretion in the Ultracompact Dwarf Galaxy M60-UCD1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracompact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) are thought to be remnants of stripped galactic nuclei, among which a handful are known to host a central supermassive black hole (SMBH). As in stripped nuclear star clusters, the SMBHs in UCDs may be fed by stellar winds from old stellar populations, in the absence of substantial gas reservoirs and galactic inflows. In this work, we investigate such a wind-fed accretion scenario for M60-UCD1, which harbors a confirmed $2\times10^7~M_\odot$ SMBH and exhibits X-ray emission suggestive of SMBH accretion signature. Using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, we simulate the SMBH accreting stellar winds from approximately 1500 asymptotic giant branch stars, and explore the role of ram pressure from the ambient interstellar or intracluster medium. After 5 Myr, the majority of the stellar winds form a cold gas disk ($\sim1000~M_\odot$) within $\sim10~\rm pc$ as well as the SMBH's gravitational sphere of influence. Within the inner $10^4~r_{\rm g}$, this disk transitions into a hot ($\sim10^7-10^9~\rm K$), geometrically thick corona that dominates the X-ray emission. The SMBH achieves an accretion rate of $\sim10^{-5}~M_\odot~\rm yr^{-1}$, yielding an X-ray luminosity of $\sim7\times10^{37}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$, well consistent with observations. Including ram pressure stripping reduces both the accretion rate and luminosity by about a factor of two. Our results suggest that the X-ray counterpart of M60-UCD1 originates from a weakly accreting SMBH fed by stellar winds, with broader insights into the feeding mechanisms of central massive black holes and the origins of X-ray sources in other UCDs.</description>

      <title>The Quasar Feedback Survey: Revealing the importance of sensitive radio imaging for AGN identification deeper into the radio-quiet regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new sub-arcsecond ($\sim$0.3-1 arcsec; $\sim$1--3\,kpc) VLA imaging at 1.4\,GHz and 6\,GHz of 29 optically-selected, [O~{\sc iii}] luminous ($L_{\rm [O III]}$ &gt; 10$^{42.1}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$), $z&lt;0.2$ quasars drawn from the expanded Quasar Feedback Survey (QFeedS; with $L_\mathrm{1.4\,GHz} = 10^{22.6}$--10$^{26.3}$\,W\,Hz$^{-1}$). These 29 new objects occupy the low end of the radio-power distribution ($L_\mathrm{1.4\,GHz}$=$10^{22.63}$--10$^{23.45}$\,W\,Hz$^{-1}$) in the QFeedS sample and are nominally `radio quiet'. Despite this, we find widespread evidence of AGN-driven synchrotron activity. Nearly $\sim 31\,$per\,cent exhibit resolved radio structures on $\sim$0.1--20\,kpc scales consistent with compact jets or wind-driven outflows, and $\sim 90\,$per\,cent display steep spectra ($\alpha \lesssim -1$) indicative of optically thin synchrotron emission. Combining morphology, spectral index and brightness-temperature diagnostics, at least $\sim38\,$per\,cent of the sample show clear AGN signatures that cannot be explained by star formation alone. These constitute the first results from the expanded QFeedS (now 71 quasars spanning $\approx 4$ dex in radio power) and demonstrate that compact, low-power jets and AGN shocks are common deep inside the radio-quiet regime. A thorough understanding of feedback processes from quasars, deep into the `radio-quiet' regime, will be obtained by connecting these high resolution radio observations with multi-wavelength observations.</description>

      <title>The ALMaQUEST Survey XVII: Unveiling Multiple Quenching Pathways in Green Valley Galaxies via Molecular Gas and Quenching Timescale Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistically, green valley (GV) galaxies exhibit lower molecular gas fractions ($f_{gas}$) and reduced star formation efficiency (SFE) compared to star-forming galaxies. However, it remains unclear whether quenching is primarily driven by one factor or results from a combination of mechanisms in individual GV galaxies. In this study, we address this question by examining the spatial distributions of star formation and molecular gas in 28 GVs selected from the ALMaQUEST survey and additional literature samples. For each galaxy, we identify regions with suppressed specific star formation rate (sSFR) and measure $\Delta f_{gas}$ and $\Delta$SFE-offsets from the resolved scaling relations of the star-forming main sequence galaxies. By comparing the fraction of regions with negative $\Delta f_{gas}$ and $\Delta$SFE, we classify 35.7$\pm$13.2\% (57.1$\pm$17.9\%) of GV galaxies as $f_{gas}$-driven, 39.3$\pm$14.0\% (39.3$\pm$14.0\%) as SFE-driven, and 25.0$\pm$10.6\% (3.6$\pm$3.6\%) as mixed mode when adopting a fixed (variable) CO-to-$\rm H_{2}$ conversion factor ($\alpha_{CO}$). These results indicate that GVs undergo quenching through multiple pathways. As sSFR decreases from the main sequence to the green valley, we observe a transition toward predominantly SFE-driven quenching, possibly linked to internal processes such as morphological quenching or AGN activity. We further estimate the quenching timescale ($\tau_{decay}$), defined as the time from the peak SFR to 1/e (approximately 37\%) of its value, using integrated MaNGA spectra. SFE-driven quenching is typically associated with short $\tau_{decay}$ , while $f_{gas}$-driven quenching shows a broader range. Overall, 75\% of GVs exhibit $\tau_{decay}$ shorter than 1 Gyr, suggesting that quenching in most GVs proceeds rapidly, challenging purely slow-quenching scenarios like starvation.</description>

      <title>New Estimate for the Cosmic Ray-Induced $\rm H_2$ Photodissociation Rate in the Interstellar Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the interstellar medium, cosmic rays (CRs) generate a field of ultraviolet (UV) photons via the excitation and subsequent radiative decay of $\rm H_2$ molecules. This UV field is a major agent of ionization and dissociation in the inner regions of molecular clouds that are shielded from the effects of the interstellar radiation field. In particular, the dissociation of $\rm H_2$, by far the most abundant molecule in interstellar clouds, leads to the production of atomic hydrogen which then takes part in the production of a multitude of molecules, in particular complex organics on the surfaces of interstellar dust grains. Precise knowledge of the rates of CR-induced dissociation processes is thus crucial for constructing reliable chemical models. For the present paper, we have derived a new value of $k_{\rm diss, CR}(\mbox{$\rm H_2$})=0.831\zeta$ for the rate of $\rm H_2$ dissociation, where $\zeta$ is the CR ionization rate of $\rm H_2$. This prediction contrasts a previous value from the Leiden database which overestimated the rate due to an inconsistent treatment of the $\rm H_2$ abundances and photodissociation cross sections. By running a series of chemical models, we show that the overestimated dissociation rate has a large effect on the results of chemical simulations, with the abundance of methanol being overestimated by over one order of magnitude. Hence, we strongly recommend the adoption of our new estimate $k_{\rm diss, CR}(\mbox{$\rm H_2$})=0.831\zeta$ in all chemical models that include this process. Our newly derived value corresponds to $\rm H_2$ being purely in the para form ($J^{\prime\prime} = 0$). However, in the interiors of molecular clouds the $\rm H_2$ ortho-to-para ratio is low and using the rate for para-$\rm H_2$ is an adequate approximation.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a new open cluster as a companion to Czernik 38 cluster and its associated complex tide, using Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize Gaia DR3 data to report the discovery of a new star cluster, Nasser 1, located 32 arcmin from Czernik 38 at coordinates $\alpha= 282.11 \pm 0.05$ and $\delta= 4.56 \pm 0.05$. Using a variable membership probability threshold technique with pyUPMASK, we confirm Nasser 1 as a genuine open cluster. It exhibits a distinct King profile and a well-defined CMD with an age of $125.0 \pm 12.30$ Myr, a distance modulus of $12.87 \pm 0.21$ mag, and a color excess of $2.42 \pm 0.09$. Nasser 1 shares consistent physical parameters (age, distance, kinematics, and reddening) with Czernik 38, suggesting they constitute a young primordial binary system in the Carina-Sagittarius spiral arm. Both clusters display elongations indicative of differential rotation tides; Nasser 1 is additionally perturbed by the spiral arm's gravitational field. Gaussian mass function analysis suggests the two were formerly a single cluster, violently torn apart by differential rotation.</description>

      <title>Explainable Galaxy Interaction Prediction with Hybrid Attention Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy interaction classification remains challenging due to complex morphological patterns and the limited interpretability of deep learning models. We propose an attentive neural ensemble that combines AG-XCaps, H-SNN, and ResNet-GRU architectures, trained on the Galaxy Zoo DESI dataset and enhanced with LIME to enable explainable predictions. The model achieves Precision = 0.95, Recall = 1.00, F1 = 0.97, and Accuracy = 96%, outperforming a Random Forest baseline by significantly reducing false positives (23 vs. 70). This lightweight (0.45 MB) and scalable framework provides an interpretable and efficient solution for large-scale surveys such as Euclid and LSST, advancing data-driven studies of galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Planet-Host Stars Across the Galaxy in the 2040s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By the 2040s, the exoplanet field will have moved from the discovery of a few thousand planets to hundreds of thousands, thanks to Gaia DR5, TESS, PLATO, Roman, and their successors. At that stage, the key bottleneck will no longer be planet detection, but our ability to understand how planetary systems form, evolve, and diversify across different stellar and Galactic environments.
  To address this, we need a large-scale, high-resolution spectroscopic survey of planet-host stars, spanning a broad range of Galactic environments (thin and thick disks, bulge, halo, clusters, associations), and including a well-defined control sample of non-hosts. Such a survey must deliver homogeneous stellar parameters, detailed abundance determinations, ages, and kinematics for tens of thousands of hosts, extending to the faint magnitudes probed by future missions but are beyond the reach of existing and currently planned spectroscopic facilities.</description>

      <title>A comparative test of different pressure profile models in clusters of galaxies using recent ACT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The electron pressure profile is a convenient tool to characterize the thermodynamical state of a galaxy cluster, with several studies adopting a "universal" functional form.
  Aims. This study aims at using Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) data to test four different functional forms for the cluster pressure profile: generalized Navarro-Frenk-White (gNFW), $\beta$-model, polytropic, and exponential. The goal is to assess to what level they are universal over a population-level cluster sample.
  Methods. A set of 3496 ACT-DR4 galaxy clusters, spanning the mass range $[10^{14},10^{15.1}]\,\text{M}_{\odot}$ and the redshift range $[0,2]$, is stacked on the ACT-DR6 Compton parameter $y$ map over $\sim13,000\,\text{deg}^2$. An angular Compton profile is then extracted and modeled using the theoretical pressure recipes, whose free parameters are constrained against the measurement via a multi-stage MCMC approach. The analysis is repeated over cluster subsamples spanning smaller mass and redshift ranges.
  Results. All functional forms are effective in reproducing the measured $y$ profiles within their error bars, without a clearly favored model. While best-fit estimates are in broad agreement with previous findings, hints of residual subsample dependency are detected favoring higher amplitudes and steeper profiles in high-mass, low-redshift clusters.
  Conclusions. Population-level cluster studies based on SZ data alone are likely unable to accurately constrain different pressure profile models. Residual trends at population level and scatter at individual cluster level undermine the universal pressure model assumption whenever high precision is required. Finally, functional forms different from the gNFW prove equally effective while being more physically motivated.</description>

      <title>HOPS-288: A Laboratory for Complex Organics in Proto-multiple Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex organic molecules (COMs) in young stellar objects (YSOs) have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their potential connection to pre-biotic chemistry and their utility as tracers of warm or shocked gas components. Proto-binary and multiple systems with close separations are particularly valuable targets for investigating chemical inheritance and reaction, as their members are expected to form from similar material in their parental cloud. We present ALMA observations of the hierarchical proto-triple system HOPS-288, focusing on the physical structure, kinematics, and COM compositions. The system is treated as a proto-binary system consisting of HOPS-288-A and HOPS-288-B due to the limited spatial resolutions, with a separation of 200~au. Three COM-rich features are revealed: two hot corinos associated with the two members, rich in a variety of COMs, and an intervening component between the two members traced by CH$_3$OH and tentatively by CH$_3$CHO. The hot corino in HOPS-288-A exhibits rotational features and might trace a disk. The hot corino in HOPS-288-B is also possibly exhibiting rotational motion. The intervening component could possibly trace a shocked region in the circumbinary disk or a bridge between the two members. The column densities of COMs, including $^{13}$CH$_3$OH, CH$_2$DOH, CH$_3$CHO, HCOOCH$_3$, C$_2$H$_5$OH, $^{13}$CH$_3$CN, and NH$_2$CHO, are broadly similar between the two sources, possibly suggesting the complex organic similarities among proto-binary/multiple systems. Given the complexity of the studied physical structures, further detailed investigations will be essential to confirm this result.</description>

      <title>Time delay measurements with Broken Power Law model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the key challenges in strong gravitational lensing cosmography is the accurate measurement of time delays between multiple lensed images, which are essential for constraining the Hubble constant ($H_0$). We investigate how lens mass-profile assumptions affect time delays. Specifically, we implement a Broken Power Law (BPL) mass model within the Lenstronomy framework (Birrer &amp; Amara 2018), which introduces additional flexibility in the radial mass distribution and can phenomenologically capture deviations from a single power-law profile. This model is combined with a numerical approach to compute time delays at the image positions. We validate the BPL implementation using simulated lenses and compare the results with those obtained from the elliptical power-law (EPL) model. We then apply both model families to the quadruply imaged quasar WGD~2038-4008. Both models fit the imaging and kinematic data comparably well, yet the greater radial freedom in the BPL model shifts the inferred time-delay distance -- and thus $H_0$ -- by an amount comparable to the current discrepancy between early- and late-universe $H_0$ estimates. In a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, the $H_0$ inferred using the BPL lens model is $75^{+23.1}_{-16.3} \ \mathrm{km \ s^{-1} \ Mpc^{-1}},$ while the EPL model gives $H_0 = 61^{+19.2}_{-13.2} \ \mathrm{km \ s^{-1} \ Mpc^{-1}}.$ This difference is largely due to uncertainties in the inner mass profile ($\theta&lt;0.2''$), a region where point spread function (PSF) reconstruction is a critical factor -- a finding consistent with results reported in Shajib et al. (2022). This highlights how time-delay cosmography remains sensitive to assumptions about the lens mass profile. With current precision, this difference does not favor one cosmological scenario over another, but rather underscores the importance of flexible mass modeling and PSF modeling.</description>

      <title>Collapse versus Disruption: The Fate of Compact Stellar Systems in Ultralight Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interference of the ultralight dark matter (ULDM) field generates time-varying gravitational potential fluctuations, which stochastically heat stellar systems embedded in ULDM halos. Small-sized stellar systems are therefore often used to set stringent constraints on ULDM. However, the evolution of systems with sizes well below the ULDM de Broglie wavelength remains poorly explored. Using numerical simulations, we show that the evolution of compact stellar systems in ULDM halos is governed by the interplay between internal stellar relaxation and ULDM-induced heating. We find the following main results. First, in sufficiently compact systems, relaxation-driven core collapse dominates, allowing the system to remain bound and dense, while ULDM-induced stripping of outer stars further accelerates the collapse. Second, in more extended systems, ULDM heating dominates and ultimately disrupts the system. Near the disruption threshold, we identify systems resembling ultra-faint dwarfs like Segue 1. Third, we further introduce a dimensionless parameter to quantify the relative importance of heating and relaxation and finally lead to an evolutionary phase diagram. Our results reveal the rich and nontrivial dynamics of compact stellar systems in ULDM halos, indicating that precise system modeling is essential for robust ULDM constraints.</description>

      <title>The Structure and Kinematics of Three Class 0 Protostellar Jets from JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present observations of jets within 2000 au of three deeply embedded protostars using 2.9-27 micron observations with JWST. These observations show the morphologies and kinematics of the collimated jets from three protostars, the low-mass Class 0 protostars B335 and HOPS 153, and the intermediate-mass protostar HOPS 370. These jets are traced by shock-ionized fine-structure line emission observed with the JWST NIRSpec and MIRI IFUs. We find that [Fe II] emission traces the full extent of the inner 1000 to 2000 au of the jets, depending on distance to the protostar, while other ions mostly trace isolated shocked knots. The jets show evidence of wiggling motion in the plane of the sky as well as asymmetries between blue and red-shifted lobes. The widths of the jets increase non-monotonically with distance from the central protostar, with opening angles ranging from 2.1 degrees to &lt; 10.1 degrees for the three protostars in the sample. The jets have total velocities ranging from 147 to 184 km/s after correcting for disk inclination. For B335, an 8-month gap between NIRSpec and MIRI MRS observations enabled measurement of the tangential velocity of a shocked knot; in combination with the radial velocity, this shows that the jet has a different inclination than the outflow cavity. We find multiple knots before and during a recent outburst in B335, although the knots were more frequent during the burst. The asymmetries between blue- and red-shifted lobes strongly suggest complex interactions between the circumstellar disks and magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>A New Constraint on the Optical Depth from the Reionization History Independent of CMB Large-Scale E-Mode Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies report a mild discrepancy between baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements within the $\Lambda$CDM framework. This discrepancy could be explained if the optical depth $\tau$ inferred from the CMB large-scale E-mode polarization is underestimated, which may be biased by foreground-subtraction or instrumental systematics. In this work, we present a determination of $\tau$ independent of the large-scale E-mode polarization, using the latest measurements of the redshift evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction $x_\mathrm{HI}(z)$, which is constrained by Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and damping-wing absorption measurements at $z\sim5$-$14$, based on ground-based optical and JWST observations. Combining $x_\mathrm{HI}(z)$ with the Planck CMB power spectra excluding the large-scale E-mode polarization, we obtain $\tau=0.0552^{+0.0019}_{-0.0026}$, a stringent constraint consistent with the previous CMB results including the large-scale E-mode. We also evaluate a potential systematic error in our method associated with absorption modeling, obtaining $\tau=0.0552^{+0.0075}_{-0.0049}$. Using this constraint on $\tau$, we resolve the degeneracy in the $\tau$-$\Omega_m$ plane and find a $2.4\sigma$ tension with the DESI DR2 BAO results, thereby confirming the claimed mild discrepancy suggestive of physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM. Finally, we derive an upper limit on the sum of neutrino masses, $\Sigma m_\nu&lt;0.0550\,(0.0717)$ eV at the 95% (99%) confidence level. This limit favors the normal mass ordering and, when combined with the lower limits from neutrino oscillation experiments, yields a further constraint, $\Sigma m_\nu=0.0594_{-0.0007}^{+0.0113}$ eV. However, the cosmological upper limit and the oscillation-based lower limit show a mild $2.2\sigma$ tension, providing an independent indication of possible physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present numerical simulations of dark matter and stellar dynamics in ultra light dark matter halos tailored to mimic dwarf galaxies. An important effect we observe is the dynamical evolution of the stellar half-light radius and velocity dispersion, which makes previous equilibrium models significantly incomplete. Based on half-light radius dynamical evolution, as well as velocity peaks due to soliton core condensation, we show that data from the Fornax, Carina, and Leo II dwarf galaxies disfavores particle masses in the range $ 5\times 10^{-22} \text{ eV} \lesssim m \lesssim 5\times10^{-21}$ eV. Smaller boson masses, around $m\approx1\times10^{-22}$ eV, could cause strong dynamical heating, but we caution that tidal stripping by the Milky Way could moderate the effect. A caveat in our analysis is the omission of stellar self-gravity, which could affect extrapolation back in time if the stellar body was much more compact in the past.</description>

      <title>Can AI Dream of Unseen Galaxies? Conditional Diffusion Model for Galaxy Morphology Augmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observational astronomy relies on visual feature identification to detect critical astrophysical phenomena. While machine learning (ML) increasingly automates this process, models often struggle with generalization in large-scale surveys due to the limited representativeness of labeled datasets, whether from simulations or human annotation, a challenge pronounced for rare yet scientifically valuable objects. To address this, we propose a conditional diffusion model to synthesize realistic galaxy images for augmenting ML training data (hereafter GalaxySD). Leveraging the Galaxy Zoo 2 dataset which contains visual feature, galaxy image pairs from volunteer annotation, we demonstrate that GalaxySD generates diverse, high-fidelity galaxy images that closely adhere to the specified morphological feature conditions. Moreover, this model enables generative extrapolation to project well-annotated data into unseen domains and advancing rare object detection. Integrating synthesized images into ML pipelines improves performance in standard morphology classification, boosting completeness and purity by up to 30% across key metrics. For rare object detection, using early-type galaxies with prominent dust lane features (~0.1% in GZ2 dataset) as a test case, our approach doubled the number of detected instances, from 352 to 872, compared to previous studies based on visual inspection. This study highlights the power of generative models to bridge gaps between scarce labeled data and the vast, uncharted parameter space of observational astronomy and sheds insight for future astrophysical foundation model developments.

      <title>An Improved Fit to the Density Distribution in Supersonic Isothermal Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The density distribution of supersonic isothermal turbulence plays a critical role in many astrophysical systems. It is commonly approximated by a lognormal distribution with a variance of $\sigma_{s,{\rm V}}^2 \approx \ln(1 + b^2 M_{\rm V}^2),$ where $s \equiv \ln \rho/\rho_0,$ $M_{\rm V}$ is the rms volume-weighted Mach number, and $b$ is a parameter that depends on the driving mechanism, which can be solenoidal (divergence-free), compressive (curl-free), or a mix of both. However, this fit neglects the driving correlation time, $\tau_{\rm a}$, which plays a key role when compressive driving is significant. Here we conduct turbulence simulations spanning a wide range of Mach numbers, driving mechanisms, and $\tau_{\rm a}$ values. In the compressive case, $\sigma_{s,{\rm V}}^2$ is not well fit by the standard expression. Instead, it scales approximately linearly with $M_{\rm V},$ and its dependence on $\tau_{\rm a}$ is $\sigma_{s,{\rm V}}^2 \approx M_{\rm V} [1 + \frac{2}{3}(1 + \lambda_{\rm a})\Theta(1 + \lambda_{\rm a})]$, where $\lambda_{\rm a} \equiv \ln(\tau_{\rm a}/\tau_{\rm e})$, $\tau_{\rm e}$ is the eddy turnover time, and $\Theta$ is the Heaviside step function. Mixed-driven turbulence shows a weak dependence on $\tau_{\rm a},$ and for solenoidally-driven turbulence, $\sigma_{s,{\rm V}}^2 \approx \frac{1}{3}M_{\rm V}$, which is consistent with the standard expression when $M_{\rm V} \lesssim 8.$ The volume-weighted mean and skewness also show systematic trends with $M_{\rm V}$ and $\tau_{\rm a}$, deviating from lognormal expectations. The mass-weighted density distribution displays significant broadening and skewness in compressively-driven cases, especially at large $\tau_{\rm a}/\tau_{\rm e}$. These results provide a refined framework for modeling astrophysical turbulence.</description>

      <title>Synthetic polarization observations of magnetized pillars in HII regions: The limitations of the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated the morphology and strength of magnetic fields in pillar-shaped structures at the boundaries of HII regions by combining three-dimensional radiation-magnetohydrodynamic, R-MHD, simulations with synthetic polarimetric observations. Our analysis focuses on the first pillar formed self-consistently in the simulation and is used as a proof of concept to test the applicability of the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) method under conditions dominated by external agents. The pillar arises as the ionization front compresses a dense clump, producing a magnetically aligned, elongated structure whose morphology and field configuration closely resemble those observed in real systems such as the pillars of M16. Synthetic dust-polarization maps at 850 $\mu$m reproduce the large-scale magnetic morphology of the simulated pillar, confirming that polarimetry is a reliable tracer of magnetic field geometry. However, magnetic field strengths inferred using DCF-type methods systematically overestimate intrinsic values from the simulations by factors $\gtrsim 2$. We attribute this discrepancy to the fact that field alignment and amplification are primarily driven by external gas pressure from the expanding HII region rather than internal turbulence, thus violating key assumptions of the DCF method. Our results highlight the need for caution when applying classical DCF-based analysis to pillars or other structures shaped by external compressions.</description>

      <title>Low Metallicity Gas on the Outskirts of the Local Group: the Circumgalactic Medium of Sextans B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a UV absorption-line analysis of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of Sextans B, a dwarf irregular galaxy at 1.3 Mpc distance on the outer frontier of the Local Group. Using HST/COS spectroscopy of two AGN sightlines passing through the Sextans B CGM at small impact parameters of 4 kpc and 8 kpc (0.04 and 0.08 r_vir), we detect the CGM in Si II, Si III, Si IV, and C II absorption. All four ions show a column-density profile that declines with radius. The profiles fall below the average CGM profiles of other nearby dwarfs (by 0.3-0.6 dex, depending on ion), likely due to the low halo mass and low metallicity of Sextans B. Using Cloudy photoionization models and interferometric measurements of the H I column density, we find low gas-phase silicon and carbon abundances in the Sextans B CGM, [Si/H]=-1.7+/-0.2 and [C/H]=-2.1+/-0.2, among the lowest gas-phase abundances anywhere in the Local Group. We calculate a cool CGM gas mass within 8 kpc of $\sim4\times10^7 M_\odot$, comparable to the H I mass and the stellar mass of Sextans B.</description>

      <title>Lomb-Scargle periodograms struggle with non-sinusoidal supermassive BH binary signatures in quasar lightcurves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) systems are expected to form as a consequence of galaxy mergers. At sub-parsec separations, SMBHBs can be identified as quasars with periodic variability with previous periodicity searches uncovering significant candidates. However, these searches focused primarily on sinusoidal signals, while theoretical models and hydrodynamical simulations predict that binaries produce more complex non-sinusoidal pulse shapes. Here we examine the efficacy of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP; one of the most popular tools for periodicity searches in unevenly sampled lightcurves) to detect periodicities with a sawtooth shape mimicking results of hydrodynamical simulations. We simulate idealised well-sampled lightcurves, lightcurves that mimic the data in the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) analyzed in Charisi et al., 2016, and lightcurves that resemble our expectations for single-band data in the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) of the Rubin Observatory. We approximate quasar variability with a damped random walk (DRW) model, inject sinusoidal and sawtooth pulse shapes and assess their statistical significance. We find that in the presence of red noise the LSP detects a relatively low fraction of the sinusoidal signals (~45%, ~24% and ~23%, in the PTF-like, idealised, and LSST-like lightcurves, respectively). The fraction is significantly reduced for sawtooth periodicity (with only ~9% in PTF-like and ~1% in idealised and LSST-like lightcurves). These low recovery rates imply that previous searches have missed the large majority of binaries. They also have significant implications for the detection of SMBHBs in upcoming LSST necessitating the developement of advanced tools that go beyond the simple LSP.</description>

      <title>Reanalyzing DESI DR1: 1. $\Lambda$CDM Constraints from the Power Spectrum and Bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first independent re-analysis of the galaxy clustering data from DESI Data Release 1, utilizing an effective field theory full-shape model. We analyze the power spectra and bispectra of the public catalogs using a custom-built pipeline based on window-deconvolved quasi-optimal estimators, accounting for a number of systematic effects. Compared to the official collaboration analysis, we add the galaxy power spectrum hexadecapole and the bispectrum monopole, and also introduce a novel stochastic estimator for fiber collisions, which facilitates robust bispectrum analyses. As a first application, we perform a full-shape analysis of the DESI power spectra and bispectra in the context of the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM. Using external priors on the physical baryon density and the primordial power spectrum tilt, we constrain the matter density fraction to $\Omega_m=0.284\pm 0.011$, the Hubble constant to $H_0=70.7\pm 1.1$ km/s/Mpc, and the mass fluctuation amplitude to $\sigma_8=0.811\pm 0.030$. The bispectrum sharpens constraints on $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$ by $\approx 10\%$ and shifts $\Omega_m$ by $\approx 1\sigma$ towards the \textit{Planck} $\Lambda$CDM value. Combining our full-shape likelihood with the official DESI DR2 BAO measurements, cosmological parameters shift further towards the \textit{Planck} values, with $\Omega_m=0.296\pm 0.007$, $H_0=68.8\pm 0.6$ km/s/Mpc, $\sigma_8=0.818\pm 0.029$ (with tighter constraints obtained in joint analyses). Similar results are obtained in a joint analysis with DR1 BAO, accounting for the cross-covariance. Finally, the bispectrum data improves measurements of quadratic bias parameters, which are consistent with predictions from halo occupation distribution models. Our work highlights the importance of higher-order statistics and sets the stage for upcoming full-shape analyses of non-minimal cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Universal numerical convergence criteria for subhalo tidal evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter subhalos and satellite galaxies in state-of-the-art cosmological simulations still suffer from the ``overmerging'' problem, where inadequate force and/or mass resolution cause artificially enhanced tidal mass loss and premature disruption. Previous idealized simulations addressing this issue have been restricted to a small subset of the subhalo orbital parameter space, and all assumed subhalos to be isotropic. Here, we present the first extensive simulation suite that quantifies numerical convergence in the tidal evolution of anisotropic subhalos under varying numerical resolutions and orbits. We report a universal force resolution criterion: the subhalo's instantaneous tidal radius must always be resolved by at least 20 cells in adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)-based simulations, or by 20 softening lengths (Plummer equivalent) in tree-based simulations, regardless of refinement details or subhalo physical properties such as concentration or velocity anisotropy. We also report a universal expression for the discreteness-noise-driven scatter in the bound-mass fraction of subhalos that depends only on the subhalo mass resolution at infall and the instantaneous bound mass fraction, agnostic of any further subhalo properties. Such stochastic discreteness noise causes both premature disruption and, notably, spurious survival of poorly mass-resolved subhalos. We demonstrate that as many as 50 percent of all subhalos in state-of-the-art cosmological simulations are likely to be either force and/or mass unresolved. Our findings advocate for adaptive softening or grid refinement based on the instantaneous tidal radius of the subhalo.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength properties of changing-state active galactic nuclei: I. the evolution of soft excess and X-ray continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07337v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Changing-state active galactic nuclei (CSAGNs) exhibit rapid variability, with mass accretion rates that can change by several orders of magnitude in a few years. This provides us with a unique opportunity to study the evolution of the inner accretion flow almost in real time. Here, we used over 1000 observations to study the broadband X-ray spectra of a sample of five CSAGNs, spanning three orders of magnitude in Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$), using phenomenological models to trace the evolution of key spectral components. We derive several fundamental parameters, such as the photon index, soft excess strength, reflection strength, and luminosities of the soft excess and primary continuum. We find that the soft excess and primary continuum emissions show a very strong positive correlation ($p \ll 10^{-10}$), suggesting a common physical origin. The soft excess strength does not show any dependency on the reflection parameter, suggesting that in these objects the soft excess is not dominated by a blurred ionized reflection process. On the other hand, the strength of the soft excess is found to be strongly positively correlated with the Eddington ratio ($p \ll 10^{-10}$), and we find that the soft excess vanishes below $\log \lambda_{\rm Edd} \sim -2.5$. Moreover, we find a clear `V'-shaped relation for $\Gamma-\lambda_{\rm Edd}$, with a break at $\log \lambda_{\rm Edd} = -2.47 \pm 0.09$. Our findings indicate a change in the geometry of the inner accretion flow at low Eddington ratios, and that the soft excess is primarily produced via warm Comptonization.</description>
