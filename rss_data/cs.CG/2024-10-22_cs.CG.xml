      <title>Distributed Computation of Persistent Cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent (co)homology is a central construction in topological data analysis, where it is used to quantify prominence of features in data to produce stable descriptors suitable for downstream analysis. Persistence is challenging to compute in parallel because it relies on global connectivity of the data. We propose a new algorithm to compute persistent cohomology in the distributed setting. It combines domain and range partitioning. The former is used to reduce and sparsify the coboundary matrix locally. After this initial local reduction, we redistribute the matrix across processors for the global reduction. We experimentally compare our cohomology algorithm with DIPHA, the only publicly available code for distributed computation of persistent (co)homology; our algorithm demonstrates a significant improvement in strong scaling.</description>

      <title>Polycubes via Dual Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete characterization of polycubes of any genus based on their dual structure: a collection of oriented loops which run in each of the axis directions and capture polycubes via their intersection patterns. A polycube loop structure uniquely corresponds to a polycube. We also describe all combinatorially different ways to add a loop to a loop structure while maintaining its validity; similarly, we show how to identify loops that can be removed from a polycube loop structure without invalidating it. Our characterization gives rise to an iterative algorithm to construct provably valid polycube-maps for a given input surface; polycube-maps are frequently used to solve texture mapping, spline fitting, and hexahedral meshing. We showcase some results of a proof-of-concept implementation of this iterative algorithm.</description>

      <title>Toroidal density-equalizing map for genus-one surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density-equalizing map is a shape deformation technique originally developed for cartogram creation and sociological data visualization on planar geographical maps. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in developing density-equalizing mapping methods for surface and volumetric domains and applying them to various problems in geometry processing and imaging science. However, the existing surface density-equalizing mapping methods are only applicable to surfaces with relatively simple topologies but not surfaces with topological holes. In this work, we develop a novel algorithm for computing density-equalizing maps for toroidal surfaces. In particular, different shape deformation effects can be easily achieved by prescribing different population functions on the torus and performing diffusion-based deformations on a planar domain with periodic boundary conditions. Furthermore, the proposed toroidal density-equalizing mapping method naturally leads to an effective method for computing toroidal parameterizations of genus-one surfaces with controllable shape changes, with the toroidal area-preserving parameterization being a prime example. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Toolpath Generation for High Density Spatial Fiber Printing Guided by Principal Stresses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While multi-axis 3D printing can align continuous fibers along principal stresses in continuous fiber-reinforced thermoplastic (CFRTP) composites to enhance mechanical strength, existing methods have difficulty generating toolpaths with high fiber coverage. This is mainly due to the orientation consistency constraints imposed by vector-field-based methods and the turbulent stress fields around stress concentration regions. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a 2-RoSy representation for computing the direction field, which is then converted into a periodic scalar field to generate partial iso-curves for fiber toolpaths with nearly equal hatching distance. To improve fiber coverage in stress-concentrated regions, such as around holes, we extend the quaternion-based method for curved slicing by incorporating winding compatibility considerations. Our proposed method can achieve toolpaths coverage between 87.5% and 90.6% by continuous fibers with 1.1mm width. Models fabricated using our toolpaths show up to 84.6% improvement in failure load and 54.4% increase in stiffness when compared to the results obtained from multi-axis 3D printing with sparser fibers.</description>

      <title>Partitioning a Polygon Into Small Pieces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.01359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of partitioning a given simple polygon $P$ into a minimum number of connected polygonal pieces, each of bounded size. We describe a general technique for constructing such partitions that works for several notions of `bounded size,' namely that each piece must be contained in an axis-aligned or arbitrarily rotated unit square or a unit disk, or that each piece has bounded perimeter, straight-line diameter or geodesic diameter. The problems are motivated by practical settings in manufacturing, finite element analysis, collision detection, vehicle routing, shipping and laser capture microdissection.
  The version where each piece should be contained in an axis-aligned unit square is already known to be NP-hard [Abrahamsen and Stade, FOCS, 2024], and the other versions seem no easier. Our main result is to develop constant-factor approximation algorithms, which means that the number of pieces in the produced partition is at most a constant factor larger than the cardinality of an optimal partition. Existing algorithms [Damian and Pemmaraju, Algorithmica, 2004] do not allow Steiner points, which means that all corners of the produced pieces must also be corners of $P$. This has the disappointing consequence that a partition often does not exist, whereas our algorithms always produce meaningful partitions. Furthermore, an optimal partition without Steiner points may require $\Omega(n)$ pieces for polygons with $n$ corners where a partition consisting of just $2$ pieces exists when Steiner points are allowed. Other existing algorithms [Arkin, Das, Gao, Goswami, Mitchell, Polishchuk and T\'oth, ESA, 2020] only allow $P$ to be split along chords (and aim to minimize the number of chords instead of the number of pieces), whereas we make no constraints on the boundaries of the pieces.</description>
