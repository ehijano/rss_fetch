      <title>A Real K3 Automorphism with Most of Its Entropy in the Real Part</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article describes an example of a real projective K3 surface admitting a real automorphism $f$ satisfying $h_{top}(f, X(\mathbb{C})) &lt; 2 h_{top}(f, X(\mathbb{R}))$. The example presented is a $(2,2,2)$-surface in $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$ given by the vanishing set of $(1 + x^2)(1 + y^2)(1 + z^2) + 10xyz - 2$, first considered by McMullen. Along the way, we develop an ad hoc shadowing lemma for $C^2$ (real) surface diffeomorphisms, and apply it to estimate the location of a periodic point in $X(\mathbb{R})$. This result uses the GNU MPFR arbitrary precision arithmetic library in C and the Flipper computer program.</description>

      <title>Circadian Clock Model with Sequestration Repression Motif: Existence of Periodic Orbits and Entrainment Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein sequestration motifs appear in many biological regulatory networks and introduce special properties into the network dynamics. Sequestration can be described as a mode of inactivation of a given protein by its binding to a second protein to form a new complex. In this complexed form, the original protein is prevented from performing its specific functions and is thus rendered inactive. We study a mathematical model of the mammalian circadian clock with a protein sequestration motif, which generates one of the negative feedback loops that guarantees periodic behavior. First, the motif permits a time-scale separation, which can be used to simplify the model. We show that the simplified model admits a periodic orbit over a fairly large region of parameters. Second, we are able to show that the sequestration motif induces a phase response curve with a very specific form, implying that external perturbations can affect the system only in a narrow window of the periodic orbit. Finally, we compare our model with a classic Goodwin oscillator, to illustrate the dynamical and robustness properties induced by the protein sequestration motif.</description>

      <title>Beyond water limitation in vegetation-autotoxicity patterning: a cross-diffusion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many mathematical models describing vegetation patterns are based on biomass--water interactions, due to the impact of this limited resource in arid and semi-arid environments. However, in recent years, a novel biological factor called autotoxicity has proved to play a key role in vegetation spatiotemporal dynamics, particularly by inhibiting biomass growth and increasing its natural mortality rate. In a standard reaction-diffusion framework, biomass-toxicity dynamics alone are unable to support the emergence of stable spatial patterns. In this paper, we derive a cross-diffusion model for biomass and toxicity dynamics as the fast-reaction limit of a three-species system involving dichotomy and different time scales. Within this general framework, in addition to growth inhibition and extra-mortality already considered in previous studies, the additional effect of ''propagation reduction'' induced by autotoxicity on vegetation dynamics is obtained. By combining linearised analysis, simulations, and continuation, we investigate the formation of spatial patterns. Thanks to the cross-diffusion term, for the first time, a spatial model based solely on biomass-toxicity feedback without explicit water dynamics supports the formation of stable (Turing) vegetation patterns for a wide range of parameter values.</description>

      <title>H\"older continuity of Lyapunov exponents for non-invertible and non-compact random cocycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the regularity of Lyapunov exponents for random linear cocycles taking values in $\Mat_m(\R)$ and driven by i.i.d. processes. Under three natural conditions - finite exponential moments, a spectral gap between the top two Lyapunov exponents, and quasi-irreducibility of the associated semigroup - we prove that the top Lyapunov exponent is H\"older continuous with respect to the Wasserstein distance. In the final section, we apply the main results to Schr\"odinger cocycles with unbounded potentials.</description>

      <title>Age-Structured Population Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter reviews some aspects of the theory of age-structured models of populations with finite maximum age. We formulate both the renewal equation for the birth rate and the partial differential equation for the age density, and show their equivalence. Next, we define and discuss central concepts in population dynamics, like the basic reproduction number $R_0$, the Malthusian parameter $r$, and the stable age distribution. We briefly review the sun-star theory that turns the birth term into a bounded additive perturbation, thus allowing to develop stability and bifurcation theory along standard lines. Finally, we review the pseudospectral approximation of the infinite-dimensional age-structured models by means of a finite system of ordinary differential equations, which allows to perform numerical bifurcation analysis with existing software tools. Here, Nicholson's blowfly equation serves as a worked example.</description>

      <title>The size of the sync basin resolved</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparsely coupled Kuramoto oscillators offer a fertile playground for exploring high-dimensional basins of attraction due to their simple yet multistable dynamics. For $n$ identical Kuramoto oscillators on cycle graphs, it is well known that the only attractors are twisted states, whose phases wind around the circle with a constant gap between neighboring oscillators ($\theta_j = 2\pi q j/n$). It was conjectured in 2006 that basin sizes of these twisted states scale as $e^{-kq^2}$ to the winding number $q$. Here, we provide new numerical and analytical evidence supporting the conjecture and uncover the dynamical mechanism behind the Gaussian scaling. The key idea is that, when starting with a random initial condition, the winding number of the solution stabilizes rapidly at $t \propto \log n$, before long-range correlation can develop among oscillators. This timescale separation allows us to model the winding number as a sum of weakly dependent variables, leading to a Central Limit Theorem derivation of the basin scaling.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the spectrum of a class of multidimensional quasi-periodic Schr\"odinger operators that exhibit a Cantor spectrum, which provides a resolution to a question posed by Damanik, Fillman, and Gorodetski \cite{DFG}. Additionally, we prove that for a dense set of irrational frequencies with positive Hausdorff dimension, the Hausdorff (and upper box) dimension of the spectrum of the critical almost Mathieu operator is positive, yet can be made arbitrarily small.</description>

      <title>A fast and memoryless numerical method for solving fractional differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The numerical solution of implicit and stiff differential equations by implicit numerical integrators has been largely investigated and there exist many excellent efficient codes available in the scientific community, as Radau5 (based on a Runge-Kutta collocation method at Radau points) and Dassl, based on backward differentiation formulas, among the others. When solving fractional ordinary differential equations (ODEs), the derivative operator is replaced by a non-local one and the fractional ODE is reformulated as a Volterra integral equation, to which these codes cannot be directly applied.
  This article is a follow-up of the article by the authors (Guglielmi and Hairer, SISC, 2025) for differential equations with distributed delays. The main idea is to approximate the fractional kernel $t^{\alpha -1}/ \Gamma (\alpha )$ ($\alpha &gt;0$) by a sum of exponential functions or by a sum of exponential functions multiplied by a monomial, and then to transform the fractional integral (of convolution type) into a set of ordinary differential equations. The augmented system is typically stiff and thus requires the use of an implicit method. It can have a very large dimension and requires a special treatment of the arising linear systems.
  The present work presents an algorithm for the construction of an approximation of the fractional kernel by a sum of exponential functions, and it shows how the arising linear systems in a stiff time integrator can be solved efficiently. It is explained how the code Radau5 can be used for solving fractional differential equations. Numerical experiments illustrate the accuracy and the efficiency of the proposed method. Driver examples are publicly available from the homepages of the authors.</description>

      <title>Classification complexity of chaotic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the classification complexity of continuous (Devaney) chaotic systems in dimensions $0,1$ and $\infty$ using the framework of invariant descriptive set theory. We identify the complexity in dimensions $0$ and $\infty$, while in dimension $1$ we get some partial results.
  More precisely, we prove the topological conjugacy relation of invertible chaotic systems on the Hilbert cube (resp. on all compact metric spaces) has the same complexity as (i.e. is Borel bireducible with) the universal orbit relation induced by a Polish group. As a consequence, this answers a recent question asked by L. Ding. We also prove that the topological conjugacy relation of invertible chaotic systems on the Cantor space has the same complexity as the universal relation induced by the group $S_\infty$. This answers a recent question by M. Foreman. Some non-trivial bounds on the classification complexity of chaotic systems on the interval and on the circle are also obtained. Namely, the lower bound is the Vitali equivalence relation, and the upper bound is the equality of countable sets of reals. This especially implies that the relation is Borel. However, the exact complexity remains unknown.</description>

      <title>Boundaries and equivariant maps for ergodic groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a notion of boundary pair $(\mathcal{B}_-,\mathcal{B}_+)$ for measured groupoids which generalizes the one introduced by Bader and Furman \cite{BF14} for locally compact groups. In the case of a semidirect groupoid $\mathcal{G}=\Gamma \ltimes X$ obtained by a probability measure preserving action $\Gamma \curvearrowright X$ of a locally compact group, we show that a boundary pair is exactly $(B_- \times X, B_+ \times X)$, where $(B_-,B_+)$ is a boundary pair for $\Gamma$. For any measured groupoid $(\mathcal{G},\nu)$, we prove that the Poisson boundaries associated to the Markov operators generated by a probability measure equivalent to $\nu$ provide other examples of our definition.
  Following Bader and Furman \cite{BF:Unpub}, we define algebraic representability for an ergodic groupoid $(\mathcal{G},\nu)$. In this way, given any measurable representation $\rho:\mathcal{G} \rightarrow H$ into the $\kappa$-points of an algebraic $\kappa$-group $\mathbf{H}$, we obtain $\rho$-equivariant maps $\mathcal{B}_\pm \rightarrow H/L_\pm$, where $L_\pm=\mathbf{L}_\pm(\kappa)$ for some $\kappa$-subgroups $\mathbf{L}_\pm&lt;\mathbf{H}$. In the particular case when $\kappa=\mathbb{R}$ and $\rho$ is Zariski dense, we show that $L_\pm$ must be minimal parabolic subgroups.</description>

      <title>Indecomposable continua for unbounded itineraries of exponential maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13859v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the exponential maps $E_{\lambda}: \mathbb{C} \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}$ defined by $E_{\lambda}(z) = \lambda e^z$, where $\lambda &gt; \frac{1}{e}$. We prove that for itineraries of a certain form, the set of all points sharing the given itinerary, together with the point at infinity, is an indecomposable continuum in the Riemann sphere. These itineraries contain infinitely many blocks of zeros whose lengths increase, and they may be unbounded. We prove that in every such continuum, there exists exactly one point whose $\omega$-limit set contains the repelling fixed point of $E_{\lambda}$. For every other point, the $\omega$-limit set is equal either to the point at infinity, or to the forward orbit of $0$ together with the point at infinity. Thus, we generalize the results of R. Devaney and X. Jarque concerning indecomposable continua for bounded itineraries.</description>

      <title>Data-driven stabilization of switched and constrained linear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.11392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the design of state feedback control laws for both the switching signal and the continuous input of an unknown switched linear system, given past noisy input-state trajectories measurements. Based on Lyapunov-Metzler inequalities, we derive data-dependent bilinear programs whose solution directly returns a provably stabilizing controller and ensures $\mathcal{H}_2$ or $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ performance. We further present relaxations that considerably reduce the computational cost, still without requiring stabilizability of any of the switching modes. Finally, we showcase the flexibility of our approach on the constrained stabilization problem for a perturbed linear system. We validate our theoretical findings numerically, demonstrating the favourable trade-off between conservatism and tractability achieved by the proposed relaxations.</description>
