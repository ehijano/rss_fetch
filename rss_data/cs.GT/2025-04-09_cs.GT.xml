      <title>From Fairness to Truthfulness: Rethinking Data Valuation Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models increasingly rely on external data sources, fairly compensating data contributors has become a central concern. In this paper, we revisit the design of data markets through a game-theoretic lens, where data owners face private, heterogeneous costs for data sharing. We show that commonly used valuation methods--such as Leave-One-Out and Data Shapley--fail to ensure truthful reporting of these costs, leading to inefficient market outcomes. To address this, we adapt well-established payment rules from mechanism design, namely Myerson and Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG), to the data market setting. We demonstrate that the Myerson payment is the minimal truthful payment mechanism, optimal from the buyer's perspective, and that VCG and Myerson payments coincide in unconstrained allocation settings. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating incentive compatibility into data valuation, paving the way for more robust and efficient data markets.</description>

      <title>To Give or Not to Give? The Impacts of Strategically Withheld Recourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individuals often aim to reverse undesired outcomes in interactions with automated systems, like loan denials, by either implementing system-recommended actions (recourse), or manipulating their features. While providing recourse benefits users and enhances system utility, it also provides information about the decision process that can be used for more effective strategic manipulation, especially when the individuals collectively share such information with each other.
  We show that this tension leads rational utility-maximizing systems to frequently withhold recourse, resulting in decreased population utility, particularly impacting sensitive groups.
  To mitigate these effects, we explore the role of recourse subsidies, finding them effective in increasing the provision of recourse actions by rational systems, as well as lowering the potential social cost and mitigating unfairness caused by recourse withholding.</description>

      <title>Impact of Price Inflation on Algorithmic Collusion Through Reinforcement Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic pricing is increasingly shaping market competition, raising concerns about its potential to compromise competitive dynamics. While prior work has shown that reinforcement learning (RL)-based pricing algorithms can lead to tacit collusion, less attention has been given to the role of macroeconomic factors in shaping these dynamics. This study examines the role of inflation in influencing algorithmic collusion within competitive markets. By incorporating inflation shocks into a RL-based pricing model, we analyze whether agents adapt their strategies to sustain supra-competitive profits. Our findings indicate that inflation reduces market competitiveness by fostering implicit coordination among agents, even without direct collusion. However, despite achieving sustained higher profitability, agents fail to develop robust punishment mechanisms to deter deviations from equilibrium strategies. The results suggest that inflation amplifies non-competitive dynamics in algorithmic pricing, emphasizing the need for regulatory oversight in markets where AI-driven pricing is prevalent.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Double Auction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Auctions are important mechanisms extensively implemented in various markets, e.g., search engines' keyword auctions, antique auctions, etc. Finding an optimal auction mechanism is extremely difficult due to the constraints of imperfect information, incentive compatibility (IC), and individual rationality (IR). In addition to the traditional economic methods, some recently attempted to find the optimal (single) auction using deep learning methods. Unlike those attempts focusing on single auctions, we develop deep learning methods for double auctions, where imperfect information exists on both the demand and supply sides. The previous attempts on single auction cannot directly apply to our contexts and those attempts additionally suffer from limited generalizability, inefficiency in ensuring the constraints, and learning fluctuations. We innovate in designing deep learning models for solving the more complex problem and additionally addressing the previous models' three limitations. Specifically, we achieve generalizability by leveraging a transformer-based architecture to model market participants as sequences for varying market sizes; we utilize the numerical features of the constraints and pre-treat them for a higher learning efficiency; we develop a gradient-conflict-elimination scheme to address the problem of learning fluctuation. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our approach to classical and machine learning baselines.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Prediction: Tractable Information Aggregation via Agreement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give efficient "collaboration protocols" through which two parties, who observe different features about the same instances, can interact to arrive at predictions that are more accurate than either could have obtained on their own. The parties only need to iteratively share and update their own label predictions-without either party ever having to share the actual features that they observe. Our protocols are efficient reductions to the problem of learning on each party's feature space alone, and so can be used even in settings in which each party's feature space is illegible to the other-which arises in models of human/AI interaction and in multi-modal learning. The communication requirements of our protocols are independent of the dimensionality of the data. In an online adversarial setting we show how to give regret bounds on the predictions that the parties arrive at with respect to a class of benchmark policies defined on the joint feature space of the two parties, despite the fact that neither party has access to this joint feature space. We also give simpler algorithms for the same task in the batch setting in which we assume that there is a fixed but unknown data distribution. We generalize our protocols to a decision theoretic setting with high dimensional outcome spaces, where parties communicate only "best response actions."
  Our theorems give a computationally and statistically tractable generalization of past work on information aggregation amongst Bayesians who share a common and correct prior, as part of a literature studying "agreement" in the style of Aumann's agreement theorem. Our results require no knowledge of (or even the existence of) a prior distribution and are computationally efficient. Nevertheless we show how to lift our theorems back to this classical Bayesian setting, and in doing so, give new information aggregation theorems for Bayesian agreement.</description>

      <title>Optimal classification with outcome performativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I consider the problem of classifying individual behavior in a simple setting of outcome performativity where the behavior the algorithm seeks to classify is itself dependent on the algorithm. I show in this context that the most accurate classifier is either a threshold or a negative threshold rule. A threshold rule offers the "good" classification to those individuals whose outcome likelihoods are greater than some cutpoint, while a negative threshold rule offers the "good" outcome to those whose outcome likelihoods are less than some cutpoint. While seemingly pathological, I show that a negative threshold rule can be the most accurate classifier when outcomes are performative. I provide an example of such a classifier, and extend the analysis to more general algorithm objectives, allowing the algorithm to differentially weigh false negatives and false positives, for example.</description>

      <title>Competitive and Revenue-Optimal Pricing with Budgets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03692v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In markets with budget-constrained buyers, competitive equilibria need not be efficient in the utilitarian sense, or maximise the seller's revenue. We consider a setting with multiple divisible goods. Competitive equilibrium outcomes, and only those, are constrained utilitarian efficient, a notion of utilitarian efficiency that respects buyers' demands and budgets. Our main contribution establishes that, when buyers have linear valuations, competitive equilibrium prices are unique and revenue-optimal for a zero-cost seller.</description>

      <title>Drawing a Map of Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our main contribution is the introduction of the map of elections framework. A map of elections consists of three main elements: (1) a dataset of elections (i.e., collections of ordinal votes over given sets of candidates), (2) a way of measuring similarities between these elections, and (3) a representation of the elections in the 2D Euclidean space as points, so that the more similar two elections are, the closer are their points. In our maps, we mostly focus on datasets of synthetic elections, but we also show an example of a map over real-life ones. To measure similarities, we would have preferred to use, e.g., the isomorphic swap distance, but this is infeasible due to its high computational complexity. Hence, we propose polynomial-time computable positionwise distance and use it instead. Regarding the representations in 2D Euclidean space, we mostly use the Kamada-Kawai algorithm, but we also show two alternatives. We develop the necessary theoretical results to form our maps and argue experimentally that they are accurate and credible. Further, we show how coloring the elections in a map according to various criteria helps in analyzing results of a number of experiments. In particular, we show colorings according to the scores of winning candidates or committees, running times of ILP-based winner determination algorithms, and approximation ratios achieved by particular algorithms.</description>
