      <title>Unified kinetic theory of induced scattering: Compton, Brillouin, and Raman processes in magnetized electron and positron pair plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified theoretical framework for induced (stimulated) scattering-parametric instabilities of electromagnetic waves, including induced Compton, stimulated Brillouin, and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) in strongly magnetized electron-positron pair plasma. By solving the dispersion relations derived from kinetic theory, taking into account the ponderomotive force due to the beat of incident and scattered waves, we obtain analytical expressions for the linear growth rates of the ordinary, neutral, and charged modes of density fluctuations. Our results clarify which type of scattering dominates under different thermal coupling, resonance, and density conditions. In strong magnetic fields, scattering of perpendicularly polarized waves is generally suppressed, but by different powers of the cyclotron frequency. Moreover, SRS, which is forbidden in unmagnetized electron and positron pair plasma, becomes possible in the charged mode. This framework enables a comprehensive evaluation of induced scattering in extreme astrophysical and laboratory plasma, such as fast radio burst (FRB) emission and propagation in magnetar magnetospheres.</description>

      <title>Mean Motion Resonances in AGN Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mean motion resonances (MMRs) are a generic outcome of convergent migration for bodies embedded in accretion disks around a central mass. Long studied in planetary systems, the same phenomenon should occur for stellar-mass black holes (BHs) in AGN disks. In this work, we derive simple analytic criteria describing when BH pairs are driven out of resonance, and use them to chart MMR stability across AGN parameter space, accounting for disruption from general-relativistic apsidal precession, hydrodynamic turbulence, and stellar stirring. Across plausible AGN disk models, we find three MBH mass regimes: (i) for $M/ M_\odot\gtrsim 10^{7.5}$, first order resonances are generically unstable; (ii) for $M/ M_\odot\lesssim 10^{6.5}$, stable MMRs are always present; (iii) for $10^{6.5}\lesssim M / M_\odot \lesssim 10^{7.5}$, stability depends on disk mass flux, the summed mass of the orbiters, and the nuclear-cusp slope. When present, stable MMRs commonly occur between an inner anti-trap and an outer trap set by thermal torque, a region where embedded objects migrate outward in the disk. These results imply that high-mass AGN allow convergent migration to proceed to LVK-band mergers largely without resonant chains, whereas low/intermediate-mass AGN can host MMRs, with the potential to reshape merger pathways.</description>

      <title>Strategy for identifying Vera C. Rubin Observatory kilonova candidates for targeted gravitational-wave searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the observation of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 and the associated kilonova AT2017gfo, the next joint gravitational-wave/optical kilonova has been highly anticipated. Overlapping observations between the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the international gravitational-wave detector network are expected soon. Wide-field survey facilities, such as Rubin, can serve dual roles in gravitational-wave astronomy: conducting dedicated optical counterpart searches following gravitational-wave triggers and, through surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), providing opportunities for fortuitous kilonova discoveries during routine operations. We use simulations to develop a strategy for identifying kilonova candidates observed by Rubin and processed by the Fink broker. These candidates can be used as astrophysical triggers for a targeted gravitational-wave search. We simulate kilonovae light-curves for the first year of Rubin with the latest observing strategy for the Wide-Fast-Deep and the Deep Drilling Fields. Assuming a kilonova rate of 250 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, we find that Rubin brokers should observe $\sim 4$ kilonovae per year with at least one alert above a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 within the gravitational-wave detector horizon ($\sim 350$ Mpc). Most of these will be faint, and detected 1-2 days following the neutron star merger. Photometric and spectroscopic follow-up will be limited to large telescopes. Using archival data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and our proposed selection criteria, we estimate a minimum contamination of at least 30 events per month from other transients and variables, even under our strictest selection criteria. A deep gravitational-wave search targeting Rubin kilonova candidates may lead to the next multi-messenger discovery.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray Transport and Gamma-Ray Signatures in the Interstellar Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of cosmic rays (CRs) with magnetic fields and the interstelar medium (ISM) leads to the production of nonthermal radiation. Although this has been a topic of study for many years, it still poses many challenges to the understanding of these processes. In this work we present a short review of recent advances in the understanding of CR propagation in magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) turbulence, in particular the process of mirror diffusion, and how it can help explain recent observational constraints for CR diffusion away from sources. We also present preliminary results from Monte Carlo simulations of CR cascading and propagation within a young massive stellar cluster (YMSC), aimed at probing the origin of very-high-energy (VHE) emission from these sources.</description>

      <title>Galactic X-ray Transients in the First eROSITA All Sky Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although a multitude of studies have focused on targeted observations of Galactic X-ray transients, blind surveys and population studies have been limited. We have used the ROSAT, eROSITA and Gaia source catalogs to find Galactic X-ray transients having timescales $&lt;$30 years. We report the properties of 738 transients found in our search, majority of which are active stars or interacting binaries. We have also found $\sim$40 compact object systems among which are at least 8 newly-identified white-dwarf systems, 3 known X-ray binaries, and one known pulsar. We use eROSITA (soft X-ray) spectra of the Galactic transients to show that two distinct types of flaring systems are prevalent: one having peak around 1 keV, well fit by thermal models, and another having peak below 0.2 keV and requiring a power-law component. Our study also reveals that single star or interacting binary systems (X-ray transients) involving giant stars exhibit significantly higher X-ray luminosities than systems involving only main-sequence stars or young stellar objects. Finally, we discuss the properties of the transients in the context of their putative emission mechanisms, the fraction of transients with respect to the total population, and the rates of Galactic transients expected in blind searches of the X-ray sky.</description>

      <title>Exploring the connection between compact object mergers and fast X-ray transients: The cases of LXT 240402A &amp; EP250207b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13015v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The connection between compact object mergers and some extragalactic fast X-ray transients (FXRTs) has long been hypothesized, but never ultimately established. In this work, we investigate two FXRTs, the LEIA X-ray Transient LXT 240402A and the Einstein Probe EP250207b, whose precise positions lie close to nearby ($z\!\lesssim\!0.1$) quiescent galaxies with negligible probability of chance coincidence, identifying them as particularly promising cases of merger-driven explosions in the local Universe. We used Chandra to derive accurate localizations for both events and secure otherwise ambiguous associations with their optical counterparts. Deep optical and near-infrared observations with VLT, GTC, and LBT were performed to characterize the surrounding environment and search for kilonova emission, the hallmark of neutron star mergers. Complementary early-time X-ray monitoring with Swift and Einstein Probe was used to constrain the non-thermal afterglow. We find that both FXRTs remain compatible with a compact binary merger progenitor, which produced low-mass ejecta and kilonova emission subdominant to the afterglow. However, alternative explanations such as a distant ($z\!\gtrsim\!1$) core-collapse supernova cannot be conclusively ruled out.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-Wave Signatures of Highly Eccentric Stellar-Mass Binary Black Holes in Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant fraction of compact-object mergers in galactic nuclei are expected to be eccentric in the Laser-Interferometer-Space-Antenna (LISA) frequency sensitivity range, $10^{-4} - 10^{-1}\ \rm Hz$. Several compact binaries detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration may retain hints of residual eccentricity at $10$~Hz, suggesting dynamical or triple origins for a significant fraction of the gravitational-wave-observable population. In triple systems, von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations perturb both the eccentricity and the argument of pericentre, $\omega$, of the inner black hole binary. The latter could be fully \textit{circulating}, where $\omega$ cycles through $2\pi$, or may \textit{librate}, with $\omega$ ranges about a fixed value with small or large variation. We use \texttt{TSUNAMI}, a regularised N-body code with up to 3.5 post-Newtonian (PN) term corrections, to identify four different families of orbits: (i) circulating, (ii) small and (iii) large amplitude librating, and (iv) merging orbits. We develop and demonstrate a new method to construct gravitational waveforms using the quadrupole formula utilising the instantaneous {\it total} acceleration of each binary component in \texttt{TSUNAMI}. We show that the four orbital families have distinct waveform phenomenologies, enabling them to be distinguished if observed in LISA. The orbits are also distinguishable from an isolated binary or from a binary perturbed by a different tertiary orbit, even if the secular timescale is the same. Future burst timing models will be able to distinguish the different orbital configurations. For efficient binary formation, about $\sim 50$ binaries can have librating orbits in the Galactic Centre.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant fraction of gravitational-wave mergers are expected to be eccentric in the Laser-Interferometer-Space-Antenna (LISA) frequency band, $10^{-4} - 10^{-1}$ Hz. Several LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA events show potential hints of residual eccentricity at 10 Hz, pointing to dynamical or triple origins for part of the population, where von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations can perturb both the eccentricity and the inclination of the binary. Moreover, the argument of pericentre, $\omega$ could be fully circulating, or librating, with a limited range for $\omega$. We use TSUNAMI, a regularised N-body code with 3.5PN corrections to identify four different orbital families: (i) circulating, (ii) small-amplitude and (iii) large-amplitude librating, and (iv) merging. We develop a new method to construct gravitational-wave waveforms using the quadrupole formula from the instantaneous acceleration in TSUNAMI. The four orbital families have distinct waveform phenomenologies, enabling them to be distinguished if observed in LISA. In particular, the properties of the tertiary companion can be inferred and serve as an independent mass measurement and distinguish field triple dynamics from galactic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Some problems associated with the standardization of the light curve of type 1a supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the parameters used to standardize the luminosity of Type 1a supernovae in the SALT2 and SiFTO models are strongly dependent on the redshift z. Consequently, when standardized with increasing z, the average absolute magnitudes of Type 1a supernovae are artificially increased. This means that for a given apparent magnitude they are, on average, assigned larger distances than they actually are, creating the appearance of their recession with acceleration and requiring the introduction of the concept of antigravity (dark energy) to explain it. We also show that after standardization, Type 1a supernovae cease to be standard candles. We therefore argue that such a standardization is not suitable for measuring the distances to Type 1a supernovae, and hence the accelerating expansion of the Universe is called into question.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo simulation of the Compton scattering and disk reflection of a cylinder with hot electrons moving away from a black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For accreting black holes (BHs), the lamp-post scenario is a simple and popular model: a hot and point-like corona is located above the black hole, irradiating the accretion disk with hard X-ray radiation, which is believed to be generated by inverse Compton scattering in the corona. Although the lamp-post model successfully explains the disk reflection component, it fails to address the origin of seed photons and the geometry of the hot corona, because this model simplistically treats the corona as a point-like source generating a cutoff powerlaw spectrum. In this paper, we make simulations on a possible physical realization of the lamp-post scenario: the shape of the scattering zone is set to be a cylinder, corresponding to the jet base near a BH. The source of seed photons in this system is assumed to be the multicolor blackbody radiation of the accretion disk. In our simulations, the Compton scattering process is simulated with a custom Monte Carlo program based on the Geant4 package and the disk reflection process is simulated with the xilconv model in XSPEC. Our simulation results have confirmed that the relativistic motion of the jet can weaken or even completely suppress the reflection of the accretion disk, and simultaneously, the Comptonization of disk photons in the jet can still make a major contribution to the observed X-ray spectrum in high energy range. We discuss the implications of our simulation results, in light of the recent observations of a very weak reflection component in the presence of a strong hard X-ray radiation from the outburst of Swift J1727.8-1613.</description>

      <title>Relativistic reflection within an extended hot plasma geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reflection of X-rays at the inner accretion disk around black holes imprints relativistically broadened features in the observed spectrum. Besides the black hole properties and the ionization and density of the accretion disk the features also depend on the location and geometry of the primary source of X-rays, often called the corona. We present a fast general relativistic model for spectral fitting of a radially extended, ring-like corona above the accretion disk. A commonly used model to explain observed X-ray reflection spectra is the lamp post, which assumes a point-like source on the rotational axis of the black hole. While often being able to explain the observations, this geometric model does not allow for a constraint on the radial size of the corona. We therefore extend the publicly available relativistic reflection model RELXILL by implementing a radially extended, ring-like primary source. With the new RELXILL model allowing us to vary the position of the primary source in two dimensions, we present simulated line profiles and spectra and discuss implications of data fitting compared to the lamp post model. We then apply this extended RELXILL model to XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data of the radio-quiet Seyfert-2 AGN ESO 033-G002. The new model describes the data well, and we are able to constrain the distance of the source to the black hole to be less than three gravitational radii, while the angular position of the source is poorly constrained. We show that a compact, radially extended corona close to the ISCO can explain the observed relativistic reflection equally well as the point-like lamp post corona. The model is made freely available to the community.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Neutrino Emission from X-ray Bright Active Galactic Nuclei with IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, IceCube reported neutrino emission from the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068. Using 13.1 years of IceCube data, we present a follow-up search for neutrino sources in the northern sky. NGC 1068 remains the most significant neutrino source among 110 preselected gamma-ray emitters while also being spatially compatible with the most significant location in the northern sky. Its energy spectrum is characterized by an unbroken power-law with spectral index $\gamma = 3.4 \pm 0.2$. Consistent with previous results, the observed neutrino flux exceeds its gamma-ray counterpart by at least two orders of magnitude. Motivated by this disparity and the high X-ray luminosity of the source, we selected 47 X-ray bright Seyfert galaxies from the Swift/BAT spectroscopic survey that were not included in the list of gamma-ray emitters. When testing this collection for neutrino emission, we observe a 3.3$\sigma$ excess from an ensemble of 11 sources, with NGC 1068 excluded from the sample. Our results strengthen the evidence that X-ray bright cores of active galactic nuclei are neutrino emitters.</description>

      <title>The Formation Rate and Luminosity Function of Fast X-ray transients from Einstein probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following its launch on January 9, 2024, the Einstein Probe (EP) telescope has detected hundreds of fast X-ray transients (FXTs), yet their physical origins remain elusive. Understanding their luminosity function and formation rate is crucial for elucidating their nature. Based on the latest catalog of EP-detected FXTs, we present, a model-independent, non-parametric approach to derive the luminosity function and formation rate of FXTs. Our analysis reveals significant cosmological luminosity evolution, characterized by a scaling relationship of $(1+z)^{3.58}$. After accounting for this evolution, we establish that the local luminosity function is best represented by a broken power law, with a break luminosity of $(4.17 \pm 0.34) \times 10^{46}$ erg/s. The formation rate exhibits a gentle decline with redshift, following the relation $(1+z)^{-0.21}$, yielding a local rate of approximately $28.0_{-16.4}^{+27.3}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. This rate is comparable to that of low-luminosity long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs). Our findings indicate a potential correlation between FXTs and LGRBs, supporting the majority of FXTs may be linked to collapsar progenitors.</description>

      <title>The 2024 outburst of the neutron star LMXB EXO 0748-676: an investigation of bursts and eclipses with AstroSat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the Type-I (thermonuclear) X-ray bursts and eclipses observed from the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) EXO 0748--676 with AstroSat during the second known outburst of the source following a 16-year-long quiescence period. We detect three thermonuclear X-ray bursts, with two displaying simultaneous coverage in the soft X-rays. Simultaneous UV observations show evidence of reprocessed burst emissions in the far-ultraviolet band. The time-resolved spectral analysis reveals the photospheric radius expansion (PRE) nature for two bursts. We estimate the distance to the source to be $7.42\pm0.53$ kpc using the peak flux of PRE. Notably, one of the bursts exhibited a secondary peak, $\sim30$ s after the primary, particularly dominating in the softer X-rays, which reveals a correlation with the evolution of burst hotspot radius with no temperature dependence. The burst properties and corresponding flux values suggest that mixed H/He burning may have fueled the bursts. We also detect evidence of a soft excess during one burst, likely arising from the interaction of the burst photons with the surroundings. We uncover evidence for a hard X-ray deficit during the peak of all bursts and a hard lag of $\sim4$ s, which can be attributed to the Compton cooling of the corona by the burst photons. We also probe the temporal evolution and the energy dependence of the eclipses, which offer insights into the binary environment. Our study helps gain deeper insight into the physics of burst ignition, flame propagation, the burst-accretion interaction, and the evolution of LMXBs.</description>

      <title>Hyperons and $\Delta$'s in rotating protoneutron stars: Local properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural evolution of rotating protoneutron stars encodes essential information about their observable signatures, while microscopic properties provide complementary knowledge to advance observational investigations. Using a relativistic mean-field model with density-dependent couplings that account for temperature and particle composition, we investigate rotation, neutrino-emission-driven changes in angular momentum, particle distributions, temperature profiles, and sound speed to probe the internal dynamics of protoneutron star matter. Additionally, we track the evolution of macroscopic quantities such as energy distribution and gravitational mass and establish direct links between microphysics and global evolution. Extending the framework of Phys. Rev. D 112, 023007 (2025), which focuses on the global properties of rotating protoneutron star evolution, our results reveal that protoneutron star deformation and thermal evolution are governed by angular momentum, mass, and composition. Exotic matter (hyperons and $\Delta$-resonances) and rapid rotation enhance deformation leading to a reduction in core temperature, whereas slowly rotating stars like PSR J0740$+$6620 remain nearly spherical. Our predicted equatorial radii for PSR J0740$+$6620, $13.0\ \mathrm{km} &lt; R_e &lt; 13.5\ \mathrm{km}$, are consistent with NICER measurements. These findings constrain the EoS, requiring a self-consistent treatment of rotation, mass-dependent compression, and composition-driven modeling to accurately model protoneutron star evolution in the context of multi-messenger astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Solar Cycle Variation of Sustained Gamma-ray Emission Events from the Sun and Related Energetic Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sustained gamma ray emission (SGRE) from the Sun is one of the fascinating high energy phenomena closely related to the acceleration of protons to energies &gt;300 MeV. Here we report on the solar cycle variation of SGRE events based on observations from Fermi's Large Area Telescope (LAT). This report covers solar cycles (SCs) 24 and 25 during which Fermi has been operating. Since SGRE events are closely related to solar energetic particle (SEP) events and interplanetary type II radio bursts caused by fast and wide coronal mass ejections (CMEs), we consider these phenomena as well. Many studies have shown that SC 25 is similar or slightly stronger than SC 24. The number of SEP events, GLE events, IP type II bursts, and fast and wide CMEs confirm this conclusion. However, the number of SGRE events observed by Fermi LAT has diminished significantly in SC 25 relative to SC 24. One of the issues has been the reduced coverage of the Sun since 2018 due to a mechanical problem with a solar array of the Fermi mission. By identifying the Fermi LAT gaps and the number of energetic events (fast and wide CMEs, interplanetary type II bursts) we conclude that about three times more SGRE events must have occurred than the 15 events observed by Fermi.</description>

      <title>XRISM Resolves Relativistic Effects from the Innermost Accretion Disk in Serpens X-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first XRISM/Resolve observation of the persistently accreting neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binary Serpens X-1. The source was observed on October 17th, 2024, for approximately 350 ks of elapsed time, resulting in 171 ks of exposure. The source exhibited 22% variability with respect to the average count rate of 73.1 count/s during the observation, but remained in a spectrally soft state throughout. The time averaged spectrum was analyzed in conjunction with spectra extracted from periods of different count rate to check for variations in spectral components. The unprecedented energy resolution of 4.5 eV at 6 keV of XRISM/Resolve provides a detailed look at the shape and structure of the Fe emission line within the data, which shows a dual-peaked structure with an extended red-wing, and steep decline in the blue-wing of the line profile. Fits with the reflection model relxillNS are able to describe the structure in the Fe line region, and confirms previous results that the disk is close to the NS ($R_{\rm in}$ = $1.02_{-0.01}^{+0.21}\ R_{\rm ISCO}$). These models also measure a low systemic inclination ($i=5^{\circ}\pm1^{\circ}$), confirming prior X-ray and optical studies. Alternative models were explored to describe the structure of the Fe line profile, however, relativistic reflection provides the simplest and statistically best explanation of the data.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and Observational Signatures of Core-Collapse Supernovae with Central Engines: Hydrodynamics Simulations with Monte Carlo Post-Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13741v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long-lived central engine embedded in expanding supernova ejecta can alter the dynamics and observational signatures of the event, producing an unusually luminous, energetic, and/or rapidly-evolving transient. We use two-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations to study the effect of a central energy source, varying the amount, rate, and isotropy of the energy deposition. We post-process the results with a time-dependent Monte Carlo radiation transport code to extract observational signatures. The engine excavates a bubble at the centre of the ejecta, which becomes Rayleigh-Taylor unstable. Sufficiently powerful engines are able to break through the edge of the bubble and accelerate, shred, and compositionally mix the entire ejecta. The breakout of the engine-driven wind occurs at distinct rupture points, and the outflowing high-velocity gas may eventually give rise to radio emission. The dynamical impact of the engine leads to faster rising optical light curves, with photon escape facilitated by the faster expansion of the ejecta and the opening of low-density channels. For models with strong engines, the spectra are initially hot and featureless, but later evolve to resemble those of broad-line Ic supernovae. Under certain conditions, line emission from ionized, low-velocity material near the centre of the ejecta may be able to escape and produce narrow emission similar to that seen in interacting supernovae. We discuss how variability in the engine energy reservoir and injection rate could give rise to a heterogeneous set of events spanning multiple observational classes, including the fast blue optical transients, broad-line Ic supernovae, and superluminous supernovae.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Supernova Classification with Interpretable Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photometric classification of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is critical for cosmological studies but remains difficult due to class imbalance and observational noise. While deep learning models have been explored, they are often resource-intensive and lack interpretability. We present a computationally efficient and interpretable classification framework that maintains high performance on imbalanced datasets. We emphasize the use of PR-AUC and F1-score as more informative metrics than ROC-AUC in severely imbalanced settings. Using an XGBoost ensemble optimized via Bayesian hyperparameter tuning, we classified light curves from the Supernova Photometric Classification Challenge (SPCC), comprising 21,318 events with a 3.19 imbalance ratio (non-Ia to Ia). Our model achieved a PR-AUC of $0.993^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$, an F1-score of $0.923 \pm 0.008$, and a ROC-AUC of $0.976 \pm 0.004$, matching or exceeding deep learning performance on precision-recall trade-offs while using fewer resources. Despite slightly lower overall accuracy, our method balances false positives and false negatives, improving the efficiency of spectroscopic follow-up. We show that optimized ensemble models offer a reproducible and lightweight alternative to complex architectures, particularly for large-scale surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) where transparency and efficiency are essential.</description>

      <title>Polarization dynamics of X-ray synchrotron emission from a multi-zone blazar jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polarization of X-ray synchrotron emission in blazars offers a direct probe into the magnetic field geometry and particle acceleration processes operating in relativistic jets. We use particle-in-cell simulations of magnetic reconnection and magnetized turbulence, coupled to polarization-sensitive radiative transfer code, to interpret IXPE observations of Mrk 421 during a high flux state recorded in December of 2023. To evaluate the fitness of the theoretical scenarios, we rely on a quantitative comparison the statistical properties of simulated and observed X-ray flux and polarization light curves using five evaluation metrics, rather than attempting to fit individual data points. We propose a multi-zone model where jet emission is represented as the sum of the radiative output of many independent cells, each described by a simulation run viewed at different orientations. Comparison of ensembles of simulated Stokes-parameter light curves with IXPE data shows that magnetic reconnection dominated models provide the best match to the observed X-ray flux and polarization dynamics. The optimal configuration corresponds to N = 15 emitting cells, which reproduces the observed amplitudes and timescales of the X-ray flux and polarization variations. Magnetized turbulence models underpredict both the flux and polarization variability. Our results indicate that a multi-zone, reconnection-powered emission scenario can describe the X-ray polarization behavior of Mrk 421 and establish a quantitative framework for testing theoretical models against IXPE observations of other high-synchrotron-peaked blazars.</description>

      <title>Investigating double bump air showers with the SKA-Low</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double-bump showers are a rare class of extensive air showers (EAS) predicted by Monte Carlo simulations. They occur when a high-energy secondary particle, the leading particle, travels significantly farther than the rest, creating a distinct double-peaked longitudinal profile. So far, no experiment has been able to directly detect these showers. The unique radio footprint of double-bump showers, characterized by multiple Cherenkov rings, provides a way to reconstruct longitudinal profiles from radio observations. With its dense antenna array and broad frequency range, the Square Kilometer Array Observatory (SKAO) will be the first experiment capable of detecting these features, offering a new opportunity to probe hadronic interactions and constrain particle cross sections at high energies.
  In our analysis, we simulate the EAS using CORSIKA with the CoREAS plugin for radio. We developed a new method based on the Akaike information criterion to identify double bump showers in simulations by analyzing their longitudinal profiles. Then we investigate the prevalence of these double bump showers across different cosmic ray primary particles and various hadronic interaction models. We create a skeleton of the EAS which consists of all the particles with at least $1\%$ of the primary energy, allowing us to confirm the leading particle hypothesis and track shower development following these particles. This will enable us to relate the attributes of the leading particle to measurable parameters. Depending on the exact shower properties, the radio footprint of a double bump shower can create a complex interference pattern, consisting of multiple rings. From this information, the longitudinal profiles can be extracted. SKA due to its dense antenna array and frequency range will be the first experiment able to observe these double bump showers in detail.</description>

Abstract: While the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer proposals for next-generation, ground-based detectors promise vastly improved sensitivities to gravitational-wave signals, only joint observations are expected to enable the full scientific potential of these facilities, making timing and coordination between the efforts crucial to avoid missed opportunities. This study investigates the impact of long-term delays on the scientific capabilities of next-generation detector networks. We use the Fisher information formalism to simulate the performance of a set of detector networks for large, fiducial populations of binary black holes, binary neutron stars, and primordial black-hole binaries. Bootstrapping the simulated populations, we map the expected observation times required to reach a number of observations fulfilling scientific targets for key sensitivity and localization metrics across various network configurations. We also investigate the sensitivity to stochastic backgrounds. We find that purely sensitivity-driven metrics such as the signal-to-noise ratio are not strongly affected by delays between facilities. This is contrasted by the localization metrics, which are very sensitive to the number of detectors in the network and, by extension, to delayed observation campaigns for a detector. Effectively, delays in one detector behave like network-wide interruptions for the localization metrics for networks consisting of two next-generation facilities. We examine the impact of a supporting, current-generation detector such as LIGO India operating concurrently with next-generation facilities and find such an addition will greatly mitigate the negative effects of delays for localization metrics, with important consequences on multi-messenger science and stochastic searches.</description>

      <title>On the maximum compactness of neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stellar compactness, that is, the dimensionless ratio between the mass and radius of a compact star, $\mathcal{C} := M/R$, plays a fundamental role in characterising the gravitational and nuclear-physics aspects of neutron stars. Yet, because the compactness depends sensitively on the unknown equation of state (EOS) of nuclear matter, the simple question: ``how compact can a neutron star be?'' remains unanswered. To address this question, we adopt a statistical approach and consider a large number of parameterised EOSs that satisfy all known constraints from nuclear theory, perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), and astrophysical observations. Next, we conjecture that, for any given EOS, the maximum compactness is attained by the star with the maximum mass of the sequence of nonrotating configurations. While we can prove this conjecture for a rather large class of solutions, its general proof is still lacking. However, the evidence from all of the EOSs considered strongly indicates that it is true in general. Exploiting the conjecture, we can concentrate on the compactness of the maximum-mass stars and show that an upper limit appears for the maximum compactness and is given by $\mathcal{C}_{\rm max} = 1/3$. Importantly, this upper limit is essentially independent of the stellar mass and a direct consequence of perturbative-QCD constraints.</description>

      <title>New Spallation Background Rejection Techniques to Greatly Improve the Solar Neutrino Sensitivity of JUNO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the potential of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) to measure solar neutrinos is known, realizing this potential requires new techniques to reduce detector backgrounds. One of the most serious backgrounds is due to the beta decays of unstable nuclei produced through muon breakup (spallation) of nuclei. This background is much more significant in JUNO compared to Super-Kamiokande due to JUNO's shallower depth and its lack of directional information. We present the first detailed theoretical calculations of spallation backgrounds in JUNO, showing the underlying physical processes and new ways to cut backgrounds while preserving signals. A key point is showing the importance of neutron tagging to identify hadronic showers, which are rare but produce almost all of the dangerous isotopes. With our new techniques, JUNO will be able to reduce deadtime (signal loss) by a factor of five and to reduce the running time needed to meet sensitivity goals by a factor of two. This will give JUNO greatly improved sensitivity to $^8$B and $hep$ solar neutrinos, as we will explore in a separate paper.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter-Electron Interactions Alter the Luminosity and Spectral Index of M87</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that cosmic-ray electron cooling through dark matter-electron scatterings contributes to the low radiative efficiency observed in radio-loud galaxies such as M87. Light dark matter can scatter efficiently off electrons in M87, lowering the observed bolometric luminosity compared to astrophysical expectations. This consideration allows us to probe previously unexplored regions of the parameter space of dark matter-electron interactions. We further model the cosmic-ray electron distribution by numerically solving a diffusion equation along the jet and find that efficient dark matter-electron interactions can induce a flattening of the spectral index at different distances from the central supermassive black hole, in better alignment with radio observations from M87.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Based Pretraining and Domain Adaptation for Astronomical Time Series with Minimal Labeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astronomical time-series analysis faces a critical limitation: the scarcity of labeled observational data. We present a pre-training approach that leverages simulations, significantly reducing the need for labeled examples from real observations. Our models, trained on simulated data from multiple astronomical surveys (ZTF and LSST), learn generalizable representations that transfer effectively to downstream tasks. Using classifier-based architectures enhanced with contrastive and adversarial objectives, we create domain-agnostic models that demonstrate substantial performance improvements over baseline methods in classification, redshift estimation, and anomaly detection when fine-tuned with minimal real data. Remarkably, our models exhibit effective zero-shot transfer capabilities, achieving comparable performance on future telescope (LSST) simulations when trained solely on existing telescope (ZTF) data. Furthermore, they generalize to very different astronomical phenomena (namely variable stars from NASA's \textit{Kepler} telescope) despite being trained on transient events, demonstrating cross-domain capabilities. Our approach provides a practical solution for building general models when labeled data is scarce, but domain knowledge can be encoded in simulations.</description>

      <title>Toward First-Principles Multi-Messenger Predictions: Coupling Nuclear Networks with GR Radiation-MHD in {\tt Gmunu}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new implementation of nuclear reaction networks in the \texttt{G}eneral-relativistic \texttt{mu}ltigrid \texttt{nu}merical (\texttt{Gmunu}) code, a framework for general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics (GRRMHD). The extended code self-consistently evolves nuclear species coupled to hydrodynamics, magnetic fields, and neutrino radiation transport under the conformal flatness approximation to Einstein's equations. Four approximate nuclear networks are included, with stiff source terms integrated using implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta schemes. Validation is performed through benchmarks including conserved-to-primitive recovery with a tabulated stellar equation of state, one-zone silicon burning, and hydrodynamic tests of shock tubes, acoustic pulses, and detonation fronts of Type Ia supernovae. These tests confirm accurate coupling between nuclear reactions and fluid dynamics, conserving electron and nuclear mass fractions to machine precision.
  As an application, we conduct spherically symmetric core-collapse supernova simulations. The models reproduce the expected non-exploding behavior of standard progenitors, while enhanced neutrino heating revives the shock. Including nuclear burning modifies the post-shock composition and dynamics, converting silicon and oxygen layers into iron-group nuclei and strengthening the explosion. This demonstrates the impact of explosive burning on ejecta composition and shock evolution, and establishes the stability of the coupled GR radiation-MHD-nuclear framework. The implementation is fully compatible with multidimensional GRMHD simulations and represents the first GRRMHD code combining M1 neutrino transport with fully coupled nuclear burning.</description>

      <title>Global linear analysis of the magneto-thermal instability in a stratified spherical model of the intracluster medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The buoyancy stability properties of the ICM are modified because of the anisotropic transport of heat along the magnetic field lines. This feature gives rise to the MTI when the temperature gradient is aligned with the gravity, which occurs in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. Most previous linear analyses of the MTI adopted a local, Boussinesq approach. However, the conduction length, which sets the characteristic length scale of the MTI, might be a non-negligible fraction of the scale height in the ICM. We want to assess the impact of locality assumptions on the linear physics of the MTI. Another goal is to unveil the deeper connections between these global MTI modes and their MRI counterparts in accretion discs. Our third objective is to provide a new benchmark against which any numerical code implementing the Braginskii heat flux in spherical geometry can be tested. We perform a global linear analysis of the MTI in a spherical stratified model of the ICM. We use a combination of analytical results, corroborated by numerical results obtained with both a pseudo-spectral solver and IDEFIX, to better explain the physics of the global MTI modes. We obtain scaling laws and approximate expressions for the growth rates of the global modes. We show that the associated functions are confined within an inner region, limited by a turning point, where the mode is allowed to grow. The most unstable local MTI modes correspond to the portion of the global mode localised near the turning point. This phenomenology is similar to that of the global MRI modes. Finally, direct simulations successfully reproduce the global MTI modes and their growth rates, with errors smaller than 1%. Overall, this study provides us with new insights on the linear theory of the global MTI in the ICM, and a useful numerical test bench for any astrophysical fluid dynamics code embedding anisotropic heat flux.</description>

      <title>Orbital dynamics and precession in magnetized Kerr spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the orbital structure and precession dynamics of neutral test particles in the magnetized Kerr black hole (MKBH) spacetime-an exact electrovacuum solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations that self-consistently incorporates the curvature effects of an external magnetic field. This geometry allows a unified treatment of gravitational and magnetic influences across weak to ultra-strong regimes. The analysis reveals a critical magnetic field strength above which no circular geodesics, timelike or null, can exist, establishing an upper magnetic bound for orbital motion. For subcritical fields, the photon circular orbit admits two real roots, the outer of which defines an outermost stable circular orbit (OSCO), complementing the conventional innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and confining stable motion within a finite radial domain. Exact expressions for the orbital, radial, and vertical epicyclic frequencies, and their associated precession rates, show substantial deviations from Kerr behavior, including a magnetically induced reversal of periastron precession within a finite radial range. For astrophysically relevant magnetic field strengths, the retrograde precession could be observable at large radii around astrophysical BHs, offering a potential diagnostic of large-scale magnetization. These findings highlight the geometric influence of magnetic curvature on strong-field dynamics, providing a self-consistent framework to interpret quasi-periodic oscillation phenomenology and potential magnetic imprints in precision timing observations of compact objects.</description>

      <title>Mass and spin coevolution of black holes inspiralling through dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In extreme/intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (E/IMRIs) embedded in dark-matter (DM) spikes, the secondary black hole can accrete collisionless particles from the surrounding halo. We study how the companion's spin controls this process, and the ensuing back-reaction on the magnitude and direction of the companion's spin vector. We find that higher spin suppresses the mass accretion rate but enhances the accretion-induced torques, driving spin-down and secular alignment of the companion's spin with the orbital plane. Collisionless DM accretion generically imprints a near-universal mass-spin correlation characterized by a spin-evolution parameter $s \simeq 2.8$, much larger than is the case for typical astrophysical environments, and largely independent of the local DM density and the spike slope. The associated spin-down proceeds on astrophysically relevant timescales, thus observations of rapidly spinning IMRI companions would disfavor the presence of dense DM environments, providing constraints complementary to those arising from dynamical friction.</description>

      <title>The Supernova 1987A system and its recent evolution - a review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supernova 1987A was the closest supernova event to be observed in nearly 400 years. The outflowing ejecta from the explosion continues to interact with extended circumstellar material and with the equatorial ring (ER) in the triple ring system, while observations of the system have continued across the whole electromagnetic spectrum. This review mainly focuses on works published over the past ten years on Supernova 1987A and its remnant. These include (a) submillimetre, infrared and X-ray studies of molecules, ions and dust in the ejecta, and (b) infrared, optical and X-ray studies of dust and ionized gas in the ER and in the surrounding circumstellar medium, including their time evolution as the ER is shocked and eroded by the impact of high velocity ejecta. Since 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope has become available for high angular resolution infrared observations of Supernova 1987A and has made significant contributions to both (a) and (b) above. Its discovery of redshifted narrow-line emission from multiple ion species located at the centre of the ejecta strongly requires the presence there of either a cooling hot neutron star, or a pulsar wind nebula, to power the emission.</description>

      <title>The collision and merger products of stars do not look alike: A magnetohydrodynamics comparison</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A significant fraction of stars experience close interactions, including collisions resulting from gravitational encounters and mergers within close binary systems. These processes can produce more massive stars that may give rise to relatively rare objects such as blue stragglers. Distinguishing the outcomes of collisions and mergers is challenging yet essential for interpreting observations. This study utilizes the magnetohydrodynamics code AREPO to simulate collisions and mergers of $5$ to $10 \,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ main-sequence stars, systematically comparing the properties of the resulting products. Both collisions and mergers yield more massive, strongly magnetized, rapidly and differentially rotating stars with cores enriched in hydrogen, but notable quantitative differences emerge. Merger products exhibit core hydrogen fractions up to $10\%$ higher than those of collision products. In both scenarios, turbulent mixing amplifies magnetic field energies by $9$ to $12$ orders of magnitude. However, magnetic fields in small-impact-parameter collision products display small-scale reversals that may dissipate over time, whereas merger products and large-impact-parameter collision products develop large-scale ordered, potentially long-lived magnetic fields. Additionally, only merger products display magnetically driven, bipolar outflows with radial velocities exceeding $300$ to $400 \,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. These distinctions may result in divergent long-term evolutionary outcomes, which warrant further investigation in future studies.</description>

Abstract: Many X-ray binaries are transiently accreting. Having statistics on their recurrence times is helpful to address questions related to binary evolution and populations, as well as the physics of binary systems. We compile a catalog of known outbursts of 87 transient neutron star (identified through bursts or pulsations) low-mass X-ray binaries, until mid-2025. Most outbursts are taken from the literature, but we also identify some outbursts from public X-ray monitoring lightcurves. We find 109 outbursts not previously identified in the literature; most are from the frequent transients GRS 1747-312 and the Rapid Burster MXB 1730-335, though we suspect that two outbursts from Liller 1 may be from another transient, besides the Rapid Burster. We also find new outbursts for 10 other systems, and verify substantial quiescent intervals for XMM J174457-2850.3, XMMU J174716.1-281048, and AX J1754.2-2754. Outburst detection has been relatively efficient since 1996 for outbursts above $F_X$(2-10)$=3\times10^{-10}$ ergs/s/cm$^2$. While several systems have many known outbursts, 40 of the 87 systems we track have zero or one recorded outburst between 1996 and 2023. This suggests that many faint Galactic Center X-ray binaries may be neutron star X-ray binaries, though we cannot completely rule out the proposition that most neutron star X-ray binaries undergo frequent outbursts below all-sky monitor detection limits.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Quantification of Observability and Equation of State of Twin Stars</title>

Abstract: The possibility of discovering twin stars, two neutron stars (NSs) with the same mass but different radii, is usually studied in forward modelings by using a restricted number of NS matter equation of state (EOS) encapsulating a first-order phase transition from hadronic to quark matter (QM). Informing our likelihood function with the NS radius data from GW170817 and using a meta-model with 9-parameters capable of mimicking most NS EOSs available in the literature, we conduct a Bayesian quantification of the observability and underlying EOSs of twin stars. Of the accepted EOSs, between 12-18\% yield twin stars, depending on the restrictions we place on the second branch. The possibility of twin stars remains robust even under recent observational constraints. We show that many of these twin star scenarios are observable with currently available levels of accuracy in measuring NS radii. We also present the marginalized posterior probability density functions (PDFs) of every EOS parameter for each of four mass-radius correlation topologies. We find that the inferred EOS depends sensitively on not only whether twin stars are present, but also the category of twin stars, indicating that the observation of twin stars would provide a strong constraint on the underlying EOS. In particular, for two coexisting hybrid stars having QM cores at different densities, the PDF for QM speed of sound squared $c_{\rm qm}^2$ has two peaks, one below and another above the conformal limit $c_{\rm qm}^2=1/3$ predicted by perturbative QCD.</description>

Abstract: The Oblate Schwarzschild (OS) approximation is a method often used to compute the flux of X-rays emitted from a rapidly rotating neutron star. In this approximation, the oblate shape of the rotating star is embedded in the Schwarzschild metric, which is used to compute the redshift of photon energies as they propagate from the star to the telescope. In this paper, we demonstrate that there are small errors introduced by the standard treatment of photon redshift in the OS approximation and provide a simple method to correct these errors. These errors are constant in phase, so this results in a constant absolute reduction in the flux. For PSR J0740+6620, the most rapidly spinning of the pulsars observed by NICER, we estimate the flux errors are less than 1\%, which is an order of magnitude smaller than the uncertainty in the distance, so this does not affect the mass and radius constraints found for this pulsar. The errors for the other pulsars observed by NICER are even smaller. However, this correction should be included when analyzing data for more rapidly rotating X-ray pulsars with spin frequencies near 600 Hz.</description>

      <title>20 GeV halo-like excess of the Galactic diffuse emission and implications for dark matter annihilation</title>

Abstract: Fifteen years of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data in the halo region of the Milky Way (MW) are analyzed to search for gamma rays from dark matter annihilation. Gamma-ray maps within the region of interest ($|l| \le 60^\circ$, $10^\circ \le |b| \le 60^\circ$) are modeled using point sources, the GALPROP models of cosmic-ray interactions, isotropic background, and templates of Loop I and the Fermi bubbles, and then the presence of a halo-like component is further examined. A statistically significant halo-like excess is found with a spectral peak around 20 GeV, while its flux is consistent with zero below 2 GeV and above 200 GeV. Examination of the fit residual maps indicates that a spherically symmetric halo component fits the map data well. The radial profile agrees with annihilation by the smooth NFW density profile, and may be slightly shallower than this, especially in the central region. Various systematic uncertainties are investigated, but the 20 GeV peak remains significant. In particular, the halo excess with a similar spectrum is detected even relative to the LAT standard background model, which contains non-template patches adjusted to match the observed map. The halo excess spectrum can be fitted by annihilation with a particle mass $m_\chi \sim$ 0.5-0.8 TeV and cross section $\langle \sigma \upsilon \rangle \sim$ (5-8)$\times 10^{-25} \ \rm cm^3 \, s^{-1}$ for the $b\bar{b}$ channel. This cross section is larger than the upper limits from dwarf galaxies and the canonical thermal relic value, but considering various uncertainties, especially the density profile of the MW halo, the dark matter interpretation of the 20 GeV ``Fermi halo'' remains feasible. The prospects for verification through future observations are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Low-frequency spectra of neutron star + OB supergiant binaries: Does wind density drive persistent and flaring modes of accretion?</title>

Abstract: Neutron star high-mass X-ray binaries are well-studied in wavebands between the infrared and hard X-rays. Their low-frequency millimeter and radio properties, on the other hand, remain poorly understood. We present observations of the millimeter and radio emission of binaries where a neutron star accretes from an OB supergiant. We report ALMA and NOEMA millimeter observations of twelve systems, supplemented by VLA radio observations of six of those targets. Our targets include six Supergiant X-ray Binaries (SgXBs), four Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs), and two intermediate systems. Nine out of twelve targets, including all SFXTs, are detected in at least one millimeter band, while in the radio, only two targets are detected. All detected targets display inverted radio/millimeter spectra, with spectral indices in the range $\alpha =0.6-0.8$ for those systems where accurate SED fits could be performed. We conclude, firstly, that the low-frequency SEDs of neutron star SFXTs and SgXBs are dominated by free-free emission from the OB supergiant's stellar wind, and that jet emission is unlikely to be observed unless the systems can be detected at sub-GHz frequencies. Secondly, we find that SFXTs are fainter at 100 GHz than prototypical SgXBs, probably due to systematically less dense winds in the former, as supported further by the differences in their fluorescence Fe K$\alpha$ lines. We furthermore compare the stellar wind constraints obtained from our millimeter observations with those from IR/optical/UV studies and bow shock detections, and present evidence for long-term stellar wind variability visible in the thermal emission.</description>

      <title>MESA-QUEST: Tracing the formation of direct collapse black hole seeds via quasi-stars</title>

Abstract: The origin of the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) observed at redshifts $z\geq 9$ remains one of the most challenging open questions in astrophysics. Their rapid emergence suggests that massive ``heavy seeds'' must have formed early, possibly through the direct collapse of pristine gas clouds in the first galaxies. We present MESA-QUEST, a new framework built upon the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code, designed to model the structure and evolution of quasi-stars -- massive, radiation-supported envelopes hosting accreting black holes at their cores -- believed to be the progenitors of direct-collapse black hole (DCBH) seeds. Our implementation introduces flexible boundary conditions representing both Bondi accretion and saturated-convection regimes, and explores the impact of several stellar wind and mass-loss prescriptions, including Reimers, Dutch, and super-Eddington radiation-driven winds. We find that quasi-stars can grow central black holes to $\geq 10^3\,M_{\odot}$ under favorable conditions, with saturated-convection models yielding BH-to-total mass ratios up to 0.55$M_*$ -- five times higher than Bondi-limited cases. However, strong radiation-driven winds can dramatically curtail growth, potentially quenching heavy-seed formation unless balanced by sustained envelope accretion. Our results delineate the physical limits under which quasi-stars can remain stable and produce heavy seeds capable of evolving into the earliest SMBHs detected by JWST and Chandra. Future extensions will incorporate rotation, magnetic fields, and GR-radiation hydrodynamics to refine accretion physics and constrain the viability of the quasi-star pathway for early SMBH formation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave signatures of non-violent non-locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13714v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurement of gravitational waves can provide precision tests of the nature of black holes and compact objects. In this work, we test Giddings' non-violent non-locality proposal, which posits that quantum information is transferred via a nonlocal interaction that generates metric perturbations around black holes. In contrast to firewalls, these quantum fluctuations would be spread out over a larger distance range -- up to a Schwarzschild radius away. In this letter, we model the modification to the gravitational waveform from non-violent non-locality. We modify the nonspinning EOBNRv2 effective one body waveform to include metric perturbations that are due to a random Gaussian process. We find that the waveform exhibits random deviations which are particularly important in the late inspiral-plunge phase. We find an optimal dephasing parameter for detecting this effect with a principal component analysis. This is particularly intriguing because it predicts random phase deviations across different gravitational wave events, providing theoretical support for hierarchical tests of general relativity. We estimate the constraint on the perturbations in non-violent non-locality with events for the LIGO-Virgo network and for a third-generation network.</description>

      <title>Spin oscillations of neutrinos scattered by the supermassive black hole in the galactic center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the propagation and spin oscillations of neutrinos in their scattering by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) surrounded by a realistic accretion disk. We review various descriptions of the fermion spin evolution in a curved spacetime under the influence of external fields. The overview of the test particle motion in the gravitational field of a rotating SMBH is also present. The external fields which a neutrino spin interacts with are the electroweak forces in plasma and the toroidal magnetic field in the accretion disk surrounding SMBH. Spin precession of neutrinos, which are supposed to be Dirac particles, is caused by the interaction of the neutrino magnetic moment with the magnetic field in the disk. We use a semi-analytical model of a thick accretion disk and review its characteristics. The cases of co-rotating and counter-rotating disks with respect to BH are discussed. We consider the incoming flux of neutrinos having an arbitrary angle with respect to the BH spin since the recent results of the Event Horizon Telescope indicate that the BH spin in the galactic center is not always perpendicular to the galactic plane. For our study, we consider a large number of incoming test neutrinos. We briefly discuss our results and their applications in the observations of astrophysical neutrinos.</description>

      <title>False Alarm Rates in Detecting Gravitational Wave Lensing from Astrophysical Coincidences: Insights with Model-Independent Technique GLANCE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The strong lensing gravitational waves (GWs) due to intervening massive astrophysical systems between the source and an observer are an inevitable consequence of the general theory of relativity, which can produce multiple GW events in overlapping sky localization error. However, the confirmed detection of such a unique astrophysical phenomenon is challenging due to several sources of contamination, arising from detector noise to astrophysical uncertainties. Robust model-independent search techniques that can mitigate noise contamination were developed in the past. In this study, we explore the astrophysical uncertainty associated with incorrectly classifying a pair of unlensed GW events as a lensed event, and the associated False Alarm Rate (FAR) depending on the GW source properties. To understand the effect of unlensed astrophysical GW sources in producing false lensing detections, we have performed a model-independent test using the pipeline GLANCE on a simulated population of merging binary-black holes (BBHs). We find that $\sim$ 0.01\% of the event pairs can be falsely classified as lensed with a lensing threshold signal-to-noise ratio of 1.5, appearing at a time delay between the event pairs of $\sim$ 1000 days or more. We show the FAR distribution for the parameter space of GW source masses, delay time, and lensing magnification parameter over which the model-independent technique GLANCE can confidently detect lensed GW pair with the current LIGO detector sensitivity. In the future, this technique will be useful for understanding the FAR of the upcoming next-generation GW detectors, which can observe many more GW sources.</description>
