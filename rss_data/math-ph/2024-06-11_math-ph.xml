      <title>A tiling algorithm for the aperiodic monotile Tile(1,1)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An algorithm is provided to tile the plane with the aperiodic monotile Tile(1,1) recently discovered by Smith et al. (2023). Their geometric construction guidelines are expanded into a numerical MATLAB algorithm. The intention is to remove a possible obstacle for researchers interested in applications of this fundamental tiling of the plane.</description>

      <title>Topological Classification of Insulators: II. Quasi-Two-Dimensional Locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an alternative characterization of two-dimensional locality (necessary e.g. to define the Hall conductivity of a Fermi projection) using the spectral projections of the Laughlin flux operator. Using this abstract characterization, we define generalizations of this locality, which we term quasi-2D. We go on to calculate the path-connected components of spaces of unitaries or orthogonal projections which are quasi-2D-local and find a starkly different behavior compared with the actual 2D column of the Kitaev table, exhibiting e.g., in the unitary chiral case, infinitely many $\mathbb{Z}$-valued indices.</description>

      <title>A model for slowing particles in random media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple model in dimension $d\geq 2$ for slowing particles in random media, where point particles move in straight lines among and inside spherical identical obstacles with Poisson distributed centres. When crossing an obstacle, a particle is slowed down according to the law $\dot{V}= -\frac{\kappa}{\epsilon} S(|V|) V$, where $V$ is the velocity of the point particle, $\kappa$ is a positive constant, $\epsilon$ is the radius of the obstacle and $S(|V|)$ is a given slowing profile. With this choice, the slowing rate in the obstacles is such that the variation of speed at each crossing is of order $1$. We study the asymptotic limit of the particle system when $\epsilon$ vanishes and the mean free path of the point particles stays finite. We prove the convergence of the point particles density measure to the solution of a kinetic-like equation with a collision term which includes a contribution proportional to a $\delta$ function in $v=0$; this contribution guarantees the conservation of mass for the limit equation.</description>

      <title>Wick rotation in the lapse: admissible complex metrics and the associated heat kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Wick rotation in the lapse (not in time) is introduced that interpolates between Riemannian and Lorentzian metrics on real manifolds admitting a co-dimension one foliation. The definition refers to a fiducial foliation but covariance under foliation changing diffeomorphisms is ensured. In particular, the resulting complex metrics are admissible in the sense of Kontsevich-Segal in all (fiducial and non-fiducial) foliations. This setting is used to construct a Wick rotated heat semigroup, which remains well-defined into the near Lorentzian regime. Among the results established for the Wick rotated version are: (i) Existence as an analytic semigroup uniquely determined by its sectorial generator. (ii) Construction of an integral kernel that is jointly smooth in the semigroup time and both spacetime arguments. (iii) Existence of an asymptotic expansion for the kernel's diagonal in (shifted) powers of the semigroup time whose coefficients are the Seeley-deWitt coefficients evaluated on the complex metrics. (iv) Emergence of a Schr\"{o}dinger evolution group in the strict Lorentzian limit. The toolbox includes local regularity results for admissible complex metrics.</description>

      <title>The wave function of stabilizer states and the Wehrl conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on quantum systems represented by a Hilbert space $L^2(A)$, where $A$ is a locally compact Abelian group that contains a compact open subgroup. We examine two interconnected issues related to Weyl-Heisenberg operators. First, we provide a complete and elegant solution to the problem of describing the stabilizer states in terms of their wave functions, an issue that arises in quantum information theory. Subsequently, we demonstrate that the stabilizer states are precisely the minimizers of the Wehrl entropy functional, thereby resolving the analog of the Wehrl conjecture for any such group. Additionally, we construct a moduli space for the set of stabilizer states, that is, a parameterization of this set, that endows it with a natural algebraic structure, and we derive a formula for the number of stabilizer states when $A$ is finite. Notably, these results are novel even for finite Abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Cubes: Gibbs Measures and Decay of Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a hierarchical model of non-overlapping cubes of sidelengths $2^j$, $j \in \mathbb{Z}$. The model allows for cubes of arbitrarily small size and the activities need not be translationally invariant. It can also be recast as a spin system on a tree with long-range hard-core interaction. We prove necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of Gibbs measures, discuss fragmentation and condensation, and prove bounds on the decay of two-point correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of F-cohomological field theories and F-topological recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define F-topological recursion (F-TR) as a non-symmetric version of topological recursion, which associates a vector potential to some initial data. We describe the symmetries of the initial data for F-TR and show that, at the level of the vector potential, they include the F-Givental (non-linear) symmetries studied by Arsie, Buryak, Lorenzoni, and Rossi within the framework of F-manifolds. Additionally, we propose a spectral curve formulation of F-topological recursion. This allows us to extend the correspondence between semisimple cohomological field theories (CohFTs) and topological recursion, as established by Dunin-Barkowski, Orantin, Shadrin, and Spitz, to the F-world. In the absence of a full reconstruction theorem \`a la Teleman for F-CohFTs, this demonstrates that F-TR holds for the ancestor vector potential of a given F-CohFT if and only if it holds for some F-CohFT in its F-Givental orbit. We turn this into a useful statement by showing that the correlation functions of F-topological field theories (F-CohFTs of cohomological degree 0) are governed by F-TR. We apply these results to the extended 2-spin F-CohFT. Furthermore, we exhibit a large set of linear symmetries of F-CohFTs, which do not commute with the F-Givental action.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a system of $n \in \mathbb{N}: \, n \geq 2$ non-relativistic, spinless quantum particles moving on the real line and interacting via a two-body delta potential. The Hamiltonian of such a system is proved to be affiliated to the resolvent algebra of the case, $\mathcal{R}\left( \mathbb{R}^{2n},\sigma \right)$; it is further shown the existence of a $\text{C}^{\ast}-$dynamical system and of a subalgebra $\pi_S\left( \mathfrak{S}_0 \right)^{-1} \subset \mathcal{R}\left( \mathbb{R}^{2n},\sigma \right)$, stable under time evolution, where $\pi_S$ is the Schr{\"o}dinger representation of the algebra.</description>

      <title>Multiple SLEs for $\kappa\in (0,8)$: Coulomb gas integrals and pure partition functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we give an explicit relationship of SLE partition functions with Coulomb gas formalism of conformal field theory. We first construct a family of SLE${}_\kappa$ partition functions as Coulomb gas integrals and derive their various properties. In accordance with an interpretation as probabilistic correlations in loop $O(n)$ models, they are always positive when $\kappa\in (8/3,8)$, while they may have zeroes for $\kappa\leq 8/3$. They also admit a Fr\"{o}benius series expansion that matches with the algebraic content from CFT. Moreover, we check that at the first level of fusion, they have logarithmic asymptotic behavior when $\kappa=8/3$ and $\kappa=8$, in accordance with logarithmic minimal models $M(2,1)$ and $M(2,3)$, respectively.
  Second, we construct SLE${}_\kappa$ pure partition functions and show that they are continuous in $\kappa\in (0,8)$ and they decay to zero as a polynomial of $(8-\kappa)$ when $\kappa\to 8$. We explicitly relate the Coulomb gas integrals and pure partition functions together in terms of the meander matrix. As a by-product, our results yield a construction of global non-simple multiple chordal SLE${}_\kappa$ measures ($\kappa \in (4,8)$) uniquely determined by their re-sampling property.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a Lie algebroid pair $A\hookrightarrow L$ we study cocycles constructed from the extension to $L$ of the higher connection forms of a representation up to homotopy $E$ of the Lie algebroid $A$. We show that there exists a cohomology class with values in the endomorphism bundle of $E$ that is independent of the extension above and vanishes whenever a homotopy $A$-compatible extension exists. Whenever the representation up to homotopy $E$ is the resolution of a Lie algebroid representation $K$ of $A$, it is shown that there exists a quasi-isomorphism sending the new Atiyah class to the classical one, associated to extensions to $L$ of the Lie algebroid representation $K$.</description>

Abstract: We study real resonances and embedded eigenvalues of the Kramers--Fokker--Planck operator with a long-range potential. We prove that thresholds are only possible accumulation points of eigenvalues and that the limiting absorption principle holds true for energies outside an exceptional set. We also prove that the eigenfunctions associated with discrete eigenvalues decay exponentially and those associated with embedded non-threshold ones decay polynomially.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical beam propagation in random media is characterized by familiar speckle patterns generated by intricate interference effects. Such patterns may be modified and possibly attenuated for partially coherent incident beam profiles. In the weak-coupling regime of the It\^o-Schr\"odinger paraxial model of wave propagation, we show how the spatio-temporal statistics of the partially coherent beams interact with the statistics of the random medium to enhance or suppress scintillation effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the singular Rayleigh-Jeans equilibrium of the $4$-waves kinetic turbulence equation for the three dimensional Schr\"{o}dinger equation. We first show the formation in finite time of a Dirac measure at zero frequency in the solution of the wave kinetic equation when the initial data has the form of Rayleigh-Jeans, truncated at large values of the energy. The initial value problem for the linearization around the singular Rayleigh-Jeans equilibria is then solved in several functional spaces. Then, long time convergence to a Dirac measure at the origin is described in detail for some of the solutions. This determines a basin of attraction of the Dirac measure.</description>

      <title>Boundary-field formulation for transient electromagnetic scattering by dielectric scatterers and coated conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the transient scattered and transmitted fields generated when an incident electromagnetic wave impinges on a dielectric scatterer or a coated conductor embedded in an infinite space. By applying a boundary-field equation method, we reformulate the problem in the Laplace domain using the electric field equation inside the scatterer and a system of boundary integral equations for the scattered electric field in free space. To analyze this nonlocal boundary problem, we replace it by an equivalent boundary value problem. Existence, uniqueness and stability of the weak solution to the equivalent BVP are established in appropriate function spaces in terms of the Laplace transformed variable. The stability bounds are translated into time-domain estimates which determine the regularity of the solution in terms of the regularity of the problem data. These estimates can be easily converted into error estimates for a numerical discretization on the convolution quadrature for time evolution.</description>

      <title>Exact quantization of topological order parameter in SU($N$) spin models, $N$-ality transformation and ingappabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the ground-state expectation value of twisting operator is a topological order parameter for $\text{U}(1)$- and $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$-symmetric symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in one-dimensional ``spin'' systems -- it is quantized in the thermodynamic limit and can be used to identify different SPT phases and to diagnose phase transitions among them. We prove that this (non-local) order parameter must take values in $N$-th roots of unity, and its value can be changed by a generalized lattice translation acting as an $N$-ality transformation connecting distinct phases. This result also implies the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis ingappability for SU($N$) spins if we further impose a general translation symmetry. Furthermore, our exact result for the order parameter of SPT phases can predict a large number of LSM ingappabilities by the general lattice translation. We also apply the $N$-ality property to provide an efficient way to construct possible multi-critical phase transitions starting from a single Hamiltonian with a unique gapped ground state.</description>

      <title>Deformation localisation in stretched liquid crystal elastomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05476v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model within the framework of finite elasticity two inherent instabilities observed in liquid crystal elastomers under uniaxial tension. First is necking which occurs when a material sample suddenly elongates more in a small region where it appears narrower than the rest of the sample. Second is shear striping, which forms when the in-plane director rotates gradually to realign and become parallel with the applied force. These phenomena are due to the liquid crystal molecules rotating freely under mechanical loading. To capture necking, we assume that the uniaxial order parameter increases with tensile stretch, as reported experimentally during polydomain-monodomain transition. To account for shear striping, we maintain the uniaxial order parameter fixed, as suggested by experiments. Our finite element simulations capture well these phenomena. As necking in liquid crystal elastomers has not been satisfactorily modelled before, our theoretical and numerical findings related to this effect can be of wide interest. Shear striping has been well studied, yet our computed examples also show how optimal stripe width increases with the nematic penetration depth measuring the competition between the Frank elasticity of liquid crystals and polymer elasticity. Although known theoretically, this result has not been confirmed numerically by previous nonlinear elastic models.</description>

      <title>Holding the fields constant: A shape-calculus approach to electromagnetic forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the mathematical theory of shape calculus as tool, we perform a rigorous investigation of the virtual work principle for the computation of electromagnetic forces in static settings. The main goal is to shed light on the widely held belief that the virtual work principle entails passively advecting the fields with the virtual displacement when computing deformation-dependent field energies gradients.
  The adjoint approach to differentiation of functionals under variational constraints provides a mathematical justification for this belief. However, it also shows that passively advecting the actual electromagnetic fields is sufficient only in the case of linear materials.

      <title>Impact of the internal modes on the sphaleron decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the sphaleron solutions in two deformations of the $\phi^6$ model and analyze the oscillons originated from them. We find that the presence of internal modes plays a crucial role in the sphaleron collapse. The positive internal modes triggered by a squeezing of the sphaleron are able to change the direction of collapse. We provide an analytical understanding behind this phenomenon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05762v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider 3D Klein-Gordon-Zakharov (KGZ) and Dirac-Klein-Gordon (DKG) systems, where a common feature is that there exist both massless and massive fields in each system. We establish global existence and asymptotic behavior for both systems with a class of large data. More precisely, in the KGZ system, we allow the massless field to be large, while in the DKG system we allow the massive field to be large.</description>

      <title>Replica symmetry breaking in spin glasses in the replica-free Keldysh formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At asymptotically late times ultrametricity can emerge from the persistent slow aging dynamics of the glass phase. We show that this suffices to recover the breaking of replica symmetry in mean-field spin glasses from the late time limit of the time evolution using the Keldysh path integral. This provides an alternative approach to replica symmetry breaking by connecting it rigorously to the dynamic formulation. Stationary spin glasses are thereby understood to spontaneously break thermal symmetry, or the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger relation of a state in global thermal equilibrium. We demonstrate our general statements for the spherical quantum $p$-spin model and the quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model in the presence of transverse and longitudinal fields. In doing so, we also derive their dynamical Ginzburg-Landau effective Keldysh actions starting from microscopic quantum models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare the bottom of the spectrum of discrete and continuous Schr\"odinger operators with periodic potentials with barriers at the boundaries of their fundamental domains. Our results show that these energy levels coincide in the semiclassical limit and we provide an explicit rate of convergence. We demonstrate the optimality of our results by using Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization conditions for potentials exhibiting non-degenerate wells, and by numerical experiments for more general potentials. We also investigate the dependence of the spectrum of the discrete semiclassical Schr\"odinger operator on the semiclassical parameter $h$ and show that it can be discontinuous.</description>

Abstract: We introduce operator-valued twisted Araki-Woods algebras. These are operator-valued versions of a class of second quantization algebras that includes $q$-Gaussian and $q$-Araki-Woods algebras and also generalize Shlyakhtenko's von Neumann algebras generated by operator-valued semicircular variables. We develop a disintegration theory that reduces the isomorphism type of operator-valued twisted Araki-Woods algebras over type I factors to the scalar-valued case. Moreover, these algebras come with a natural weight, and we characterize its modular theory. We also give sufficient criteria that guarantee that factoriality of these algebras.</description>

      <title>On antiferromagnetic regimes in the Ashkin-Teller model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ashkin-Teller model can be represented by a pair of Ising spin configurations with coupling constants $J$ and $J'$ for each, and $U$ for their product. We study this representation on the square lattice and confirm the presence of a mixed antiferromagnetic phase in the isotropic case ($J=J'$) when $-U&gt;0$ is sufficiently large and $J=J'&gt;0$ is sufficiently small, by means of a graphical representation. We then construct a coupling with the eight-vertex model and show that, in analogy to the first result, the corresponding height function is localised, although with antiferromagnetically ordered heights on one class of the graph.
  Using the OSSS inequality, we proceed to establish a subcritical sharpness statement along suitable curves in the anisotropic ($J\neq J'$) phase diagram when $U&lt;0$, circumventing the difficulty of the lack of general monotonicity properties in the parameters. We then address the isotropic case and provide indications of monotonicity.</description>

      <title>Fourier series for the three-dimensional random flight</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11121v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The probability density function of the random flight with isotropic initial conditions is obtained by an expansion in the number of collisions and the in the spatial harmonics of the solution, as in a Fourier series. The method holds for any dimension and is worked out in detail for the three dimensional case. In this case the probability density functions conditional to 1 and 2 collisions are also found using a different method, which yields them in terms of elementary functions and the polylogarithm function Li$_2$. The latter method is exact in the sense that one does not have to truncate a series, as in the first method. This provides a reference to decide where to truncate the series. A link is provided to a web page where the reader may download the series truncated at 132 collisions; for times larger than 100 times the average inter-collision time, the Gaussian approximations is used. The case in which the initial condition is a particle moving along a fixed direction is briefly considered.</description>

      <title>Elastic solids with strain-gradient elastic boundary surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13744v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works have shown that in contrast to classical linear elastic fracture mechanics, endowing crack fronts in a brittle Green-elastic solid with Steigmann-Ogden surface elasticity yields a model that predicts bounded stresses and strains at the crack tips for plane-strain problems. However, singularities persist for anti-plane shear (mode-III fracture) under far-field loading, even when Steigmann-Ogden surface elasticity is incorporated.
  This work is motivated by obtaining a model of brittle fracture capable of predicting bounded stresses and strains for all modes of loading. We formulate an exact general theory of a three-dimensional solid containing a boundary surface with strain-gradient surface elasticity. For planar reference surfaces parameterized by flat coordinates, the form of surface elasticity reduces to that introduced by Hilgers and Pipkin, and when the surface energy is independent of the surface covariant derivative of the stretching, the theory reduces to that of Steigmann and Ogden. We discuss material symmetry using Murdoch and Cohen's extension of Noll's theory. We present a model small-strain surface energy that incorporates resistance to geodesic distortion, satisfies strong ellipticity, and requires the same material constants found in the Steigmann-Ogden theory.
  Finally, we derive and apply the linearized theory to mode-III fracture in an infinite plate under far-field loading. We prove that there always exists a unique classical solution to the governing integro-differential equation, and in contrast to using Steigmann-Ogden surface elasticity, our model is consistent with the linearization assumption in predicting finite stresses and strains at the crack tips.</description>

Abstract: In this series of papers we aim to provide a mathematically comprehensive framework to the Hamiltonian pictures of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes. Our final goal is to study the kinematics and the dynamics of the theory from the point of differential geometry in infinite dimensions.In this first part we introduce the tools of Gaussian analysis in infinite dimensional spaces of distributions. These spaces will serve the basis to understand the Schr\"odinger and Holomorphic pictures, over arbitrary Cauchy hypersurfaces, using tools of Hida-Malliavin calculus. Here the Wiener-Ito decomposition theorem provides the QFT particle interpretation. Special emphasis is done in the applications to quantization of these tools in the second part of this paper. We devote a section to introduce Hida test functions as a notion of second quantized test functions. We also analyze of the ingredients of classical field theory modeled as distributions paving the way for quantization procedures that will be analyzed in the second part of this series.</description>

      <title>Pointwise bounds on eigenstates in non-relativistic QED</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper, Kato's distributional inequality with magnetic field is generalized to vector-valued functions and operator-valued vector potentials. This result is then used in non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics (QED) to show that eigenstates of the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian satisfy a subsolution estimate, and hence that any $L^2$-exponential bound in terms of a Lipschitz function implies the corresponding pointwise exponential bound. Similar pointwise bounds are also established for the one-particle density of states that are not eigenstates.</description>

Abstract: In this series of papers we aim to provide a mathematically comprehensive framework to the Hamiltonian pictures of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes. Our final goal is to study the kinematics and the dynamics of the theory from the point of differential geometry in infinite dimensions. In this second part we use the tools of Gaussian analysis in infinite dimensional spaces introduced in the first part to describe rigorously the procedures of geometric quantization in the space of Cauchy data of a scalar theory. This leads us to discuss and establish relations between different pictures of QFT. We also apply these tools to describe the geometrization of the space of pure states of quantum field theory as a Kh\"aler manifold. We use this to derive an evolution equation that preserves the geometric structure and avoids norm losses in the evolution. This leads us to a modification of the Schr\"odinger equation via a quantum connection that we discuss and exemplify in a simple case.</description>

      <title>Efficient semiclassical approximation for bound states in graphene in magnetic field with a small trigonal warping correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the construction of semiclassical spectrum and efficient (simple to implement) explicit semiclassical asymptotic eigenfunctions of the Dirac operator for relatively high-energy bound states in graphene in magnetic field, considering the effect of trigonal warping [11, 16] to be small. It turns out that the asymptotic spectrum of the operator remains unchanged under such a perturbation due to the symmetry of the problem rather than the smallness of this correction. However, the behavior of asymptotic eigenfunctions is quite different; they are significantly affected by trigonal warping that leads to the breaking of certain symmetries. Density plots of asymptotic eigenfunctions can indicate what might be observed using a scanning tunneling microscope. Our approach to constructing asymptotic solutions is based on developments of works [9, 1, 5], which present a new method for constructing the solution, simplifying practical application.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove upper and lower bounds for the number of eigenvalues of semi-bounded Schr\"odinger operators in all spatial dimensions. As a corollary, we obtain two-sided estimates for the sum of the negative eigenvalues of atomic Hamiltonians with Kato potentials. Instead of being in terms of the potential itself, as in the usual Lieb-Thirring result, the bounds are in terms of the landscape function, also known as the torsion function, which is a solution of $(-\Delta + V +M)u_M =1$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$; here $M\in\mathbb{R}$ is chosen so that the operator is positive. We further prove that the infimum of $(u_M^{-1} - M)$ is a lower bound for the ground state energy $E_0$ and derive a simple iteration scheme converging to $E_0$.</description>

We write equations of these curves as determinants of tridiagonal matrices and deduce some consequences regarding the geometric structure of the Gaudin coverings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2004.10730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the construction of Lagrangians for higher spin fields of mixed symmetry in the framework of graded geometry. The main advantage of the graded formalism in this context is that it provides universal expressions, in the sense that a given Lagrangian describes the dynamics of any type of bosonic tensor field even though the corresponding explicit expressions in terms of local field components and their derivatives look rather different. Aside from free fields and their kinetic terms, we also consider higher derivative interaction terms that lead to second order field equations. For scalars, differential forms and bipartite tensors, these are identified with Galileon theories, written in a simple yet elegant form as a generalised kinetic term, and are gauge invariant by construction. For fields of spin higher than 2, we illustrate the candidate Galileon-like interactions and argue that full gauge invariance and locality cannot be simultaneously maintained.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.00872v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perelomov coherent states for equally spaced, infinite homogeneous waveguide arrays with Euclidean E(2) symmetry are defined, and a new resolution of the identity is obtained. The key point to construct this novel resolution of the identity is the fact that coherent states satisfy the Helmholtz equation (in coherent states labels), and thus every coherent state belongs to a one-parameter family uniquely determined by the Cauchy initial data of the coherent state in a one-dimensional Cauchy set. For this reason we call \textit{Cauchy coherent} states to these initial data. The novel, non-local resolution of the identity in terms of Cauchy coherent states is provided using frame theory. It is also shown that Perelomov coherent states for the Eucliean E(2) group have a simple and natural physical realization in these waveguide arrays.</description>

      <title>When quantum memory is useful for dense coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss dense coding with $n$ copies of a specific preshared state between the sender and the receiver when the encoding operation is limited to the application of group representation. Typically, to act on multiple local copies of these preshared states, the receiver needs quantum memory, because in general the multiple copies will be generated sequentially. Depending on available encoding unitary operations, we investigate what preshared state offers an advantage of using quantum memory on the receiver's side.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the nonholonomic motion of a point particle on the Heisenberg group around the fixed "sun" whose potential is given by the fundamental solution of the sub-Laplacian. Unlike arXiv:1212.2713 where the variational problem is studied we consider the equations of nonholonomic dynamics which are not Hamiltonian. We find three independent first integrals of the system and show that its bounded trajectories of the system are wound up around certain surfaces of the fourth order.</description>

      <title>Sum-of-Squares &amp; Gaussian Processes I: Certification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new SoS hierarchy for a broad class of average-case problems. The new high-entropy steps (HES) SoS hierarchy certifies properties of input instances only over a certain family of well behaved distributions of possible solutions. This allows the hierarchy to circumvent the oft-cited impossibility of providing a low-degree SoS proof of concentration of measure \cite[Lec.~1.2, Marley Paradigm]{barak2016proofs} by vastly reducing the set of solution concepts they need to be proven over.
  We evaluate the HES SoS hierarchy on a well-studied Gaussian process: the spherical spin-glass, which is a particular ensemble of random low-degree polynomials (LDPs). We prove that, given an instance sampled from the problem distribution, with high probability there exists a HES distribution that achieves value arbitrarily close to the conjectured optimal algorithmic threshold and, at the same time, there are low-degree SoS certificates that no HES distribution can achieve value above a constant factor times this threshold, improving over standard SoS whose certificates are loose by a factor of $n^{\lfloor p/2 - 1\rfloor/2}$ for a degree-$p$ random polynomial \cite{bhattiprolu2017sum, hopkins2017power}. We also give examples of anisotropic modifications to the spherical spin glass problem where there is proof (or strong evidence) that the HES SoS hierarchy does better than the only other known algorithm \cite{subag2021following}. We conjecture that the HES SoS hierarchy can be applied to any LDP approximate Gaussian process to obtain value that is optimal among polynomial-time algorithms.
  The rounding algorithm is introduced and analyzed in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Reversibility and A New Theory of Causal Emergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of causal emergence based on effective information(EI) suggests that complex systems may exhibit a phenomenon called causal emergence(CE), where the macro-dynamics demonstrate a stronger causal effect than the micro-dynamics. However, a challenge in this theory is the dependence on the method used to coarse-grain the system. In this paper, we introduce a fresh concept of approximate dynamical reversibility and establish a novel framework for CE based on this and singular value decomposition. Our research not only reveals a strong correlation between the proximity of a Markov chain being dynamically reversible and EI in assessing causal effects across various scenarios but also demonstrates that EI is constrained by the logarithm of the approximate dynamical reversibility. Leveraging this concept, we present an innovative approach to quantifying CE that is agnostic to specific coarse-graining techniques and effectively captures the inherent characteristics of Markov dynamics. Through empirical evaluations on examples of boolean networks, cellular automata, and complex networks, we validate our refined CE definition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the well-posedness of transmission problems on classes of two-sided Sobolev extension domains to give variational definitions for (boundary) layer potential operators and Neumann-Poincar{\'e} operators. These classes of domains contain Lipschitz domains, and also domains with fractal boundaries. Although our variational formulation does not involve any measures on the boundary, we recover the classical results in smooth domains by considering the surface measure on the boundary. We discuss properties of these operators and generalize basic results in imaging beyond the Lipschitz case.</description>

Abstract: We examine relativistic diffusion through the frame and observer bundles associated with a Lorentzian manifold $(M,g)$. Our focus is on spacetimes with a non-trivial isometry group, and we detail the conditions required to find symmetric solutions of the relativistic diffusion equation. Additionally, we analyze the conservation laws associated with the presence of Killing vector fields on $(M,g)$ and their implications for the expressions of the geodesic spray and the vertical Laplacian on both the frame and the observer bundles. Finally, we present several relevant examples of symmetric spacetimes.</description>

      <title>The Magic Number Conjecture for the $m=2$ amplituhedron and Parke-Taylor identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The amplituhedron $A_{n,k,m}$ is a geometric object introduced in the context of scattering amplitudes in $N=4$ super Yang Mills. It generalizes the positive Grassmannian (when $n=k+m$), cyclic polytopes (when $k=1$), and the bounded complex of the cyclic hyperplane arrangement (when $m=1$). Of substantial interest are the tilings of the amplituhedron, which are analogous to triangulations of a polytope. Karp, Williams and Zhang (2020) observed that the known tilings of $A_{n,k,2}$ have cardinality ${n-2 \choose k}$ and the known tilings of $A_{n,k,4}$ have cardinality the Narayana number $\frac{1}{n-3}{n-3 \choose k+1}{n-3 \choose k}$; generalizing these observations, they conjectured that for even $m$ the tilings of $A_{n, k,m}$ have cardinality the MacMahon number, the number of plane partitions which fit inside a $k \times (n-k-m) \times \frac{m}{2}$ box. We refer to this prediction as the `Magic Number Conjecture'. In this paper we prove the Magic Number Conjecture for the $m=2$ amplituhedron: that is, we show that each tiling of $A_{n,k,2}$ has cardinality ${n-2 \choose k}$. We prove this by showing that all positroid tilings of the hypersimplex $\Delta_{k+1,n}$ have cardinality ${n-2 \choose k}$, then applying T-duality. In addition, we give combinatorial necessary conditions for tiles to form a tiling of $A_{n,k,2}$; we give volume formulas for Parke-Taylor polytopes and certain positroid polytopes in terms of circular extensions of cyclic partial orders; and we prove new variants of the classical Parke-Taylor identities.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh nonequilibrium quantum field theory of open quantum systems beyond the Markovian regime: Application to the spin-boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT) for open quantum systems interacting with a dissipative environment and apply it to the spin-boson model as an archetypical example where the environment is composed of a bosonic bath. Prior SKFT developments of this type have been confined to the Markovian regime, as an alternative to a conventional description by the Lindblad quantum master equation (QME) which is a time-local matrix differential equation. Here we combine SKFT with a two-particle irreducible (2PI) action that resums a class of Feynman diagrams to infinite order. We obtain the time-evolution of the spin density matrix in the form of a system of integro-differential equations applicable to both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. The latter regime--where taking into account memory effects becomes essential--poses a challenge for standard methods when trying to incorporate arbitrary properties of the system, bath, and length of time evolution. The SKFT+2PI-computed time evolution of the spin expectation values in the Markovian regime reproduces the solution of the Lindblad QME, as long as the system-bath coupling in the latter is adjusted by increasing it. In the non-Markovian regime, SKFT+2PI yields a nonperturbative solution that mimics results from both hierarchical equations of motion and tensor networks methods that we employ as benchmarks. Our SKFT+2PI approach can also access challenging cases, such as zero-temperature and sub-Ohmic bath, as well as arbitrary long evolution times. Taking into account favorable numerical cost of solving the integro-differential equations with increasing number of spins, time steps or dimensionality the SKFT+2PI approach offers a promising route for simulation of driven-dissipative systems in quantum computing or quantum magnonics and spintronics in the presence of a variety of (single or multiple) dissipative environments.</description>

      <title>Constructing vortex functions and basis states of Chern insulators: ideal condition, inequality from index theorem, and coherent-like states on von Neumann lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of fractional Chern insulators, a great deal of effort has been devoted to characterizing Chern bands that exhibit properties similar to the Landau levels. Among them, the concept of the vortex function, which generalizes the complex coordinate used for the symmetric-gauge Landau-level basis, allows for a concise description. In this paper, we develop a theory of constructing the vortex function and basis states of Chern insulators in the tight-binding formalism. In the first half, we consider the optimization process of the vortex function, which minimizes an indicator that measures the difference from the ideal Chern insulators. In particular, we focus on the sublattice position dependence of the vortex function or the quantum geometric tensor. This degree of freedom serves as a discrete analog of the non-uniformity in the spatial metric and magnetic field in a continuous model. In the second half, we construct two types of basis sets for a given vortex function: radially localized basis set and coherent-like basis set. The former basis set is defined as the eigenstates of an analogy of the angular momentum operator. Remarkably, one can always find exact zero mode(s) for this operator, which is explained by the celebrated Atiyah-Singer index theorem. As a byproduct, we propose an inequality rooted in the band topology. We also discuss the subtle differences between our formalism and the previous works about the momentum-space Landau level. The latter basis set generalizes the concept of coherent states on von Neumann lattice. While this basis set is not orthogonal, it is useful to compare the LLL and the given Chern insulator directly in the Brillouin zone. These basis sets are expected to be useful for many-body calculations of fractional Chern insulators.</description>

      <title>Wigner's Theorem for stabilizer states and quantum designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the symmetry group of the stabilizer polytope for any number $n$ of systems and any prime local dimension $d$. In the qubit case, the symmetry group coincides with the linear and anti-linear Clifford operations. In the case of qudits, the structure is somewhat richer: for $n=1$, it is a wreath product of permutations of bases and permutations of the elements within each basis. For $n&gt;1$, the symmetries are given by affine symplectic similitudes. These are the affine maps that preserve the symplectic form of the underlying discrete phase space up to a non-zero multiplier. We phrase these results with respect to a number of a priori different notions of "symmetry'', including Kadison symmetries (bijections that are compatible with convex combinations), Wigner symmetries (bijections that preserve inner products), and symmetries realized by an action on Hilbert space. Going beyond stabilizer states, we extend an observation of Heinrich and Gross (Ref. [25]) and show that the symmetries of fairly general sets of Hermitian operators are constrained by certain moments. In particular: the symmetries of a set that behaves like a 3-design preserve Jordan products and are therefore realized by conjugation with unitaries or anti-unitaries. (The structure constants of the Jordan algebra are encoded in an order-three tensor, which we connect to the third moments of a design). This generalizes Kadison's formulation of the classic Wigner Theorem on quantum mechanical symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the algebraic structure of the mesonic moduli spaces of bipartite field theories by computing the Hilbert series. Bipartite field theories form a large family of 4d N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories that are defined by bipartite graphs on Riemann surfaces with boundaries. By calculating the Hilbert series, we are able to identify the generators and defining generator relations of the mesonic moduli spaces of these theories. Moreover, we show that certain bipartite field theories exhibit enhanced global symmetries which can be identified through the computation of the corresponding refined Hilbert series. As part of our study, we introduce two one-parameter families of bipartite field theories defined on cylinders whose mesonic moduli spaces are all complete intersection toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds.</description>

      <title>A T-Duality of Non-Supersymmetric Heterotic Strings and an implication for Topological Modular Forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent developments connecting non-supersymmetric heterotic string theory to the theory of Topological Modular Forms (TMF), we show that the worldsheet theory with central charge $(17,\frac{3}{2})$ obtained by fibering the $(E_8)_1 \times (E_8)_1$ current algebra over the $\mathcal{N}=(0,1)$ sigma model on $S^{1}$ with antiperiodic spin structure (such that the two $E_8$ factors are exchanged as we go around the circle), is continuously connected to the $(E_8)_2$ theory in the Gaiotto$-$Johnson-Freyd$-$Witten sense of going "up and down the RG trajectories". Combined with the work of Tachikawa and Yamashita, this furnishes a physical derivation of the fact that the $(E_8)_2$ theory corresponds to the unique nontrivial torsion element $[(E_8)_2]$ of $\mathsf{TMF}^{31}$ with zero mod-2 elliptic genus.</description>

      <title>Steady supersonic combustion flows with a contact discontinuity in two-dimensional finitely long nozzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the two-dimensional steady supersonic combustion flows with a contact discontinuity moving through a nozzle of finite length. Mathematically, it can be formulated as a free boundary value problem governed by the two -dimensional steady combustion Euler equations with a contact discontinuity as the free boundary. The main mathematical difficulties are that the contact discontinuity is a characteristic free boundary and the equations for all states are coupled with each other due to the combustion process. We first employ the Lagrangian coordinate transformation to fix the free boundary. Then by introducing the flow slope and Bernoulli function, we further reduce the fixed boundary value problem into an initial boundary value problem for a first order hyperbolic system coupled with several ordinary differential equations. A new iteration scheme is developed near the background states by employing the intrinsic structure of the equation for the mass fraction of the non-combustion gas. We show that there is a fixed point for the iteration by deriving some novel $C^{1,\alpha}$-estimates of the solutions and applying the fixed point theorem, and then the uniqueness of the fixed point is proved by a contraction argument. On the other hand, a quasi-one-dimensional approximate system is often used to simplify the two-dimensional steady supersonic combustion model. The error between these two systems is estimated. Finally, given a piece-wise $C^{1,\alpha}$-solution containing a contact discontinuity with piece-wise constant states on the entrance of the nozzle, we can show that the solution is the piece-wise constant states with a straight contact discontinuity.</description>
