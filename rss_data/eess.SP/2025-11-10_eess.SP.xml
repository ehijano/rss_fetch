      <title>OPF-Based Optimal Power System Network Restoration Considering Frequency Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to recent blackout and system split incidents in power grids worldwide, as well as increased system complexity in view of the energy transition, there has been increasing interest in re-evaluating existing Power System Restoration (PSR) plans. In restoration scenarios, due to low island inertia, it is necessary to ensure not only the static, but also the dynamic stability of the system. In this paper, we pose and solve a formulation of the optimal PSR problem including frequency dynamics. We validate the switching constraints for global optimality within a static version of the formulation using a brute-force tree search method. We apply the dynamic problem formulation to the IEEE 9-Bus model, and show that the optimal switching sequence using the static formulation would violate dynamic constraints, illustrating the importance of dynamic considerations in PSR planning.</description>

      <title>Joint Power Allocation and Radiation Optimization in NOMA-Assisted Pinching Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores a joint optimization of transmit power allocation and radiation coefficients in a downlink Pinching Antenna SyStem (PASS) employing Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA). By leveraging the PASS-enabled flexible channel adjustment and NOMA's power allocation adaptability, a sum rate maximization problem is formulated with the objective of simultaneously optimizing base station (BS)'s transmit power coefficients and pinching antenna (PA)'s radiation powers. Due to its non-convexity and complexity, the formulated optimization problem is challenging to solve directly. Hence, we decompose the main problem into two sub-problems, namely transmit power allocation sub-problem and PA radiation power allocation sub-problem. In the first sub-problem, closed-form solutions are derived for the BS's power allocation among NOMA users. Meanwhile, in the second sub-problem, we optimize the PA's radiation power utilizing successive convex approximation (SCA). These two sub-problems are solved alternatively using Alternating Optimization (AO) until convergence. It should be noted that decoding order plays a significant role in NOMA-assisted PASS. Hence, two variations of decoding order are considered, namely: i) a high-complexity exhaustive search approach, and, ii) a low-complexity alternative that utilizes pre-determined channel information. Numerical results show that our proposed approach substantially improves the system's sum-rate compared to widely adopted equal power allocation PASS schemes.</description>

      <title>Two-timescale Beamforming Optimization for Downlink Multi-user Holographic MIMO Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benefiting from the rapid development of metamaterials and metasurfaces, the holographic multiple-input and multiple-output surface (HMIMOS) has been regarded as a promising solution for future wireless networks recently. By densely packing numerous radiation elements together, HMIMOS is capable of realizing accurate beamforming with low hardware complexity. However, enormous radiation elements on the HMIMOS lead to high computational complexity and signaling overhead when applying traditional beamforming schemes relying on instantaneous channel state information (CSI). To tackle this problem, we propose a two-timescale optimization scheme to minimize the required transmission power under the constraint of all users' quality-of-service (QoS). Specifically, the beampatterns at the base station (BS) and the user equippment (UE) are optimized over the slowly changing statistical CSI based on the constrained stochastic successive convex approximation (CSSCA) algorithm. Then, the instantaneous CSI is utilized to design the precoding matrix in order to ensure the system performance without significant increase in computational cost, due to the small number of feeds on the HMIMOS. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to other baselines.</description>

      <title>4D Imaging in ISAC Systems: A Framework Based on 5G NR Downlink Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a key enabler for sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, supporting spectrum sharing and hardware integration. Beyond communication enhancement, ISAC also enables high-accuracy environment reconstruction and imaging, which are crucial for applications such as autonomous driving and digital twins. This paper proposes a 4D imaging framework fully compliant with the 5G New Radio (NR) protocol, ensuring compatibility with cellular systems. Specifically, we develop an end-to-end processing chain that covers waveform generation, echo processing, and multi-BS point cloud fusion. Furthermore, we introduce Zoom-OMP, a coarse-to-fine sparse recovery algorithm for high-resolution angle estimation that achieves high accuracy with reduced computational cost. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves robust 4D imaging performance with superior spatial accuracy and reconstruction quality compared to conventional benchmarks, paving the way for practical ISAC-enabled environment reconstruction in 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Channel Knowledge Map Construction: Recent Advances and Open Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) has emerged as a pivotal technology for environment-aware wireless communications and sensing, which provides a priori location-specific channel knowledge to facilitate network optimization. Efficient CKM construction is an important technical problem for its effective implementation. This article provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in CKM construction. First, we examine classical interpolation-based CKM construction methods, highlighting their limitations in practical deployments. Next, we explore image processing and generative artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, which leverage feature extraction to construct CKMs based on environmental knowledge. Furthermore, we present emerging wireless radiance field (WRF) frameworks that exploit neural radiance fields or Gaussian splatting to construct high-fidelity CKMs from sparse measurement data. Finally, we outline various future research directions in real-time and cross-domain CKM construction, as well as cost-efficient deployment of CKMs.</description>

      <title>PECL: A Heterogeneous Parallel Multi-Domain Network for Radar-Based Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radar systems are increasingly favored for medical applications because they provide non-intrusive monitoring with high privacy and robustness to lighting conditions. However, existing research typically relies on single-domain radar signals and overlooks the temporal dependencies inherent in human activity, which complicates the classification of similar actions. To address this issue, we designed the Parallel-EfficientNet-CBAM-LSTM (PECL) network to process data in three complementary domains: Range-Time, Doppler-Time, and Range-Doppler. PECL combines a channel-spatial attention module and temporal units to capture more features and dynamic dependencies during action sequences, improving both accuracy and robustness. The experimental results show that PECL achieves an accuracy of 96.16% on the same dataset, outperforming existing methods by at least 4.78%. PECL also performs best in distinguishing between easily confused actions. Despite its strong performance, PECL maintains moderate model complexity, with 23.42M parameters and 1324.82M FLOPs. Its parameter-efficient design further reduces computational cost.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Models and Signal Processing for Movable Antenna-Enhanced Wireless Communications and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) has been recognized as a promising technology for performance enhancement in wireless communication and sensing systems by exploiting the spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) in flexible antenna movement. However, the integration of MAs into next-generation wireless networks still faces design challenges due to the paradigm shift from conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs) to MAs, which motivates this paper to provide a comprehensive overview of the models, scenarios, and signal processing techniques for MA-enhanced wireless networks. First, we introduce several efficient methods to realize flexible antenna movement. Next, channel models based on field response and spatial correlation are presented to characterize the channel variations with respect to MA movement. Then, we discuss the advantages and challenges of applying MAs to typical application scenarios of wireless communications and sensing. Moreover, we show the signal processing techniques for MA-enhanced communication and sensing systems, including channel acquisition and antenna position optimization. Finally, we highlight promising research directions to inspire future investigations.</description>

      <title>Average and Worst-case Analysis of MIMO Beamforming Loss due to Hardware Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of hardware impairments in antenna arrays on the beamforming performance of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communication systems. We consider two types of imperfections: per-element gain mismatches and inter-element spacing deviations. We analytically determine the impairment configurations that result in the worst-case degradation. In addition, the analytical expression of the average-case performance is also derived for comparison. Simulation and theoretical results show that the average SNR degradation remains relatively limited, whereas the worst-case scenarios can exhibit substantially higher losses. These findings provide clear insight into the robustness limits of MIMO systems under practical hardware imperfections.</description>

      <title>Near-optimal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Configuration: Blind Beamforming with Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blind beamforming has emerged as a promising approach to configure reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) without relying on channel state information (CSI) or geometric models, making it directly compatible with commodity hardware. In this paper, we propose a new blind beamforming algorithm, so-called Blind Optimal RIS Beamforming with Sensing (\textsc{BORN}), that operates using only received signal strength (RSS). In contrast to existing methods that rely on majority-voting mechanisms, \textsc{BORN} exploits the intrinsic quadratic structure of the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The algorithm proceeds in two stages: \emph{sensing}, where a quadratic model is estimated from RSS measurements, and \emph{optimization}, where the RIS configuration is obtained using the estimated quadratic model. Our novelties are twofold. Firstly, we show for the first time, that \textsc{BORN} can achieve provable near-optimal performance using only $O(N \log_2(N))$ samples, where $N$ is the number of RIS elements. As a by-product of our analysis, we show that quadratic models are learnable under Rademacher feature distributions when the second-order coefficient matrix is low-rank. This result, to our knowledge, has not been established in prior matrix sensing literature. Secondly, extensive simulations and real-world field tests demonstrate that \textsc{BORN} achieves near-optimal performance, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art blind beamforming algorithms, particularly in scenarios with a weak background channel such as non-line-of-sight (NLOS).</description>

      <title>Look Before Switch: Sensing-Assisted Handover in 5G NR V2I Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) has emerged as a promising solution in addressing the challenges of high-mobility scenarios in 5G NR Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communications. This paper proposes a novel sensing-assisted handover framework that leverages ISAC capabilities to enable precise beamforming and proactive handover decisions. Two sensing-enabled handover triggering algorithms are developed: a distance-based scheme that utilizes estimated spatial positioning, and a probability-based approach that predicts vehicle maneuvers using interacting multiple model extended Kalman filter (IMM-EKF) tracking. The proposed methods eliminate the need for uplink feedback and beam sweeping, thus significantly reducing signaling overhead and handover interruption time. A sensing-assisted NR frame structure and corresponding protocol design are also introduced to support rapid synchronization and access under vehicular mobility. Extensive link-level simulations using real-world map data demonstrate that the proposed framework reduces the average handover interruption time by over 50%, achieves lower handover rates, and enhances overall communication performance.</description>

      <title>Millimeter-Scale Absolute Carrier Phase-Based Localization in Multi-Band Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localization is a key feature of future Sixth Generation (6G) net-works with foreseen accuracy requirements down to the millimeter level, to enable novel applications in the fields of telesurgery, high-precision manufacturing, and others. Currently, such accuracy requirements are only achievable with specialized or highly resource-demanding systems, rendering them impractical for more wide-spread deployment. In this paper, we present the first system that enables low-complexity and low-bandwidth absolute 3D localization with millimeter-level accuracy in generic wireless networks. It performs a carrier phase-based wireless localization refinement of an initial location estimate based on successive location-likelihood optimization across multiple bands. Unlike previous phase unwrapping methods, our solution is one-shot. We evaluate its performance collecting ~350, 000 measurements, showing an improvement of more than one order of magnitude over classical localization techniques. Finally, we will open-source the low-cost, modular FR3 front-end that we developed for the experimental campaign.</description>

      <title>Location-Informed Interference Suppression Precoding Methods for Distributed Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of mobile networks towards user-centric cell-free distributed Massive MIMO configurations requires the development of novel signal processing techniques. More specifically, digital precoding algorithms have to be designed or adopted to enable distributed operation. Future deployments are expected to improve coexistence between cellular generations, and between mobile networks and incumbent services such as radar. In dense cell-free deployments, it might also not be possible to have full channel state information for all users at all antennas. To leverage location information in a dense deployment area, we suggest and investigate several algorithmic alterations on existing precoding methods, aimed at location-informed interference suppression, for usage in existing and emerging systems where user locations are known. The proposed algorithms are derived using a theoretical channel model and validated and numerically evaluated using an empirical dataset containing channel measurements from an indoor distributed Massive MIMO testbed. When dealing with measured CSI, the impact of the hardware, in addition to the location-based channel, needs to be compensated for. We propose a method to calibrate the hardware and achieve measurement-based evaluation of our location-based interference suppression algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed methods allow location-based interference suppression without explicit CSI knowledge at the transmitter, under certain realistic network conditions.</description>

      <title>Strategic Decision-Making Under Uncertainty through Bi-Level Game Theory and Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In strategic scenarios where decision-makers operate at different hierarchical levels, traditional optimization methods are often inadequate for handling uncertainties from incomplete information or unpredictable external factors. To fill this gap, we introduce a mathematical framework that integrates bi-level game theory with distributionally robust optimization (DRO), particularly suited for complex network systems. Our approach leverages the hierarchical structure of bi-level games to model leader-follower interactions while incorporating distributional robustness to guard against worst-case probability distributions. To ensure computational tractability, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are used to transform the bi-level challenge into a more manageable single-level model, and the infinite-dimensional DRO problem is reformulated into a finite equivalent. We propose a generalized algorithm to solve this integrated model. Simulation results validate our framework's efficacy, demonstrating that under high uncertainty, the proposed model achieves up to a 22\% cost reduction compared to traditional stochastic methods while maintaining a service level of over 90\%. This highlights its potential to significantly improve decision quality and robustness in networked systems such as transportation and communication networks.</description>

      <title>Predicting Cognitive Assessment Scores in Older Adults with Cognitive Impairment Using Wearable Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background and Objectives: This paper focuses on using AI to assess the cognitive function of older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia using physiological data provided by a wearable device. Cognitive screening tools are disruptive, time-consuming, and only capture brief snapshots of activity. Wearable sensors offer an attractive alternative by continuously monitoring physiological signals. This study investigated whether physiological data can accurately predict scores on established cognitive tests. Research Design and Methods: We recorded physiological signals from 23 older adults completing three NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery tests, which assess working memory, processing speed, and attention. The Empatica EmbracePlus, a wearable device, measured blood volume pulse, skin conductance, temperature, and movement. Statistical features were extracted using wavelet-based and segmentation methods. We then applied supervised learning and validated predictions via cross-validation, hold-out testing, and bootstrapping. Results: Our models showed strong performance with Spearman's \rho of 0.73-0.82 and mean absolute errors of 0.14-0.16, significantly outperforming a naive mean predictor. Sensor roles varied: heart-related signals combined with movement and temperature best predicted working memory, movement paired with skin conductance was most informative for processing speed, and heart in tandem with skin conductance worked best for attention. Discussion and Implications: These findings suggest that wearable sensors paired with AI tools such as supervised learning and feature engineering can noninvasively track specific cognitive functions in older adults, enabling continuous monitoring. Our study demonstrates how AI can be leveraged when the data sample is small. This approach may support remote assessments and facilitate clinical interventions.</description>

Abstract: This paper considers a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless system wherein two legitimate users attempt to exchange secret keys over free-space optical (FSO) channels. Novel frameworks for the use of the one- and two-way discrete-variable quantum key distribution (DV-QKD) protocols, employing weak coherent pulses and decoy states, are presented. Focusing on the case where a photon-number-splitting attack is adopted by the eavesdropper and the legitimate multi-antenna receiver using threshold detection for the key extraction, novel expressions for the secret key rate and quantum bit error rate for both one- and two-way protocols are derived. The performance gain with larger MIMO configurations and the tradeoff between the performances with the one- and the two-way protocols with respect to the transmission distance of the legitimate FSO link are numerically assessed.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Entanglement-Aware Routing for Satellite Quantum Networks under Orbital and Atmospheric Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The expansion of satellite-based quantum networks requires adaptive routing mechanisms that can sustain entanglement under dynamic orbital and atmospheric conditions. Conventional schemes, often tailored to static or idealised topologies, fail to capture the combined effects of orbital motion, fading, and trust variability in inter-satellite links. This work proposes an \textit{adaptive entanglement-aware routing framework} that jointly accounts for orbital geometry, atmospheric attenuation, and multi-parameter link evaluation. The routing metric integrates fidelity, trust, and key-rate weights to maintain connectivity and mitigate loss from turbulence and fading. Monte Carlo simulations across multiple orbital densities ($\rho = 10^{-6}$~km$^{-3}$) and environmental regimes, standard atmosphere, strong turbulence, and clear-sky LEO show up to a 275\% improvement in key generation rate and a 15\% increase in effective entanglement fidelity over existing adaptive methods. The framework achieves sub-linear path-length scaling with network size and remains robust for fading variances up to $\sigma_{\mathrm{fade}}=0.1$, demonstrating strong potential for future global quantum constellations.</description>

      <title>Pre-equalization Design for ISAC-OTFS Air-Ground Transmission: A Deep Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the strong Doppler resilience capability, orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation suffers from high channel estimation and equalization complexity at the receiver, hindering its applicability in air-ground transmission. In this paper, we propose a pre-equalization-based integrated sensing and communications-OTFS downlink transmission framework in which the terrestrial access point executes pre-equalization using the predicted channel state information (CSI), so that the unmanned aerial vehicle can perform direct symbol detection without channel equalization. In particular, the mean square error of OTFS symbol demodulation and Cramer-Rao lower bound of sensing parameter estimation are considered, with their weighted sum utilized as the metric for optimizing the pre-equalization matrix. To address the time-varying CSI, we develop a deep learning based framework composed of channel prediction and pre-equalization. In particular, a parameter-level channel prediction module is utilized to decouple OTFS channel parameters, and a low-dimensional prediction network is leveraged to correct outdated CSI, which is then used to initialize the input of the pre-equalization module. Finally, a dual-branch residual-structured deep neural network is cascaded to execute pre-equalization. Simulation results show that the proposed channel prediction-based pre-equalization framework significantly reduces receiver complexity and pilot overhead while achieving symbol detection performance close to minimum mean square error equalization with perfect CSI under high mobility, as well as substantially improving sensing accuracy.</description>

      <title>On multipolar magnetic anomaly detection: multipolar signal subspaces, an analytical orthonormal basis, multipolar truncature and detection performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the magnetic anomaly detection problem which aims to find hidden ferromagnetic masses by estimating the weak perturbation they induce on local Earth's magnetic field. We consider classical detection schemes that rely on signals recorded on a moving sensor, and modeling of the source as a function of unknown parameters. As the usual spherical harmonic decomposition of the anomaly has to be truncated in practice, we study the signal vector subspaces induced by each multipole of the decomposition, proving they are not in direct sum, and discussing the impact it has on the choice of the truncation order. Further, to ease the detection strategy based on generalized likelihood ratio test, we rely on orthogonal polynomials theory to derive an analytical set of orthonormal functions (multipolar orthonormal basis functions) that spans the space of the noise-free measured signal. Finally, based on the subspace structure of the multipole vector spaces, we study the impact of the truncation order on the detection performance, beyond the issue of potential surparametrization, and the behaviour of the information criteria used to choose this order.</description>

      <title>Lossy Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: Modeling and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has emerged as an advancement and generalization of the conventional diagonal RIS (D-RIS) by introducing tunable interconnections between RIS elements, enabling smarter wave manipulation and enlarged coverage. While BD-RIS has demonstrated advantages over D-RIS in various aspects, most existing works rely on the assumption of a lossless model, leaving practical considerations unaddressed. This paper thus proposes a lossy BD-RIS model and develops corresponding optimization algorithms for various BD-RIS-aided communication systems. First, by leveraging admittance parameter analysis, we model each tunable admittance based on a lumped circuit with losses and derive an expression of a circle characterizing the real and imaginary parts of each tunable admittance. We then consider the received signal power maximization in single-user single-input single-output (SISO) systems with the proposed lossy BD-RIS model. To solve the optimization problem, we design an effective algorithm by carefully exploiting the problem structure. Specifically, an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework is custom-designed to deal with the complicated constraints associated with lossy BD-RIS. Furthermore, we extend the proposed algorithmic framework to more general multiuser multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems, where the transmit precoder and BD-RIS scattering matrix are jointly designed to maximize the sum-rate of the system. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that all BD-RIS architectures still outperform D-RIS in the presence of losses, but the optimal BD-RIS architectures in the lossless case are not necessarily optimal in the lossy case, e.g. group-connected BD-RIS can outperform fully- and tree-connected BD-RISs in SISO systems with relatively high losses, whereas the opposite always holds true in the lossless case.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient Collaborative LLM Inference via Distributed Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speculative decoding is an emerging technique that accelerates large language model (LLM) inference by allowing a smaller draft model to predict multiple tokens in advance, which are then verified or corrected by a larger target model. In AI-native radio access networks (AI-RAN), this paradigm is well-suited for collaborative inference between resource-constrained end devices and more capable edge servers or base stations (BSs). However, existing distributed speculative decoding requires transmitting the full vocabulary probability distribution from the draft model on the device to the target model at the BS, which leads to prohibitive uplink communication overhead. To address this issue, we propose a ``Top-K Sparse Logits Transmission (TK-SLT)`` scheme, where the draft model transmits only the top-K token raw probabilities and the corresponding token indices instead of the entire distribution. This approach significantly reduces bandwidth consumption while maintaining inference performance. We further derive an analytical expression for the optimal draft length that maximizes inference throughput, and provide a theoretical analysis of the achievable speedup ratio under TK-SLT. Experimental results validate both the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference for Extended Target Detection in mmWave Automotive Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) automotive radar systems offer high range resolution due to their wide bandwidth, enabling the detection of multiple spatially distributed scatterers from a single extended target, such as a vehicle. Traditional CFAR-based detection methods often treat these scatterers as independent point targets, thereby neglecting the inherent spatial structure of extended objects. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Range-Doppler (RD) segment-based statistical inference framework that captures the characteristic scattering profile of extended automotive targets. The framework employs Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for statistical parameter extraction and utilizes Gibbs sampling within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) scheme to model the posterior distribution of the segment features. A skewness-based test statistic, derived from the estimated distribution, is introduced for binary hypothesis testing to distinguish extended targets. Furthermore, we develop a detection pipeline incorporating Intersection over Union (IoU) metrics and peak-centric segment alignment, optimized for single-dwell radar operations. Comprehensive evaluations on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving enhanced detection accuracy and robustness in automotive radar scenarios.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Self-Calibration and Parametric Channel Estimation for 6G Antenna Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate channel estimation is essential for both high-rate communication and high-precision sensing in 6G wireless systems. However, a major performance limitation arises from calibration mismatches when operating phased-array antennas under real-world conditions. To address this issue, we propose to integrate antenna element self-calibration into a variational sparse Bayesian learning (VSBL) algorithm for parametric channel estimation. We model antenna gain and phase deviations as latent variables and derive explicit update equations to jointly infer these calibration parameters and the channel parameters: the model order, complex amplitudes, delays, angles, and the noise variance. The resulting algorithm operates online and adapts in real time to hardware-induced mismatches. We assess its performance in terms of the root mean square error (RMSE) and the optimal subpattern-assignment (OSPA) metric, demonstrating consistent improvements over conventional VSBL without calibration. Our results demonstrate that embedding self-calibration within Bayesian inference significantly enhances the robustness of channel estimation.</description>

      <title>RNN(p) for Power Consumption Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.01378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An elementary Recurrent Neural Network that operates on p time lags, called an RNN(p), is the natural generalisation of a linear autoregressive model ARX(p). It is a powerful forecasting tool for variables displaying inherent seasonal patterns across multiple time scales, as is often observed in energy, economic, and financial time series. The architecture of RNN(p) models, characterised by structured feedbacks across time lags, enables the design of efficient training strategies. We conduct a comparative study of learning algorithms for these models, providing a rigorous analysis of their computational complexity and training performance. We present two applications of RNN(p) models in power consumption forecasting, a key domain within the energy sector where accurate forecasts inform both operational and financial decisions. Experimental results show that RNN(p) models achieve excellent forecasting accuracy while maintaining a high degree of interpretability. These features make them well-suited for decision-making in energy markets and other fintech applications where reliable predictions play a significant economic role.</description>

      <title>LLM-Based Emulation of the Radio Resource Control Layer: Towards AI-Native RAN Protocols</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16821v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating Large AI Models (LAMs) into 6G mobile networks is a key enabler of the AI-Native Air Interface (AI-AI), where protocol intelligence must scale beyond handcrafted logic. This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first standards-compliant emulation of the Radio Resource Control (RRC) layer using a decoder-only LAM (LLAMA-class) fine-tuned with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a multi-vendor corpus of real-world traces spanning both 5G and 4G systems. We treat RRC as a domain-specific language and construct a segmentation-safe, question--answer (Question-and-Answer (QA)) dataset that preserves Abstract Syntax Notation (ASN.1) structure through linearization prior to Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization. The proposed approach combines parameter-efficient adaptation with schema-bounded prompting to ensure syntactic and procedural fidelity. Evaluation introduces a standards-aware triad -- ASN.1 conformance, field-level coverage analysis, and uplink-to-downlink state-machine checks -- alongside semantic similarity and latency profiling across 120 configurations. On 30k 5G request--response pairs plus an additional 4.8k QA turns from 4G sessions, our 8B model achieves a median cosine similarity of 0.97, a 61% relative gain over a zero-shot baseline, while sustaining high conformance rates. These results demonstrate that LAMs, when augmented with protocol-aware reasoning, can directly orchestrate control-plane procedures, laying the foundation for the future Artificial Intelligence (AI)-native Radio Access Network (RAN).</description>

      <title>To Trust or Not to Trust: On Calibration in ML-based Resource Allocation for Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In next-generation communications and networks, machine learning (ML) models are expected to deliver not only accurate predictions but also well-calibrated confidence scores that reflect the true likelihood of correct decisions. This paper studies the calibration performance of an ML-based outage predictor within a single-user, multi-resource allocation framework. We first establish key theoretical properties of this system's outage probability (OP) under perfect calibration. Importantly, we show that as the number of resources grows, the OP of a perfectly calibrated predictor approaches the expected output conditioned on it being below the classification threshold. In contrast, when only one resource is available, the system's OP equals the model's overall expected output. We then derive the OP conditions for a perfectly calibrated predictor. These findings guide the choice of the classification threshold to achieve a desired OP, helping system designers meet specific reliability requirements. We also demonstrate that post-processing calibration cannot improve the system's minimum achievable OP, as it does not introduce new information about future channel states. Additionally, we show that well-calibrated models are part of a broader class of predictors that necessarily improve OP. In particular, we establish a monotonicity condition that the accuracy-confidence function must satisfy for such improvement to occur. To demonstrate these theoretical properties, we conduct a rigorous simulation-based analysis using post-processing calibration techniques: Platt scaling and isotonic regression. As part of this framework, the predictor is trained using an outage loss function specifically designed for this system. Furthermore, this analysis is performed on Rayleigh fading channels with temporal correlation captured by Clarke's 2D model, which accounts for receiver mobility.</description>
