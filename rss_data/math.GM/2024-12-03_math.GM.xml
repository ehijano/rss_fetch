      <title>Exploring the refuge-induced bubbling phenomenon and harvesting in a three species food chain model that incorporates memory effect and odour effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, an odour-mediated system is developed and studied. In an odor-mediated systems, the sense of smell or odour of species plays a critical role in the interactions between predators and prey. It is widely recognised in scientific literature that these systems are very common and essential across natural ecosystems. These systems are crucial for various behaviors, including foraging, mating, and avoiding predators. In this paper, it is assumed that the presence of prey odour aids the predator in its hunting efforts. It is assumed that both prey and intermediate predators seek refuge against their respective predators upon detecting the odour of their predators. In other words, the odour of predators assists prey species in evaluating the danger and seeking refuge for hiding. This model incorporates the prey species' harvesting as well. We also explore the impact of fading memory on the system by incorporating fractional derivatives into the model. The conditions for both the existence and local stability of the non-negative equilibria are derived. The current model system undergoes both Hopf and transcritical bifurcation when the parameter values are appropriately chosen. The dynamic behaviour of the system is showcased and thoroughly analysed using a range of diagrams, highlighting the the impact of prey refuge and predator odour parameters. This paper extensively examines the long-term impacts of harvesting within the system. The presence of prey odour plays a significant role in promoting a long-term cohabitation dynamic within this specific system. It has been observed that when individuals within the system have a strong memory, it positively affects the stability of the system. Numerical simulations are conducted in order to demonstrate and validate the usefulness of the model being considered, therefore supporting the analytical conclusions.</description>

      <title>Clifford-valued linear canonical Stockwell transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new Clifford-valued linear canonical Stockwell transform aimed at providing efficient and focused representation of Clifford-valued functions in high-dimensional time-frequency analysis. This transform improves upon the windowed Fourier and wavelet transforms by incorporating angular, scalable, and localized windows, allowing for greater directional flexibility in multi-scale signal analysis within the Clifford domain. Using operator theory, we explore the core properties of the proposed transform, such as the inner product relation, reconstruction formula, and interval theorem. Practical examples are included to confirm the validity of the derived results.</description>

      <title>Carleman Linearization of Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carleman linearization is a technique that embeds systems of ordinary differential equations with polynomial nonlinearities into infinite dimensional linear systems in a procedural way. In this paper we generalize the method for systems of partial differential equations with quadratic nonlinearities, while maintaining the original structure of Carleman linearization. Furthermore, we apply our approach to Burger's equation and to the Vlasov equation as examples.</description>

      <title>Summed series involving \,_{1}F_{2} hypergeometric functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a prior paper we found that the Fourier-Legendre series of a Bessel function of the first kind J_{N}\left(kx\right) and of a modified Bessel functions of the first kind I_{N}\left(kx\right) lead to an infinite set of series involving \,_{1}F_{2} hypergeometric functions (extracted therefrom) that could be summed, having values that are inverse powers of the eight primes 1/\left(2^{i}3^{j}5^{k}7^{l}11^{m}13^{n}17^{o}19^{p}\right) multiplying powers of the coefficient k, for the first 22 terms in each series. The present paper shows how to generate additional, doubly infinite summed series involving \,_{1}F_{2} hypergeometric functions from Chebyshev polynomial expansions of Bessel functions, and trebly infinite sets of summed series involving \,_{1}F_{2} hypergeometric functions from Gegenbauer polynomial expansions of Bessel functions.</description>

      <title>A Fractional Model of Abalone Growth using Adomian Decomposition Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study is a modification of the McKendrick equation into a growth model with fractional order to predict the abalone length growth. We have shown that the model is a special case of Taylor's series after it was analysed using Adomian decomposition method and Caputo fractional derivative. By simulating the series with some fractional orders, the results indicate that the greater the fractional order of the model, the series values generated are greater as well. Moreover, the series that is close to the real data is the one with a fractional order of $0.5$. Therefore, the growth model with a fractional order provides more accuracy than a classical integer order.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Reaction-Diffusion-Advection System and its Impact on River Ecology in the Presence of Spatial Heterogeneity I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, a spatially distributed reaction-diffusion-advection (RDA) model with harvesting is investigated to signify the outcome of a competition between two competing species in a heterogeneous environment. The study builds upon the concept presented in literature \cite{tisha2}, applying it to river ecology in the context of harvesting activities. We assume that despite of having distinct advection and diffusion rates, two species are competing for the same food supply. This paper's main objective is to study, using theoretical and numerical analysis, the global asymptotic stability and coexistence steady state based on different and unequal rates of diffusion and advection. We establish the result for existence, uniqueness and positivity of the solution. The local stability of two semi trivial steady states is demonstrated. Also, we examine the non-existence of coexistence steady state with the help of some non-trivial presumptions. Finally, we combine the local stability with the non-existence of coexistence to demonstrate the global stability using monotone dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Modeling H1N1 Influenza Transmission and Control: Epidemic Theory Insights Across Mexico, Italy, and South Africa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study incorporates mathematical analysis, focusing on developing theories and conducting numerical simulations of Influenza virus transmission using real-world data. The terms in the equations introduce parameters which are determined by fitting the model for matching clinical data sets using non-linear least-square method. The purpose is to determine the wave trend, critical illness factors and forecast for Influenza in national levels of Mexico, Italy, and South Africa and to investigate the effectiveness of control policy and making some suggestions of alternative control policies. Data were extracted from the following sources: published literature, surveillance, unpublished reports, and websites of Centres For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \cite{CDC}, Natality report of U.S. clinics and World Health Organization (WHO) Influenza Disease Dashboard \cite{WHO}. We included total 120 weeks data (which are calculated as per thousand) from October 01, 2020 to March 31, 2023 \cite{CDC}, throughout this study. Numerical and sensitivity analysis are carried out to determine some prevent strategies. The objectives of local and global sensitivity analysis is to determine the dominating parameters and effective correlation with $\mathcal{R}_0$. We presented data fitting, Latin hypercube sampling, sensitivity indices, Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient, p-value, estimation of the nature of $\mathcal{R}_0$ from available data to show validation of the model with these counties. The aim is to determine optimal control strategies with drug administration schemes, treatments which represent the efficacy of drug inhabiting viral production and preventing new infections, minimizes the systematic cost based on the percentage effect of the drug. Finally, we present series of numerical examples and the effect of different parameters on the compartments to verify theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We found a counterexample to the conjecture of Karvatskyi and Pratsiovytyi concerning the topological type of the achievement set of an intermediate series (Proceedings of the International Geometry Center, 2023. https://doi.org/10.15673/pigc.v16i3.2519). This conjecture is based on an analogy with the squeeze theorem from calculus. We also proposed an improved version of the conjecture, which this counterexample does not refute.</description>

      <title>Properties of f correlated fuzzy numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents some concepts of the theory of interactive fuzzy numbers, and mainly, a class of interactive fuzzy numbers, called $f$-correlated fuzzy numbers. We start from the foundations of general fuzzy mathematics and go through operations and the notion of interactivity for fuzzy numbers. The main result is that $f$-correlation preserve the shape of certains fuzzy numbers. More specificaly, if two fuzzy numbers are $f$ correlated, and one is a LR-type fuzzy number, the other is also a LR-type fuzzy number. This paper also presents some operations with the $f$-correlated fuzzy numbers wich are interesting to applications like biomathematics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a brief introduction to a class of interactive fuzzy numbers, called f correlated fuzzy numbers, which consist of pairs of fuzzy numbers where one is dependent on the other by a continuous montone injector function. We present some results of operations with these numbers, obtaining equations that can directly calculate the results of these operations using only basic operations with real numbers, intervals on the real line and the function that relates the fuzzy numbers being considered.</description>

      <title>A Python Framework Enhancement for Neutrosophic Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an extension to the Python Neutrosophic Sets (PYNS) framework, originally detailed in Nordo et al. 2024, with the addition of the NSfamily class for constructing and manipulating neutrosophic topologies. Building on existing classes like NSuniverse and NSset, the NSfamily class enables the definition and testing of neutrosophic families as basis and sub-basis for neutrosophic topological spaces. This extension provides tools for verifying closure properties under union and intersection, and for determining whether a given family constitutes a neutrosophic topology. Through implemented algorithms, the framework automates the generation of topologies from families of neutrosophic sets, offering an efficient tool for advancing research in neutrosophic topology. Practical applications are demonstrated with detailed examples, showcasing how this class enhances the scope and flexibility of neutrosophic modeling within the PYNS framework.</description>

      <title>The path sequence of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $P(G)=(P_{0}(G),P_{1}(G),\cdots, P_{\rho}(G))$ be the path sequence of a graph $G$, where $P_{i}(G)$ is the number of paths with length $i$ and $\rho$ is the length of a longest path in $G$. In this paper, we first give the path sequences of some graphs and show that the number of paths with length $h$ in a starlike tree is completely determined by its branches of length not more than $h-2$. And then we consider whether the path sequence characterizes a graph from a different point of view and find that any two graphs in some graph families are isomorphic if and only if they have the same path sequence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1604.02174v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fernandez-Guasti squircle is a plane algebraic curve that is an intermediate shape between the circle and the square. It has qualitative features that are similar to the more famous Lam\'e curve. However, unlike the Lam\'e curve which has unbounded exponents, the Fernandez-Guasti squircle is a low degree quartic curve. This makes it more amenable to algebraic manipulation and simplification. In this paper, we will analyze this squircle and derive formulas for its area, arc length, and polar form. We will also provide several parametric equations of this squircle. Finally, we extend the Fernandez-Guasti squircle to three dimensions by coming up with an analogous surface that is an intermediate shape between the sphere and the cube.</description>
