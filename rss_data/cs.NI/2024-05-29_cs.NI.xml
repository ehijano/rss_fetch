      <title>The Efficacy of the Connect America Fund in Addressing US Internet Access Inequities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Residential fixed broadband internet access in the United States (US) has long been distributed inequitably, drawing significant attention from researchers and policymakers. This paper evaluates the efficacy of the Connect America Fund (CAF), a key policy intervention aimed at addressing disparities in US internet access. CAF subsidizes the creation of new regulated broadband monopolies in underserved areas, aiming to provide comparable internet access, in terms of price and speed, to that available in urban regions. Oversight of CAF largely relies on data self-reported by internet service providers (ISPs), which is often questionable. We use the broadband-plan querying tool (BQT) to curate a novel dataset that complements ISP-reported information with ISP-advertised broadband plan details (download speed and monthly cost) on publicly accessible websites. Specifically, we query advertised broadband plans for 687k residential addresses across 15 states, certified as served by ISPs to regulators. Our analysis reveals significant discrepancies between ISP-reported data and actual broadband availability. We find that the serviceability rate-defined as the fraction of addresses ISPs actively serve out of the total queried, weighted by the number of CAF addresses in a census block group-is only 55%, dropping to as low as 18% in some states. Additionally, the compliance rate-defined as the weighted fraction of addresses where ISPs actively serve and advertise download speeds above the FCC's 10 Mbps threshold-is only 33%. We also observe that in a subset of census blocks, CAF-funded addresses receive higher broadband speeds than their monopoly-served neighbors. These results indicate that while a few users have benefited from this multi-billion dollar program, it has largely failed to achieve its intended goal, leaving many targeted rural communities with inadequate or no broadband connectivity.</description>

      <title>FlocOff: Data Heterogeneity Resilient Federated Learning with Communication-Efficient Edge Offloading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a fundamental learning paradigm to harness massive data scattered at geo-distributed edge devices in a privacy-preserving way. Given the heterogeneous deployment of edge devices, however, their data are usually Non-IID, introducing significant challenges to FL including degraded training accuracy, intensive communication costs, and high computing complexity. Towards that, traditional approaches typically utilize adaptive mechanisms, which may suffer from scalability issues, increased computational overhead, and limited adaptability to diverse edge environments. To address that, this paper instead leverages the observation that the computation offloading involves inherent functionalities such as node matching and service correlation to achieve data reshaping and proposes Federated learning based on computing Offloading (FlocOff) framework, to address data heterogeneity and resource-constrained challenges. Specifically, FlocOff formulates the FL process with Non-IID data in edge scenarios and derives rigorous analysis on the impact of imbalanced data distribution. Based on this, FlocOff decouples the optimization in two steps, namely : (1) Minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence via Computation Offloading scheduling (MKL-CO); (2) Minimizes the Communication Cost through Resource Allocation (MCC-RA). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FlocOff effectively improves model convergence and accuracy by 14.3\%-32.7\% while reducing data heterogeneity under various data distributions.</description>

      <title>User Association and Channel Allocation in 5G Mobile Asymmetric Multi-band Heterogeneous Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the proliferation of mobile terminals and the continuous upgrading of services, 4G LTE networks are showing signs of weakness. To enhance the capacity of wireless networks, millimeter waves are introduced to drive the evolution of networks towards multi-band 5G heterogeneous networks. The distinct propagation characteristics of mmWaves and microwaves, as well as the vastly different hardware configurations of heterogeneous base stations, make traditional access strategies no longer effective. Therefore, to narrowing the gap between theory and practice, we investigate the access strategy in multi-band 5G heterogeneous networks, taking into account the characteristics of mobile users, asynchronous switching between uplink and downlink of pico base stations, asymmetric service requirements, and user communication continuity. We formulate the problem as integer nonlinear programming and prove its intractability. Thereby, we decouple it into three subproblems: user association, switch point selection, and subchannel allocation, and design an algorithm based on optimal matching and spectral clustering to solve it efficiently. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the comparison methods in terms of overall data rate, effective data rate, and number of satisfied users.</description>

      <title>To RL or not to RL? An Algorithmic Cheat-Sheet for AI-Based Radio Resource Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several Radio Resource Management (RRM) use cases can be framed as sequential decision planning problems, where an agent (the base station, typically) makes decisions that influence the network utility and state. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) in its general form can address this scenario, it is known to be sample inefficient. Following the principle of Occam's razor, we argue that the choice of the solution technique for RRM should be guided by questions such as, "Is it a short or long-term planning problem?", "Is the underlying model known or does it need to be learned?", "Can we solve the problem analytically?" or "Is an expert-designed policy available?". A wide range of techniques exists to address these questions, including static and stochastic optimization, bandits, model predictive control (MPC) and, indeed, RL. We review some of these techniques that have already been successfully applied to RRM, and we believe that others, such as MPC, may present exciting research opportunities for the future.</description>

      <title>Multi-Source Coflow Scheduling in Collaborative Edge Computing with Multihop Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative edge computing has become a popular paradigm where edge devices collaborate by sharing resources. Data dissemination is a fundamental problem in CEC to decide what data is transmitted from which device and how. Existing works on data dissemination have not focused on coflow scheduling in CEC, which involves deciding the order of flows within and across coflows at network links. Coflow implies a set of parallel flows with a shared objective. The existing works on coflow scheduling in data centers usually assume a non-blocking switch and do not consider congestion at different links in the multi-hop path in CEC, leading to increased coflow completion time (CCT). Furthermore, existing works do not consider multiple flow sources that cannot be ignored, as data can have duplicate copies at different edge devices. This work formulates the multi-source coflow scheduling problem in CEC, which includes jointly deciding the source and flow ordering for multiple coflows to minimize the sum of CCT. This problem is shown to be NP-hard and challenging as each flow can have multiple dependent conflicts at multiple links. We propose a source and coflow-aware search and adjust (SCASA) heuristic that first provides an initial solution considering the coflow characteristics. SCASA further improves the initial solution using the source search and adjust heuristic by leveraging the knowledge of both coflows and network congestion at links. Evaluation done using simulation experiments shows that SCASA leads to up to 83% reduction in the sum of CCT compared to benchmarks without a joint solution.</description>

      <title>Adaptive and Parallel Split Federated Learning in Vehicular Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vehicular edge intelligence (VEI) is a promising paradigm for enabling future intelligent transportation systems by accommodating artificial intelligence (AI) at the vehicular edge computing (VEC) system. Federated learning (FL) stands as one of the fundamental technologies facilitating collaborative model training locally and aggregation, while safeguarding the privacy of vehicle data in VEI. However, traditional FL faces challenges in adapting to vehicle heterogeneity, training large models on resource-constrained vehicles, and remaining susceptible to model weight privacy leakage. Meanwhile, split learning (SL) is proposed as a promising collaborative learning framework which can mitigate the risk of model wights leakage, and release the training workload on vehicles. SL sequentially trains a model between a vehicle and an edge cloud (EC) by dividing the entire model into a vehicle-side model and an EC-side model at a given cut layer. In this work, we combine the advantages of SL and FL to develop an Adaptive Split Federated Learning scheme for Vehicular Edge Computing (ASFV). The ASFV scheme adaptively splits the model and parallelizes the training process, taking into account mobile vehicle selection and resource allocation. Our extensive simulations, conducted on non-independent and identically distributed data, demonstrate that the proposed ASFV solution significantly reduces training latency compared to existing benchmarks, while adapting to network dynamics and vehicles' mobility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In vehicular networks (VNets), ensuring both road safety and dependable network connectivity is of utmost importance. Achieving this necessitates the creation of resilient and efficient decision-making policies that prioritize multiple objectives. In this paper, we develop a Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC)-based multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) framework to characterize efficient network selection and autonomous driving policies in a vehicular network (VNet). Numerical results showcase notable enhancements in both convergence rates and rewards when compared to conventional deep-Q networks (DQNs), validating the efficacy of the VQC-MORL solution.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Switching with One-Way Repeaters in Star Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributing quantum states reliably among distant locations is a key challenge in the field of quantum networks. One-way quantum networks address this by using one-way communication and quantum error correction. Here, we analyze quantum circuit switching as a protocol to distribute quantum states in one-way quantum networks. In quantum circuit switching, pairs of users can request the delivery of multiple quantum states from one user to the other. After waiting for approval from the network, the states can be distributed either sequentially, forwarding one at a time along a path of quantum repeaters, or in parallel, sending batches of quantum states from repeater to repeater. Since repeaters can only forward a finite number of quantum states at a time, a pivotal question arises: is it advantageous to send them sequentially (allowing for multiple requests simultaneously) or in parallel (reducing processing time but handling only one request at a time)? We compare both approaches in a quantum network with a star topology. Using tools from queuing theory, we show that requests are met at a higher rate when packets are distributed in parallel, although sequential distribution can generally provide service to a larger number of users simultaneously. We also show that using a large number of quantum repeaters to combat channel losses limits the maximum distance between users, as each repeater introduces additional processing delays. These findings provide insight into the design of protocols for distributing quantum states in one-way quantum networks.</description>

      <title>HawkVision: Low-Latency Modeless Edge AI Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trend of modeless ML inference is increasingly growing in popularity as it hides the complexity of model inference from users and caters to diverse user and application accuracy requirements. Previous work mostly focuses on modeless inference in data centers. To provide low-latency inference, in this paper, we promote modeless inference at the edge. The edge environment introduces additional challenges related to low power consumption, limited device memory, and volatile network environments.
  To address these challenges, we propose HawkVision, which provides low-latency modeless serving of vision DNNs. HawkVision leverages a two-layer edge-DC architecture that employs confidence scaling to reduce the number of model options while meeting diverse accuracy requirements. It also supports lossy inference under volatile network environments. Our experimental results show that HawkVision outperforms current serving systems by up to 1.6X in P99 latency for providing modeless service. Our FPGA prototype demonstrates similar performance at certain accuracy levels with up to a 3.34X reduction in power consumption.</description>

      <title>Network Connectivity--Information Freshness Tradeoff in Information Dissemination Over Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a gossip network consisting of a source generating updates and $n$ nodes connected according to a given graph structure. The source keeps updates of a process, that might be generated or observed, and shares them with the gossiping network. The nodes in the network communicate with their neighbors and disseminate these version updates using a push-style gossip strategy. We use the version age metric to quantify the timeliness of information at the nodes. We first find an upper bound for the average version age for a set of nodes in a general network. Using this, we find the average version age scaling of a node in several network graph structures, such as two-dimensional grids, generalized rings and hyper-cubes. Prior to our work, it was known that when $n$ nodes are connected on a ring the version age scales as $O(n^{\frac{1}{2}})$, and when they are connected on a fully-connected graph the version age scales as $O(\log n)$. Ours is the first work to show an age scaling result for a connectivity structure other than the ring and the fully-connected network, which constitute the two extremes of network connectivity. Our work helps fill the gap between these two extremes by analyzing a large variety of graphs with intermediate connectivity, thus providing insight into the relationship between the connectivity structure of the network and the version age, and uncovering a network connectivity--information freshness tradeoff.</description>

      <title>Coupling OMNeT++ and mosaik for integrated Co-Simulation of ICT-reliant Smart Grids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.12550v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy resources requires so-called smart grid services for monitoring, control and automation tasks. Simulation environments are vital for evaluating and developing innovative solutions and algorithms. Especially in smart energy systems, we face a variety of heterogeneous simulators representing, e.g., power grids, analysis or control components and markets. The co-simulation framework mosaik can be used to orchestrate the data exchange and time synchronization between individual simulators. So far, the underlying communication infrastructure has often been assumed to be optimal and therefore, the influence of e.g., communication delays has been neglected. This paper presents the first results of the project cosima, which aims at connecting the communication simulator OMNeT++ to the co-simulation framework mosaik to analyze the resilience and robustness of smart grid services, e.g., multi-agent-based services with respect to adaptivity, scalability, extensibility and usability. This facilitates simulations with realistic communication technologies (such as 5G) and the analysis of dynamic communication characteristics by simulating multiple messages. We show the functionality and benefits of cosima in experiments with 50 agents.</description>

      <title>Insights from the Design Space Exploration of Flow-Guided Nanoscale Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanodevices with Terahertz (THz)-based wireless communication capabilities are providing a primer for flow-guided localization within the human bloodstreams. Such localization is allowing for assigning the locations of sensed events with the events themselves, providing benefits in precision medicine along the lines of early and precise diagnostics, and reduced costs and invasiveness. Flow-guided localization is still in a rudimentary phase, with only a handful of works targeting the problem. Nonetheless, the performance assessments of the proposed solutions are already carried out in a non-standardized way, usually along a single performance metric, and ignoring various aspects that are relevant at such a scale (e.g., nanodevices' limited energy) and for such a challenging environment (e.g., extreme attenuation of in-body THz propagation). As such, these assessments feature low levels of realism and cannot be compared in an objective way. Toward addressing this issue, we account for the environmental and scale-related peculiarities of the scenario and assess the performance of two state-of-the-art flow-guided localization approaches along a set of heterogeneous performance metrics such as the accuracy and reliability of localization.</description>

      <title>A Wireless AI-Generated Content (AIGC) Provisioning Framework Empowered by Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative AI applications have been recently catering to a vast user base by creating diverse and high-quality AI-generated content (AIGC). With the proliferation of mobile devices and rapid growth of mobile traffic, providing ubiquitous access to high-quality AIGC services via wireless communication networks is becoming the future direction. However, it is challenging to provide qualified AIGC services in wireless networks with unstable channels, limited bandwidth resources, and unevenly distributed computational resources. To tackle these challenges, we propose a semantic communication (SemCom)-empowered AIGC (SemAIGC) generation and transmission framework, where only semantic information of the content rather than all the binary bits should be generated and transmitted by using SemCom. Specifically, SemAIGC integrates diffusion models within the semantic encoder and decoder to design a workload-adjustable transceiver thereby allowing adjustment of computational resource utilization in edge and local. In addition, a Resource-aware wOrk lOad Trade-off (ROOT) scheme is devised to intelligently make workload adaptation decisions for the transceiver, thus efficiently generating, transmitting, and fine-tuning content as per dynamic wireless channel conditions and service requirements. Simulations verify the superiority of our proposed SemAIGC framework in terms of latency and content quality compared to conventional approaches.</description>

      <title>Bandwidth Efficient Cache Selection and Content Advertisement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Caching is extensively used in various networking environments to optimize performance by reducing latency, bandwidth, and energy consumption. To optimize performance, caches often advertise their content using indicators, which are data structures that trade space efficiency for accuracy. However, this tradeoff introduces the risk of false indications. Existing solutions for cache content advertisement and cache selection often lead to inefficiencies, failing to adapt to dynamic network conditions. This paper introduces SALSA2, a Scalable Adaptive and Learning-based Selection and Advertisement Algorithm, which addresses these limitations through a dynamic and adaptive approach. SALSA2 accurately estimates mis-indication probabilities by considering inter-cache dependencies and dynamically adjusts the size and frequency of indicator advertisements to minimize transmission overhead while maintaining high accuracy. Our extensive simulation study, conducted using a variety of real-world cache traces, demonstrates that SALSA2 achieves up to 84\% bandwidth savings compared to the state-of-the-art solution and close-to-optimal service cost in most scenarios. These results highlight SALSA2's effectiveness in enhancing cache management, making it a robust and versatile solution for modern networking challenges.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Analysis of Network Robustness Evaluation Based on Convolutional Neural Networks with Spatial Pyramid Pooling</title>

Abstract: Connectivity robustness, a crucial aspect for understanding, optimizing, and repairing complex networks, has traditionally been evaluated through time-consuming and often impractical simulations. Fortunately, machine learning provides a new avenue for addressing this challenge. However, several key issues remain unresolved, including the performance in more general edge removal scenarios, capturing robustness through attack curves instead of directly training for robustness, scalability of predictive tasks, and transferability of predictive capabilities. In this paper, we address these challenges by designing a convolutional neural networks (CNN) model with spatial pyramid pooling networks (SPP-net), adapting existing evaluation metrics, redesigning the attack modes, introducing appropriate filtering rules, and incorporating the value of robustness as training data. The results demonstrate the thoroughness of the proposed CNN framework in addressing the challenges of high computational time across various network types, failure component types and failure scenarios. However, the performance of the proposed CNN model varies: for evaluation tasks that are consistent with the trained network type, the proposed CNN model consistently achieves accurate evaluations of both attack curves and robustness values across all removal scenarios. When the predicted network type differs from the trained network, the CNN model still demonstrates favorable performance in the scenario of random node failure, showcasing its scalability and performance transferability. Nevertheless, the performance falls short of expectations in other removal scenarios. This observed scenario-sensitivity in the evaluation of network features has been overlooked in previous studies and necessitates further attention and optimization. Lastly, we discuss important unresolved questions and further investigation.</description>

      <title>Introducing Adaptive Continuous Adversarial Training (ACAT) to Enhance ML Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial training enhances the robustness of Machine Learning (ML) models against adversarial attacks. However, obtaining labeled training and adversarial training data in network/cybersecurity domains is challenging and costly. Therefore, this letter introduces Adaptive Continuous Adversarial Training (ACAT), a method that integrates adversarial training samples into the model during continuous learning sessions using real-world detected adversarial data. Experimental results with a SPAM detection dataset demonstrate that ACAT reduces the time required for adversarial sample detection compared to traditional processes. Moreover, the accuracy of the under-attack ML-based SPAM filter increased from 69% to over 88% after just three retraining sessions.</description>
