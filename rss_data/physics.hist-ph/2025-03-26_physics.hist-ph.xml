      <title>The Great Rift in Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is commonly remarked that contemporary physics faces a challenge in reconciling quantum theory with Relativity, specifically General Relativity as a theory of gravity. But "challenge" is too mild a descriptor. Once one understands both what John Bell proved and what Einstein himself demanded of Relativity it becomes clear that the predictions of quantum theory, predictions that have been verified in the lab, are flatly incompatible with what Einstein wanted and built into General Relativity. There is not merely a tension but an incompatibility between the predictions of quantum theory and Relativity, and what has to give way is the Relativistic account of space-time structure and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals of Stars II: Revisiting Bolometric Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development line of bolometric corrections within the brief history of photometry was described from the perspective of the Kuhnian philosophy of science. The luminous efficiency and heat index were two previous concepts to imply visual and bolometric brightness difference of a star, which was mainly suggested and used as auxiliary tools for calibrating stellar temperature scales before the term ``bolometric correction'' (BC) was also introduced for the same purpose by Kuiper in 1938, as $BC = M_{\rm bol} - M_{\rm V} = m_{\rm {bol}} - V$. Despite its ill-posed nature imposing no zero-point constant ($C_2=0$) for the BC scale and $L_{\rm V} = L \times 10^{BC/2.5}$, if $BC&gt;0$, $L_{\rm V}$ is unphysical, for the luminosity of a star from which ``BC of a star must always be negative,'' ``the bolometric magnitude of a star ought to be brighter than its $V$-magnitude,'' and ``the zero point of bolometric corrections are arbitrary'' (paradigms) were extracted. The newest of the first three definitions of BC was accepted and used throughout the century. Therefore, the part of the development line of BC before Kuiper could be considered a prescience period. The rest could be named the normal science period in which astrophysicists work under the three paradigms. The rise of BC as a concept, how the ill-posed definition BC emerged/used, how inconsistencies (paradigms) of BC developed, and how the Resolution B2 of the General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union imposing $C_{\rm bol} = 71.197\,425\,\ldots$ mag, and $C_2&gt;0$, for the zero-point constants of the $M_{\rm {Bol}}$ and BC scales resolve the long-lasting problems were discussed. Generalized new definition of BC implying $L_{\rm V}=L \times 10^\frac{({\rm BC}-C_2)}{2.5}$ were given to replace $L = L_{\rm V} \times 10^{BC/2.5}$.</description>

      <title>Feynman 1947 letter on path integral for the Dirac equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1947, four months before the famous Shelter Island conference, Richard Feynman wrote a lengthy letter to his former MIT classmate Theodore Welton, reporting on his efforts to develop a path integral describing the propagation of a Dirac particle. While these efforts never came to fruition, and were shortly abandoned in favor of a very different method of dealing with the electron propagator appearing in in QED, the letter is interesting both from the historical viewpoint of revealing what Feynman was thinking about during that period just before the development of QED, and for its scientific ideas. It also contains at the end some philosophical remarks, which Feynman wraps up with the comment, ``Well enough for the baloney.'' In this article I present a transcription of the letter along with editorial notes, and a facsimile of the original handwritten document. I also briefly comment on Feynman's efforts and discuss their relation to some later work.</description>

      <title>Copenhagen Survey on Black Holes and Fundamental Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this survey is to take a snapshot of the attitudes of physicists working on some of the most pressing questions in modern physics, which may be useful to sociologists and historians of science. For this study, a total of 85 completed surveys were returned out of 151 registered participants of the ``Black holes Inside and out'' conference, held in Copenhagen in 2024. The survey asked questions about some of the most contentious issues in fundamental physics, including the nature of black holes and dark energy. A number of surprising results were found. For example, some of the leading frameworks, such as the cosmological constant, cosmic inflation, or string theory - while most popular - gain less than the majority of votes from the participants. The only statement that gains majority approval (by 68\% of participants) was that the Big Bang meant ``the universe evolved from a hot dense state'', not ``an absolute beginning time''. These results provide reasons for caution in describing ideas as consensus in the scientific community when a more nuanced view may be justified.</description>
