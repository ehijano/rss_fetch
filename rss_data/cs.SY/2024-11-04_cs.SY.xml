      <title>Learning Optimal Interaction Weights in Multi-Agents Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a spatio-temporal inverse optimal control framework for understanding interactions in multi-agent systems (MAS). We employ a graph representation approach and model the dynamics of interactions between agents as state-dependent edge weights in a consensus algorithm, incorporating both spatial and temporal dynamics. Our method learns these edge weights from trajectory observations, such as provided by expert demonstrations, which allows us to capture the complexity of nonlinear, distributed interaction behaviors. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimality of these interaction weights, explaining how the network topology affects MAS coordination. The proposed method is demonstrated on a multi-agent formation control problem, where we show its effectiveness in recovering the interaction weights and coordination patterns from sample trajectory data.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Reformulation Based System Identification for Periodically Time-varying Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses a system identification for linear periodically time-varying plants in the discrete-time setting. A system identification algorithm for linear, periodically time-varying plants is introduced based on a cyclic reformulation and a state coordinate transformation of the cycled system. By using our system identification algorithm, the high-accuracy model of the periodically time-varying plant can be obtained without using specific periodic input signals. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated with numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Coherent Hierarchical Probabilistic Forecasting of Electric Vehicle Charging Demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) significantly changes typical load curves in smart grids. With the development of fast charging technology, the volatility of EV charging demand is increasing, which requires additional flexibility for real-time power balance. The forecasting of EV charging demand involves probabilistic modeling of high dimensional time series dynamics across diverse electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs). This paper studies the forecasting problem of multiple EVCS in a hierarchical probabilistic manner. For each charging station, a deep learning model based on a partial input convex neural network (PICNN) is trained to predict the day-ahead charging demand's conditional distribution, preventing the common quantile crossing problem in traditional quantile regression models. Then, differentiable convex optimization layers (DCLs) are used to reconcile the scenarios sampled from the distributions to yield coherent scenarios that satisfy the hierarchical constraint. It learns a better weight matrix for adjusting the forecasting results of different targets in a machine-learning approach compared to traditional optimization-based hierarchical reconciling methods. Numerical experiments based on real-world EV charging data are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Closed-Loop Stability of a Lyapunov-Based Switching Attitude Controller for Energy-Efficient Torque-Input-Selection During Flight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new Lyapunov-based switching attitude controller for energy-efficient real-time selection of the torque inputted to an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) during flight. The proposed method, using quaternions to describe the attitude of the controlled UAV, interchanges the stability properties of the two fixed points-one locally asymptotically stable and another unstable-of the resulting closed-loop (CL) switching dynamics of the system. In this approach, the switching events are triggered by the value of a compound energy-based function. To analyze and ensure the stability of the CL switching dynamics, we use classical nonlinear Lyapunov techniques, in combination with switching-systems theory. For this purpose, we introduce a new compound Lyapunov function (LF) that not only enables us to derive the conditions for CL asymptotic and exponential stability, but also provides us with an estimate of the CL system's region of attraction. This new estimate is considerably larger than those previously reported for systems of the type considered in this paper. To test and demonstrate the functionality, suitability, and performance of the proposed method, we present and discuss experimental data obtained using a 31-g quadrotor during the execution of high-speed yaw-tracking maneuvers. Also, we provide empirical evidence indicating that all the initial conditions chosen for these maneuvers, as estimated, lie inside the system's region of attraction. Last, experimental data obtained through these flight tests show that the proposed switching controller reduces the control effort by about 53%, on average, with respect to that corresponding to a commonly used benchmark control scheme, when executing a particular type of high-speed yaw-tracking maneuvers.</description>

      <title>Weighted Null Space Fitting (WNSF): A Link between The Prediction Error Method and Subspace Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subspace identification method (SIM) has been proven to be very useful and numerically robust for estimating state-space models. However, it is in general not believed to be as accurate as the prediction error method (PEM). Conversely, PEM, although more accurate, comes with non-convex optimization problems and requires local non-linear optimization algorithms and good initialization points. This contribution proposes a weighted null space fitting (WNSF) method to identify a state-space model, combining some advantages of the two mainstream approaches aforementioned. It starts with the estimate of a non-parametric model using least-squares, and then the reduction to a state-space model in the observer canonical form is a multi-step least-squares procedure where each step consists of the solution of a quadratic optimization problem. Unlike SIM, which focuses on the range space of the extended observability matrix, WNSF estimates its null space, avoiding the need for singular value decomposition. Moreover, the statistically optimal weighting for the null space fitting problem is derived. It is conjectured that WNSF is asymptotically efficient, which is supported by a simulation study.</description>

      <title>Constraint-Driven Multi-USV Coverage Path Generation for Aquatic Environmental Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we address aquatic environmental monitoring using a fleet of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). Specifically, we develop an online path generator that provides either of circular or elliptic paths based on the real-time feedback so that the USVs efficiently sample the sensor data over given aquatic environment. To this end, we begin by formulating a novel online path generation problem for a group of Dubins vehicles in the form of cost minimization based on the formulation of persistent coverage control. We then transform the cost minimization into a constraint-based specification so that a prescribed performance level is certified. An online coverage path generator is then designed based on the so-called constraint-based control in order to meet the performance certificate together with additional constraints inherent in the parameters that specify the paths. It is also shown there that the present constraint-based approach allows one to drastically reduce the computational complexity stemming from combinations of binary variables corresponding to the turning directions of the USVs. The present coverage path generator is finally demonstrated through simulations and experiments on an original testbed of multiple USVs.</description>

      <title>Identification of Analytic Nonlinear Dynamical Systems with Non-asymptotic Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the system identification of an important class of nonlinear systems: linearly parameterized nonlinear systems, which enjoys wide applications in robotics and other mechanical systems. We consider two system identification methods: least-squares estimation (LSE), which is a point estimation method; and set-membership estimation (SME), which estimates an uncertainty set that contains the true parameters. We provide non-asymptotic convergence rates for LSE and SME under i.i.d. control inputs and control policies with i.i.d. random perturbations, both of which are considered as non-active-exploration inputs. Compared with the counter-example based on piecewise-affine systems in the literature, the success of non-active exploration in our setting relies on a key assumption on the system dynamics: we require the system functions to be real-analytic. Our results, together with the piecewise-affine counter-example, reveal the importance of differentiability in nonlinear system identification through non-active exploration. Lastly, we numerically compare our theoretical bounds with the empirical performance of LSE and SME on a pendulum example and a quadrotor example.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Contouring Control with Barrier and Lyapunov Functions for Stable Path-Following in UAV systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel method that integrates Nonlinear Model Predictive Contour Control (NMPCC) with an Exponentially Stabilizing Control Lyapunov Function (ES-CLF) and Exponential Higher-Order Control Barrier Functions to achieve stable path-following and obstacle avoidance in UAV systems. This framework enables unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to safely navigate around both static and dynamic obstacles while strictly adhering to desired paths. The quaternion-based formulation ensures precise orientation and attitude control, while a robust optimization solver enforces the constraints imposed by the Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) and Control Barrier Functions (CBF), ensuring reliable real-time performance. The method was validated in a Model-in-the-Loop (MiL) environment, demonstrating effective path tracking and obstacle avoidance. The results highlight the framework's ability to minimize both orthogonal and tangential errors, ensuring stability and safety in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Set-Theoretic Direct Data-driven Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing the terminal ingredients of direct data-driven predictive control presents challenges due to its reliance on an implicit, non-minimal input-output data-driven representation. By considering the class of constrained LTI systems with unknown time delays, we propose a set-theoretic direct data-driven predictive controller that does not require a terminal cost to provide closed-loop guarantees. In particular, first, starting from input/output data series, we propose a sample-based method to build N-step input output backward reachable sets. Then, we leverage the constructed family of backward reachable sets to derive a data-driven control law. The proposed method guarantees finite-time convergence and recursive feasibility, independent of objective function tuning. It requires neither explicit state estimation nor an explicit prediction model, relying solely on input-output measurements; therefore, unmodeled dynamics can be avoided. Finally, a numerical example highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method in stabilizing the system, whereas direct data-driven predictive control without terminal ingredients fails under the same conditions.</description>

      <title>First, Learn What You Don't Know: Active Information Gathering for Driving at the Limits of Handling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combining data-driven models that adapt online and model predictive control (MPC) has enabled effective control of nonlinear systems. However, when deployed on unstable systems, online adaptation may not be fast enough to ensure reliable simultaneous learning and control. For example, controllers on a vehicle executing highly dynamic maneuvers may push the tires to their friction limits, destabilizing the vehicle and allowing modeling errors to quickly compound and cause a loss of control. In this work, we present a Bayesian meta-learning MPC framework. We propose an expressive vehicle dynamics model that leverages Bayesian last-layer meta-learning to enable rapid online adaptation. The model's uncertainty estimates are used to guide informative data collection and quickly improve the model prior to deployment. Experiments on a Toyota Supra show that (i) the framework enables reliable control in dynamic drifting maneuvers, (ii) online adaptation alone may not suffice for zero-shot control of a vehicle at the edge of stability, and (iii) active data collection helps achieve reliable performance.</description>

      <title>An Improved Rapidly Exploring Random Tree Algorithm for Path Planning in Configuration Spaces with Narrow Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithms have been applied successfully to challenging robot motion planning and under-actuated nonlinear control problems. However a fundamental limitation of the RRT approach is the slow convergence in configuration spaces with narrow channels because of the small probability of generating test points inside narrow channels. This paper presents an improved RRT algorithm that takes advantage of narrow channels between the initial and goal states to find shorter paths by improving the exploration of narrow regions in the configuration space. The proposed algorithm detects the presence of narrow channel by checking for collision of neighborhood points with the infeasible set and attempts to add points within narrow channels with a predetermined bias. This approach is compared with the classical RRT and its variants on a variety of benchmark planning problems. Simulation results indicate that the algorithm presented in this paper computes a significantly shorter path in spaces with narrow channels.</description>

      <title>Multi-Uncertainty Aware Autonomous Cooperative Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous cooperative planning (ACP) is a promising technique to improve the efficiency and safety of multi-vehicle interactions for future intelligent transportation systems. However, realizing robust ACP is a challenge due to the aggregation of perception, motion, and communication uncertainties. This paper proposes a novel multi-uncertainty aware ACP (MUACP) framework that simultaneously accounts for multiple types of uncertainties via regularized cooperative model predictive control (RC-MPC). The regularizers and constraints for perception, motion, and communication are constructed according to the confidence levels, weather conditions, and outage probabilities, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated in the Car Learning to Act (CARLA) simulation platform. Results demonstrate that the proposed MUACP efficiently performs cooperative formation in real time and outperforms other benchmark approaches in various scenarios under imperfect knowledge of the environment.</description>

      <title>A KAN-based Interpretable Framework for Process-Informed Prediction of Global Warming Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of Global Warming Potential (GWP) is essential for assessing the environmental impact of chemical processes and materials. Traditional GWP prediction models rely predominantly on molecular structure, overlooking critical process-related information. In this study, we present an integrative GWP prediction model that combines molecular descriptors (MACCS keys and Mordred descriptors) with process information (process title, description, and location) to improve predictive accuracy and interpretability. Using a deep neural network (DNN) model, we achieved an R-squared of 86% on test data with Mordred descriptors, process location, and description information, representing a 25% improvement over the previous benchmark of 61%; XAI analysis further highlighted the significant role of process title embeddings in enhancing model predictions. To enhance interpretability, we employed a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) to derive a symbolic formula for GWP prediction, capturing key molecular and process features and providing a transparent, interpretable alternative to black-box models, enabling users to gain insights into the molecular and process factors influencing GWP. Error analysis showed that the model performs reliably in densely populated data ranges, with increased uncertainty for higher GWP values. This analysis allows users to manage prediction uncertainty effectively, supporting data-driven decision-making in chemical and process design. Our results suggest that integrating both molecular and process-level information in GWP prediction models yields substantial gains in accuracy and interpretability, offering a valuable tool for sustainability assessments. Future work may extend this approach to additional environmental impact categories and refine the model to further enhance its predictive reliability.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Granularity Supervised Contrastive Framework for Remaining Useful Life Prediction of Aero-engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate remaining useful life (RUL) predictions are critical to the safe operation of aero-engines. Currently, the RUL prediction task is mainly a regression paradigm with only mean square error as the loss function and lacks research on feature space structure, the latter of which has shown excellent performance in a large number of studies. This paper develops a multi-granularity supervised contrastive (MGSC) framework from plain intuition that samples with the same RUL label should be aligned in the feature space, and address the problems of too large minibatch size and unbalanced samples in the implementation. The RUL prediction with MGSC is implemented on using the proposed multi-phase training strategy. This paper also demonstrates a simple and scalable basic network structure and validates the proposed MGSC strategy on the CMPASS dataset using a convolutional long short-term memory network as a baseline, which effectively improves the accuracy of RUL prediction.</description>

      <title>An exact column generation algorithm for load balancing in capacity sharing networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Capacity sharing networks are typical heterogeneous communication networks widely applied in information and communications technology (ICT) field. In such networks, resources like bandwidth, spectrum, computation and storage are shared among various communication services. Meanwhile, the issue of network congestion is always a prominent challenge. To handle network congestion essentially needs to solve the load balancing of networks. In this paper, for capacity sharing networks, we formulate their load balancing problem as a maximum multi-commodity flow problem. For such a problem, always a large-scale linear programming, the column generation algorithm is a commonly used and crucial method to solve it. In each iteration, this algorithm involves solving a linear programming subproblem and determining whether to terminate or generate a new column for inclusion in the subproblem. This iterative procedure of solving and checking continues throughout the algorithm. Nevertheless, since the checking subproblem is NP-hard, its solution significantly impacts the overall efficiency of the algorithm. In this paper, we innovatively convert the checking subproblem into a single-constrained shortest path (SCSP) subproblem. By exactly solving the SCSP subproblem, we can obtain the optimal solution to the checking subproblem with same or less computing time. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves computational efficiency comparable to heuristic algorithms while outperforming other state-of-the-art algorithms by at least an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Incentive-based Platoon Formation: Optimizing the Personal Benefit for Drivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Platooning or cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) has been investigated for decades, but debate about its lasting impact is still ongoing. Even though platooning benefits and platoon formation are rather well understood for trucks, this is less clear for passenger cars, which have a higher heterogeneity in trips and drivers' preferences. Most importantly, it remains unclear how to form platoons of passenger cars in order to optimize the personal benefit for the individual driver. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel platoon formation algorithm that optimizes the personal benefit for drivers of individual passenger cars. For computing vehicle-to-platoon assignments, the algorithm utilizes a new metric that we propose to evaluate the personal benefits of various driving systems, including platooning. By combining fuel and travel time costs into a single monetary value, drivers can estimate overall trip costs according to a personal monetary value for time spent. This provides an intuitive way for drivers to understand and compare the benefits of driving systems like human driving, adaptive cruise control (ACC), and, of course, platooning. Unlike previous similarity-based methods, our proposed algorithm forms platoons only when beneficial for the driver, rather than for the sake of platooning only. Results of a large-scale simulation study demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms normal ACC as well as previous similarity-based platooning approaches by balancing fuel savings and travel time, independent of traffic and drivers' time cost.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Cache Content Placement in Integrated Terrestrial and Non-terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-terrestrial networks (NTN) have emerged as a transformative solution to bridge the digital divide and deliver essential services to remote and underserved areas. In this context, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations offer remarkable potential for efficient cache content broadcast in remote regions, thereby extending the reach of digital services. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to optimize wireless edge content placement using NTN. Despite wide coverage, the varying NTN transmission capabilities must be carefully aligned with each content placement to maximize broadcast efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to optimize wireless edge content placement using NTN, positioning NTN as a complement to TN for achieving optimal content broadcasting. Specifically, we dynamically select content for placement via NTN links. This selection is based on popularity and suitability for delivery through NTN, while considering the orbital motion of LEO satellites. Our system-level case studies, based on a practical LEO constellation, demonstrate the significant improvement in placement speed compared to existing methods, which neglect network mobility. We also demonstrate that NTN links significantly outperform standalone wireless TN solutions, particularly in the early stages of content delivery. This advantage is amplified when there is a higher correlation of content popularity across geographical regions.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Information Freshness: An AoI Optimized Markov Decision Process Dedicated In the Underwater Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02424v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ocean exploration utilizing autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) via reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a significant research focus. However, underwater tasks have mostly failed due to the observation delay caused by acoustic communication in the Internet of underwater things. In this study, we present an AoI optimized Markov decision process (AoI-MDP) to improve the performance of underwater tasks. Specifically, AoI-MDP models observation delay as signal delay through statistical signal processing, and includes this delay as a new component in the state space. Additionally, we introduce wait time in the action space, and integrate AoI with reward functions to achieve joint optimization of information freshness and decision-making for AUVs leveraging RL for training. Finally, we apply this approach to the multi-AUV data collection task scenario as an example. Simulation results highlight the feasibility of AoI-MDP, which effectively minimizes AoI while showcasing superior performance in the task. To accelerate relevant research in this field, we have made the simulation codes available as open-source.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Autonomous Driving Safety Analysis with Generative AI: A Comparative Study on Automated Hazard and Risk Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of autonomous driving technology has accentuated the need for comprehensive hazard analysis and risk assessment (HARA) to ensure the safety and reliability of vehicular systems. Traditional HARA processes, while meticulous, are inherently time-consuming and subject to human error, necessitating a transformative approach to fortify safety engineering. This paper presents an integrative application of generative artificial intelligence (AI) as a means to enhance HARA in autonomous driving safety analysis. Generative AI, renowned for its predictive modeling and data generation capabilities, is leveraged to automate the labor-intensive elements of HARA, thus expediting the process and augmenting the thoroughness of the safety analyses. Through empirical research, the study contrasts conventional HARA practices conducted by safety experts with those supplemented by generative AI tools. The benchmark comparisons focus on critical metrics such as analysis time, error rates, and scope of risk identification. By employing generative AI, the research demonstrates a significant upturn in efficiency, evidenced by reduced timeframes and expanded analytical coverage. The AI-augmented processes also deliver enhanced brainstorming support, stimulating creative problem-solving and identifying previously unrecognized risk factors.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Online Regularized Learning Over Random Time-Varying Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.03861v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the decentralized online regularized linear regression algorithm over random time-varying graphs. At each time step, every node runs an online estimation algorithm consisting of an innovation term processing its own new measurement, a consensus term taking a weighted sum of estimations of its own and its neighbors with additive and multiplicative communication noises and a regularization term preventing over-fitting. It is not required that the regression matrices and graphs satisfy special statistical assumptions such as mutual independence, spatio-temporal independence or stationarity. We develop the nonnegative supermartingale inequality of the estimation error, and prove that the estimations of all nodes converge to the unknown true parameter vector almost surely if the algorithm gains, graphs and regression matrices jointly satisfy the sample path spatio-temporal persistence of excitation condition. Especially, this condition holds by choosing appropriate algorithm gains if the graphs are uniformly conditionally jointly connected and conditionally balanced, and the regression models of all nodes are uniformly conditionally spatio-temporally jointly observable, under which the algorithm converges in mean square and almost surely. In addition, we prove that the regret upper bound is $O(T^{1-\tau}\ln T)$, where $\tau\in (0.5,1)$ is a constant depending on the algorithm gains.</description>

      <title>PowerGraph: A power grid benchmark dataset for graph neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02827v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Power grids are critical infrastructures of paramount importance to modern society and, therefore, engineered to operate under diverse conditions and failures. The ongoing energy transition poses new challenges for the decision-makers and system operators. Therefore, developing grid analysis algorithms is important for supporting reliable operations. These key tools include power flow analysis and system security analysis, both needed for effective operational and strategic planning. The literature review shows a growing trend of machine learning (ML) models that perform these analyses effectively. In particular, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) stand out in such applications because of the graph-based structure of power grids. However, there is a lack of publicly available graph datasets for training and benchmarking ML models in electrical power grid applications. First, we present PowerGraph, which comprises GNN-tailored datasets for i) power flows, ii) optimal power flows, and iii) cascading failure analyses of power grids. Second, we provide ground-truth explanations for the cascading failure analysis. Finally, we perform a complete benchmarking of GNN methods for node-level and graph-level tasks and explainability. Overall, PowerGraph is a multifaceted GNN dataset for diverse tasks that includes power flow and fault scenarios with real-world explanations, providing a valuable resource for developing improved GNN models for node-level, graph-level tasks and explainability methods in power system modeling. The dataset is available at https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/PowerGraph/22820534 and the code at https://github.com/PowerGraph-Datasets.</description>

      <title>B-ISAC: Backscatter Integrated Sensing and Communication for IoE Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of backscatter communication (BackCom) technology with integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology not only enhances the system sensing performance, but also enables low-power information transmission. This is expected to provide a new paradigm for communication and sensing in internet of everything (IoE) applications. In this paper, we propose a novel cognitive wireless system called backscatter-ISAC (B-ISAC) and develop a joint beamforming framework for different stages (task modes). This system can achieve cognitive spectrum sharing between legacy communication, backscatter communication and sensing functions. We derive communication performance metrics of the system in terms of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and communication rate, and derive sensing performance metrics of the system in terms of probability of detection, error of linear least squares (LS) estimation, and the error of linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimation. The proposed joint beamforming framework consists of three stages: tag detection, tag estimation, and communication enhancement. We develop corresponding joint beamforming schemes aimed at enhancing the performance objectives of their respective stages by solving complex non-convex optimization problems. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed joint beamforming schemes. The proposed B-ISAC system has broad application prospect in next generation IoE scenarios.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models as Efficient Reward Function Searchers for Custom-Environment Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02428v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving the effective design and improvement of reward functions in reinforcement learning (RL) tasks with complex custom environments and multiple requirements presents considerable challenges. In this paper, we propose ERFSL, an efficient reward function searcher using LLMs, which enables LLMs to be effective white-box searchers and highlights their advanced semantic understanding capabilities. Specifically, we generate reward components for each numerically explicit user requirement and employ a reward critic to identify the correct code form. Then, LLMs assign weights to the reward components to balance their values and iteratively adjust the weights without ambiguity and redundant adjustments by flexibly adopting directional mutation and crossover strategies, similar to genetic algorithms, based on the context provided by the training log analyzer. We applied the framework to an underwater data collection RL task without direct human feedback or reward examples (zero-shot learning). The reward critic successfully corrects the reward code with only one feedback instance for each requirement, effectively preventing unrectifiable errors. The initialization of weights enables the acquisition of different reward functions within the Pareto solution set without the need for weight search. Even in cases where a weight is 500 times off, on average, only 5.2 iterations are needed to meet user requirements. The ERFSL also works well with most prompts utilizing GPT-4o mini, as we decompose the weight searching process to reduce the requirement for numerical and long-context understanding capabilities</description>

      <title>Optimal Attitude Control of Large Flexible Space Structures with Distributed Momentum Actuators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent spacecraft mission concepts propose larger payloads that have lighter, less rigid structures. For large lightweight structures, the natural frequencies of their vibration modes may fall within the attitude controller bandwidth, threatening the stability and settling time of the controller and compromising performance. This work tackles this issue by proposing an attitude control design paradigm of distributing momentum actuators throughout the structure to have more control authority over vibration modes. The issue of jitter disturbances introduced by these actuators is addressed by expanding the bandwidth of the attitude controller to suppress excess vibrations. Numerical simulation results show that, at the expense of more control action, a distributed configuration can achieve lower settling times and reduce structural deformation compared to a more standard centralized configuration.</description>

      <title>LucidGrasp: Robotic Framework for Autonomous Manipulation of Laboratory Equipment with Different Degrees of Transparency via 6D Pose Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07801v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many modern robotic systems operate autonomously, however they often lack the ability to accurately analyze the environment and adapt to changing external conditions, while teleoperation systems often require special operator skills. In the field of laboratory automation, the number of automated processes is growing, however such systems are usually developed to perform specific tasks. In addition, many of the objects used in this field are transparent, making it difficult to analyze them using visual channels. The contributions of this work include the development of a robotic framework with autonomous mode for manipulating liquid-filled objects with different degrees of transparency in complex pose combinations. The conducted experiments demonstrated the robustness of the designed visual perception system to accurately estimate object poses for autonomous manipulation, and confirmed the performance of the algorithms in dexterous operations such as liquid dispensing. The proposed robotic framework can be applied for laboratory automation, since it allows solving the problem of performing non-trivial manipulation tasks with the analysis of object poses of varying degrees of transparency and liquid levels, requiring high accuracy and repeatability.</description>

      <title>Tiny Learning-Based MPC for Multirotors: Solver-Aware Learning for Efficient Embedded Predictive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tiny aerial robots show promise for applications like environmental monitoring and search-and-rescue but face challenges in control due to their limited computing power and complex dynamics. Model Predictive Control (MPC) can achieve agile trajectory tracking and handle constraints. Although current learning-based MPC methods, such as Gaussian Process (GP) MPC, improve control performance by learning residual dynamics, they are computationally demanding, limiting their onboard application on tiny robots. This paper introduces Tiny Learning-Based Model Predictive Control (LB MPC), a novel framework for resource-constrained micro multirotor platforms. By exploiting multirotor dynamics' structure and developing an efficient solver, our approach enables high-rate control at 100 Hz on a Crazyflie 2.1 with a Teensy 4.0 microcontroller. We demonstrate a 23% average improvement in tracking performance over existing embedded MPC methods, achieving the first onboard implementation of learning-based MPC on a tiny multirotor (53 g).</description>
