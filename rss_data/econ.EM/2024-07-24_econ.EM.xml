      <title>Estimating Distributional Treatment Effects in Randomized Experiments: Machine Learning for Variance Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel regression adjustment method designed for estimating distributional treatment effect parameters in randomized experiments. Randomized experiments have been extensively used to estimate treatment effects in various scientific fields. However, to gain deeper insights, it is essential to estimate distributional treatment effects rather than relying solely on average effects. Our approach incorporates pre-treatment covariates into a distributional regression framework, utilizing machine learning techniques to improve the precision of distributional treatment effect estimators. The proposed approach can be readily implemented with off-the-shelf machine learning methods and remains valid as long as the nuisance components are reasonably well estimated. Also, we establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator and present a uniformly valid inference method. Through simulation results and real data analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating machine learning techniques in reducing the variance of distributional treatment effect estimators in finite samples.</description>

      <title>Bayesian modelling of VAR precision matrices using stochastic block networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commonly used priors for Vector Autoregressions (VARs) induce shrinkage on the autoregressive coefficients. Introducing shrinkage on the error covariance matrix is sometimes done but, in the vast majority of cases, without considering the network structure of the shocks and by placing the prior on the lower Cholesky factor of the precision matrix. In this paper, we propose a prior on the VAR error precision matrix directly. Our prior, which resembles a standard spike and slab prior, models variable inclusion probabilities through a stochastic block model that clusters shocks into groups. Within groups, the probability of having relations across group members is higher (inducing less sparsity) whereas relations across groups imply a lower probability that members of each group are conditionally related. We show in simulations that our approach recovers the true network structure well. Using a US macroeconomic data set, we illustrate how our approach can be used to cluster shocks together and that this feature leads to improved density forecasts.</description>

      <title>Testing Forecast Rationality for Measures of Central Tendency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12545</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.12545v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rational respondents to economic surveys may report as a point forecast any measure of the central tendency of their (possibly latent) predictive distribution, for example the mean, median, mode, or any convex combination thereof. We propose tests of forecast rationality when the measure of central tendency used by the respondent is unknown. We overcome an identification problem that arises when the measures of central tendency are equal or in a local neighborhood of each other, as is the case for (exactly or nearly) symmetric distributions. As a building block, we also present novel tests for the rationality of mode forecasts. We apply our tests to income forecasts from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Survey of Consumer Expectations. We find these forecasts are rationalizable as mode forecasts, but not as mean or median forecasts. We also find heterogeneity in the measure of centrality used by respondents when stratifying the sample by past income, age, job stability, and survey experience.</description>

      <title>Robust Permutation Tests in Linear Instrumental Variables Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.13774v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops permutation versions of identification-robust tests in linear instrumental variables (IV) regression. Unlike the existing randomization and rank-based tests in which independence between the instruments and the error terms is assumed, the permutation Anderson- Rubin (AR), Lagrange Multiplier (LM) and Conditional Likelihood Ratio (CLR) tests are asymptotically similar and robust to conditional heteroskedasticity under standard exclusion restriction i.e. the orthogonality between the instruments and the error terms. Moreover, when the instruments are independent of the structural error term, the permutation AR tests are exact, hence robust to heavy tails. As such, these tests share the strengths of the rank-based tests and the wild bootstrap AR tests. Numerical illustrations corroborate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Instrumented Difference-in-Differences with Heterogeneous Treatment Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12083v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many studies exploit variation in the timing of policy adoption across units as an instrument for treatment. This paper formalizes the underlying identification strategy as an instrumented difference-in-differences (DID-IV). In this design, a Wald-DID estimand, which scales the DID estimand of the outcome by the DID estimand of the treatment, captures the local average treatment effect on the treated (LATET). In contrast to Fuzzy DID design considered in de Chaisemartin and D'Haultfoeuille (2018), our DID-IV design does not ex ante require strong restrictions on treatment adoption behavior across units. Additionally, our target parameter, the LATET, is policy-relevant if the instrument is based on the policy change of interest to the researcher. We extend the canonical DID-IV design to multiple period settings with the staggered adoption of the instrument across units, calling it a staggered DID-IV design, and propose an estimation method that is robust to treatment effect heterogeneity. We illustrate our findings in the setting of Oreopoulos (2006), estimating returns to schooling in the United Kingdom. In this application, the two-way fixed effects instrumental variable regression, which is the conventional approach to implement a staggered DID-IV design, yields a negative estimate, whereas our estimation method indicates a substantial gain from schooling.</description>
