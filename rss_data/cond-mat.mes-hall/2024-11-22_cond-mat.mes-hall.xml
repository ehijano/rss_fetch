      <title>Edge thermal current of the topological insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a systematic approach to calculate the contribution of edge states to the thermal Hall conductivity and energy magnetization. A two-dimensional topological insulator in equilibrium at a finite temperature is analyzed in the presence of a static gravitational field, which mimics the variations in the temperature distribution. From this model, an effective boundary free energy functional for the gravitational field is derived. Our analysis reveals that, unlike in the case of massive Dirac fermions, the addition of the Newtonian mass term in the topological insulator model significantly modifies the quantum anomalous behavior of the boundary states, leading to a non-zero bulk thermal current. This additional contribution violates the Wiedemann-Franz law.</description>

      <title>Friedel oscillations in one-dimensional 4He</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-dimensional bosonic systems, such as helium confined to nanopores, exhibit Luttinger liquid behavior characterized by density waves as collective excitations. We investigate the impact of a scattering potential on a low dimensional quantum liquid. We consider a microscopic model of $^4$He inside a perturbed nanopore with a localized constriction, and employ quantum Monte Carlo simulations to analyze the density of the core within an effective low-energy framework. Our results reveal the emergence of Friedel oscillations in a bosonic quantum liquid without a Fermi surface. Furthermore, we utilize the Luttinger liquid model to predict experimentally observable signatures of this pinning phenomena in elastic scattering and via the temperature and pressure dependence of mass transport through the deformed nanopore.</description>

      <title>Robust coherent dynamics of homogeneously limited anisotropic excitons in two-dimensional layered ReS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of in-plane anisotropic excitons in two-dimensional layered semiconductors enables state-of-the-art nanophotonic applications. A fundamental yet unknown parameter of these quasiparticles is the coherence time (T_2 ), which governs the quantum dephasing timescale, over which the coherent superposition of excitons can be maintained and manipulated. Here, we report the direct measurement of T_2 within the sub-picosecond range, along with multiple population decay timescales (T_1 ) at resonance for anisotropic excitons in pristine layered rhenium disulfide (ReS2). We observe a notable weak dependence on layer thickness for T_2 , and a quasi-independence for T_1 . The excitonic coherence in few-layer ReS2 exhibits exceptional robustness against optical density and temperature compared to other two-dimensional semiconductors, enabling quantum features even at room temperature. No photon echo fingerprints were observed in pristine ReS2, highlighting the homogeneous character of the anisotropic excitonic transitions and a particularly low level of disorder in exfoliated flakes. Lastly, our results for mono- to bulk-like ReS2 support a direct gap band structure regardless their layer thickness, addressing the ongoing discussion about its nature.</description>

      <title>Switchable Non-Hermitian Skin Effect in Bogoliubov Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interacting or nonlinear lattices can host emergent particle-like modes, such as Bogoliubov quasiparticles, whose band topology and other properties are potentially highly tunable. Despite originating in the study of superconducting materials, Bogoliubov quasiparticles can also occur in synthetic metamaterials. Here, we implement a nonlinear driven-dissipative circuit whose fluctutations are Bogoliubov modes possessing nontrivial non-Hermitian band topology. We show experimentally that the system exhibits a switchable non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), which abruptly appears when the on-site driving voltage amplitude exceeds a threshold. In contrast to earlier realizations of the NHSE and related phenomena in circuit models, the switchable NHSE in our system occurs in Bogoliubov modes, which are strongly affected by how the system is driven. Moreover, unlike other experimental platforms hosting non-Hermitian Bogoliubov modes, our system does not contain unconventional asymmetric hopping nonlinearities, only a local Kerr-type nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Modeling the variability of memristive devices with hexagonal boron nitride as dielectric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variability in memristive devices based on h-BN dielectrics is studied in depth. Different numerical techniques to extract the reset voltage are described and the corresponding cycle-to-cycle variability is characterized by means of the coefficient of variance. The charge-flux domain was employed to develop one of the extraction techniques, the calculation of the integrals of current and voltage to obtain the charge and flux allows to minimize the effects of electric noise and the inherent stochasticity of resistive switching on the measurement data. A model to reproduce charge versus flux curves has been successfully employed. The device variability is also described by means of the time series analysis to assess the memory effect along a resistive switching series. Finally, we analyzed I-V curves under ramped voltage stress utilizing a simulator based on circuit breakers, the formation and rupture of the percolation paths that constitute the conductive nanofilaments is studied to describe the set and reset processes behind the resistive switching operation.</description>

      <title>A 2x2 quantum dot array in silicon with fully tuneable pairwise interdot coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in semiconductor spin qubits have achieved linear arrays exceeding ten qubits. Moving to two-dimensional (2D) qubit arrays is a critical next step to advance towards fault-tolerant implementations, but it poses substantial fabrication challenges, particularly because enabling control of nearest-neighbor entanglement requires the incorporation of interstitial exchange gates between quantum dots in the qubit architecture. In this work, we present a 2D array of silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) quantum dots with tunable interdot coupling between all adjacent dots. The device is characterized at 4.2 K, where we demonstrate the formation and isolation of double-dot and triple-dot configurations. We show control of all nearest-neighbor tunnel couplings spanning up to 30 decades per volt through the interstitial exchange gates and use advanced modeling tools to estimate the exchange interactions that could be realized among qubits in this architecture. These results represent a significant step towards the development of 2D MOS quantum processors compatible with foundry manufacturing techniques.</description>

      <title>Hybrid dielectrophoretic-optical trap for microparticles in aqueous suspension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a set of microfabricated electrodes can be coupled to a commercial optical tweezers device, implementing a hybrid electro-optical trap with multiple functionalities to manipulate micro/nanoparticles in suspension. Our design allows us to simultaneously trap tens of particles in a single potential well generated in the low electric field region of the electrode arrangement, taking advantage of negative dielectrophoresis. Together with the optical tweezers, we show that the hybrid scheme allows enhanced manipulation capabilities, including controlled loading and accumulation in the dielectrophoretic trap from the optical tweezers, selectivity, and tracking of the individual trajectories of trapped particles.</description>

      <title>Photon drag at the junction between metal and 2d semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon drag represents a mechanism of photocurrent generation wherein the electromagnetic (EM) field momentum is transferred directly to the charge carriers. It is believed to be small by the virtue of low photon momentum compared to the typical momenta of the charge carriers. Here, we show that photon drag becomes particularly strong at the junctions between metals and 2d materials, wherein highly non-uniform local EM fields are generated upon diffraction. To this end, we combine an exact theory of diffraction at 'metal-2d material' junctions with microscopic transport theory of photon drag, and derive the functional dependences of the respective photovoltage on the parameters of EM field and 2d system. The voltage responsivity appears inversely proportional to the electromagnetic frequency $\omega$, the sheet density of charge, and a dimensionless momentum transfer coefficient $\alpha$ which depends only on 2d conductivity in units of light speed $\eta = 2\pi \sigma/c$ and light polarization. For $p$-polarized incident light, the momentum transfer coefficient appears finite even for vanishingly small 2d conductivity $\eta$, which is a consequence of dynamic lightning rod effect. For $s$-polarized incident light, the momentum transfer coefficient scales as $\eta \ln \eta^{-1}$, which stems from long-range dipole radiation of a linear junction. A simple estimate shows that the ratio of thermoelectric and photon drag photovoltages at the junction for $p$-polarization is roughly $\omega\tau_\varepsilon$, where $\tau_\varepsilon$ is the energy relaxation time, while for $s$-polarization the photon drag always dominates over the thermoelectric effect.</description>

      <title>Promoting and imaging intervalley coherent order in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene on MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilayer rhombohedral graphene (RG) has recently emerged as a new, structurally simple flat-band system, which facilitates the exploration of interaction-driven correlation states with highly ordered electron arrangements. Despite a variety of many-body order behaviors observed in RG by transport measurements, the direct microscopic visualization of such correlated phases in real space is still lacking. Here, we show the discovery of a robust intervalley coherent order, a long-predicted ground state in RG, at 77 K in tetralayer RG placed on MoS2 via imaging atomic-scale spatial reconstruction of wave functions for correlated states. By using scanning tunnelling microscopy, we observe spectroscopic signatures of electronic correlations at partially filled flat bands, where distinct splitting appears. At ~60% and ~70% fillings of the flat bands, we visualize atomic-scale reconstruction patterns with a &lt;sqrt&gt;3 x &lt;sqrt&gt;3 supercell on graphene lattice at liquid nitrogen temperature, which indicates a robust intervalley coherent phase of the interacting electrons. The &lt;sqrt&gt;3 x &lt;sqrt&gt;3 pattern is observed in MoS2-supported RG, while it is absent in hBN-based ones under the same experimental conditions, suggesting the significant influence of spin-orbit proximity effect. Our results provide microscopic insights into the correlated phases in tetralayer RG and highlight the significant potential for realizing highly accessible collective phenomena through Van der Waals proximity.</description>

      <title>Current-induced brightening of vacancy-related emitters in hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform photoluminescence measurements on vacancy-related emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) that are notorious for their low quantum yields. The gating of these emitters via few-layer graphene electrodes reveals a reproducible, gate-dependent brightening of the emitter, which coincides with a change in the direction of the simultaneously measured leakage current across the hBN layers. At the same time, we observe that the relative increase of the brightening effect scales linearly with the intensity of the excitation laser. Both observations can be explained in terms of a photo-assisted electroluminescence effect. Interestingly, emitters can also show the opposite behavior, i.e. a decrease in emitter intensity that depends on the gate leakage current. We explain these two opposing behaviors with different concentrations of donor and acceptor states in the hBN and show that precise control of the doping of hBN is necessary to gain control over the brightness of vacancy-related emitters by electrical means. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of vacancy-related defects in hBN that is necessary to make use of their potential for quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Transition in Thermal Conductivity in Germanene Monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an anomalous temperature-induced transition in thermal conductivity in germanene monolayer around a critical temperature $T_c = 350 \, \text{K}$. Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations reveal a transition from $\kappa \sim T^{-2}$ scaling below $T_c$ to $\kappa \sim T^{-1/2}$ above, contrasting with conventional $\kappa \sim T^{-1}$ behavior. This anomalous scaling correlates with long-scale characteristics timescale $\tau_2$ obtained from double exponential fitting of heat current autocorrelation function. Phonon mode analysis using normal mode decomposition indicates that a redshift in TA phonons reduces the acoustic-optical phonon gap, enhancing the phonon-phonon scattering and driving the anomalous scaling behavior. Moreover, non equilibrium simulations find a convergent thermal conductivity of germanene with sample size, in agreement with mode coupling theory, owing to high scattering of ZA phonons due to the inherent buckling of germanene.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the first time the exact analytical expressions for the three-dimensional bound electron states in the Coulomb field of the chain consisting of positively charged ions, are obtained within the Dirac description, using the new spinor invariant found for this problem. It is demonstrated that within such approach the coupling between electron spin and its one-dimensional propagation along the chain naturally arise, without any need to include artificially into the equations the so-called spin-orbit interaction.</description>

      <title>Low-Field Regime of Magnon Transport in Yttrium Iron Garnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusive propagation of spin waves and their quanta - magnons - in the archetypal magnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet (YIG) is under a surge of research for low-power and low-loss data communication. However, operation under external magnetic fields reduces magnon diffusion length, attenuates the voltage amplitude at measurement terminals, and complicates the architecture of magnonic devices. Here, we explore the low-field and field-free regime of diffusive magnon transport in YIG films. We demonstrate that the field-induced suppression of magnon diffusion length can be fully inhibited only at the zero-field limit. Even a modest field of 10mT attenuates the non-local spin voltage by $\sim$ 20$\%$ in a transport channel of $\sim$ 1$\mu$m long. Using Stoner-Wohlfarth macrospin simulations, we reveal that an often overlooked, in-plane uniaxial anisotropy becomes the critical parameter governing the field-free operation of magnonic devices. We further demonstrate a tenfold enhancement in the effective field associated with the in-plane uniaxial anisotropy of YIG films at low temperatures - a key finding for field-free operation of magnonic devices under cryogenic conditions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Friction near the Instability Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop an analytical framework to understand quantum friction across distinct stability regimes, providing approximate expressions for frictional forces both in the deep stable regime and near the critical threshold of instability. Our primary finding is analytical proof that, near the instability threshold, the quantum friction force diverges logarithmically. This result, verified through numerical simulations, sheds light on the behavior of frictional instabilities as the system approaches criticality.
  Our findings offer new insights into the role of instabilities, critical divergence and temperature in frictional dynamics across quantum and classical regimes.</description>

      <title>Discovery of an Antiferromagnetic Topological Nodal-line Kondo Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The symbiosis of strong interactions, flat bands, topology and symmetry has led to the discovery of exotic phases of matter, including fractional Chern insulators, correlated moir\'e topological superconductors, and Dirac and Weyl semimetals. Correlated metals, such as those present in Kondo lattices, rely on the screening of local moments by a sea of non-magnetic conduction electrons. Here, we report on a unique topological Kondo lattice compound, CeCo2P2, where the Kondo effect - whose existence under the magnetic Co phase is protected by PT symmetry - coexists with antiferromagnetic order emerging from the flat bands associated with the Co atoms. Remarkably, this is the only known Kondo lattice compound where magnetic order occurs in non-heavy electrons, and puzzlingly, at a temperature significantly higher than that of the Kondo effect. Furthermore, at low temperatures, the emergence of the Kondo effect, in conjunction with a glide-mirror-z symmetry, results in a nodal line protected by bulk topology near the Fermi energy. These unusual properties, arising from the interplay between itinerant and correlated electrons from different constituent elements, lead to novel quantum phases beyond the celebrated topological Kondo insulators and Weyl Kondo semimetals. CeCo2P2 thus provides an ideal platform for investigating narrow bands, topology, magnetism, and the Kondo effect in strongly correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness in a Hartree-Fock model for graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene is a monolayer graphitic film where electrons behave like two-dimensional Dirac fermions without mass. Its study has attracted a wide interest in the domain of condensed matter physics. In particular, it represents an ideal system to test the comprehension of 2D massless relativistic particles in a laboratory, the Fermi velocity being $300$ times smaller than the speed of light. In this work, we present a global well-posedness result for graphene in the Hartree-Fock approximation. The model allows to describe the time evolution of graphene in the presence of external electric fields, such as those induced by local defects in the monolayer of carbon atoms. Our approach is based on a well established non-perturbative framework originating from the study of three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Ultrafast Spin-Valley Dynamics and Phonon-Mediated Charge Transfer in MoSe$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$ Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use helicity-resolved ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy to study spin-valley polarization dynamics in a vertically stacked MoSe$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$ heterostructure. The experimental findings reveal details of interlayer charge transfer on ultrafast timescales, showing that the spin-valley polarized state of photoexcited carriers is conserved during the charge transfer and formation of interlayer excitons. Our results confirm that phonon scattering mediates the interlayer charge transfer process, while a high phonon population at elevated temperatures causes a significant decrease in spin-valley selective charge transfer. Moreover, the experimental findings demonstrate the possibility that interlayer excitons and their spin-valley polarization can be probed in the optical response of intralayer excitons. These findings pave the way for ultrafast detection, control, and manipulation of spin-valley polarized excitons in transition metal dichalcogenide-based 2D heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an approach to quantize discrete networks (graphs with discrete edges). We introduce a new exact solution of discrete Schrodinger equation that is used to write the solution for quantum graphs. Formulation of the problem and derivation of secular equation for arbitrary quantum graphs is presented. Application of the approach for the star graph is demonstrated by obtaining eigenfunctions and eigenvalues explicitely. Practical application of the model in conducting polymers and branched molecular chains is discussed.</description>

      <title>Correlated Structural and Optical Characterization of Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) hosts quantum emitters that exhibit single-photon emission and spin-dependent fluorescence at room temperature. These features make hBN a promising platform for quantum sensing and photonics. Despite many investigations of their optical properties, the emitters' chemical structure remains unclear, as does the role of contamination at surfaces and interfaces in forming the emitters or modifying their properties. We prepare hBN samples that are compatible with both confocoal photoluminescence microscopy (PL) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and we use those techniques to investigate correlations between fluorescent emission, flake morphology, and surface residue. We find that the microscopy techniques themselves induce changes in hBN's optical activity and residue mophology: PL measurements induce photobleaching, whereas TEM measurements alter surface residue and emission characteristics. We also study the effects of common treatments $\unicode{x2014}$ annealing and oxygen plasma cleaning $\unicode{x2014}$ on the structure and optical activity of hBN. The results illustrate the power and importance of correlative studies to elucidate aspects of microscopic mechanisms that influence hBN's functionality as a host for quantum emitters and spin defects.</description>

      <title>Topologically invisible defects in chiral mirror lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the hallmark of topological insulators is having conductivity properties that are unaffected by the possible presence of defects. In this work, we go beyond backscattering immunity and obtain topological invisibility across defects or disorder. Using a combination of chiral and mirror symmetry, the transmission coefficient is guaranteed to be unity. Importantly, but no phase shift is induced making the defect completely invisible. Many lattices possess the chiral-mirror symmetry, and we choose to demonstrate the principle on an hexagonal lattice model with Kekule distortion displaying topological edge waves, and we show analytically and numerically that the transmission across symmetry preserving defects is unity. We then realize this lattice in an acoustic system, and confirm the invisibility with numerical experiments. We foresee that the versatility of our model will trigger new experiments to observe topological invisibility in various wave systems, such as photonics, cold atoms or elastic waves.</description>

Abstract: We investigate many-body topological and transport properties of a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) topological chain coupled to the quantum field of a cavity mode. The quantum conductance is determined via Green's function formalism in terms of the light-matter eigenstates calculated via exact diagonalization for a finite number of electrons. We show that the topology of the cavity-embedded many-electron system is described by a generalized electron-photon Zak marker. We reveal how the quantization of transport is modified by the cavity vacuum fields for a finite-size chain and how it is impacted by electronic disorder. Moreover, we show that electron-photon entanglement produces dramatic differences with respect to the predictions of mean-field theory, which strongly underestimates cavity-modified transport.</description>

      <title>Reducing disorder in Ge quantum wells by using thick SiGe barriers</title>

Abstract: We investigate the disorder properties of two-dimensional hole gases in Ge/SiGe heterostructures grown on Ge wafers, using thick SiGe barriers to mitigate the influence of the semiconductor-dielectric interface. Across several heterostructure field effect transistors we measure an average maximum mobility of $(4.4 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{6}~\mathrm{cm^2/Vs}$ at a saturation density of $(1.72 \pm 0.03) \times 10^{11}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$, corresponding to a long mean free path of $(30 \pm 1)~\mathrm{\mu m}$. The highest measured mobility is $4.68 \times 10^{6}~\mathrm{cm^2/Vs}$. We identify uniform background impurities and interface roughness as the dominant scattering mechanisms limiting mobility in a representative device, and we evaluate a percolation-induced critical density of $(4.5 \pm 0.1)\times 10^{9} ~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. This low-disorder heterostructure, according to simulations, may support the electrostatic confinement of holes in gate-defined quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Tuning the lasing threshold of quantum well exciton-polaritons under a perpendicular magnetic field: a theoretical study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polariton lasing is a promising phenomenon with potential applications in next-generation lasers that operate without the need for population inversion. Applying a perpendicular magnetic field to a quantum well (QW) significantly alters the properties of exciton-polaritons. In this theoretical study, we investigate how the lasing threshold of QW exciton-polaritons depends on the magnetic field. By modifying the exciton's effective mass and Rabi splitting, the magnetic field induces notable changes in the relaxation kinetics, which directly affect the lasing threshold. For low-energy pumping, an increase in the magnetic field delays the lasing threshold, while for high-energy pumping, the threshold is reached at much lower pump intensities. Furthermore, increasing both the pump energy and the magnetic field enhances relaxation efficiency, leading to a substantially larger number of condensed polaritons. Our result gives insights into the modulation of exciton-polariton condensation through magnetic fields, with potential implications for the design of low-threshold polariton lasers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rich entanglement dynamics and transitions exhibited by monitored quantum systems typically only exist in the conditional state, making observation extremely difficult. In this work we construct a general recipe for mimicking the conditional entanglement dynamics of a monitored system in a corresponding measurement-free dissipative system involving directional interactions between the original system and a set of auxiliary register modes. This mirror setup autonomously implements a measurement-feedforward dynamics that effectively retains a coarse-grained measurement record. We illustrate our ideas in a bosonic system featuring a competition between entangling measurements and local unitary dynamics, and also discuss extensions to qubit systems and truly many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Identifying gap-closings in open non-Hermitian systems by Biorthogonal Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12213v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate gap-closings in one- and two-dimensional tight-binding models with two bands, containing non-Hermitian hopping terms, and open boundary conditions (OBCs) imposed along one direction. We compare the bulk OBC spectra with the periodic boundary condition (PBC) spectra, pointing out that they do not coincide, which is an intrinsic characteristic of non-Hermitian systems. The non-Hermiticity, thus, results in the failure of the familiar notions of bulk-boundary correspondence found for Hermitian systems. This necessitates the search for topological invariants which can characterize gap-closings in open non-Hermitian systems correctly and unambiguously. We elucidate the behaviour of two possible candidates applicable for one-dimensional slices - (1) the sum of winding numbers for the two bands defined on a generalized Brillouin zone and (2) the biorthogonal polarization (BP). While the former shows jumps/discontinuities for some of the non-Hermitian systems studied here, at points when an edge mode enters the bulk states and becomes delocalized, it does not maintain quantized values in a given topological phase. On the contrary, BP shows jumps at phase transitions, and takes the quantized value of one or zero, which corresponds to whether an actual edge mode exists or whether that mode is delocalized and absorbed within the bulk (not being an edge mode anymore).</description>

Abstract: Quantum processing units will be modules of larger information processing systems containing also digital and analog electronics modules. Silicon-based quantum computing offers the enticing opportunity to manufacture all the modules using the same technology platform. Here, we present a cryogenic multi-module assembly for multiplexed readout of silicon quantum devices where all modules have been fabricated using the same fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) CMOS process. The assembly is constituted by three chiplets: (i) a low-noise amplifier (LNA), (ii) a single-pole eight-throw switch (SP8T), and (iii) a silicon quantum dot (QD) array. We integrate the chiplets into modules and show respectively, (i) a peak gain over 35dB with a 3dB bandwidth from 709MHz to 827MHz and an average noise temperature of 6.2K (minimum 4.2K), (ii) an insertion loss smaller than 1.1dB and a noise temperature less than 1.1K over the 0-2GHz range, and (iii) single-electron box (SEB) charge sensors. Finally, we combine all modules into a single demonstration showing time-domain radio-frequency multiplexing of two SEBs paving the way to an all-silicon quantum computing system.</description>

      <title>Topological zero modes and bounded modes at smooth domain walls: Exact solutions and dualities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topology describes global quantities invariant under continuous deformations, such as the number of elementary excitations at a phase boundary, without detailing specifics. Conversely, differential laws are needed to understand the physical properties of these excitations, such as their localization and spatial behavior. For instance, topology mandates the existence of solitonic zero-energy modes at the domain walls between topologically inequivalent phases in topological insulators and superconductors. However, the spatial dependence of these modes is only known in the idealized (and unrealistic) case of a sharp domain wall. Here, we find the analytical solutions of these zero-modes by assuming a smooth and exponentially-confined domain wall. This allows us to characterize the zero-modes using a few length scales: the domain wall width, the exponential decay length, and oscillation wavelength. These quantities define distinct regimes: featureless modes with "no hair" at sharp domain walls, and nonfeatureless modes at smooth domain walls, respectively, with "short hair", i.e., featureless at long distances, and "long hair", i.e., nonfeatureless at all length scales. We thus establish a universal relation between the bulk excitation gap, decay rate, and oscillation momentum of the zero modes, which quantifies the bulk-boundary correspondence in terms of experimentally measurable physical quantities. Additionally, we reveal an unexpected duality between topological zero modes and Shockley modes, unifying the understanding of topologically-protected and nontopological boundary modes. These findings shed some new light on the localization properties of edge modes in topological insulators and Majorana zero modes in topological superconductors and on the differences and similarities between topological and nontopological zero modes in these systems.</description>

      <title>Effects of grain temperature distribution on organic protostellar envelope chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Dust grains in circumstellar envelopes are likely to have a spread-out temperature distribution. Aims. To investigate how trends in temperature distribution between small and large grains affect the hot corino chemistry of complex organic molecules (COMs) and warm carbon-chain chemistry (WCCC). Methods. A multi-grain multi-layer astrochemical code with an up-to-date treatment of surface chemistry was used with three grain temperature trends: grain temperature proportional to grain radius to the power -1/6 (Model M-1/6), to 0 (M0), and to 1/6 (M1/6). The cases of hot corino and WCCC chemistry were investigated, for a total of six models. The essence of these changes is for the main ice reservoir - small grains - having higher (M-1/6) or lower (M1/6) temperature than the surrounding gas. Results. The chemistry of COMs shows better agreement with observations in models M-1/6 and M1/6 than in Model M0. Model M-1/6 shows best agreement for WCCC because earlier mass-evaporation of methane ice from small grains induces the WCCC phenomenon at lower temperatures. Conclusions. Models considering several grain populations with different temperatures can more precisely reproduce circumstellar chemistry.</description>

Abstract: Magnetoelectric (ME) materials displaying strong magnetically induced polarization have attracted considerable interest due to their potential applications in spintronics and various fast electrically controlled magnetic devices. CaMn$_7$O$_{12}$ (CMO) stands out for its giant spin-induced ferroelectric polarization. However, the origin of the induced electric polarization in CMO remains highly controversial and continues to be a subject of ongoing debate. In this paper, through room temperature X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility, and thermally stimulated depolarizing current (TSDC) measurements, we provide experimental evidence for a route to tune the magnetically induced polarization by modifying the exchange-striction in CMO via Sr-doping. Our findings demonstrate that the large and broad current peaks observed near the first magnetic phase transition ($T_N1 \sim 90$ K) indicate contributions to the TSDC density from both extrinsic thermally stimulated depolarization processes and intrinsic pyroelectric current arising from magnetically induced polarization changes. We suggest that this reduction in induced electric polarization in CMO originates from the increase in the Mn$^{3+}$ -- O -- Mn$^{4+}$ bond angle due to Sr$^{2+}$ doping, weakening the exchange-striction interaction. Meanwhile, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) effect determines the direction of the induced electric polarization. Our result sheds light on understanding the intriguing giant-induced polarization in CMO and similar compounds with complex magnetic structures.</description>

      <title>Critical states exhibit invariance in both position and momentum spaces</title>

Abstract: The critical states of disordered systems are intriguing subjects within the realm of condensed matter physics and complex systems. These states manifest in materials where disorder plays a significant role, and are distinguished by their multifractal structure and self-similarity. However, accurately characterizing critical states continues to pose a significant challenge. In this study, we argue that critical states exhibit a certain invariance in both position and momentum spaces, leading to their delocalization in both domains. More specifically, it is expected that typical physical quantities characterizing critical states, such as the inverse participation ratio and information entropy, should exhibit invariance in both position space and momentum space. Subsequent numerical simulations validate the correctness of this invariance, thereby establishing a robust foundation for future experimental validation of critical states.</description>
