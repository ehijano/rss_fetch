      <title>Interpretable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Analysis of Strongly Correlated Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an exceptionally powerful tool for analyzing scientific data. In particular, attention-based architectures have demonstrated a remarkable capability to capture complex correlations and to furnish interpretable insights into latent, otherwise inconspicuous patterns. This progress motivates the application of AI techniques to the analysis of strongly correlated electrons, which remain notoriously challenging to study using conventional theoretical approaches. Here, we propose novel AI workflows for analyzing snapshot datasets from tensor-network simulations of the two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model over a broad range of temperature and doping. The 2D Hubbard model is an archetypal strongly correlated system, hosting diverse intriguing phenomena including Mott insulators, anomalous metals, and high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Our AI techniques yield fresh perspectives on the intricate quantum correlations underpinning these phenomena and facilitate universal omnimetry for ultracold-atom simulations of the corresponding strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Neural Network Backflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately describing the ground state of strongly correlated systems is essential for understanding their emergent properties. Neural Network Backflow (NNBF) is a powerful variational ansatz that enhances mean-field wave functions by introducing configuration-dependent modifications to single-particle orbitals. Although NNBF is theoretically universal in the limit of large networks, we find that practical gains saturate with increasing network size. Instead, significant improvements can be achieved by using a multi-determinant ansatz. We explore efficient ways to generate these multi-determinant expansions without increasing the number of variational parameters. In particular, we study single-step Lanczos and symmetry projection techniques, benchmarking their performance against diffusion Monte Carlo and NNBF applied to alternative mean fields. Benchmarking on a doped periodic square Hubbard model near optimal doping, we find that a Lanczos step, diffusion Monte Carlo, and projection onto a symmetry sector all give similar improvements achieving state-of-the-art energies at minimal cost. By further optimizing the projected symmetrized states directly, we gain significantly in energy. Using this technique we report the lowest variational energies for this Hamiltonian on $4\times 16$ and $4 \times 8$ lattices as well as accurate variance extrapolated energies. We also show the evolution of spin, charge, and pair correlation functions as the quality of the variational ansatz improves.</description>

      <title>Engineering Biquadratic Interactions in Spin-1 Chains by Spin-1/2 Spacers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-dimensional quantum systems host a variety of exotic states, such as symmetry-protected topological ground states in spin-1 Haldane chains. Real-world realizations of such states could serve as practical quantum simulators for quantum phases if the interactions can be controlled. However, many proposed models, such as the AKLT state, require unconventional forms of spin interactions beyond standard Heisenberg terms, which do not naturally emerge from microscopic (Coulomb) interactions. Here, we demonstrate a general strategy to induce a biquadratic term between two spin-1 sites and to tune its strength $\beta$ by placing pairs of spin-1/2 spacers in between them. $\beta$ is controlled by the ratio between Heisenberg couplings to and in between the spacer spins. Increasing this ratio first increases the magnitude of $\beta$ and decreases the correlation length of edge states, but at a critical value of the ratio, we observe a quantum phase transition between two spin-liquid phases with hidden antiferromagnetic order. Detailed atomistic calculations reveal that chains of nanographene flakes with 22 and 13 atoms, respectively, which could be realized by state-of-the-art bottom-up growth technology, yield precisely the couplings required to approach the AKLT state. These findings deliver a blueprint for engineering unconventional interactions in bottom-up synthesized quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectricity of moir\'e heavy fermions in MoTe2/WSe2 bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunable Kondo lattice and heavy fermion physics have been recently reported in moir\'e materials, but most of the studies have focused on the electrical and magnetic properties. Quantitative thermoelectric measurements, which can reveal entropic information of the heavy fermions, have yet to be achieved. Here, we report a comprehensive thermoelectric study on the moir\'e heavy fermion phase realized in hole-doped angle-aligned MoTe2/WSe2 bilayers. By electrically gating the material to the Kondo lattice region of the phase diagram, we observe a sign change in the Seebeck coefficient near the Kondo coherence temperature, where the heavy fermion phase with an electron-like Fermi surface evolves into an itinerant Fermi liquid with a hole-like Fermi surface. We compare the results with the semiclassical Mott relation and discuss the observed discrepancies. In addition to the thermal dissociation of Kondo singlets in the heavy Fermi liquid, a sign change accompanied by a strong peak in the Seebeck coefficient is also observed near a Zeeman breakdown of the Kondo singlets, signaling an entropy accumulation. Our results provide entropic information on both the formation and breakdown of heavy fermions in moir\'e semiconductors.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in ultrafast laser systems and high harmonic generation (HHG) techniques have enabled time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on femtosecond timescales, opening up unprecedented opportunities to explore quantum materials in both time and momentum space. In this review, we present recent representative studies utilizing HHG-laser-based time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy for a variety of quantum materials. We particularly highlight electron-phonon interactions and non-equilibrium dynamics in time and frequency domain, through which rich information about non-equilibrium electron-phonon couplings and related phenomena has been clearly revealed.</description>

      <title>Kink in Stoner Factor as a Signature of Changing Magnetic Fluctuations in Organic Conductor $\lambda$-(BETS)$_2$GaCl$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have theoretically investigated the magnetic properties of the quasi-two-dimensional organic conductor $\lambda$-(BETS)$_2$GaCl$_4$ using a multi-band Hubbard model and the two-particle self-consistent method. We have employed a four-band model, where each BETS molecule is considered as a site, and a two-band model, treating each BETS dimer as a site. Our results for the temperature dependence of the Stoner factor reveal a kink around $T_\mathrm{kink} \approx 5 \mathrm{meV}$, indicating a change in the dominant magnetic fluctuations. Above $T_\mathrm{kink}$, it shows a broad structure indicating smeared antiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuations, while below $T_\mathrm{kink}$, the spin susceptibility peaks at a wavevector corresponding to spin-density-wave (SDW)-like fluctuations. As the intra-dimer transfer integral increases, the kink disappears, and the AFM fluctuations are enhanced. Our findings are consistent with experimental observations, which also report a change in magnetic properties from AFM to SDW-like fluctuations upon cooling.</description>

      <title>Absence of Parity Anomaly in Massive Dirac Fermions on a Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parity anomaly for Dirac fermions in two spatial dimensions has shaped perspectives in quantum field theory and condensed matter physics. In condensed matter it has evolved as a mechanism for half-quantized Hall responses in systems described by massive Dirac fermions. Here we reexamine the issue on a lattice and show that the half-quantized Hall conductivity is absent for massive Dirac fermions when lattice regularization is properly implemented and the translational invariant symmetry is taken into account. We realize that a single massive Dirac cone on a lattice always leads to an integer quantized Hall conductivity and to the half-quantized Hall conductivity only in the unphysical limit of infinite momentum cut-off. The half-quantized Hall conductivity appears with nonzero longitudinal conductance as a signature of a single massless Dirac cone on a lattice. Consequently, the parity anomaly is a property of massless Dirac fermions in a semimetal/metal, not of massive Dirac fermions in an insulator on a lattice.</description>

      <title>Ground states of a family of frustrated spin models for quasicrystals and their approximants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many new families of quasicrystal-forming magnetic alloys have been synthesized and studied in recent years. For small changes of composition, the alloys can go from quasiperiodic to periodic (approximant crystals) while conserving most of the local atomic environments. Experiments show that many of the periodic approximants order at low temperatures, with clear signatures of ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic transitions, and also in some cases undergo non-equilibrium spin glass transitions. In contrast, the quasicrystals are mostly found to be spin glasses. Systematically studying these alloys could help elucidate the role played by quasiperiodicity in (de)stabilizing long range magnetic order. In this work, we study cluster spin models with the aim of understanding the mechanisms behind various types of long range magnetic ordering in approximants and quasicrystals. These models embody key features of real systems, and to some extent are analytically tractable, both for periodic and quasiperiodic cases. For the quasicrystal, we describe two novel magnetic phases with quasiperiodic ordering. Our results should serve to motivate further studies with detailed numerical explorations of this family of models.</description>

      <title>First-Order Spin-Reorientation Transition and Incomplete Softening of the Antiferromagnetic Resonance Mode in Multiferroic GdFe$_3$(BO$_3$)$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multiferroic ferroborate GdFe$_3$(BO$_3$)$_4$ with huntite-type structure exhibits magnetic ordering below T$_N$ = 38 K and contains two magnetic subsystems associated with Gd and Fe ions. Competing anisotropies of these subsystems drive a spin reorientation transition at T$_{SR}$ = 10.7 K, switching the ground state from easy-axis to easy-plane. Using antiferromagnetic resonance, we investigate the spin dynamics across this transition. The observed incomplete softening of a magnon mode during both field- and temperature-induced spin-reorientation transitions indicates the first-order nature of the phase transition, which is accompanied by a discontinuous jump in the effective anisotropy field. We reproduce this behavior using a simple model that attributes the jump in the anisotropy field to the presence of an effective fourth-order anisotropy constant, responsible for the discontinuous character of the transition. Remarkably, for in-plane magnetic fields, we identify a new AFMR mode that persists from 12 K up to T$_N$. This mode likely corresponds to the dynamics of a long period incommensurate state, previously detected by resonant elastic X-ray scattering.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced excitonic magnetism in a multiorbital Hubbard system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiorbital Hubbard models with Hund coupling and crystal-field splitting exhibit an instability toward spin-triplet excitonic order in the parameter regime characterized by strong local spin fluctuations. Upon chemical doping, two distinct types of excitonic ferromagnetism have been reported. Using steady-state nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory, we demonstrate that photo-doped half-filled systems can host nonthermal counterparts of these excitonic phases and exhibit a rich phase diagram in the space of photo-doping and crystal field splitting. Photo-doping a spin-triplet excitonic insulator provides a route towards nonequilibrium control of magnetic order.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties of $R$Rh$_6$Ge$_4$ ($R$ = Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd-Er) single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single crystals of $R$Rh$_6$Ge$_4$ ($R$ = Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd - Er) were synthesized using a Bi flux and their physical properties were characterized by magnetization, resistivity, and specific heat measurements. These compounds crystallize in the noncentrosymmetric LiCo$_6$P$_4$-type structure (space group $P\bar{6}m2$), where rare-earth atoms form a triangular lattice in the $ab$-plane and chains along the $c$-axis. PrRh$_6$Ge$_4$ and ErRh$_6$Ge$_4$ do not exhibit magnetic transitions above 0.4 K. NdRh$_6$Ge$_4$ and SmRh$_6$Ge$_4$ are ferromagnets, while GdRh$_6$Ge$_4$ and DyRh$_6$Ge$_4$ show antiferromagnetic transitions, \red{whereas HoRh$_6$Ge$_4$ is a ferrimagnet}. In addition, DyRh$_6$Ge$_4$ shows multiple transitions and magnetization plateaus when a magnetic field is applied along the $c$-axis. In SmRh$_6$Ge$_4$, like the Ce counterpart, the crystalline-electric field (CEF) effect leads to an easy plane anisotropy, while in other compounds it gives rise to a pronounced uniaxial anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Schr\"odinger CFTs: Factorization, Massless Particles, and a Path to the Bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit Schr\"odinger CFTs from a modern point of view. We introduce the ''harmonic trap geometry,'' analogous to the cylinder picture in relativistic CFTs, and demonstrate a state-operator correspondence that applies to all operators, including descendant, massless, and ''normal-ordered operators.'' A thermofield double construction plays an extremely important role. We systematically classify all physical spectra in the harmonic trap and their unitarity bounds, extending earlier results to include both massless and massive states of all spins, providing a new analytic treatment of unitarity bounds, and establishing foundations for a bootstrap. In our reformulation, previously known perturbative non-renormalization theorems follow immediately from non-perturbative factorization at fixed points and along RG flows. Massless states are described by an effective 1d CFT, as predicted by DLCQ, and violate the non-renormalization theorems. We include a self-consistent review of Schr\"odinger CFTs in our framework, making the paper accessible to anyone with a field theory background.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusion and anomalous fluctuations in chiral integrable dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetries strongly influence transport properties of quantum many-body systems, and can lead to deviations from the generic case of diffusion. In this work, we study the impact of time-reversal symmetry breaking on the transport and its universal aspects in integrable chiral spin ladders. We observe that the infinite-temperature spin transport is superdiffusive with a dynamical critical exponent z = 3/2 matching the one of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class, which also lacks the time reversal symmetry. However, we find that fluctuations of the net magnetization transfer deviate from the KPZ predictions. Moreover, the full probability distribution of the associated spin current obeys fluctuation symmetry despite broken time-reversal and space-reflection symmetries. To further investigate the role of conserved quantities, we introduce an integrable quantum circuit that shares the essential symmetries with the chiral ladder, and which exhibits analogous dynamical behaviour in the absence of energy conservation. Our work shows that time-reversal symmetry breaking is compatible with superdiffusion, but insufficient to stabilize the KPZ universality in integrable systems. This suggests that additional fundamental features are missing in order to identify the emergence of such dynamics in quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Probing non-equilibrium physics through the two-body Bell correlator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying equilibrium criticalities and phases from the dynamics of a system, known as a dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT), is a challenging task when relying solely on local observables. We exhibit that the experimentally accessible two-body Bell operator, originally designed to detect nonlocal correlations in quantum states, serves as an effective witness of DQPTs in a long-range (LR) XY spin chain subjected to a magnetic field, where the interaction strength decays as a power law. Following a sudden quench of the system parameters, the Bell operator between nearest-neighbor spins exhibits a distinct drop at the critical boundaries. In this study, we consider two quenching protocols, namely sudden quenches of the magnetic field strength and the interaction fall-off rate. This pronounced behavior defines a threshold, distinguishing intra-phase from inter-phase quenches, remaining valid regardless of the strength of long-range interactions, anisotropy, and system sizes. Comparative analyses further demonstrate that conventional classical and quantum correlators, including entanglement, fail to capture this transition during dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hall correlations in tilted extended Bose-Hubbard chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate characteristics of a bosonic fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state in a one-dimensional extended Bose-Hubbard model (eBHM) with a static tilt. In the large tilt limit, quenched kinetic energy leads to emergent dipole moment conservation, enabling mapping to a model generating FQH states. Using exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group, and an analytical transfer matrix approach, we analyze energy and entanglement properties to reveal FQH correlations. Our findings set the stage for the use of quenched kinetics in simple time-reversal invariant eBHMs to explore emergent phenomena.</description>

      <title>Pinch points and half moons encode Berry curvature</title>

Abstract: "Half moons", distinctive crescent patterns in the dynamical structure factor, have been identified in inelastic neutron scattering experiments for a wide range of frustrated magnets. In an earlier paper [H. Yan et al., Phys. Rev. B 98, 140402(R) (2018)] we have shown how these features are linked to the local constraints realized in classical spin liquids. Here we explore their implication for the topology of magnon bands. The presence of half moons indicates a separation of magnetic degrees of freedom into irrotational and incompressible components. Where bands satisfying these constraints meet, it is at a singular point encoding Berry curvature of $\pm 2\pi$. Interactions which mix the bands open a gap, resolving the singularity, and leading to bands with finite Berry curvature, accompanied by characteristic changes to half--moon motifs. These results imply that inelastic neutron scattering can, in some cases, be used to make rigorous inference about the topological nature of magnon bands.</description>

      <title>Theory of Topological Superconductivity and Antiferromagnetic Correlated Insulators in Twisted Bilayer WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the very recent discovery of unconventional superconductivity in twisted WSe$_2$ homobilayers at filling $\nu=-1$, considerable interest has arisen in revealing its mechanism. In this paper, we developed a three-band tight-binding model with non-trivial band topology by direct Wannierization of the low-energy continuum model. Incorporating both onsite Hubbard repulsion and next-nearest-neighbor attraction, we then performed a mean-field analysis of the microscopic model and obtained a phase diagram qualitatively consistent with the experiment results. For zero or weak displacement field, the ground state is a Chern number $C=\pm 2$ topological superconductor in the Altland-Zirnbauer A-class (breaking time-reversal but preserving total $S_z$ symmetry) with inter-valley pairing dominant in $d_{xy}\pm id_{x^2-y^2}$-wave (mixing with a subdominant $p_x\mp i p_y$-wave) component. For a relatively strong displacement field, the ground state is a correlated insulator with the $120^\circ$ antiferromagnetic order. Our results provide new insights into the nature of the twisted WSe$_2$ systems and suggest the need for further theoretical and experimental explorations.</description>

      <title>Elastic Response and Instabilities of Anomalous Hall Crystals</title>

Abstract: Anomalous Hall crystals (AHCs) are exotic phases of matter that simultaneously break continuous translation symmetry and exhibit the quantum anomalous Hall effect. AHCs have recently been proposed as an explanation for the observation of an integer quantum anomalous Hall phase in a multilayer graphene system. Despite intense theoretical and experimental interest, little is known about the mechanical properties of AHCs. We study the elastic properties of AHCs, first by utilizing a continuum model with a quadratic dispersion and uniform Berry curvature. We find using time-dependent Hartree-Fock that the stiffness of the AHC is an order of magnitude smaller than that of the WC, which we attribute to the finite Chern number of the AHC preventing exponential localization of the charge density. By modifying the dispersion relation to include a local minimum modeled after that of rhombohedral pentalayer graphene (R5G), we find that deformations away from the triangular lattice minimize the kinetic energy of the AHC, which overwhelms the small stiffness and generates a mechanical instability. Using a microscopic model of R5G, we observe a similar mechanical instability over an experimentally relevant parameter regime. We conclude that the topologically limited stiffness of AHCs makes them susceptible to mechanical instabilities, an important consideration when interpreting experiments in terms of AHCs.</description>

      <title>Learning phases with Quantum Monte Carlo simulation cell</title>

Abstract: We propose the use of the ``spin-opstring", derived from Stochastic Series Expansion Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations as machine learning (ML) input data. It offers a compact, memory-efficient representation of QMC simulation cells, combining the initial state with an operator string that encodes the state's evolution through imaginary time. Using supervised ML, we demonstrate the input's effectiveness in capturing both conventional and topological phase transitions, and in a regression task to predict non-local observables. We also demonstrate the capability of spin-opstring data in transfer learning by training models on one quantum system and successfully predicting on another, as well as showing that models trained on smaller system sizes generalize well to larger ones. Importantly, we illustrate a clear advantage of spin-opstring over conventional spin configurations in the accurate prediction of a quantum phase transition. Finally, we show how the inherent structure of spin-opstring provides an elegant framework for the interpretability of ML predictions. Using two state-of-the-art interpretability techniques, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation and SHapley Additive exPlanations, we show that the ML models learn and rely on physically meaningful features from the input data. Together, these findings establish the spin-opstring as a broadly-applicable and interpretable input format for ML in quantum many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Evidence for energy-dependent scattering dominating thermoelectricity in heavy fermion systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of thermoelectric materials and devices, improving energy conversion efficiency remains a long-standing challenge. As a promising approach to address this issue, utilizing energy-dependent electron-scattering beyond the ordinary constant relaxation time approximation (CRTA) has been proposed. However, direct experimental evidence for an energy-dependent scattering reflected in the Seebeck coefficient is still lacking. Here we demonstrate using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy that the relaxation time of heavy fermion quasiparticles is highly dependent on the energy near the Fermi level. The observed energy dependence of the relaxation time is due to the coherent Kondo scattering, describing the sign of the Seebeck coefficient reasonably well, which cannot be deduced from CRTA. Our findings provide not only deeper insight into the understanding of thermoelectricity in correlated materials, but also future perspectives on possible orbital-selective engineering of thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Toward a Theory of Phase Transitions in Quantum Control Landscapes</title>

Abstract: Control landscape phase transitions (CLPTs) occur as abrupt changes in the cost function landscape upon varying a control parameter, and can be revealed by non-analytic points in statistical order parameters. A prime example are quantum speed limits (QSL) which mark the onset of controllability as the protocol duration is increased. Here we lay the foundations of an analytical theory for CLPTs by developing Dyson, Magnus, and cumulant expansions for the cost function that capture the behavior of CLPTs with a controlled precision. Using linear and quadratic stability analysis, we reveal that CLPTs can be associated with different types of instabilities of the optimal protocol. This allows us to explicitly relate CLPTs to critical structural rearrangements in the extrema of the control landscape: utilizing path integral methods from statistical field theory, we trace back the critical scaling of the order parameter at the QSL to the topological and geometric properties of the set of optimal protocols, such as the number of connected components and its dimensionality. We verify our predictions by introducing a numerical sampling algorithm designed to explore this optimal set via a homotopic stochastic update rule. We apply this new toolbox explicitly to analyze CLPTs in the single- and two-qubit control problems whose landscapes are analytically tractable, and compare the landscapes for bang-bang and continuous protocols. Our work provides the first steps towards a systematic theory of CLPTs and paves the way for utilizing statistical field theory techniques for generic complex control landscapes.</description>

      <title>Entanglement generation and scaling from noisy quenches across a quantum critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03584v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of noise on the dynamics of entanglement in the transverse-field Ising chain, with the field quenched linearly across one or both of the quantum critical points of the model. Taking concurrence as a measure of entanglement, we find that a quench generates entanglement between nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor spins, with noise reducing the amount of entanglement. Focusing on the next-nearest-neighbor concurrence, known to exhibit Kibble-Zurek scaling with the square root of the quench rate in the noiseless case, we find a different result when noise is present: The concurrence now scales logarithmically with the quench rate, with a noise-dependent amplitude. This is also different from the ``anti-Kibble-Zurek" scaling of defect density with quench rate when noise is present, suggesting that noisy entanglement generation is largely independent from the rate of defect formation. Intriguingly, the critical time scale beyond which no entanglement is produced by a noisy quench scales as a power law with the strength of noise, with the same exponent as that which governs the optimal quench time for which defect formation is at a minimum in a standard quantum annealing scheme.</description>
