      <title>Beyond Lux thresholds: a systematic pipeline for classifying biologically relevant light contexts from wearable data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Wearable spectrometers enable field quantification of biologically relevant light, yet reproducible pipelines for contextual classification remain under-specified.
  Objective: To establish and validate a subject-wise evaluated, reproducible pipeline and actionable design rules for classifying natural vs. artificial light from wearable spectral data.
  Methods: We analysed ActLumus recordings from 26 participants, each monitored for at least 7 days at 10-second sampling, paired with daily exposure diaries. The pipeline fixes the sequence: domain selection, log-base-10 transform, L2 normalisation excluding total intensity (to avoid brightness shortcuts), hour-level medoid aggregation, sine/cosine hour encoding, and MLP classifier, evaluated under participant-wise cross-validation.
  Results: The proposed sequence consistently achieved high performance on the primary task, with representative configurations reaching AUC = 0.938 (accuracy 88%) for natural vs. artificial classification on the held-out subject split. In contrast, indoor vs. outdoor classification remained at feasibility level due to spectral overlap and class imbalance (best AUC approximately 0.75; majority-class collapse without contextual sensors). Threshold baselines were insufficient on our data, supporting the need for spectral-temporal modelling beyond illuminance cut-offs.
  Conclusions: We provide a reproducible, auditable baseline pipeline and design rules for contextual light classification under subject-wise generalisation. All code, configuration files, and derived artefacts will be openly archived (GitHub + Zenodo DOI) to support reuse and benchmarking.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Spatial Clustering of Single-Molecule Localizations with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-molecule localization microscopy generates point clouds corresponding to fluorophore localizations. Spatial cluster identification and analysis of these point clouds are crucial for extracting insights about molecular organization. However, this task becomes challenging in the presence of localization noise, high point density, or complex biological structures. Here, we introduce MIRO (Multifunctional Integration through Relational Optimization), an algorithm that uses recurrent graph neural networks to transform the point clouds in order to improve clustering efficiency when applying conventional clustering techniques. We show that MIRO supports simultaneous processing of clusters of different shapes and at multiple scales, demonstrating improved performance across varied datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates MIRO's transformative potential for single-molecule localization applications, showcasing its capability to revolutionize cluster analysis and provide accurate, reliable details of molecular architecture. In addition, MIRO's robust clustering capabilities hold promise for applications in various fields such as neuroscience, for the analysis of neural connectivity patterns, and environmental science, for studying spatial distributions of ecological data.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Analysis for a Class of Stochastic Copolymerization Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a stochastic model of a copolymerization process that has been extensively investigated in the physics literature. The main questions of interest include: (i) what are the criteria for transience, null recurrence, and positive recurrence in terms of the system parameters; (ii) in the transient regime, what are the limiting fractions of the different monomer types; and (iii) in the transient regime, what is the speed of growth of the polymer? Previous studies in the physics literature have addressed these questions using heuristic methods. Here, we utilize rigorous mathematical arguments to derive the results from the physics literature. Moreover, the techniques developed allow us to generalize to the copolymerization process with finitely many monomer types. We expect that the mathematical methods used and developed in this work will also enable the study of even more complex models in the future.</description>
