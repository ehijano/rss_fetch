      <title>A Novel Branch-and-Prune Algorithmic Framework for the 3D Interval Discretizable Distance Geometry Problem: An Approach Based on Torsion Angles of Molecular Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distance Geometry plays a central role in determining protein structures from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) data, a task known as the Molecular Distance Geometry Problem (MDGP). A subclass of this problem, the Discretizable Distance Geometry Problem (DDGP), allows a recursive solution via the combinatorial Branch-and-Prune (BP) algorithm by exploiting specific vertex orderings in protein backbones. To accommodate the inherent uncertainty in NMR data, the interval Branch-and-Prune (\textit{i}BP) algorithm was introduced, incorporating interval distance constraints through uniform sampling. In this work, we propose two new algorithmic frameworks for solving the three-dimensional interval DDGP (\textit{i}DDGP): the interval Angular Branch-and-Prune (\textit{i}ABP), and its extension, the interval Torsion-angle Branch-and-Prune (\textit{i}TBP). These methods convert interval distances into angular constraints, enabling structured sampling over circular arcs. The \textit{i}ABP method guarantees feasibility by construction and removes the need for explicit constraint checking. The \textit{i}TBP algorithm further incorporates known torsion angle intervals, enforcing local chirality and planarity conditions critical for protein geometry. We present formal mathematical foundations for both methods and a systematic strategy for generating biologically meaningful \textit{i}DDGP instances from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) structures. Computational experiments demonstrate that both \textit{i}ABP and \textit{i}TBP consistently outperform \textit{i}BP in terms of solution rate and computational efficiency. In particular, \textit{i}TBP yields solutions with lower RMSD variance relative to the original PDB structures, better reflecting biologically plausible conformations.</description>

      <title>AbRank: A Benchmark Dataset and Metric-Learning Framework for Antibody-Antigen Affinity Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) binding affinity is essential for therapeutic design and vaccine development, yet the performance of current models is limited by noisy experimental labels, heterogeneous assay conditions, and poor generalization across the vast antibody and antigen sequence space. We introduce AbRank, a large-scale benchmark and evaluation framework that reframes affinity prediction as a pairwise ranking problem. AbRank aggregates over 380,000 binding assays from nine heterogeneous sources, spanning diverse antibodies, antigens, and experimental conditions, and introduces standardized data splits that systematically increase distribution shift, from local perturbations such as point mutations to broad generalization across novel antigens and antibodies. To ensure robust supervision, AbRank defines an m-confident ranking framework by filtering out comparisons with marginal affinity differences, focusing training on pairs with at least an m-fold difference in measured binding strength. As a baseline for the benchmark, we introduce WALLE-Affinity, a graph-based approach that integrates protein language model embeddings with structural information to predict pairwise binding preferences. Our benchmarks reveal significant limitations in current methods under realistic generalization settings and demonstrate that ranking-based training improves robustness and transferability. In summary, AbRank offers a robust foundation for machine learning models to generalize across the antibody-antigen space, with direct relevance for scalable, structure-aware antibody therapeutic design.</description>

      <title>Cryo-em images are intrinsically low dimensional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference provides a powerful framework for cryo-electron microscopy, employing neural networks in methods like CryoSBI to infer biomolecular conformations via learned latent representations. This latent space represents a rich opportunity, encoding valuable information about the physical system and the inference process. Harnessing this potential hinges on understanding the underlying geometric structure of these representations. We investigate this structure by applying manifold learning techniques to CryoSBI representations of hemagglutinin (simulated and experimental). We reveal that these high-dimensional data inherently populate low-dimensional, smooth manifolds, with simulated data effectively covering the experimental counterpart. By characterizing the manifold's geometry using Diffusion Maps and identifying its principal axes of variation via coordinate interpretation methods, we establish a direct link between the latent structure and key physical parameters. Discovering this intrinsic low-dimensionality and interpretable geometric organization not only validates the CryoSBI approach but enables us to learn more from the data structure and provides opportunities for improving future inference strategies by exploiting this revealed manifold geometry.</description>
