      <title>Hyperbolic Safety-Aware Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Addressing the retrieval of unsafe content from vision-language models such as CLIP is an important step towards real-world integration. Current efforts have relied on unlearning techniques that try to erase the model's knowledge of unsafe concepts. While effective in reducing unwanted outputs, unlearning limits the model's capacity to discern between safe and unsafe content. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that shifts from unlearning to an awareness paradigm by leveraging the inherent hierarchical properties of the hyperbolic space. We propose to encode safe and unsafe content as an entailment hierarchy, where both are placed in different regions of hyperbolic space. Our HySAC, Hyperbolic Safety-Aware CLIP, employs entailment loss functions to model the hierarchical and asymmetrical relations between safe and unsafe image-text pairs. This modelling, ineffective in standard vision-language models due to their reliance on Euclidean embeddings, endows the model with awareness of unsafe content, enabling it to serve as both a multimodal unsafe classifier and a flexible content retriever, with the option to dynamically redirect unsafe queries toward safer alternatives or retain the original output. Extensive experiments show that our approach not only enhances safety recognition but also establishes a more adaptable and interpretable framework for content moderation in vision-language models.

      <title>Seeing Sarcasm Through Different Eyes: Analyzing Multimodal Sarcasm Perception in Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrating increasingly human-like abilities, a pivotal question emerges: do different LVLMs interpret multimodal sarcasm differently, and can a single model grasp sarcasm from multiple perspectives like humans? To explore this, we introduce an analytical framework using systematically designed prompts on existing multimodal sarcasm datasets. Evaluating 12 state-of-the-art LVLMs over 2,409 samples, we examine interpretive variations within and across models, focusing on confidence levels, alignment with dataset labels, and recognition of ambiguous "neutral" cases. Our findings reveal notable discrepancies -- across LVLMs and within the same model under varied prompts. While classification-oriented prompts yield higher internal consistency, models diverge markedly when tasked with interpretive reasoning. These results challenge binary labeling paradigms by highlighting sarcasm's subjectivity. We advocate moving beyond rigid annotation schemes toward multi-perspective, uncertainty-aware modeling, offering deeper insights into multimodal sarcasm comprehension. Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/CoderChen01/LVLMSarcasmAnalysis</description>

      <title>LAPIG: Language Guided Projector Image Generation with Surface Adaptation and Stylization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose LAPIG, a language guided projector image generation method with surface adaptation and stylization. LAPIG consists of a projector-camera system and a target textured projection surface. LAPIG takes the user text prompt as input and aims to transform the surface style using the projector. LAPIG's key challenge is that due to the projector's physical brightness limitation and the surface texture, the viewer's perceived projection may suffer from color saturation and artifacts in both dark and bright regions, such that even with the state-of-the-art projector compensation techniques, the viewer may see clear surface texture-related artifacts. Therefore, how to generate a projector image that follows the user's instruction while also displaying minimum surface artifacts is an open problem. To address this issue, we propose projection surface adaptation (PSA) that can generate compensable surface stylization. We first train two networks to simulate the projector compensation and project-and-capture processes, this allows us to find a satisfactory projector image without real project-and-capture and utilize gradient descent for fast convergence. Then, we design content and saturation losses to guide the projector image generation, such that the generated image shows no clearly perceivable artifacts when projected. Finally, the generated image is projected for visually pleasing surface style morphing effects. The source code and video are available on the project page: https://Yu-chen-Deng.github.io/LAPIG/.</description>

      <title>Deepfake Detection with Optimized Hybrid Model: EAR Biometric Descriptor via Improved RCNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deepfake is a widely used technology employed in recent years to create pernicious content such as fake news, movies, and rumors by altering and substituting facial information from various sources. Given the ongoing evolution of deepfakes investigation of continuous identification and prevention is crucial. Due to recent technological advancements in AI (Artificial Intelligence) distinguishing deepfakes and artificially altered images has become challenging. This approach introduces the robust detection of subtle ear movements and shape changes to generate ear descriptors. Further, we also propose a novel optimized hybrid deepfake detection model that considers the ear biometric descriptors via enhanced RCNN (Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network). Initially, the input video is converted into frames and preprocessed through resizing, normalization, grayscale conversion, and filtering processes followed by face detection using the Viola-Jones technique. Next, a hybrid model comprising DBN (Deep Belief Network) and Bi-GRU (Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit) is utilized for deepfake detection based on ear descriptors. The output from the detection phase is determined through improved score-level fusion. To enhance the performance, the weights of both detection models are optimally tuned using the SU-JFO (Self-Upgraded Jellyfish Optimization method). Experimentation is conducted based on four scenarios: compression, noise, rotation, pose, and illumination on three different datasets. The performance results affirm that our proposed method outperforms traditional models such as CNN (Convolution Neural Network), SqueezeNet, LeNet, LinkNet, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), DFP (Deepfake Predictor) [1], and ResNext+CNN+LSTM [2] in terms of various performance metrics viz. accuracy, specificity, and precision.</description>

      <title>AdaReTaKe: Adaptive Redundancy Reduction to Perceive Longer for Video-language Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have revolutionized video understanding, yet are still limited by context length when processing long videos. Recent methods compress videos by leveraging visual redundancy uniformly, yielding promising results. Nevertheless, our quantitative analysis shows that redundancy varies significantly across time and model layers, necessitating a more flexible compression strategy. We propose AdaReTaKe, a training-free method that flexibly reduces visual redundancy by allocating compression ratios among time and layers with theoretical guarantees. Integrated into state-of-the-art MLLMs, AdaReTaKe improves processing capacity from 256 to 2048 frames while preserving critical information. Experiments on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench, and LVBench datasets demonstrate that AdaReTaKe outperforms existing methods by 2.3% and 2.8% for 7B and 72B models, respectively, with even greater improvements of 5.9% and 6.0% on the longest LVBench.

      <title>MAVEN: Multi-modal Attention for Valence-Arousal Emotion Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces MAVEN (Multi-modal Attention for Valence-Arousal Emotion Network), a novel architecture for dynamic emotion recognition through dimensional modeling of affect. The model uniquely integrates visual, audio, and textual modalities via a bi-directional cross-modal attention mechanism with six distinct attention pathways, enabling comprehensive interactions between all modality pairs. Our proposed approach employs modality-specific encoders to extract rich feature representations from synchronized video frames, audio segments, and transcripts. The architecture's novelty lies in its cross-modal enhancement strategy, where each modality representation is refined through weighted attention from other modalities, followed by self-attention refinement through modality-specific encoders. Rather than directly predicting valence-arousal values, MAVEN predicts emotions in a polar coordinate form, aligning with psychological models of the emotion circumplex. Experimental evaluation on the Aff-Wild2 dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, with performance measured using Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC). The multi-stage architecture demonstrates superior ability to capture the complex, nuanced nature of emotional expressions in conversational videos, advancing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in continuous emotion recognition in-the-wild.

      <title>Grounded Chain-of-Thought for Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite great progress, existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are prone to visual hallucination, greatly impeding their trustworthy applications. In this paper, we study this problem from the perspective of visual-spatial reasoning, and propose a new learning task for MLLMs, termed Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT). Different from recent visual CoT studies, which focus more on visual knowledge reasoning, GCoT is keen to helping MLLMs to recognize and ground the relevant visual cues step by step, thereby predicting the correct answer with grounding coordinates as the intuitive basis. To facilitate this task, we also carefully design and construct a dataset called multimodal grounded chain-of-thought (MM-GCoT) consisting of 24,022 GCoT examples for 5,033 images. Besides, a comprehensive consistency evaluation system is also introduced, including the metrics of answer accuracy, grounding accuracy and answer-grounding consistency. We further design and conduct a bunch of experiments on 12 advanced MLLMs, and reveal some notable findings: i. most MLLMs performs poorly on the consistency evaluation, indicating obvious visual hallucination; ii. visual hallucination is not directly related to the parameter size and general multimodal performance, i.e., a larger and stronger MLLM is not less affected by this issue. Lastly, we also demonstrate that the proposed dataset can help existing MLLMs to well cultivate their GCoT capability and reduce the inconsistent answering significantly. Moreover, their GCoT can be also generalized to exiting multimodal tasks, such as open-world QA and REC.</description>

      <title>ACT360: An Efficient 360-Degree Action Detection and Summarization Framework for Mission-Critical Training and Debriefing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective training and debriefing are critical in high-stakes, mission-critical environments such as disaster response, military simulations, and industrial safety, where precision and minimizing errors are paramount. The traditional post-training analysis relies on manually reviewing 2D videos, a time-consuming process that lacks comprehensive situational awareness. To address these limitations, we introduce ACT360, a system that leverages 360-degree videos and machine learning for automated action detection and structured debriefing. ACT360 integrates 360YOWO, an enhanced You Only Watch Once (YOWO) model with spatial attention and equirectangular-aware convolution (EAC) to mitigate panoramic video distortions. To enable deployment in resource-constrained environments, we apply quantization and model pruning, reducing the model size by 74% while maintaining robust accuracy (mAP drop of only 1.5%, from 0.865 to 0.850) and improving inference speed. We validate our approach on a publicly available dataset of 55 labeled 360-degree videos covering seven key operational actions, recorded across various real-world training sessions and environmental conditions. Additionally, ACT360 integrates 360AIE (Action Insight Explorer), a web-based interface for automatic action detection, retrieval, and textual summarization using large language models (LLMs), significantly enhancing post-incident analysis efficiency. ACT360 serves as a generalized framework for mission-critical debriefing, incorporating EAC, spatial attention, summarization, and model optimization. These innovations apply to any training environment requiring lightweight action detection and structured post-exercise analysis.</description>

      <title>BlobCtrl: A Unified and Flexible Framework for Element-level Image Generation and Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Element-level visual manipulation is essential in digital content creation, but current diffusion-based methods lack the precision and flexibility of traditional tools. In this work, we introduce BlobCtrl, a framework that unifies element-level generation and editing using a probabilistic blob-based representation. By employing blobs as visual primitives, our approach effectively decouples and represents spatial location, semantic content, and identity information, enabling precise element-level manipulation. Our key contributions include: 1) a dual-branch diffusion architecture with hierarchical feature fusion for seamless foreground-background integration; 2) a self-supervised training paradigm with tailored data augmentation and score functions; and 3) controllable dropout strategies to balance fidelity and diversity. To support further research, we introduce BlobData for large-scale training and BlobBench for systematic evaluation. Experiments show that BlobCtrl excels in various element-level manipulation tasks while maintaining computational efficiency, offering a practical solution for precise and flexible visual content creation.

      <title>LAVCap: LLM-based Audio-Visual Captioning using Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated audio captioning is a task that generates textual descriptions for audio content, and recent studies have explored using visual information to enhance captioning quality. However, current methods often fail to effectively fuse audio and visual data, missing important semantic cues from each modality. To address this, we introduce LAVCap, a large language model (LLM)-based audio-visual captioning framework that effectively integrates visual information with audio to improve audio captioning performance. LAVCap employs an optimal transport-based alignment loss to bridge the modality gap between audio and visual features, enabling more effective semantic extraction. Additionally, we propose an optimal transport attention module that enhances audio-visual fusion using an optimal transport assignment map. Combined with the optimal training strategy, experimental results demonstrate that each component of our framework is effective. LAVCap outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the AudioCaps dataset, without relying on large datasets or post-processing.

      <title>Sequential Contrastive Audio-Visual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful technique in audio-visual representation learning, leveraging the natural co-occurrence of audio and visual modalities in webscale video datasets. However, conventional contrastive audio-visual learning (CAV) methodologies often rely on aggregated representations derived through temporal aggregation, neglecting the intrinsic sequential nature of the data. This oversight raises concerns regarding the ability of standard approaches to capture and utilize fine-grained information within sequences. In response to this limitation, we propose sequential contrastive audiovisual learning (SCAV), which contrasts examples based on their non-aggregated representation space using multidimensional sequential distances. Audio-visual retrieval experiments with the VGGSound and Music datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SCAV, with up to 3.5x relative improvements in recall against traditional aggregation-based contrastive learning and other previously proposed methods, which utilize more parameters and data. We also show that models trained with SCAV exhibit a significant degree of flexibility regarding the metric employed for retrieval, allowing us to use a hybrid retrieval approach that is both effective and efficient.</description>

      <title>PDMX: A Large-Scale Public Domain MusicXML Dataset for Symbolic Music Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent explosion of generative AI-Music systems has raised numerous concerns over data copyright, licensing music from musicians, and the conflict between open-source AI and large prestige companies. Such issues highlight the need for publicly available, copyright-free musical data, in which there is a large shortage, particularly for symbolic music data. To alleviate this issue, we present PDMX: a large-scale open-source dataset of over 250K public domain MusicXML scores collected from the score-sharing forum MuseScore, making it the largest available copyright-free symbolic music dataset to our knowledge. PDMX additionally includes a wealth of both tag and user interaction metadata, allowing us to efficiently analyze the dataset and filter for high quality user-generated scores. Given the additional metadata afforded by our data collection process, we conduct multitrack music generation experiments evaluating how different representative subsets of PDMX lead to different behaviors in downstream models, and how user-rating statistics can be used as an effective measure of data quality. Examples can be found at https://pnlong.github.io/PDMX.demo/.</description>

      <title>Loss-tolerant neural video codec aware congestion control for real time video communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Because of reinforcement learning's (RL) ability to automatically create more adaptive controlling logics beyond the hand-crafted heuristics, numerous effort has been made to apply RL to congestion control (CC) design for real time video communication (RTC) applications and has successfully shown promising benefits over the rule-based RTC CCs. Online reinforcement learning is often adopted to train the RL models so the models can directly adapt to real network environments. However, its trail-and-error manner can also cause catastrophic degradation of the quality of experience (QoE) of RTC application at run time. Thus, safeguard strategies such as falling back to hand-crafted heuristics can be used to run along with RL models to guarantee the actions explored in the training sensible, despite that these safeguard strategies interrupt the learning process and make it more challenging to discover optimal RL policies.
  The recent emergence of loss-tolerant neural video codecs (NVC) naturally provides a layer of protection for the online learning of RL-based congestion control because of its resilience to packet losses, but such packet loss resilience have not been fully exploited in prior works yet. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning (RL) based congestion control which can be aware of and takes advantage of packet loss tolerance characteristic of NVCs via reward in online RL learning. Through extensive evaluation on various videos and network traces in a simulated environment, we demonstrate that our NVC-aware CC running with the loss-tolerant NVC reduces the training time by 41\% compared to other prior RL-based CCs. It also boosts the mean video quality by 0.3 to 1.6dB, lower the tail frame delay by 3 to 200ms, and reduces the video stalls by 20\% to 77\% in comparison with other baseline RTC CCs.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Compression Technique for 3D Gaussian Splatting Compression</title>

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) demonstrates excellent rendering quality and generation speed in novel view synthesis. However, substantial data size poses challenges for storage and transmission, making 3D GS compression an essential technology. Current 3D GS compression research primarily focuses on developing more compact scene representations, such as converting explicit 3D GS data into implicit forms. In contrast, compression of the GS data itself has hardly been explored. To address this gap, we propose a Hierarchical GS Compression (HGSC) technique. Initially, we prune unimportant Gaussians based on importance scores derived from both global and local significance, effectively reducing redundancy while maintaining visual quality. An Octree structure is used to compress 3D positions. Based on the 3D GS Octree, we implement a hierarchical attribute compression strategy by employing a KD-tree to partition the 3D GS into multiple blocks. We apply farthest point sampling to select anchor primitives within each block and others as non-anchor primitives with varying Levels of Details (LoDs). Anchor primitives serve as reference points for predicting non-anchor primitives across different LoDs to reduce spatial redundancy. For anchor primitives, we use the region adaptive hierarchical transform to achieve near-lossless compression of various attributes. For non-anchor primitives, each is predicted based on the k-nearest anchor primitives. To further minimize prediction errors, the reconstructed LoD and anchor primitives are combined to form new anchor primitives to predict the next LoD. Our method notably achieves superior compression quality and a significant data size reduction of over 4.5 times compared to the state-of-the-art compression method on small scenes datasets.</description>

      <title>Video-Guided Foley Sound Generation with Multimodal Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17698v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating sound effects for videos often requires creating artistic sound effects that diverge significantly from real-life sources and flexible control in the sound design. To address this problem, we introduce MultiFoley, a model designed for video-guided sound generation that supports multimodal conditioning through text, audio, and video. Given a silent video and a text prompt, MultiFoley allows users to create clean sounds (e.g., skateboard wheels spinning without wind noise) or more whimsical sounds (e.g., making a lion's roar sound like a cat's meow). MultiFoley also allows users to choose reference audio from sound effects (SFX) libraries or partial videos for conditioning. A key novelty of our model lies in its joint training on both internet video datasets with low-quality audio and professional SFX recordings, enabling high-quality, full-bandwidth (48kHz) audio generation. Through automated evaluations and human studies, we demonstrate that MultiFoley successfully generates synchronized high-quality sounds across varied conditional inputs and outperforms existing methods.

      <title>ReTaKe: Reducing Temporal and Knowledge Redundancy for Long Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20504v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have made significant strides in video understanding but struggle with long videos due to the limitations of their backbone LLMs. Existing solutions rely on length extrapolation, which is memory-constrained, or visual token compression, which primarily leverages low-level temporal redundancy while overlooking the more effective high-level knowledge redundancy. To address this, we propose $\textbf{ReTaKe}$, a training-free method with two novel modules DPSelect and PivotKV, to jointly reduce both temporal visual redundancy and knowledge redundancy for video compression. To align with the way of human temporal perception, DPSelect identifies keyframes based on inter-frame distance peaks. To leverage LLMs' learned prior knowledge, PivotKV marks the keyframes as pivots and compress non-pivot frames by pruning low-attention tokens in their KV cache. ReTaKe enables VideoLLMs to process 8 times longer frames (up to 2048), outperforming similar-sized models by 3-5% and even rivaling much larger ones on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench, and LVBench. Moreover, by overlapping compression operations with prefilling, ReTaKe introduces only ~10% prefilling latency overhead while reducing decoding latency by ~20%.

      <title>Seeing World Dynamics in a Nutshell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of efficiently representing casually captured monocular videos in a spatially- and temporally-coherent manner. While existing approaches predominantly rely on 2D/2.5D techniques treating videos as collections of spatiotemporal pixels, they struggle with complex motions, occlusions, and geometric consistency due to absence of temporal coherence and explicit 3D structure. Drawing inspiration from monocular video as a projection of the dynamic 3D world, we explore representing videos in their intrinsic 3D form through continuous flows of Gaussian primitives in space-time. In this paper, we propose NutWorld, a novel framework that efficiently transforms monocular videos into dynamic 3D Gaussian representations in a single forward pass. At its core, NutWorld introduces a structured spatial-temporal aligned Gaussian (STAG) representation, enabling optimization-free scene modeling with effective depth and flow regularization. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that NutWorld achieves high-fidelity video reconstruction quality while enabling various downstream applications in real-time. Demos and code will be available at https://github.com/Nut-World/NutWorld.</description>
