      <title>The $k$-th Order Preserving Sets and Isoperimetric Type Inequalities for Planar Ovals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce and investigate a new class of sets, the \textit{$k$-th Order Preserving Sets}, arising naturally from the Fourier analysis of support functions associated with hedgehogs. Specifically, we focus on sets whose support functions possess a Fourier series that preserves only terms with positive indices divisible by a fixed $k$.
  We explore the geometry of the \textit{$k$-th Order Middlepoint Set}, defined as the set of centroids of all equiangular $k$-gons circumscribed about a given hedgehog. This set captures essential structural and symmetry-related features of the underlying geometric configuration.
  We study the geometric properties of such sets and, in particular, establish an isoperimetric type inequality relating the perimeter and area of a region bounded by a simple smooth convex closed curve (an oval) $\mathcal{O}$: \[ L_{\mathcal{O}}^2 - 4\pi A_{\mathcal{O}} \geqslant 4\pi |A_{\mathcal{P}_k}| + 2\pi |A_{\Omega_{\mathcal{O},k}}|, \] where $L_{\mathcal{O}}$ denotes the length (perimeter) of $\mathcal{O}$, $A_{\mathcal{O}}$ is the area of the region enclosed by $\mathcal{O}$, $A_{\mathcal{P}_k}$ is the oriented area of the associated $k$-th Order Preserving Set $\mathcal{P}_k$, and $A_{\Omega_{\mathcal{O},k}}$ is the oriented area of the associated $k$-th Order Middlepoint Set $\Omega_{\mathcal{O},k}$. Moreover, we characterize the equality case: the inequality becomes an equality if and only if every equiangular circumscribed $k$-gon around $\mathcal{O}$ is a~regular $k$-gon with its center of mass located at the Steiner point of $\mathcal{O}$.</description>

      <title>$SU(2)$ Yang-Mills-Higgs functional with Higgs self-interaction on $3$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fixing a constant $\lambda&gt;0$, for any parameter $\varepsilon&gt;0$ we study critical points of the Yang--Mills--Higgs energy \[ \mathcal{Y}_{\varepsilon}(\nabla,\Phi) = \int_M \varepsilon^2|F_{\nabla}|^2 + |\nabla\Phi|^2 + \frac{\lambda}{4\varepsilon^2}(1-|\Phi|^2)^2, \] defined for pairs $(\nabla,\Phi)$, where $\nabla$ is a connection on an $SU(2)$-bundle over an oriented Riemannian $3$-manifold $(M^3, g)$, and $\Phi$ a section of the associated adjoint bundle. When $M$ is closed, we use a $2$-parameter min-max construction to produce, for $\varepsilon\ll_M 1$, non-trivial critical points in the energy regime \[ 1 \lesssim_{\lambda}\varepsilon^{-1}\mathcal{Y}_{\varepsilon}(\nabla_{\varepsilon},\Phi_{\varepsilon}) \lesssim_{\lambda, M} 1. \] When $b_1(M)=0$, these critical points are irreducible: $\nabla_{\varepsilon}\Phi_{\varepsilon}\neq 0$. Next, assuming $M$ has bounded geometry (not necessarily compact), and given critical points with $\varepsilon^{-1}\mathcal{Y}_{\varepsilon}(\nabla_{\varepsilon}, \Phi_{\varepsilon})$ uniformly bounded, we show that as $\varepsilon\to 0$, the energy measures $\varepsilon^{-1}e_{\varepsilon}(\nabla_{\varepsilon}, \Phi_{\varepsilon}) vol_{g}$ converge subsequentially to \[ |h|^2 vol_g + \sum_{x \in S}\Theta(x)\delta_{x}, \] where $h$ is an $L^2$ harmonic $1$-form, $S$ a finite set and each $\Theta(x)$ equals the energy of a finite collection of $\mathcal{Y}_{1}$-critical points on $\mathbb{R}^3$. Finally, the estimates involved also lead to an energy gap for critical points on $3$-manifolds with bounded geometry. As a byproduct of our results, we deduce the existence of non-trivial $\mathcal{Y}_{1}$-critical points over $\mathbb{R}^3$ for any $\lambda&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Symplectic solvmanifolds not satisfying the hard-Lefschetz condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For Lie groups $G$ of the form $G = \R^k \ltimes_{\phi} \R^m$, with $k + m$ even, a result of H. Kasuya shows that if the action $\phi:\R^k \to \mathrm{Aut}(\R^m)$ is semisimple then any symplectic solvmanifold $(\Gamma \backslash G, \omega)$ satisfies the hard-Lefschetz condition for any symplectic form. In this article, we prove the converse in the case $k = 1$ and $G$ completely solvable: no symplectic form on such a solvmanifold satisfies the hard-Lefschetz condition if $\phi$ is not semisimple; moreover, we show that the failure occurs either at degree $1$ or at degree $2$ in cohomology, depending on the spectrum of the differential of the action $\phi$. This result is achieved through a detailed analysis of the cohomology groups $H^1(\g)$, $H^2(\g)$, $H^{2n-2}(\g)$, $H^{2n-1}(\g)$ of the Lie algebra $\g$ of such Lie groups. Among other things, this analysis yields useful representatives for each cohomology class corresponding to any symplectic form on $\g$, allowing the most delicate cases to be reduced to a straightforward computation. We also construct lattices for many of the Lie groups under consideration, thereby exhibiting examples of symplectic solvmanifolds of completely solvable Lie groups failing to have the hard-Lefschetz property for any symplectic form.</description>

      <title>Symmetric log-epiperimetric inequality for harmonic maps with analytic target and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a direct symmetric (log)-epiperimetric inequality for harmonic maps with analytic target and we leverage on this result to achieve a new proof of Simon's celebrated uniqueness of tangents with isolated singularity for energy minimizing harmonic maps. Moreover, we show that tangents at infinity of energy minimizing harmonic maps with suitably controlled energy growth are always unique, by exploiting the lower bound entailed in the symmetric (log)-epiperimetric inequality.</description>

      <title>Extremising eigenvalues of the GJMS operators in a fixed conformal class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $n\geq 3$. If $s$ is a positive integer satisfying $2s&lt;n$, we let $P_g^s$ be the GJMS operator of order $2s$ in $M$. We investigate in this paper the extremal values taken by fixed eigenvalues of $P_h^s$ as $h$ runs though the whole conformal class $[g]$. Due to the conformal covariance of $P_g^s$ we need only consider two variational problems: maximising negative eigenvalues of $P_h^s$ and minimising positive eigenvalues of $P_h^s$ when $h \in [g]$. These extremal values are conformal invariants of $(M,g)$ and optimisers for these problems, when they exist, are known to not be smooth metrics in general. To overcome this we define and investigate eigenvalues for singular conformal metrics, that we call \emph{generalised eigenvalues}. We develop a new variational framework for renormalised eigenvalues of any index over the set of admissible (singular) conformal factors: we obtain semi-continuity results and Euler-Lagrange equations for local extremals. Using this framework we prove, under mild assumptions on $(M,g)$ and $s$, several new (non)-existence results for extremals of renormalised eigenvalues over $[g]$. These include, among other results, a maximisation result for negative eigenvalues, the minimisation of the principal eigenvalue of $P_g^s$ and the analysis of several invariants of the round sphere $(\mathbb{S}^n, g_0)$. We also establish a strong connection between the existence of optimisers and (nodal) solutions of prescribed $Q$-curvature equations. Our analysis covers the case of any order $s \ge 1$ and allows $P_g^s$ to have kernel. When $s=1$ and $P_g^1$ is the conformal Laplacian, this problem was previously investigated when $k=1, 2$. Our work strongly generalises previous results to eigenvalues of any index.</description>

      <title>Modified Hawking mass and rigidity of three-manifolds with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a rigidity result for three-dimensional Riemannian manifolds with boundary, under the assumption that a free boundary minimal two-disk, which locally maximizes a modified Hawking mass, is embedded in a $3$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with negative scalar curvature and mean convex boundary. First, we establish area estimates for free boundary strictly stable two-disks. Finally, we show that the $3$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with boundary is locally isometric to the half anti-de Sitter-Schwarzschild manifold.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons potentials of higher-dimensional Pontryagin densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel and systematic approach to computing the Chern-Simons potentials given the Pontryagin densities in arbitrary even dimensions $ D\geq4 $. Throughout we work with a generic affine connection, that results in a non-vanishing torsion in general and allows for non-metricity, which accommodates the existence of non-trivial Pontryagin densities in $ D=4n-2 \, (n \geq 2) $ dimensions. We outline an algorithm, with its implementation as a code, which lets one to determine the Chern-Simons potential of the Pontryagin density given an arbitrary even dimension.</description>

      <title>Manifold Learning with Normalizing Flows: Towards Regularity, Expressivity and Iso-Riemannian Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning increasingly leverages the insight that high-dimensional data often lie near low-dimensional, non-linear manifolds, an idea known as the manifold hypothesis. By explicitly modeling the geometric structure of data through learning Riemannian geometry algorithms can achieve improved performance and interpretability in tasks like clustering, dimensionality reduction, and interpolation. In particular, learned pullback geometry has recently undergone transformative developments that now make it scalable to learn and scalable to evaluate, which further opens the door for principled non-linear data analysis and interpretable machine learning. However, there are still steps to be taken when considering real-world multi-modal data. This work focuses on addressing distortions and modeling errors that can arise in the multi-modal setting and proposes to alleviate both challenges through isometrizing the learned Riemannian structure and balancing regularity and expressivity of the diffeomorphism parametrization. We showcase the effectiveness of the synergy of the proposed approaches in several numerical experiments with both synthetic and real data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that relativistic invariance introduce strong constraints in the interactions of classical particles. We generalize the non-interaction theorems for Lorentz violating systems which still preserve a subgroup of Poincar\'e symmetry. In particular we analize the case of very special relativity introduced by Cohen and Glashow. We also extend the analysis for Galilei invariant multiparticle systems and for some anisotropic systems which are still invariant under some maximal subgroups of Galilei group.</description>

Abstract: In this note we show that the recent work of Magee, Puder and van Handel [MPvH25] can be applied to obtain an optimal spectral gap result with polynomial error rate for uniformly random covers of closed hyperbolic surfaces. Let $X$ be a closed hyperbolic surface. We show there exists $b,c&gt;0$ such that a uniformly random degree-$n$ cover $X_{n}$ of $X$ has no new Laplacian eigenvalues below $\frac{1}{4}-cn^{-b}$ with probability tending to $1$ as $n\to\infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a closed hyperbolic surface, we investigate semiclassical defect measures associated with the magnetic Laplacian in the presence of a constant magnetic field. Depending on the energy level where the eigenfunctions concentrate, three distinct dynamical regimes emerge. In the low-energy regime, we show that any invariant measure of the magnetic flow in phase space can be obtained as a semiclassical measure. At the critical energy level, we establish Quantum Unique Ergodicity, together with a quantitative rate of convergence of eigenfunctions to the Liouville measure. In the high-energy regime, we prove a Shnirelman-type result: a density-one subsequence of eigenfunctions becomes equidistributed with respect to the Liouville measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.13576v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduced a new flow to the LYZ equation on a compact K\"ahler manifold. We first show the existence of the longtime solution of the flow. We then show that under the Collins-Jacob-Yau's condition on the subsolution, the longtime solution converges to the solution of the LYZ equation, which was solved by Collins-Jacob-Yau [5] by the continuity method. Moreover, as an application of the flow, we show that on a compact K\"ahler surface, if there exists a semi-subsolution of the LYZ equation, then our flow converges smoothly to a singular solution to the LYZ equation away from a finite number of curves of negative self-intersection. Such a solution can be viewed as a boundary point of the moduli space of the LYZ solutions for a given K\"ahler metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.07623v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently it has been proved (Lee-Topping 2022, Deruelle-Schulze-Simon 2022, Lott 2019) that three-dimensional complete manifolds with non-negatively pinched Ricci curvature must be flat or compact, thus confirming a conjecture of Hamilton. In this paper we generalise our work on the existence of Ricci flows from non-compact pinched three-manifolds in order to prove a higher-dimensional analogue. We construct a solution to Ricci flow, for all time, starting with an arbitrary complete non-compact manifold that is PIC1 pinched. As an application we prove that any complete manifold of non-negative complex sectional curvature that is PIC1 pinched must be flat or compact.</description>

      <title>Volume preserving spacetime mean curvature flow and foliations of initial data sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12971v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a volume preserving curvature evolution of surfaces in an asymptotically Euclidean initial data set with positive ADM-energy. The speed is given by a nonlinear function of the mean curvature which generalizes the spacetime mean curvature recently considered by Cederbaum-Sakovich (Calc. Var. PDE, 2021). Following a classical approach by Huisken-Yau (Invent. Math., 1996), we show that the flow starting from suitably round initial surfaces exists for all times and converges to a constant (spacetime) curvature limit. This provides an alternative construction of the CSTMC foliation by Cederbaum-Sakovich and has applications in the definition of center of mass of an isolated system in General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Isotropic embeddings of coadjoint orbits and magnetic geodesic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider isotropic and Lagrangian embeddings of coadjoint orbits of compact Lie groups into products of coadjoint orbits. After reviewing the known facts in the case of $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ we initiate a similar study for $\mathrm{SO}$ and $\mathrm{Sp}$ cases. In the second part we apply this to the study of dynamical systems with $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ symmetry, proving equivalence between systems of two types: those describing magnetic geodesic flow on flag manifolds and classical `spin chains' of a special type.</description>

      <title>Dual pairs of generic conformally flat hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study generic conformally flat (local-)hypersurfaces in the Euclidean 4-space $\mathbb{R}^4$. Such a hypersurface $f$ has the dual (hypersurface) $f^*$ in $\mathbb{R}^4$, which is also generic and conformally flat. By repeating the composite action of inversion and the dual transformation on a hypersurface $f$, infinitely many non-equivalent generic conformally flat hypersurfaces are obtained from a single $f$. The dual $f^*$ is defined by the total differential of the embedding expressed in terms of the original $f$. However, the exact formula in $\mathbb{R}^4$ of $f^*$ is not obvious, because of difficulty of integrating the total differential. Therefore, for the study of generic conformally flat hypersurfaces it is important to clarify in some way an explicit correspondence between the dual pair in $\mathbb{R}^4$. The aim of this paper is to clarify that correspondence between the dual pair $f$ and $f^*$, which we do by making approximate discrete hypersurfaces of $f^*$ for all positive integers $n$ as maps from $3$-dimensional nets in $f$ to $\mathbb{R}^4$. The approximations are constructed from the dual invariants of a generic conformally flat hypersurface $f$, of which dual invariants are defined as the maps from $f$ to $\mathbb{R}^4$, and as $n$ tends to $\infty$, the approximations induce maps between the corresponding curvature surfaces of $f$ and $f^*$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we classify complete, nontrivial shrinking and steady quasi-Yamabe gradient solitons whose scalar curvature is bounded below by the soliton constant. We also classify complete, nontrivial expanding and steady quasi-Yamabe gradient solitons whose scalar curvature is bounded above by the soliton constant.</description>

      <title>Criteria for codimension two singularities of surfaces and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give simple criteria for the singularities appearing on surfaces codimension less than or equal to two. As applications, we give conditions for codimension two singularities that appear in ruled surfaces and center maps of surfaces in the Euclidean space.</description>

      <title>Well-posed geometric boundary data in General Relativity, I: Conformal-mean curvature boundary data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the local in time well-posedness of the initial boundary value problem (IBVP) for the vacuum Einstein equations in general relativity with geometric boundary conditions. For conformal-mean curvature boundary conditions, consisting of the conformal class of the boundary metric and mean curvature of the boundary, well-posedness does not hold without imposing additional angle data at the corner. When the corner angle is included as corner data, we prove well-posedness of the linearized problem in $C^{\infty}$, where the linearization is taken at any smooth vacuum Einstein metric.</description>

      <title>On the Marinus--Ptolemy and Delisle--Euler conical maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine connections between the mathematics behind methods of drawing geographical maps due, on the one hand to Marinos and Ptolemy (1st-2nd c. CE) and on the other hand to Delisle and Euler (18th century). A recent work by the first two authors of this article shows that methods of Delisle and Euler for drawing geographical maps, which are improvements of methods of Marinus and Ptolemy, are best among a collection of geographical maps we term ``conical''. This is an instance where after practitioners and craftsmen (here, geographers) have used a certain tool during several centuries, mathematicians prove that this tool is indeed optimal. Many connections among geography, astronomy and geometry are highlighted. The fact that the Marinos--Ptolemy and the Delisle--Euler methods of drawing geographical maps share many non-trivial properties is an important instance of historical continuity in mathematics.</description>
