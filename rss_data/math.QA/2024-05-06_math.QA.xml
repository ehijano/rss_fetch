      <title>From quantum difference equation to Dubrovin connection of affine type A quiver varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the continuation of the article \cite{Z23}. In this article we will give a detailed analysis of the quantum difference equation of the equivariant $K$-theory of the affine type $A$ quiver varieties. We will give a good representation of the quantum difference operator $\mathbf{M}_{\mathcal{L}}(z)$ such that the monodromy operator $\mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{m}}(z)$in the formula can be written in the $U_{q}(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-form or in the $U_{q}(\hat{\mathfrak{gl}}_1)$-form. We also give the detailed analysis of the connection matrix for the quantum difference equation in the nodal limit $p\rightarrow0$. Using these two results, we prove that the degeneration limit of the quantum difference equation is the Dubrovin connection for the quantum cohomology of the affine type $A$ quiver varieties, and the monodromy representation for the Dubrovin connection is generated by the monodromy operators $\mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{m}}$.</description>

      <title>Deformation maps of quasi-twilled Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a unified approach to study the cohomology theories and deformation theories of various types of operators in the category of Lie algebras, including modified $r$-matrices, crossed homomorphisms, derivations, homomorphisms, relative Rota-Baxter operators, twisted Rota-Baxter operators, Reynolds operators and deformation maps of matched pairs of Lie algebras. The main ingredients are quasi-twilled Lie algebras. We introduce two types of deformation maps of a quasi-twilled Lie algebra. Deformation maps of type I unify modified $r$-matrices, crossed homomorphisms, derivations and homomorphisms between Lie algebras, while deformation maps of type II unify relative Rota-Baxter operators, twisted Rota-Baxter operators, Reynolds operators and deformation maps of matched pairs of Lie algebras. We further give the controlling algebras and cohomologies of these two types of deformation maps, which not only recover the existing results for crossed homomorphisms, derivations, homomorphisms, relative Rota-Baxter operators, twisted Rota-Baxter operators and Reynolds operators, but also leads to some new results which are unable to solve before, e.g. the controlling algebras and cohomologies of modified $r$-matrices and deformation maps of matched pairs of Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Old and new powerful tools for the normal ordering problem and non-commutative binomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive formal general formulas for non-commutative exponentiation and the exponential function, while also revisiting an unrecognized, and yet powerful theorem. These tools are subsequently applied to derive counterparts for the exponential identity $e^{A+B} = e^A e^B$ and the binomial theorem $(A+B)^n = \sum \binom{n}{k} A^k B^{n-k}$ when the commutator $[B, A]$ is either an arbitrary quadratic polynomial or a monomial in $A$ or $B$. Analogous formulas are found when the commutator is bivariate. Furthermore, we introduce a novel operator bridging between the normal and antinormal forms.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Tannaka-Krein reconstruction and quantum automorphism groups of discrete structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define quantum automorphism groups of a wide range of discrete structures. The central tool for their construction is a generalisation of the Tannaka-Krein reconstruction theorem. For any direct sum of matrix algebras $M$, and any concrete unitary 2-category of finite type Hilbert-$M$-bimodules $\mathcal{C}$, under reasonable conditions, we construct an algebraic quantum group $\mathbb{G}$ which acts on $M$ by $\alpha$, such that the category of $\alpha$-equivariant corepresentations of $\mathbb{G}$ on finite type Hilbert-$M$-bimodules is equivalent to $\mathcal{C}$. Moreover, we explicitly describe how to get such categories from connected locally finite discrete structures. As an example, we define the quantum automorphism group of a quantum Cayley graph.</description>

      <title>Modular data of non-semisimple modular categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate non-semisimple modular categories with an eye towards a structure theory, low-rank classification, and applications to low dimensional topology and topological physics. We aim to extend the well-understood theory of semisimple modular categories to the non-semisimple case by using representations of factorizable ribbon Hopf algebras as a case study. We focus on the Cohen-Westreich modular data, which is obtained from the Lyubashenko-Majid modular representation restricted to the Higman ideal of a factorizable ribbon Hopf algebra. The Cohen-Westreich $S$-matrix diagonalizes the mixed fusion rules and reduces to the usual $S$-matrix for semisimple modular categories. The paper includes detailed studies on small quantum groups $U_qsl(2)$ and the Drinfeld doubles of Nichols Hopf algebras, especially the $\mathrm{SL}(2, \mathbb{Z})$-representation on their centers, Cohen-Westreich modular data, and the congruence kernel theorem's validity.</description>

      <title>Reflections on the Larson-Sweedler theorem for (weak) multiplier Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ be an algebra with identity and $\Delta:A\to A\otimes A$ a coproduct that admits a counit. If there exist a faithful left integral and a faithful right integral, one can construct an antipode and $(A,\Delta)$ is a Hopf algebra. This is the Larson-Sweedler theorem. There are generalizations of this result for multiplier Hopf algebras, weak Hopf algebras and weak multiplier Hopf algebras. In the case of a multiplier Hopf algebra, the existence of a counit can be weakened and can be replaced by the requirement that the coproduct is full. A similar result is true for weak multiplier Hopf algebras. What we show in this note is that in fact the result for multiplier Hopf algebras can still be obtained without the condition of fullness of the coproduct. As it turns out, this property will already follow from the other conditions. Consequently, also in the original theorem for Hopf algebras, the existence of a counit is a consequence of the other conditions. This slightly generalizes the original result. The situation for weak multiplier Hopf algebras seems to be more subtle. We discuss the problems and see what is still possible here. We consider these results in connection with the development of the theory of locally compact quantum groups. This is discussed in an appendix.</description>

Abstract: We construct a homomorphism from the affine Yangian associated with $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(q_u-q_{u+1})$ to the universal enveloping algebra of a $W$-algebra associated with $\mathfrak{gl}(\sum_{s=1}^lq_s)$ and a nilpotent element of type $(1^{q_1-q_2},2^{q_2-q_3},\dots,(l-1)^{q_{l-1}-q_l},l^{q_l})$ by using the coproduct and evaluation map for the affine Yangian and the Miura map for non-rectangular $W$-algebras. As an application, we give a homomorphism from the affine Yangian to some cosets of non-rectangular $W$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Zeta zeros and prolate wave operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We integrate in the framework of the semilocal trace formula two recent discoveries on the spectral realization of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function by introducing a semilocal analogue of the prolate wave operator. The latter plays a key role both in the spectral realization of the low lying zeros of zeta--using the positive part of its spectrum--and of their ultraviolet behavior--using the Sonin space which corresponds to the negative part of the spectrum. In the archimedean case the prolate operator is the sum of the square of the scaling operator with the grading of orthogonal polynomials, and we show that this formulation extends to the semilocal case. We prove the stability of the semilocal Sonin space under the increase of the finite set of places which govern the semilocal framework and describe their relation with Hilbert spaces of entire functions. Finally, we relate the prolate operator to the metaplectic representation of the double cover of $\operatorname{SL}(2,\mathbb R)$ with the goal of obtaining (in a forthcoming paper) a second candidate for the semilocal prolate operator.</description>

      <title>Periodic and quasi-motivic pencils of flat connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new notion of a periodic pencil of flat connections on a smooth algebraic variety $X$. This is a family $\nabla(s_1,...,s_n)$ of flat connections on a trivial vector bundle on $X$ depending linearly on parameters $s_1,...,s_n$ and generically invariant, up to isomorphism, under the shifts $s_i\mapsto s_i+1$ for all $i$. If in addition $\nabla$ has regular singularities, we call it a quasi-motivic pencil. We use tools from complex analysis to establish various remarkable properties of such pencils over $\mathbb C$. For example, we show that the monodromy of a quasi-motivic pencil is defined over the field of algebraic functions in $e^{2\pi is_j}$, and that its singularities are constrained to an arrangement of hyperplanes with integer normal vectors. Then we show that many important examples of families of flat connections, such as Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov, Dunkl, and Casimir connections, are quasi-motivic and thus periodic pencils.
  Besides being interesting in its own right, the periodic property of a pencil of flat connections turns out to be very useful in computing the eigenvalues of the $p$-curvature of its reduction to positive characteristic. This will be done in our forthcoming paper.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative divergence and the Turaev cobracket</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16566v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The divergence map, an important ingredient in the algebraic description of the Turaev cobracket on a connected oriented compact surface with boundary, is reformulated in the context of non-commutative geometry using a flat connection on the space of 1-forms on a formally smooth associative algebra. We then extend this construction to the case of associative algebras with any finite cohomological dimension, which allows us to give a similar algebraic description of the Turaev cobracket on a closed surface. We also look into a relation between the Satoh trace and the divergence map on a free Lie algebra via geometry over Lie operad.</description>

      <title>Two Homomorphisms from the affine Yangian associated with $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n)$ to the affine Yangian associated with $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n+1)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a homomorphism from the affine Yangian $Y_{\hbar,\varepsilon+\hbar}(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n))$ to the affine Yangian $Y_{\hbar,\varepsilon}(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n+1))$ which is different from the one in arXiv:2312.09933. By using this homomorphism, we give a homomorphism from $Y_{\hbar,\varepsilon}(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n))\otimes Y_{\hbar,\varepsilon+n\hbar}(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(m))$ to $Y_{\hbar,\varepsilon}(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(m+n))$. As an application, we construct a homomorphism from the affine Yangian $Y_{\hbar,\varepsilon+n\hbar}(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(m))$ to the centralizer algebra of the pair of affine Lie algebras $(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}(m+n),\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}(n))$ and the coset vertex algebra of the pair of rectangular $W$-algebras $(\mathcal{W}^k(\mathfrak{gl}(2m+2n),(2^{m+n})),\mathcal{W}^{k+m}(\mathfrak{sl}(2n),(2^{n})))$.</description>
