      <title>Further Classes of Series Involving Central Binomial Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Departing from a class of infinite series with central binomial coefficients in the numerator and depending on a positive integer parameter, we first extend known identities to all complex parameters. Then we use various methods, including exponential Bell polynomials and integral representations, to further extend these results. Throughout the paper, we make extensive use of the gamma and polygamma functions and their properties.</description>

      <title>Generalized Cotangent Series and Links Zeta and Theta Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a generalized cotangent-type series, extending classical expansions to higher-order lattice sums. By introducing a new family of series indexed by integer powers, we derive closed form representations that combine trigonometric and hyperbolic structures, uncover recursive patterns, and establish integral connections to generalized Jacobi theta functions. The analysis reveals deep structural relationships between lattice summations, values of the Riemann zeta function, and modular kernels of theta type. Using techniques such as contour integration, Mellin transforms, and factorization identities, we obtain new expressions for even zeta values and formulate integral identities linking these series to generalized theta functions. These results unify classical expansions of trigonometric and hyperbolic cotangent functions within a broader analytic framework, offering new insights into modular forms.</description>

      <title>Counting the number of $2$-periodic $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$-and $\mathbb{F}_{p}[t]$-points of a discrete dynamical system with applications from arithmetic statistics, VI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this follow-up paper, we again inspect a surprising relationship between the set of $2$-periodic points of a polynomial map $\varphi_{d, c}$ defined by $\varphi_{d, c}(z) = z^d + c$ for all $c, z \in \mathbb{Z}_{p}$ or $c, z \in \mathbb{F}_{p}[t]$ and the coefficient $c$, where $d&gt;2$ is an integer. As before, we again wish to study counting problems that are inspired by advances on $2$-torsion point-counting in arithmetic statistics and $2$-periodic point-counting in arithmetic dynamics. In doing so, we then first prove that for any prime $p\geq 3$ and for any $\ell \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$, the average number of distinct $2$-periodic $p$-adic integral points of any $\varphi_{p^{\ell}, c}$ modulo $p\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ is bounded or zero or unbounded as $c\to \infty$; and then prove that for any prime $p\geq 5$ and for any $\ell\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$, the average number of distinct $2$-periodic $p$-adic integral points of any $\varphi_{(p-1)^{\ell}, c}$ modulo $p\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ is $1$ or $2$ or $0$ as $c\to \infty$. Motivated by periodic $\mathbb{F}_{p}(t)$-point-counting in arithmetic dynamics, we then also prove that for any prime $p\geq 3$ and for any $\ell \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$, the average number of distinct $2$-periodic points of any $\varphi_{p^{\ell}, c}$ modulo prime $\pi$ is bounded or zero or unbounded as $c$ varies; and then prove that for any prime $p\geq 5$ and for any $\ell \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$, the average number of distinct $2$-periodic points of any $\varphi_{(p-1)^{\ell}, c}$ modulo prime $\pi$ is $1$ or $2$ or $0$ as $c$ varies. Finally, we apply density, field-counting, and Sato-Tate equidistribution results from arithmetic statistics, and then obtain counting and statistical results on irreducible polynomials, number (function) fields, and Artin $L$-functions that arise naturally in our polynomial discrete dynamical settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A class number formula is proved for extended ring class fields $L_{\mathcal{O},9}$ over imaginary quadratic fields $K_d = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-d})$, in which the prime $p = 3$ splits, by determining the fields generated by the periodic points of a well-chosen algebraic function. The number of periodic points of a given period $n \ge 2$ for this algebraic function equals six times the sum of class numbers of imaginary quadratic orders $\textsf{R}_{-d}$, for which the Artin symbol for a prime ideal divisor $\wp_3$ in $K_d$ of $3$ has order $n$ in the Galois group of $F_d/K_d$, where $F_d$ is the inertia field of $\wp_3$ in $L_{\mathcal{O},9}/K_d$.</description>

      <title>Residues of Terms of Lucas Sequences Modulo $3^k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fibonacci sequence defined by $F_0=0$, $F_1=1$, and $F_n=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}$ has a shortest period length of $4\cdot 3^{k-1}$ modulo $3^k$ for every $k\in\mathbb{N}$. In 2011, Bundschuh and Bundschuh \cite{bundschuh3} gave the frequencies of every residue $0\leq b\leq 3^k-1$ in this shortest period. In particular, their result implies that the Fibonacci sequences is not stable modulo $3$. Here we extend this result to other Lucas sequences. More specifically, we give analogous results for Lucas sequences defined by $\left(u_n\right)_n$ with $u_0=0$, $u_1=1$, and $u_n=Pu_{n-1}+u_{n-2}$ for all $n\geq 2$, as well as Lucas sequences defined by $\left(v_n\right)_n$ with $v_0=2$, $v_1=P$, and $v_n=Pv_{n-1}+v_{n-2}$ for all $n\geq 2$. In particular, our result implies that none of these Lucas sequences are stable modulo $3$ either.</description>

      <title>On the cohomological dimension of Siegel modular varieties and the modularity of formal Siegel modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the coherent cohomological dimension of the Siegel modular variety $A_{g,\Gamma}$ is at most $g(g+1)/2-2$ for $g\geq 2$. As a corollary, we show that the boundary of the compactified Siegel modular variety satisfies the Grothendieck-Lefschetz condition. This implies, in particular, that formal Siegel modular forms of genus $g\geq2$ are automatically classical Siegel modular forms. Our result generalizes the work of Bruinier and Raum on the modularity of formal Siegel modular forms.</description>

      <title>On almost strong approximation for linear algebraic groups over number fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected linear algebraic group over a number field $K$. We study the almost strong approximation property (ASA) of $G$ raised by Rapinchuk and Tralle, and we give a necessary and sufficient condition for (ASA) to hold in terms of the Brauer group of $G$, by using Demarche's results on strong approximation with Brauer-Manin obstruction. Using the criteria, it turns out that (ASA) can be completely controlled by the Dirichlet density of the places and the splitting field of $G$, which generalizes a result of Rapinchuk and Tralle.</description>

      <title>Multiple polylogarithms, a regularisation process and an admissible open domain of convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the analytic properties of the multiple polylogarithms in the $s$-aspect. Although the domain of absolute convergence of the series defining the multiple polylogarithms is well-known, the study towards a larger open domain of (conditional) convergence has been limited, particularly when the depth is $\ge 2$. Here, we exhibit a larger open domain of (conditional) convergence for this series by writing certain translation formulas satisfied by them. The series moreover defines a holomorphic function in this open set. We then introduce a regularisation process for the multiple polylogarithms, extending an earlier work of the second author. This regularisation process requires a generalisation of the Euler-Boole summation formula that we derive in the appendix of this article. The regularisation process leads to a larger open domain, where the series (conditionally) converges at integer points. The holomorphicity at such points is a more delicate question and this regularisation process is to be used to study the local behaviour of the multiple polylogarithms around such points.</description>

      <title>On the Classification of Dillon's APN Hexanomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we undertake a systematic analysis of a class of hexanomial functions over finite fields of characteristic 2 proposed by Dillon in 2006 as potential candidates for almost perfect nonlinear (APN) functions, pushing the analysis a lot further than what has been done via the partial APN concept in (Budaghyan et al., DCC 2020). These functions, defined over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ where $q=2^n$, have the form $F(x) = x(Ax^2 + Bx^q + Cx^{2q}) + x^2(Dx^q + Ex^{2q}) + x^{3q}.$ Using algebraic number theory and methods on algebraic varieties over finite fields, we establish necessary conditions on the coefficients $A, B, C, D, E$ that must hold for the corresponding function to be APN. Our main contribution is a comprehensive case-by-case analysis that systematically excludes large classes of Dillon's hexanomials from being APN based on the vanishing patterns of certain key polynomials in the coefficients. Through a combination of number theory, algebraic-geometric techniques and computational verification, we identify specific algebraic obstructions-including the existence of absolutely irreducible components in associated varieties and degree incompatibilities in polynomial factorizations-that prevent these functions from achieving optimal differential uniformity. Our results significantly narrow the search space for new APN functions within this family and provide a theoretical roadmap applicable to other classes of potential APN functions. We complement our theoretical work with extensive computations. Through exhaustive searches on $\mathbb{F}_{2^2}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{2^4}$ and random sampling on $\mathbb{F}_{2^6}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{2^8}$, we identified thousands of APN hexanomials, many of which are not CCZ-equivalent to the known Budaghyan-Carlet family (Budaghyan-Carlet, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th., 2008).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In their study of a binomial sum related to Wolstenholme's theorem, Chamberland and Dilcher prove that the corresponding sequence modulo primes $p$ satisfies congruences that are analogous to Lucas' theorem for the binomial coefficients with the notable twist that there is a restriction on the $p$-adic digits. We prove a general result that shows that similar partial Lucas congruences are satisfied by all sequences representable as the constant terms of the powers of a multivariate Laurent polynomial.</description>

      <title>Product of Eisenstein series with multiplicative power series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say a power series $a_0+a_1q+a_2q^2+\cdots$ is \emph{multiplicative} if $n\mapsto a_n/a_1$ for positive integers $n$ is a multiplicative function. Given the Eisenstein series $E_{2k}(q)$, we consider formal multiplicative power series $g(q)$ such that the product $E_{2k}(q)g(q)$ is also multiplicative. For fixed $k$, this requirement leads to an infinite system of polynomial equations in the coefficients of $g(q)$. The initial coefficients can be analyzed using elimination theory. Using the theory of modular forms, we prove that each solution for the initial coefficients of $g(q)$ leads to one and only one solution for the whole power series, which is always a quasimodular form. In this way, we determine all solutions of the system for $k \le 20$.
  For general $k$, we can regard the system of polynomial equations as living over a symbolic ring. Although this system is beyond the reach of computer algebra packages, we can use a specialization argument to prove it is generically inconsistent. This is delicate because resultants commute with specialization only when the leading coefficients do not specialize to $0$. Using a Newton polygon argument, we are able to compute the relevant degrees and justify the claim that for $k$ sufficiently large, there are no solutions.
  These results support the conjecture that $E_{2k}(q)g(q)$ can be multiplicative only for $k = 2, 3, 4, 5, 7$.</description>

      <title>Fine-grained deterministic hardness of the shortest vector problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\gamma$-$\mathsf{GapSVP}_p$ be the decision version of the shortest vector problem in the $\ell_p$-norm with approximation factor $\gamma$, let $n$ be the lattice dimension and $0&lt;\varepsilon\leq 1$. We prove that the following statements hold for infinitely many values of $p$.
  $(2-\varepsilon)$-$\mathsf{GapSVP}_p$ is not in $O\left(2^{O(p)}\cdot n^{O(1)}\right)$-time, unless $\text{P}=\text{NP}$.
  $(2-\varepsilon)$-$\mathsf{GapSVP}_p$ is not in $O\left(2^{2^{o(p)}}\cdot 2^{o(n)}\right)$-time, unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis is false.
  The proofs are based on a Karp reduction from a variant of the subset-sum problem that imposes restrictions on vectors orthogonal to the vector of its weights. While more extensive hardness results for the shortest vector problem in all $\ell_p$-norms have already been established under randomized reductions, the results in this paper are fully deterministic.</description>

      <title>Quadratic points on double planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zariski dense collections of quadratic points on curves $X$ are well-understood by results of Harris--Silverman and Vojta, but when $\dim X \geq 2$ there is not an analogous geometric characterization, even conjecturally. In this note we consider the case of a double cover $\pi \colon X \to \mathbb{P}^r$, where Hilbert's Irreducibility Theorem implies that the quadratic points in the fibers of $\pi$ are dense. We show that Vojta's Conjecture implies that, once the canonical bundle of $X$ is sufficiently positive, there are no other sources of Zariski dense quadratic points. This is complemented by several examples of surfaces $X \to \mathbb{P}^2$ with an additional source of dense quadratic points.</description>

      <title>Modular forms for \(\mathrm{GL}(r, \mathbb{F}_{q}[T])\): Hecke operators and growth of expansion coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the action of the Hecke operators \(T_{\mathfrak{p},i}\) on the coefficient forms \(g_{1}, \dots, g_{r-1}, g_{r} = \Delta\), and \(h\), which together generate the ring of modular forms for \(\mathrm{GL}(r, \mathbf{F}_{q}[T])\). All these are eigenforms with powers of \(\pi\) as eigenvalues, where \(\pi\) is the monic generator of the prime ideal \(\mathfrak{p}\) of \(\mathbb{F}_{q}[T]\). We further describe the growth of the \(t\)-expansion coefficients of the discriminant function \(\Delta\). It is such that the product expansion of \(\Delta\) as well as the \(t\)-expansion of each modular form converges on the natural fundamental domain for \(\mathrm{GL}(r, \mathbf{F}_{q}[T])\).</description>

      <title>Arithmetic Properties of Several Generalized-Constant Sequences, with Implications for ${\Gamma^{\left(n\right)}\left(1\right)}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neither the Euler-Mascheroni constant, $\gamma = 0.577215...$, nor the Euler-Gompertz constant, $\delta = 0.596347...$, is currently known to be irrational. However, it has been proved that at least one of them is transcendental. The two constants are related by a well-known equation of Hardy, equivalent to $\gamma + \delta/e = \mathrm{Ein}(1)$, which recently has been generalized to $\gamma^{(n)} + \delta^{(n)}/e = \eta^{(n)}$; $n \ge 0$ for sequences of constants $\gamma^{(n)}$, $\delta^{(n)}$, and $\eta^{(n)}$ (given respectively by full, conditional, and partial moments of the Gumbel(0,1) probability distribution). We first investigate the $\gamma^{(n)}$ through recurrence relations, revealing that at least one of the pair {$\gamma,\gamma^{(2)}$} and at least two of the set {$\gamma,\gamma^{(n)},\gamma^{(n+1)},\ldots,\gamma^{(2n)}$} (for all $n \ge 2$) are transcendental. This result implies $\Gamma^{(n)}(1)$ is transcendental infinitely often for $n \ge 1$. We then show, via a theorem of Shidlovskii, that the $\eta^{(n)}$ are algebraically independent (and therefore transcendental) for all $n \ge 0$, implying further that at least one of each pair, {$\gamma^{(n)},\delta^{(n)}/e$} and {$\gamma^{(n)},\delta^{(n)}$}, and at least two of the triple {$\gamma^{(n)},\delta^{(n)}/e,\delta^{(n)}$}, are transcendental for all $n \ge 1$. Finally, we provide parallel results for the sequences $\tilde{\delta}^{(n)}$ and $\tilde{\eta}^{(n)}$ satisfying the "non-alternating analogue" equation $\gamma^{(n)} + \tilde{\delta}^{(n)}/e = \tilde{\eta}^{(n)}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an effective, probabilistic version of Deligne's `th\'eor\`eme du pgcd' for a smooth, projective, geometrically integral (\textit{nice}) variety $X_{0}\subset \mathbb{P}^{N}$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ of dimension $n$ and degree $D$, obtained via good reduction from a nice variety $\mathcal{X}_{0}$ over a number field $K$ at a prime $\mathfrak{p}\subset \mathcal{O}_{K}$. The main ingredients include bounding torsion in the Betti cohomology of $\mathcal{X}_{0}$, a mod -- $\ell$ big monodromy result and equidistribution of Frobenius in the representation associated to the sheaf of vanishing cycles modulo $\ell$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show, using the techniques developed in \cite{DESTate,DET2023mittagintersectionflat}, that dagger algebras and Tate algebras in the sense of Berkovich in prime characteristic $p &gt; 0$ have intersection flat Frobenius. Equivalently, if $S$ is such a ring, then $S^{1/p}$ is a flat and Mittag-Leffler $S$-module. As a consequence, we deduce that any ideal-adic completion of a reduced ring that is essentially of finite type over a dagger algebra or a Berkovich Tate algebra in prime characteristic has big test elements from tight closure theory.</description>

Abstract: We introduce Frobenius-untwists of the variants of topological cyclic homology, following Manam. Using these, we construct modifications of the free loop space over the sphere spectrum, and show that they provide even periodic spectral enhancements of the prismatization stacks of Bhatt-Lurie and Drinfeld. We identify the extra structure on prismatization encoded in the even periodic enhancements with previously-known structures, such as the Breuil-Kisin twists and the Drinfeld formal group.</description>

      <title>Some Mizohata-Takeuchi-type estimate for exponential sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $R^{\frac{1}{2}}$ be a large integer, and $\omega$ be a nonnegative weight in the $R$-ball $B_R=[0,R]^2$ such that $\omega(B_R)\le R$. For any complex sequence $\{a_n\}$, define the quadratic exponential sum \[ G(x,t)=\sum_{n=1}^{R^{\frac{1}{2}}} a_n e\big(\frac{n}{R^{\frac{1}{2}}} x+\frac{n^2}{R} t\big). \] It holds that \[ \int |G|^2 \omega \lessapprox \sup_{T}\omega(T)^{\frac{1}{2}}\cdot R \,\|a_n\|_{l^2}^2 \] where $T$ ranges over $R\times R^{\frac{1}{2}}$ tubes in $B_R$. The proof is established through exploring the distributions of superlevel sets of the $G$ function. It is based on the $TT^*$ method and the circle method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate lattice-counting problems associated with symplectic forms from the perspective of homogeneous dynamics. In the qualitative direction, we establish an analog of Margulis theorem for symplectic forms, proving density results for tuples of vectors. Quantitatively, we derive a volume formula having a certain growth rate, and use this and Rogers' formulas for a higher rank Siegel transform to obtain the asymptotic formulas of the counting function associated with a generic symplectic form. We further establish primitive and congruent analogs of the generic quantitative result. For the primitive case, we show that the lack of completely explicit higher moment formulas for a primitive higher rank Siegel transform does not obstruct obtaining quantitative statements.</description>

      <title>Counting algebraic tori over $\mathbb{Q}$ by Artin conductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.02855v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we count the number $N_n^{\text{tor}}(X)$ of $n$-dimensional algebraic tori over $\mathbb{Q}$ whose Artin conductor of the associated character is bounded by $X$. This can be understood as a generalization of counting number fields of given degree by discriminant. We suggest a conjecture on the asymptotics of $N_n^{\text{tor}}(X)$ and prove that this conjecture follows from Malle's conjecture for tori over $\mathbb{Q}$. We also prove that $N_2^{\text{tor}}(X) \ll_{\varepsilon} X^{1 + \varepsilon}$, and this upper bound can be improved to $N_2^{\text{tor}}(X) \ll_{\varepsilon} X (\log X)^{1 + \varepsilon}$ under the assumption of the Cohen-Lenstra heuristics for $p=3$.</description>

Abstract: We study the prime values of Ramanujan's tau function $\tau(n)$. Lehmer found that $n=251^2=63001$ is the smallest $n$ such that $\tau(n)$ is prime: $$\tau(251^2)=-80561663527802406257321747.$$ We prove that in most arithmetic progressions (mod 23), the prime values $\tau$ belonging to the progression form a thin set. As a consequence, there exists a set of primes of Dirichlet density $\frac{9}{11}$ which are not values of $\tau$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an Andr\'e--Oort-type result for a family of hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{C}^n$ that is both uniform and effective. Let $K_*$ denote the single exceptional imaginary quadratic field which occurs in the Siegel--Tatuzawa lower bound for the class number. We prove that, for $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}_{&gt;0}$, there exists an effective constant $c(m, n)&gt;0$ with the following property: if pairwise distinct singular moduli $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ with respective discriminants $\Delta_1, \ldots, \Delta_n$ are such that $a_1 x_1^m + \ldots + a_n x_n^m \in \mathbb{Q}$ for some $a_1, \ldots, a_n \in \mathbb{Q} \setminus \{0\}$ and $\# \{ \Delta_i : \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{\Delta_i}) = K_*\} \leq 1$, then $\max_i \lvert \Delta_i \rvert \leq c(m, n)$. In addition, we prove an unconditional and completely explicit version of this result when $(m, n) = (1, 3)$ and thereby determine all the triples $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ of singular moduli such that $a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + a_3 x_3 \in \mathbb{Q}$ for some $a_1, a_2, a_3 \in \mathbb{Q} \setminus \{0\}$.</description>

We show that $\mathcal{N}_K$ is a finite set if $K$ does not contain any real quadratic subfield. In the case where $K$ is a cubic field, we also explicitly classify all solutions to the unit equation $\varepsilon + \delta = n$ when $K$ is either cyclic or has negative discriminant.</description>

      <title>Hasse norm principle for metacyclic extensions with trivial Schur multiplier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14365v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a global field, $K/k$ be a finite separable field extension and $L/k$ be the Galois closure of $K/k$ with Galois groups $G={\rm Gal}(L/k)$ and $H={\rm Gal}(L/K)\lneq G$. In 1931, Hasse proved that if $G$ is cyclic, then the Hasse norm principle holds for $K/k$. We show that if $G$ is metacyclic with trivial Schur multiplier $M(G)=0$, then $H$ is cyclic and the Hasse norm principle holds for $K/k$. Some examples of metacyclic, dihedral, quasidihedral, modular, generalized quaternion, extraspecial groups and $Z$-groups $G$ with trivial Schur multiplier $M(G)=0$ are given. These provide new examples which the Hasse norm principle hold for non-Galois extensions $K/k$ whose Galois closure is $L/k$ with metacyclic $G={\rm Gal}(L/k)$ and $M(G)=0$.</description>

      <title>Stratification theorems for exponential sums in families</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We survey some of the stratification theorems concerning exponential sums over finite fields, especially those due to Katz-Laumon and Fouvry-Katz, as well as some of their applications. Moreover, motivated partly by recent work of Bonolis, Pierce and Woo (arXiv:2505.11226), we prove that these stratification statements admit uniform variants in families, both algebraically and analytically.
  The paper includes an Appendix by Forey, Fres\'an and Kowalski (excerpted from arXiv:2109.11961), which provides an elementary intuitive introduction to trace functions in more than one variable over finite fields.</description>

      <title>Improvement of effective Erdos-Wintner theorem for Zeckendorf expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the effective Erdos-Wintner theorem for Zeckendorf expansions. Drmota and the author obtained a uniform Kolmogorov bound whose error involves $T\sum_{j&gt;L-2h}|f(F_j)|$, which assumes absolute convergence of the linear tail $\sum_j f(F_j)$. We remove this assumption. Grouping the transfer matrices in pairs and working to second order on the logarithm of the product, after extracting the common linear phase along the dominant direction, yields a quadratic tail $T^2\sum_{j&gt;L-2h} f(F_j)^2$, or, in a flexible variant, the split tail $T\sum_{|f(F_j)|&gt;1/T}|f(F_j)| + T^2\sum_{|f(F_j)|\le 1/T} f(F_j)^2$. Either form requires only $\sum f(F_j)^2&lt;\infty$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study certain new relative trace formulas on (non-reductive) period integrals involving Weil representations, in the context of the relative Langlands program. We study normal representatives using Galois theory, and establish geometric decompositions of relative trace formulas using normal representatives for good test functions. By comparing global representatives, local distributions and orbital integrals, we prove the twisted Gan--Gross--Prasad (GGP) conjecture on Asai L-functions, in any dimension under some local assumptions, allowing ramifications of number fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every LCA group has a Haar measure unique up to rescaling by a positive scalar. Clausen has shown that the Haar measure describes the universal determinant functor of the category LCA in the sense of Deligne. We show that when only working with LCA groups without allowing real vector spaces, any conceivable determinant functor is unique up to rescaling by at worst rational values. As a result, no transcendental real nor p-adic regulators could ever show up in special L-value conjectures (as in Tamagawa number conjectures or Weil-etale cohomology) if anyone had the, admittedly outlandish and bizarre, idea to try to circumvent incorporating a real (Betti) realization of the motive.</description>

      <title>Modular Periodicity of Random Initialized Recurrences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical studies of the Fibonacci sequence focus on its periodicity modulo $m$ (the Pisano periods) with canonical initialization. We investigate instead the complete periodic structure arising from all $m^2$ possible initializations in $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$. We discover perfect chiral symmetry between the Fibonacci recurrence $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ and its parity transform $a_n = - a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ and observe fractal self-similarity in the extension from prime to prime power moduli. Additionally, we classify prime moduli based on their quadratic reciprocity and demonstrate that periodic sequences exhibit weight preservation under modular extension. Furthermore, we define a minima distribution $P(n)$ governed by Lucas ratios, which satisfies the symmetric relation $P(n)=P(1-n)$. For cyclotomic recurrences, we propose explicit counting functions for the number of distinct periods with connections to necklace enumeration. These findings imply potential connections to Viswanath's random recurrence, modular forms and L-functions.</description>

      <title>Affine Hecke algebras and symmetric quasi-polynomial duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper with Sahi and Stokman, we introduced quasi-polynomial generalizations of Macdonald polynomials for arbitrary root systems via a new class of representations of the double affine Hecke algebra. These objects depend on a deformation parameter $q$, Hecke parameters, and an additional torus parameter. In this paper, we study $\textit{antisymmetric}$ and $\textit{symmetric}$ quasi-polynomial analogs of Macdonald polynomials in the $q \rightarrow \infty$ limit. We provide explicit decomposition formulas for these objects in terms of classical Demazure-Lusztig operators and partial symmetrizers, and relate them to Macdonald polynomials with prescribed symmetry in the same limit. We also provide a complete characterization of (anti-)symmetric quasi-polynomials in terms of partially (anti-)symmetric polynomials. As an application, we obtain formulas for metaplectic spherical Whittaker functions associated to arbitrary root systems. For $GL_{r}$, this recovers some recent results of Brubaker, Buciumas, Bump, and Gustafsson, and proves a precise statement of their conjecture about a "parahoric-metaplectic" duality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to develop extreme value theory for $\vartheta$-expansions. We establish the limit distribution of the maximum value in a $\vartheta$-continued fraction mixing stationary stochastic process, along with some related results. These findings are analogous to the theorems of J. Galambos and W. Philipp for regular continued fractions. Additionally, we emphasize that a Borel-Bernstein type theorem plays a crucial role.</description>

      <title>Representability of G-functions as rational functions in hypergeometric series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fres\'an and Jossen have given a negative answer to a question of Siegel about the representability of every $E$-function as a polynomial with algebraic coefficients in $E$-functions of type ${}_pF_q[\underline{a};\underline{b};\gamma x^{q-p+1}]$ with $q\geq p\geq 0$, $\gamma \in \overline{\mathbb Q}$ and rational parameters $\underline{a}, \underline{b}$. In this paper, we study, in a more general context, a similar question for $G$-functions asked by Fischler and the second author: can every $G$-function be represented as a polynomial with algebraic coefficients in $G$-functions of type $\mu(x)\cdot {}_pF_{p-1}[\underline{a};\underline{b};\lambda(x)]$ with $p\ge 1$, rational parameters $\underline{a},\underline{b}$ and $\mu,\lambda$ algebraic over $\mathbb Q(x)$ with $\lambda(0)=0$? They have shown the answer to be negative under a generalization of Grothendieck's Period Conjecture and a technical assumption on the~$\lambda$'s. Using differential Galois theory, we prove that, for every $N\in \mathbb N$, there exists a $G$-function which can not be represented as a rational function with coefficients in $\overline{\mathbb C(x)}$ of solutions of linear differential equations with coefficients in $\mathbb C(x)$ and at most $N$ singularities in $\mathbb{P}^1 (\mathbb C)$. As a corollary, we deduce that not all $G$-functions can be represented as a rational function in hypergeometric series of the above mentioned type, when the $\lambda$'s are rational functions with degrees of their numerators and denominators bounded by an arbitrarily large fixed constant. This provides an unconditional negative answer to the question asked by Fischler and the second author for such~$\lambda$'s.</description>

      <title>Unitary discriminants of characters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Together with David Schlang we computed the discriminants of the invariant Hermitian forms for all indicator $o$ even degree absolutely irreducible characters of the ATLAS groups supplementing the tables of orthogonal determinants computed in collaboration with Richard Parker, Tobias Braun and Thomas Breuer. The methods that are used in the unitary case are described in this paper. A character has a well defined unitary discriminant, if and only if it is unitary stable, i.e. all irreducible unitary constituents have even degree. Computations for large degree characters are only possible because of a new method called {\em unitary condensation}. A suitable automorphism helps to single out a square class of the real subfield of the character field consisting of representatives of the discriminant of the invariant Hermitian forms. This square class can then be determined modulo enough primes.</description>

Abstract: The main goal of this note is to show that the local L-packet of Fargues-Scholze [FS], corresponding to an elliptic L-parameter, has an endoscopic decomposition. Our argument is strongly motivated by a beautiful paper of Chenji Fu [Fu], where the stable case is proven. To put our results in a more general context, we also construct a general endoscopic decomposition over complex numbers based on results of Arthur, and a generalization of this decomposition over an arbitrary algebraically closed field of characteristic zero based on a recent work [KSV].</description>

Abstract: Let $\Gamma &lt; G$ be an arithmetic lattice in a noncompact connected semisimple real algebraic group. For many such $G$ of rank at most $2$, in particular $G = \operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb R)$, we prove effective equidistribution of large translates of tori in $G/\Gamma$. As an application, we obtain an asymptotic counting formula with a power saving error term for integral $3 \times 3$ matrices with a specified characteristic polynomial. These effectivize celebrated theorems of Eskin-Mozes-Shah.</description>

      <title>On Shilov boundaries, Rees valuations and integral extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore an analogy between, on one hand, the notions of integral closure of ideals and Rees valuations in commutative algebra and, on the other hand, the notions of spectral seminorm and Shilov boundary in nonarchimedean geometry. For any Tate ring $\mathcal{A}$ with a Noetherian ring of definition $\mathcal{A}_{0}$ and pseudo-uniformizer $\varpi\in\mathcal{A}_{0}$, we prove that the Shilov boundary for $\mathcal{A}$ naturally coincides with the set of Rees valuation rings of the principal ideal $(\varpi)_{\mathcal{A}_{0}}$ of $\mathcal{A}_{0}$.
  Furthermore, we characterize the Shilov boundary for a wide class of Tate rings by means of minimal open prime ideals in the subring of power-bounded elements. For affinoid algebras, in the sense of Tate, whose underlying rings are integral domains, this recovers a well-known result of Berkovich. Moreover, under some mild assumptions, we prove stability of our characterization of the Shilov boundary under (completed) integral extensions. In particular, for every mixed-characteristic Noetherian domain $R$, we obtain a description of the Shilov boundary for the Tate ring $\widehat{R^{+}}[p^{-1}]$, where $\widehat{R^{+}}$ is the $p$-adic completion of the absolute integral closure of the domain $R$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Refined BPS indices give rise to a quantum Riemann-Hilbert problem that is inherently related to a non-commutative deformation of moduli spaces arising in gauge and string theory compactifications. We reformulate this problem in terms of a non-commutative deformation of a TBA-like equation and obtain its formal solution as an expansion in refined indices. As an application of this construction, we derive a generating function of solutions of the TBA equation in the unrefined case.</description>

      <title>Computing intrinsic volumes of sublevel sets and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intrinsic volumes are fundamental geometric invariants generalizing volume, surface area, and mean width for convex bodies. We establish a unified Laplace-Grassmannian representation for intrinsic and dual volumes of convex polynomial sublevel sets. More precisely, let $f$ be a convex $d$-homogeneous polynomial of even degree $d \ge 2$ which is positive except at the origin. We show that the intrinsic and dual volumes of the sublevel set $[f \le 1]$ admit Laplace-type integral formulas obtained by averaging the infimal projection and restriction of $f$ over the Grassmannian. This explicit representation yields three main consequences: (1) L\"owner--John-type existence and uniqueness results extending beyond the classical volume case; (2) a block decomposition principle describing factorization of intrinsic volumes under direct-sum splitting; (3) a coordinate-free formulation of Lipschitz-type lattice discrepancy bounds. These formulas enable analytic treatment of a broad class of geometric quantities, providing direct access to variational and arithmetic applications as well as new structural insights.</description>
