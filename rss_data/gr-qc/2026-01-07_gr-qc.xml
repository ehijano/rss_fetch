      <title>Primordial Black Hole Formation in $f(R)=R+\alpha R^2$ Gravity: Perturbative and Non-Perturbative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete analytic and semi-analytic study of gravitational collapse and primordial black hole (PBH) formation in the quadratic $f(R)$ model $f(R)=R+\alpha R^2$. We first derive the perturbative expansion around General Relativity (GR), working to first order in the small parameter $\alpha$. For a collapsing flat FLRW dust interior we compute the explicit first-order corrections to the scale factor, the stellar radius, and the horizon formation time. We then use these results to obtain the shift in the PBH formation threshold $\delta_c$. The perturbative effect is small for PBHs forming in the deep radiation era, but becomes important when the background curvature is high. To access this early regime we reformulate the theory in the Einstein frame, where the model becomes GR plus the scalaron field $\phi$ with the Starobinsky potential. We provide the complete ODE system governing both the cosmological background and the evolution of an overdense closed FLRW patch. This system can be numerically integrated to obtain the critical overdensity $\delta_c(k)$ for PBH formation near the end of inflation.</description>

      <title>Resonances in b-EMRIs: playing the black hole piano</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar-mass binaries evolving in the vicinity of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) may be common in the universe, either in active galactic nuclei or in other astrophysical environments. Here, we study in detail the resonant excitation of SMBH modes driven by a nearby stellar-mass binary. The resulting resonant energy fluxes vary with the orbital location and frequency of the binary, exhibiting a rich and complex structure. In particular, we find that the total energy flux radiated to infinity is maximized at a gravitational-wave frequency that is close to, but not exactly equal to, the real part of the corresponding quasinormal-mode frequency. Moreover, as the binary is moved farther away from the SMBH, this offset from the mode frequency becomes increasingly pronounced. In addition, for suitable orientations, the binary can effectively ``feed'' the light ring of the SMBH, selectively exciting particular oscillation modes. For rotating (Kerr) black holes, the mode spectrum is significantly more intricate; however, individual modes are also less strongly damped, leading to an enhanced - but more difficult to interpret - resonant response.</description>

      <title>Saving the Unruh Signal: Coherent Cancellation of Spontaneous Emission with Entangled Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Unruh effect is notoriously difficult to detect, as it is exponentially overwhelmed by Wigner--Weisskopf spontaneous emission. We show that this fundamental obstacle can be overcome by harnessing multi-detector quantum interference. By preparing a system of three entangled Unruh--DeWitt detectors in a specific W-state, the spontaneous emission channels can be forced to destructively interfere and vanish, thereby "saving" the Unruh signal by coherently silencing this dominant noise. Our central result is the derivation of the condition for complete and simultaneous cancellation of all right- and left-traveling emission modes. We find this requires preparing the detectors in a unique entangled state whose real-valued coefficients are fixed by an elegant geometric constraint, given by a ratio of sines of the logarithms of the detector accelerations. This work establishes multi-detector entanglement as a precision tool for noise cancellation in relativistic quantum settings, offering a new pathway toward the definitive observation of the Unruh signal.</description>

      <title>Hints Beyond $\Lambda$CDM from Barrow and Tsallis Holographic Dark Energy with GO cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barrow and Tsallis Holographic Dark Energy (HDE) are two recent extensions of the standard HDE framework, obtained by introducing generalized entropy corrections through the Barrow and Tsallis formalisms. In this work, we examine the cosmological consequences of Barrow and Tsallis HDE implemented with the Granda-Oliveros (GO) infrared (IR) cutoff. After deriving the modified Friedmann equations within the thermodynamic-gravity conjecture, we study the background evolution in both non-interacting and interacting dark sector scenarios, emphasizing the role of the entropic parameter in shaping late-time dynamics. We then confront the model with state-of-the-art observations, including PantheonPlus and Union3 Type Ia supernovae, Cosmic Chronometers and DESI DR2 BAO measurements. Using Bayesian MCMC methods, we constrain the model parameters and compare the performance of BHDE with that of $\Lambda$CDM. Our results show that BHDE is compatible with current data and can exhibit a mild statistical preference over the concordance model for certain dataset combinations. Overall, the analysis underscores the relevance of generalized entropy frameworks in late-time cosmology and identifies Barrow-Tsallis holography with the GO cutoff as a competitive alternative to $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Exploring Lorentz Violation in Spacetime through Universal Finsler Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finsler geometry serves as a fundamental and natural extension of Riemannian geometry, providing a valuable framework for investigating Lorentz violation in spacetime. Previous studies have treated the Finsler structures associated with different particles as distinct entities. In this paper, we propose a novel hypothesis suggesting that the Finsler structure may represent an intrinsic property of the universe itself. Under this assumption, we derive a series of modified dispersion relations that have not been previously explored, and we analyze their implications. Our findings indicate that the scales of Lorentz violation for massive particles are proportional to their masses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this hypothesis aligns well with existing phenomenological results regarding Lorentz violation observed in photons, neutrinos, and electrons.</description>

      <title>Utilizing anticoincidence veto in a search for gravitational-wave transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We devise a technique to suppress the effect of noise transients occurring at gravitational-wave detectors based on temporal anticoincidence. Searches for gravitational-wave signals in the detector data are prone to spurious disturbances of terrestrial origin. The technique presented here benefits from the fact that such effects are generally non-coincident in time at geographically separated detectors. Therefore, abnormally loud triggers that are not time-coincident can be vetoed. We implement the veto technique in a matched-filter search for transient signals from binary black holes and observe search backgrounds to be generally close to the Gaussian limit. An improvement in the sensitivity of the search is demonstrated using simulated signals. The technique is expected to especially improve the detection efficiency of the search toward short duration transient signals.</description>

      <title>ModMax Black Holes in 4-Dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study charged black hole solutions in 4-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity combined with ModMax nonlinear electrodynamics. This is a conformally invariant extension of Maxwell theory that effectively describes nonlinear electromagnetic phenomena. Within the regularized 4-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet framework, we derive an exact static and spherically symmetric black hole solution that is sourced by a purely electric ModMax field. We explore how higher curvature corrections and nonlinear electromagnetic effects change the spacetime geometry, horizon structure, and energy content of the black hole. We examine the thermodynamic properties in detail, revealing a minimum mass and stable black hole remnants. These findings might be significant in scenarios involving dark-sector compact objects or evaporation endpoints beyond standard general relativity. We also investigate the motion of massive particles, discussing the characteristics of circular orbits and the innermost stable circular orbit, highlighting differences from the Maxwell case. Additionally, we analyze the quasinormal modes of a massive scalar field using WKB methods with Pad\'{e} approximants and the P\"{o}schl-Teller approximation. We explore how the quasinormal spectrum depends on the Gauss-Bonnet coupling, the ModMax parameter, and the scalar field mass. Our results confirm the linear stability of the black hole and offer potential observational signatures of dark-sector inspired modifications of gravity and electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>An Interior model of Charged Fluid Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At constant time $t$, we examine the Vaidya-Tikekar metric characterising a three-dimensional, extremely dense spheroidal star configuration. The static, spherically symmetric solution of Einstein's field equations can be expressed in analytic closed form utilising a hypergeometric series. A relativistic, superdense state of matter at a constant $t$ is represented by the resultant model, which describes the geometry of a three-spheroid.
  Assuming a stellar density of $\rho_{a}= 2*10^{14} gm*cm^{-3}$, we investigate configurations whose total mass and radius vary over a range of well-defined values of the density variation parameter. Similar to an uncharged neutron star, all models possess the same total mass and boundary radius. The hypergeometric solution leads to a new class of exact, physically acceptable solutions. We show that the model satisfies the conditions of hydrostatic equilibrium and fulfils all standard energy conditions, which are verified throughout the analysis.</description>

      <title>A Precise Ultra - Dense Star Model on Spheroidal Space-Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a static, spherically symmetric configuration in which the interior geometry of a relativistic superdense star is modeled as a three-spheroid with constant $t_1$. The model is constructed using an analytical closed-form solution to Einstein's field equations. Assuming a characteristic density of $\rho_{a}= 2\times10^{14} \mathrm{g\,cm^{-3}}$, we compute the total mass and radius of the star based on a prescribed set of structural parameters that influence the density profile. The resulting stellar configurations exhibit boundary radii and total masses comparable to those of neutron stars with vanishing charge density.
  New exact solutions are obtained by solving the relevant second-order ordinary differential equations. We demonstrate that these solutions satisfy the standard energy conditions and maintain hydrostatic equilibrium throughout the stellar interior. All physical requirements remain valid at every point within the configuration. In this framework, the parameter $\lambda=\frac{\rho_{a}}{\rho_{0}}$ serves as a key determinant of the mass--radius relationship. We further assess the suitability of the model for representing a relativistic superdense star and analyze its stability under radial perturbations. The investigation indicates that, for the configuration to remain dynamically stable, the density ratio between the outer and inner regions must take the value $\lambda = 0.4$.</description>

      <title>Probing the nature of Einstein nonlinear Maxwell Yukawa black hole through gravitational wave forms from periodic orbits and quasiperiodic oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study gravitational wave emission from periodic orbits of test particles, analyze quasi periodic oscillations, and constrain the parameters of the static, spherically symmetric Einstein nonlinear Maxwell Yukawa black hole. Using the Hamiltonian approach, we calculate the equations of motion of the particles. We analyze the effective potential to determine the innermost stable circular orbit and innermost bound circular orbit, illustrating how the Yukawa screening parameter and electric charge Q affect orbital stability and energy requirements. Periodic orbits are classified by integer triplets and exhibit characteristic zoom whirl behavior. Based on these orbits we compute the corresponding GW signals in both the polarizations. Finally, we perform Monte Carlo Markov Chain MCMC simulations to constrain the parameters of the ENLMY BH for four microquasars and the galactic center within the relativistic precession model.</description>

      <title>Does relativistic motion really freeze initially maximal entanglement?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relativistic dynamics of quantum entanglement in a four-qubit cluster ($CL_4$) state using a fully operational Unruh-DeWitt detector framework. Contrary to the widely held expectation that the Unruh effect inevitably degrades initially maximal entanglement, we demonstrate that the 1-3 bipartite entanglement of the $CL_4$ state remains strictly maximal for all accelerations, including the infinite-acceleration limit. This result uncovers a previously unexplored phenomenon, namely the ``complete freezing of initially maximal entanglement" under relativistic motion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first identification and systematic characterization of such a phenomenon within a relativistic framework. These findings overturn the conventional view that acceleration universally diminishes maximal entanglement and establish the $CL_4$ state as a promising resource for quantum information processing in non-inertial or curved-spacetime settings.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Spherically Symmetric Spacetime I: Geometro-Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This series of works revisits the geometry, dynamics, and covariant phase space of spherically symmetric spacetimes with the aim of exploring the thermodynamics of spacetime from their dynamical properties. In this first paper, we examine the geometry from the perspective of a foliation by spherical hypersurfaces. Using the rigging technique, we first define a local frame adapted to these slices and reconstruct the geometry and dynamics fully. We clarify the connection of the frame adapted to constant-radius slices, to the Kodama vector and Misner-Sharp energy. Through frame transformations, we then show that the gravitational dynamics in a general foliation-adapted frame can be interpreted as hydrodynamics, i.e., geometro-hydrodynamics: the Einstein equations exhibit the gravitational analogs of the Euler and Young-Laplace equations, and the spacetime can be viewed as the worldvolume of a concentric stack of "gravitational bubbles" -- spherical collective modes with the Misner-Sharp energy density and a geometric pressure. We apply this framework to apparent horizons and study the dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate that a similar geometro-hydrodynamic picture holds in Lovelock gravity. These results provide a fresh perspective on this class of spacetimes and lay the foundation for understanding their thermodynamic properties.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Newtonian physics, the excitation spectrum of a fluid is the same in all reference frames, up to a trivial shift. In special relativity, this is no longer the case. Relativity of simultaneity causes different inertial observers to measure markedly different excitation spectra, with stability being the only property known to be Lorentz invariant in all causal theories. Here, we show that, under a certain Onsager-like symmetry principle (which applies to kinetic theory and transient hydrodynamics), it is possible to place rigorous bounds on phase velocities, eigenmode convergence radii, spectral gaps, and equilibration rates in any inertial frame, using only information about the rest frame spectrum at zero wavenumber. The conventional intuition coming from time dilation is also shown to lead to generically wrong predictions, but becomes accurate if the fluid is non-relativistic in the rest frame.</description>

      <title>Epicyclic motion and accretion disk around a charged black hole in Einstein-ModMax theory with a quintessence field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the epicyclic motion of charged test particles and the associated quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) around a weakly magnetized black hole surrounded by quintessence within the framework of Einstein-ModMax theory. We analyze the dynamics of charged particles on circular orbits and derive the corresponding radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies. The influence of the nonlinear electrodynamics parameter, magnetic coupling, dyonic charge, and quintessence state parameter on the innermost stable circular orbit and epicyclic frequencies is examined in detail. Using the forced resonance model, we compare the theoretical predictions of high-frequency QPOs with observational data from several X-ray binary systems. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis is employed to constrain the black hole parameters and assess the role of weak magnetization and nonlinear electrodynamics effects. This analysis indicates that QPO observations tightly constrain the black hole mass and orbital radius while placing stringent upper bounds on the ModMax coupling, magnetic interaction, and dyonic charge. In addition, we study the radiative properties of the accretion disk and analyze the effects of the model parameters on the disk flux and temperature profiles. These findings suggest that the observed QPOs are consistent with general relativity in the strong-field regime, allowing only small deviations associated with Einstein-Maxwell theory in the presence of a quintessence field.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Statistical Study of Bianchi Type-I Universe in $f(R,T^\psi)$ Modified Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have examined the cosmological actions of LRS (Locally Rationally Symmetric) Bianchi type-I universe model in $f(R,T^\psi)$ gravity. For this, we have estimated the Hubble parameter, the effective equation of state parameter ($\omega^{eff}$), and the potential of the scalar field as a function of time using equation $H = W(\psi)$. The graphical representation of the potential function $V(\psi)$ with respect to cosmic time t is described. This study explores the dynamical properties of a Bianchi Type-I universe by utilizing Bayesian statistical techniques to constrain the model parameters and evaluate the viability of anisotropic cosmology under extended matter-geometry couplings. Also, we have applied the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) mechanism on the derived $H(z)$ model by using observational Hubble data (OHD), the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) dataset, and the Pantheon dataset. From the confidence-level contours and best-fit parameter values obtained, along with the corresponding reduced $\chi^{2}$, it is evident that the model aligns strongly with observational data, demonstrating statistical stability and consistency in describing late-time cosmic acceleration. Likewise, the error analyses presented in this research, including a comparison between the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and the reconstructed $H(z)$ model, confirm the model's compatibility with current observations by yielding a reliable and accurate account of the universe's expansion history.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our work, we present a calculation based on an exact, non-approximated wave equation, as described by the Teukolsky equation, for a Taub-NUT-de Sitter spacetime. We observe the scattering of a monochromatic point source by an observer located at a greater distance from the black hole, and examine the wave-optical images by a single source and by multiple sources.</description>

      <title>When does entanglement through gravity imply gravitons?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detection of entanglement through the Newtonian potential has been claimed to support the existence of gravitons, by extrapolating to a thought experiment which demonstrates that complementarity and causality would be in conflict unless quantum fluctuations exist. We critically assess this consistency argument using scalar field models. We show that whether complementarity or no-signalling is violated when quantum fluctuations are neglected, depends on how this approximation is taken, while in both cases entanglement is generated locally in spacetime. We clarify that the correct reading of the paradox requires making a clear distinction between two notions of causality violation: Newtonian action-at-a-distance and the quantum mechanical no-signalling; the latter is pertinent while the former is not. We conclude that the thought experiment (a) does not add to the epistemological relevance of entanglement through Newtonian potentials (b) lends support for the existence of gravitons, if retardation effects are detected in entanglement through gravity.</description>

      <title>Discrete gravitational diagram technique in the soft synchronous gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops our work on the consequences of the Regge calculus, where some edge length scale arises as an optimal starting point of the perturbative expansion with taking into account a bell-shaped form of the measure obtained using functional integration over connection.
  A "hypercubic" structure is considered (some variables are frozen), it is described by the metric $g_{\lambda \mu}$ at the sites.
  The edge length scale as some maximum point of the measure is $\sim \eta^{1 / 2}$, where $\eta$ defines the free factor like $ ( - \det \| g_{\lambda \mu} \| )^{ \eta / 2}$ in the measure and should be a large parameter to ensure true action upon integration over connection. A priori, the perturbative expansion may contain increasing powers of $\eta$, but this does not happen for the starting point inside some neighborhood of the maximum point of the measure, and it does happen outside this neighborhood. This appears to be a dynamic mechanism for establishing the edge length scale.
  We use a discrete version of the soft synchronous gauge in the principal value type prescription we discuss in a recent paper arXiv:2601.02181. This allows one to fix the timelike length scale at a low level for which the measure is known in closed form. This gauge is considered together with a refined finite-difference form of the action to match the analytical properties of the propagator to the continuum case.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Collider Gravitational Waves sourced by Right-handed Neutrino production from Bubbles: Testing Seesaw, Leptogenesis and Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a minimal type-I seesaw framework in which a first-order phase transition (FOPT), driven by a singlet scalar, produces right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) through bubble collisions, realizing a cosmic-scale collider that probes ultra-high energy scales. The resulting RHN distribution sources novel low-frequency gravitational-waves (GWs) in addition to the standard bubble-collision contribution. A stable lightest RHN can account for the observed dark matter (DM) relic abundance for masses as low as $M_{1} \equiv m_{\rm DM} \gtrsim 10^{6}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, with the associated novel GW signal accessible in LISA, ET and upcoming LVK detectors. If the RHNs are unstable, their CP-violating decays generate the observed baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis for $M_{1} \gtrsim 10^{11}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and phase transition temperatures $T_* \gtrsim 10^{6}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, for which the novel GW spectrum is detectable in ET, BBO and upcoming LVK. If RHN decays also populate a dark-sector fermion with mass $m_{\chi} \in [10^{-4},10^{4}],\mathrm{GeV}$, successful co-genesis of baryons and asymmetric dark matter occurs for $T_* \gtrsim 10^{7}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and $M_{1} \gtrsim 10^{9}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, naturally explaining $\Omega_{\rm DM} \simeq 5\Omega_{\rm B}$. The corresponding GW signals are testable with LISA, ET, and BBO. Finally, we analyze a UV-complete multi-Majoron model, based on a global $U(1)_N \times U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ extension, motivated from the hierarchy of lepton masses, which we dub as Mojaron collider. The corresponding FOPT in this model leaves a distinctive GW signature arising from RHN production during $U(1)_N$ symmetry breaking detectable by BBO, ET and upcoming LVK. Successful leptogenesis is realized for heaviest RHN mass $M_3 \sim 10^{10}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and a $U(1)_N$ breaking vev $v_2 \sim \mathcal{O}(\mathrm{TeV})$, which sets the seesaw scale.</description>

      <title>On the exceptionality of exceptional gravitational-wave events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In gravitational-wave astronomy, as in other scientific disciplines, ``exceptional'' sources attract considerable interest because they challenge our current understanding of the underlying (astro)physical processes. Crucially, ``exceptionality'' is defined only relative to the rest of the detected population. For instance, among all gravitational-wave events detected so far, GW231123 is the binary black hole with the largest total mass, while GW241110 is the binary black hole with the most strongly misaligned spin relative to the orbital angular momentum. Mandel [Astrophys.J.Lett. 996 (2026) 1, L4] argued that apparent ``exceptionality'' may reflect measurement error rather than an extreme true value, and suggested that the total mass of GW231123 may be significantly overestimated. Here we present a quantitative analysis that supports this conceptual point. We find that claims of ``exceptionality'' obtained under agnostic priors should be critically questioned whenever measurement uncertainties are comparable to the width of the underlying population. Specifically, we find that the total mass of GW231123 is unlikely to be meaningfully affected by this effect while the spin of GW241110 is far less likely to be anti-aligned than initially claimed: about 70% of realizations that appear to yield an ``exceptionally anti-aligned'' spin are in fact consistent with either nonspinning or aligned configurations.</description>

      <title>Indications of a Late-Time Transition to a Strongly Interacting Dark Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the transition from the $\Lambda$CDM to an interacting dark sector by introducing a model with a redshift threshold that controls the onset of the energy transfer between the dark energy and the dark matter. Below the transition redshift, the interaction between dark matter and dark energy becomes active, while at earlier times the cosmological evolution coincides with that of $\Lambda$CDM. This approach allows us to determine the epoch in the comic history where the interacting effects have an impact in the description of the dark sector. We constrain the free parameters of the model using late-time cosmological observations, namely Cosmic Chronometers, DESI DR2 Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations, and Supernova data from the Pantheon Plus, Union3.0, and DES-Dovekie catalogues. The analysis provides an indication of a strong interacting term that describes energy transfer from dark energy to dark matter, which is activated at low redshifts. The PantheonPlus sample provides a threshold of $z_{T}&lt;0.624$, the Union3.0 sample yields $z_{T}=0.400_{-0.23}^{+0.021}$, and the DES-Dovekie sample gives $z_{T}=0.371_{-0.26}^{+0.028}$. The model fits the data in a similar way to the CPL parametrization, without the dark energy to cross the phantom divide line.</description>

      <title>Measuring the homogeneity scale using the peculiar velocity field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an innovative definition of the scale at which the Universe becomes homogeneous based on measurements of velocities rather than densities. When using the matter density field, one has to choose an arbitrary scale (e.g. within 1\% of the average density) to define the transition to homogeneity. Furthermore, the resulting homogeneity scale is strongly degenerate with the galaxy bias. By contrast, peculiar velocities (PV) allow us to define an unambiguous scale of homogeneity, namely the distance at which the velocities between pairs of galaxies change from being on-average correlated to anti-correlated. Physically, this relates to when the motion of pairs of galaxies is influenced by the matter density between them, rather than beyond. The disadvantage is that peculiar velocities are more difficult to measure than positions, resulting in smaller samples with larger uncertainties. Nevertheless, we illustrate the potential of this approach using the peculiar velocity correlation functions obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey PV catalog, finding an homogeneity scale of $R_H\approx 133\substack{+28 \\ -52}\, \rm{Mpc/h}$. Finally, we show that more precise measurements are within reach of upcoming peculiar velocity surveys, and highlight this homogeneity scale's potential use as a standard ruler within the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <title>A Universal Upper Bound on the Pressure-to-Energy Density Ratio in Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equation-of-state (EOS) parameter $\phi \equiv P/\varepsilon$, defined as the ratio of pressure to energy density, encapsulates the fundamental response of matter under extreme compression. Its value at the center of the most massive neutron star (NS), $\x \equiv \phi_{\rm c} = P_{\rm c}/\varepsilon_{\rm c}$, sets a universal upper bound on the maximum denseness attainable by any form of visible matter anywhere in the Universe. Remarkably, owing to the intrinsically nonlinear structure of the EOS in General Relativity (GR), this bound is forced to lie far below the naive Special Relativity (SR) limit of unity. In this work, we refine the theoretical upper bound on $\x$ in a self-consistent manner by incorporating, in addition to the causality constraint from SR, the mass-sphere stability condition associated with the mass evolution pattern in the vicinity of the NS center. This condition is formulated within the intrinsic-and-perturbative analysis of the dimensionless Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equations (IPAD-TOV) framework. The combined constraints yield an improved bound, $\x \lesssim 0.385$, which is slightly above but fully consistent with the previously derived causal-only limit, $\x \lesssim 0.374$. We further derive an improved scaling relation for NS compactness and verify its universality across a broad set of 284 realistic EOSs, including models with first-order phase transitions, exotic degrees of freedom, continuous crossover behavior, and deconfined quark cores. The resulting bound on $\x$ thus provides a new, EOS-independent window into the microphysics of cold superdense matter compressed by strong-field gravity in GR.</description>

      <title>Bounce Inflation with Dynamical Dark Energy in Light of DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 (DESI DR2) suggests that the dark energy in our universe might be evolving, favoring the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization and a lower Hubble constant. In our previous work, it has been reported that cosmological model with the non-singular bounce inflation (BI) scenario and $\Lambda$CDM might alleviate the Hubble tension into 3$\sigma$ confidence. In this paper, we study the cosmological model of BI with a dynamical dark energy. We find that individual consideration of the CPL parameterization and the data \texttt{DESI DR2} tend to larger Hubble constants for both BI and power law (PL) case with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. Employing BI with combined CPL parameterization and \texttt{DESI DR2}, we obtain the Hubble constant $H_ 0 = 65.2^{ + 1.8}_{ - 2.2} \ \mathrm{km} \cdot \mathrm{s}^{ -1 } \cdot \mathrm{Mpc}^{ -1 }$, which is larger than $H_ 0 = 64.0 \pm 2.1 \ \mathrm{km} \cdot \mathrm{s}^{ -1 } \cdot \mathrm{Mpc}^{ -1 }$ for the PL case. After considering nontrivial weak lensing effect and spatial curvature as well as adding \texttt{Pantheon+}, BI fits 3.1$\sigma$ confidence of $\Lambda$CDM with $w_ 0 = -0.919 \pm 0.038$ and $w_{ \mathrm{a}} = -0.37 \pm 0.12$, and it prefers evolving dark energy than the PL case with $w_ 0 = -0.960 \pm 0.074$ and $w_{ \mathrm{a}} = -0.15^{ +0.28}_{ -0.25}$.</description>

      <title>Standard Model Higgs Peaks: a Note on the Vacuum Instability during Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Standard Model, the Higgs potential develops an instability at high field values when the quartic self-coupling runs negative. Large quantum fluctuations during cosmic inflation could drive the Higgs field beyond the potential barrier, creating regions that would be catastrophic for our observable universe. We point out that the extreme-value statistics describing the peaks (maxima) of the Higgs values is the correct statistics to infer the condition to avoid vacuum instability. Even if this statistics delivers a bound on the Hubble rate during inflation which is only a factor $\sqrt{2}$ stronger than the one commonly adopted in the literature, it is qualitatively distinct and we believe worthwhile communicating it.</description>

      <title>Heavy Black-Holes Also Matter in Standard Siren Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the release of the Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog GWTC-4.0 by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration, 218 candidate detections of gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary coalescences (CBCs) have been reported. This milestone represents a major advancement for GW cosmology, as many methods, particularly those employing the spectral siren approach, critically depend on the number of available sources. We investigate the impact of a novel parametric model describing the full population mass spectrum of CBCs on the estimation of the Hubble constant. This model is designed to test the impact of heavy black holes in GW cosmology. We perform a joint inference of cosmological and population parameters using 142 CBCs from GWTC-4.0 with a false alarm rate smaller than 0.25 per year, using both spectral and dark siren approaches. With spectral sirens, we estimate the Hubble constant to be $H_0 = 78.8^{+19.0}_{-15.3}\,{\rm km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ (68% CL), while the dark siren method yields $H_0 = 82.5^{+16.8}_{-14.3}\,{\rm km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ (68% CL). These results improve the uncertainty by approximately 30.4% and 36.2%, respectively. We show that this improvement is linked to the presence of a new mass scale in the binary black hole mass spectrum at $63.3^{+4.8}_{-4.8}\,M_{\odot}$, which provides additional constraints on the Hubble constant. Besides providing the tightest standard-siren constraints on $H_0$, this highlights the importance of a heavy-mass feature in the black hole spectrum.</description>

Abstract: The microscopic origin of black hole entropy remains one of the central puzzles in quantum gravity. In this work, we investigate the statistical entropy of scalar fields propagating in stationary axisymmetric spacetimes using the thin-film modification of the 't Hooft brick wall method. We derive a generalized expression for the free energy of both superradiant and non-superradiant modes, expressed explicitly in terms of generic metric components. This unified formalism allows for a systematic evaluation of entropy across a diverse class of black holes without re-deriving the wave equation for each specific case. We validate our approach by recovering the Bekenstein-Hawking area law for the standard Kerr black hole. Subsequently, we extend the analysis to the Kerr-Newman-AdS geometry and, finally, to the novel case of a Kerr-Newman-AdS black hole surrounded by quintessence and a cloud of strings. Our results confirm that the area law holds even in the presence of these complex background matter fields, provided the cutoff parameter is appropriately renormalized.</description>

      <title>Transformation equation for frames undergoing non-uniform acceleration such as SHM and rotational motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01677v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lorentz transformation equations provide us a set of relations between the spacetime coordinates as observed from two different inertial frames. In case, one of the frames is moving with a uniform rectilinear acceleration we have Rindler's transformation equations under such a situation. In the present work, we extend the Rindler's equations to a situation where we have in general non-uniform acceleration. After that we consider the non-inertial frame to undergo simple harmonic motion (SHM) and as a second case we consider the non-inertial frame to move uniformly along a circle. This set of transformation equations will have applications in various branches of Physics and in general in Astrophysics.</description>

      <title>How to obtain slow roll inflation driven by non-linear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish for the first time the conditions that must be imposed on the action for a magnetic universe in a theory of non-linear electrodynamics in order to have an asymptotically de Sitter initial state followed by a slow roll inflationary phase. We show that models so far proposed in the literature do not allow for a prolonged inflationary phase consistent with observations. We construct a Lagrangian that reduces to the Maxwell one in weak field; this is the only class of models that satisfies the required conditions for slow roll in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Non-Equatorial Deflection of Light due to Kerr-Newman Black Hole: A Material Medium Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explored the effect of space-time geometry on the trajectory of light rays in the context of a charged, rotating black hole. We derived an analytical expression for the deflection of light rays in Kerr-Newman space-time geometry, using a material medium approach, on non-equatorial plane. From this deflection angle expression it is evident that the charge and rotation of the black hole can affect the light rays' paths. Additionally, we calculated the refractive index of light rays by treating space-time as a medium. We demonstrated how the rotation parameter and charge influence the refractive index and hence the deflection angle of light rays. For Kerr-Newman geometry, the deflection angle decreases with increasing charge when the rotation parameter is held constant. Conversely, for a constant charge, the deflection angle increases with the rotation parameter for prograde and decreases for retrograde trajectories. Applying both factors results in the deflection angle being lower than that of the Schwarzschild geometry. Non-equatorial study of the deflection angle reveals that it is maximum in the equatorial plane than in the pole. The frame-dragging effects in the Kerr-Newman field were taken into account to calculate the velocity of light rays, leading to the determination of the refractive index in this field geometry. This study concludes that depending on the values of the rotation parameter and charge parameter both prograde and retrograde trajectories coincide, resulting in the conclusion that at some point the frame dragging effect is the same for prograde and retrograde motion. Also, the frame dragging increases towards poles for retrograde trajectories while decreasing for prograde trajectories, and these nontrivial nature results because of the interplay between charge and rotation.</description>

Abstract: Setting up a relativistic lunar reference frame is of a prime importance in the context of future exploration missions to the Moon. If the procedure for building a consistent reference frame within the framework of the general theory of relativity is well established (cf. resolutions B.3 of IAU 2000), there is still some freedom in the choice of the coordinate timescale to be adopted as reference in the lunar region. In this paper, we review the orders of magnitude of the relativistic effects resulting from (i) the gravitational redshift of a clock on the lunar surface and (ii) the time transformations between a clock on the surface of the Moon and a clock on the surface of the Earth. We then discuss possible options for a lunar reference timescale with their advantages and drawbacks, taking note that the solution which is adopted for the Moon shall then be reemployed for Mars and other planets. Finally, we propose possible realizations of the lunar reference timescale as well as its traceability to UTC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a family of rotating black bounces with an anisotropic fluid obtained by using a modified Newman-Janis algorithm. We analyze the main features of these spacetimes and obtain the geodesics for photons, which admit the separation of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. We then determine the shape of the shadow in terms of the parameters of the model. We present some relevant examples that exhibit some traits that distinguish these spacetimes from other related ones appearing in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The introduction of anisotropy into the large-scale geometry of the universe has led to the development of exotic spacetimes possessing an inherent anisotropic curvature in them. Studies related to these anisotropic spacetimes have revealed how they could explain the evolutionary dynamics and light propagation in the universe. Here, we consider one such interesting set of spacetimes that preserve homogeneity but place no constraint on isotropy during the inflationary epoch, to examine whether we can address the possibility of anisotropic inflation in the universe. Researchers have proposed inflationary models in which a vector field coupled to the inflaton is found to violate the cosmic no-hair theorem for the anisotropic Bianchi type I spacetime, due to the existence of a stable anisotropically inflationary fixed point. Lately, this study has been extended to axisymmetric spacetimes of Bianchi type II, III, and the Kantowski-Sachs metric, and it has been inferred that the entire family of spacetimes is attracted to the anisotropic Bianchi I fixed point. By fabricating Thurston spacetimes as inflationary models with an explicit vector field sourced effectively by their inherent eccentricity coupled to inflation, we perform dynamical stability and phase space analyses to confer the feasibility of anisotropic inflation. The results obtained for the considered set of Thurston geometries showed the presence and convergence to a unique, stable inflationary fixed point, which was found to be similar to those obtained in Bianchi spacetimes, thereby indicating the cosmological viability of inflation with anisotropic hair.</description>

      <title>On the Bondi accretion of a self-interacting complex scalar field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalar fields with a global U(1) symmetry often appear in cosmology and astrophysics. We study the spherically-symmetric, stationary accretion of such a classical field onto a Schwarzschild black hole in the test-field approximation. Thus, we consider the relativistic Bondi accretion beyond a simplified perfect-fluid setup. We focus on the complex scalar field with canonical kinetic term and with a generic quartic potential which either preserves the U(1) symmetry or exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is well known that in the lowest order in gradient expansion the dynamics of such a scalar field is well approximated by a perfect superfluid; we demonstrate that going beyond this approximation systematically reduces the accretion rate with respect to the perfect fluid case. Hence, black holes can provide a way to distinguish a perfect fluid from its ultraviolet completion in form of the complex scalar field.</description>

      <title>Gravitation and Spacetime: Emergent from Spinor Interactions -- How?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Newtonian gravity arises as the nonrelativistic, static, weak-field limit of some Lorentzian spacetime geometry solving the generally covariant Einstein equations for a given matter field configuration. Spacetime geometry has a local description in the spinor basis of Penrose. The breakdown of relativistic quantum (field) theory at small distances suggests that, the Lorentzian geometry is to be modified below some regularization length. The thermodynamic correspondence, e.g. for black holes or other horizons, indicates that, Lorentzian spacetime is an emergent geometric description of an ensemble of more fundamental constituents. The independent derivations of the area law of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy by string theory and loop quantum gravity show that, (some) properties of spacetime do not depend on the nature of its fundamental constituents (in leading order).
  Whether, on a fundamental scale, spacetime gravity has its own classical or quantum constituents (like e.g. in loop quantum gravity), or it is just an effective theory, deriving from expectation values of quantum matter operators (like in spinor gravity or causal fermion systems), this is still open. We compare some very different classical and quantum approaches to spacetime geometry, all deriving in one way or another from spinors, and comment on questions for future research in order to clarify their relations. We propose that both, the causal structure and the spin networks for generation of discrete geometry arise via projection from all particle spinors (fermionic and bosonic) within a causal double cone region and their spin intertwining interaction events onto a spatial section of this double cone region.</description>

      <title>The symplectic potential for leaky boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Charges associated with gauge symmetries are defined on boundaries of spacetimes. But these constructions typically involve divergent quantities when considering asymptotic boundaries. Different prescriptions exist to address this problem, based on ambiguities in the definition of the symplectic potential. We propose a method well suited to leaky boundaries, which describe spacetimes than can exchange matter or radiation with their environment. The main advantage of this approach is that it relies only on the bulk Lagrangian and it is not tied to a specific choice of boundary conditions. The prescription is applied to four dimensional Einstein-Hilbert gravity in the partial Bondi gauge. This leads to a finite symplectic potential for unconstrained boundary data and reveals two new corner symplectic pairs associated with the relaxation of the gauge.</description>

      <title>Classification of $f(R)$ Theories Of Inflation And The Uniqueness of Starobinsky Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify $f(R)$ theories using a mathematical analogy between slow-roll inflation and the renormalization-group flow. We derive the power spectra and spectral indices class by class and compare them with the latest data. The framework used for the classification allows us to determine the general structure of the $f(R)$ functions that belong to each class. Our main result is that only two classes survive. Moreover, we show that the Starobinsky model is the only polynomial $f(R)$ that can realize slow-roll inflation. In fact, all other polynomials belong to a special class that can only realize constant-roll inflation, at least far enough in the past. We point out some of the issues involved in considering a smooth transition between constant-roll and slow-roll inflation in this class of models. Finally, we derive the map that transforms the results from the Jordan frame to the Einstein frame.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Constraints on $f(T,B)$ Gravity from Observations of Early and Late Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a unified framework comprising two complementary approaches to constrain three functional forms of $f(T,B)$ gravity, namely the linear, quadratic, and general power law models, by jointly utilizing early and late Universe observations. First, we impose bounds on deviations in the weak interaction freeze-out temperature, informed by the latest measurements of the primordial helium-4 mass fraction. Second, we incorporate direct Hubble parameter data, $H(\mathcal{z})$, obtained from Cosmic Chronometers in the redshift range $0.07\le\mathcal{z}\le2.0$, to trace the expansion history of the Universe. By minimizing a combined chi-square statistic across both datasets, we derive the best-fit values and confidence intervals for each model parameter. The joint analysis significantly refines the parameter constraints compared to methods based solely on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, thereby offering a more robust test of $f(T,B)$ gravity across cosmic epochs. The results support the viability of torsion-based modifications to General Relativity and provide a consistent methodology for future evaluation using upcoming observational data.</description>

Abstract: We define a Grassmann odd analogue of a Carrollian manifold as a supermanifold of dimension $n|1$ with an even degenerate metric such that the kernel is generated by a non-singular odd vector field that is a supersymmetry generator. Alongside other results, we establish that the reduced manifold is a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, and show that compatible affine connections always exist, albeit they must carry torsion. As a physically relevant example, we examine an In\"on\"u--Wigner contraction of the supertranslation algebra on standard superspace $\mathbb{R}^{4|4}$.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we present a novel family of exact black hole solutions constructed in the context of five-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet gravity. These solutions add a non-linear charge to the Ba\~{n}ados-Teitelboim-Zanelli-like configurations known to exist with arbitrary Thurston horizon geometry. We establish constraints on the parameter space defining physically viable black holes, aligning with the standard energy conditions. An explicit proof of the first law of thermodynamics within our scenario is provided. We also employ holographic techniques to characterize the DC conductivities for the distinct horizon geometries, identifying a critical temperature indicative of phase transitions and exploring pertinent limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Performing Bayesian inference on quarkyonic equation-of-state models for neutron star matter, we find they satisfy all current astrophysical observations, thus reinforcing the argument for the use of such neutron star matter equation-of-state models alongside traditional ones. To observationally differentiate between stars with and without a quarkyonic phase, we identify a novel observational signature- the slope of the mass-radius relation at some fixed mass in conjunction with the sound speed at the star's center. In this plane, we find quarkyonic stars in a region with high central sound speed and positive slope, that is distinct from purely nucleonic stars. High accuracy NS radii measurements facilitated by the next generation of detectors, coupled with ongoing studies of mapping astrophysical observables to microphysical properties like sound speed can be used for testing this signature. Our results indicate that a neutron star with these properties would be a strong evidence for existence of a quarkyonic phase or a similar crossover transition in its core.</description>

      <title>Can Newtonian Gravity Produce Quantum Entanglement?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23584v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether Newtonian gravity can generate quantum entanglement between mesoscopic quantum bodies modeled as superposed mass quadrupoles using three complementary approaches: mini-superspace, semiclassical gravity, and stochastic gravity. We systematically analyze gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE) mechanisms and the conditions under which they can arise. Our results support the GIE hypothesis by showing that the mini-superspace framework, which quantizes the parity of the gravitational tidal field, can entangle spatially separate quantum bodies. In contrast, the semiclassical and stochastic gravity models, in which the tidal gravitational field sourced by the quantum bodies remains classical, fail to entangle the final state. These findings clarify recent claims that classical gravity might induce entanglement, and reveal how perturbative treatments can lead to misleading conclusions.</description>

      <title>Completeness conditions for spacetimes with low-regularity metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend Beem's three completeness notions -- finite compactness, timelike Cauchy completeness, and Condition A -- originally defined for spacetimes, to Lorentzian length spaces and study their relationships. We prove that finite compactness implies timelike Cauchy completeness and that timelike Cauchy completeness implies Condition A for globally hyperbolic Lorentzian length spaces. Furthermore, for globally hyperbolic $C^{1}$-spacetimes, we establish the equivalence of the three conditions assuming the causally non-branching and non-intertwining conditions, which in fact imply the continuity of the causal exponential map. These results can be regarded as a Hopf-Rinow type theorem for low-regularity Lorentzian geometry. The appendix presents examples of $C^{1}$-spacetimes -- where geodesic uniqueness may fail -- in which causal geodesics nevertheless behave well, illustrating the scope of our results.</description>

      <title>General Effective Theories of Black Holes in the Large D Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the general form of the effective equations governing black hole dynamics in the limit of a large number of dimensions $D$. These split into a universal \emph{soap-bubble} embedding condition for stationary configurations and a set of nonlinear dynamical evolution equations describing near-horizon fluctuations of $O(1/D)$ amplitude over horizon scales of $O(1/\sqrt{D})$. We obtain these equations in full generality, including arbitrary asymptotic sources in the near-horizon region, and we show that they form a parabolic system with a well-posed initial value problem. To connect the various approaches to large-$D$ black hole dynamics, we also show that both the embedding and dynamical equations can be derived from the covariant membrane formalism. We clarify the intrinsic scope of the large-$D$ approach, emphasizing that it yields a well-posed dynamical evolution only on horizon scales of $O(1/\sqrt{D})$, which is the range where the most relevant horizon dynamics occur. Our results highlight the versatility of these effective theories for studying a wide class of black hole phenomena.</description>

      <title>Supertranslation in the bulk for generic spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supertranslations are usually defined as asymptotic symmetries associated with spacetime boundaries, such as null infinity and black hole horizons. In this Letter, we show that supertranslations admit a natural, coordinate-independent extension into the bulk of spacetime, realized as transitions between families of null hypersurfaces. This construction applies to generic spacetimes in arbitrary dimensions and unifies the realizations of supertranslations at null infinity and black hole horizons. The bulk supertranslation is connected to boundary supertranslation by characteristic flows. The associated symmetry algebra can be realized by light-ray operators defined on the null hypersurface. Within this framework, the gravitational wave memory effect corresponds to a shift of null hypersurfaces in the bulk. As explicit examples, we compute bulk supertranslations in Minkowski spacetime in arbitrary dimensions and in four-dimensional Schwarzschild spacetime, where we uncover a novel curvature-induced memory effect with observable consequences for light propagation.</description>

      <title>A topological perspective on bulk boundary thermodynamic equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish an exact duality between the extended thermodynamics of five-dimensional charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes and the thermodynamic framework of the dual boundary conformal field theory (CFT). The thermodynamics of the dual CFT involves two central charges originating from the trace anomaly. We demonstrate a precise correspondence between the extended first laws on the bulk and boundary sides. Moreover, the topological charges of the CFT thermodynamics, associated with the phase transition and critical point, coincide with those of the corresponding bulk black hole.</description>

      <title>Graviton-Photon Mixing by a Kerr-Newman Black Hole with Worldline EFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In black hole perturbation theory, the difficulty in separating electromagnetic and gravitational sectors of the coupled Teukolsky equations has prevented a general treatment of scattering processes involving both electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves in presence of a Kerr-Newman black hole. We present the first computation of the gauge-invariant, low-frequency scattering amplitude for graviton photoproduction by a Kerr-Newman black hole at tree level up to $\mathcal{O}\big((\omega/m)^2\big)$ or $\mathcal{O}(S^2)$ and linear in $\kappa$, using the worldline effective field theory. The relevant Wilson coefficients are determined by matching the graviton and photon one-point functions to the Kerr-Newman solution. We obtain the full angular dependence of the conversion cross section in the presence of spin and comment on the factorization relation between the graviton photoproduction amplitude and the photon Compton amplitude for a classical spinning source. The result provides a benchmark for future analyses of coupled gravitoelectromagnetic scattering in spinning charged compact object backgrounds.</description>
