      <title>Tensor-Network study of Ising model on infinite hyperbolic dodecahedral lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a tensor-network-based algorithm to study the classical Ising model on an infinitely large hyperbolic lattice with a regular 3D tesselation of identical dodecahedra. We reformulate the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG) algorithm from 2D to 3D to reproduce the known results on the cubic lattice. Consequently, we generalize the CTMRG to the hyperbolic dodecahedral lattice, which is an infinite-dimensional lattice. We analyze the spontaneous magnetization, von Neumann entropy, and correlation length to find a continuous non-critical phase transition on the dodecahedral lattice. The phase transition temperature is estimated to be $T_{\rm pt} \approx 4.66$. We find the magnetic critical exponents $\beta= 0.4999$ and $\delta=3.007$ that confirm the mean-field universality class in accord with predictions of Monte Carlo and high-temperature series expansions. The algorithm can be applied to arbitrary multi-state spin models.</description>

      <title>Tensor Renormalization-Group study of the surface critical behavior of a frustrated two-layer Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two replicas of a 2D Ising model are coupled by frustrated spin-spin interactions. It is known that this inter-layer coupling is marginal and that the bulk critical behavior belongs to the Ashkin-Teller (AT) universality class, as the $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model. In this work, the surface critical behavior is studied numerically by Tensor Renormalization-Group calculations. The Bond-Weight Tensor Renormalization Group algorithm is extended to tackle systems with boundaries. It is observed that the two-fold degeneracy of the surface magnetic scaling dimension of the AT model is lifted in the frustrated two-layer Ising model (F2LIM). The splitting is explained by the breaking of the ${\mathbb Z}_2$-symmetry under spin reversal of a single Ising replica in the F2LIM. The two distinct surface magnetic scaling dimensions $x_1^s$ and $x_2^s$ of the F2LIM satisfies a simple duality relation $x_1^s=1/4x_2^s$.</description>

      <title>Faradaic and capacitive charging of an electrolyte-filled pore in response to a small applied potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrochemical devices often charge both through Faradaic reactions and electric double layer formation. Here, we study these coupled processes in a model system of a long electrolyte-filled pore subject to a small suddenly-applied potential, close to the equilibrium potential $\Psi^\text{eq}$ at which there is no net Faradaic charge transfer. Specifically, we solve the coupled Poisson-Nernst-Planck and Frumkin-Butler-Volmer equations by asymptotic approximations, using the pore's small inverse aspect ratio as the small parameter. In the early-time limit, the reaction-diffusion equations yield an extended Faradaic transmission line model that includes a voltage source, $\Psi_\text{eq}$, biasing the Faradaic reactions, captured by the resistance $R_F$. In the long-time limit, the model exhibits a nontrivial potential of zero charge, $\Psi_\text{pzc} = \Psi_\text{eq}[1 - \hat{Z}(0)/R_F]$, where $\hat{Z}(0)$ is the experimentally accessible zero-frequency impedance of the system. This expression provides a new means to experimentally measure the Faradaic contribution to $\Psi_\text{pzc}$.</description>

      <title>Koopman Mode Decomposition of Thermodynamic Dissipation in Nonlinear Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear oscillations are commonly observed in complex systems far from equilibrium, such as living organisms. These oscillations are essential for sustaining vital processes, like neuronal firing, circadian rhythms, and heartbeats. In such systems, thermodynamic dissipation is necessary to maintain oscillations against noise. However, due to their nonlinear dynamics, it has been challenging to determine how the characteristics of oscillations, such as frequency, amplitude, and coherent patterns across elements, influence dissipation. To resolve this issue, we employ Koopman mode decomposition, which recasts nonlinear dynamics as a linear evolution in a function space. This linearization allows the dynamics to be decomposed into temporal oscillatory modes coherent across elements, with the Koopman eigenvalues determining their frequencies. Using this method, we decompose thermodynamic dissipation caused by nonconservative forces into contributions from oscillatory modes in overdamped nonlinear Langevin dynamics. We show that the dissipation from each mode is proportional to its frequency squared and its intensity, providing an interpretable, mode-by-mode picture. In the noisy FitzHugh--Nagumo model, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in quantifying the impact of oscillatory modes on dissipation during nonlinear phenomena like stochastic resonance and bifurcation. For instance, our analysis of stochastic resonance reveals that the greatest dissipation at the optimal noise intensity is supported by a broad spectrum of frequencies, whereas at non-optimal noise levels, dissipation is dominated by specific frequency modes. Our work offers a general approach to connecting oscillations to dissipation in noisy environments and improves our understanding of diverse oscillation phenomena from a nonequilibrium thermodynamic perspective.</description>

      <title>Beyond Poisson: First-Passage Asymptotics of Renewal Shot Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first-passage time (FPT) of a stochastic signal to a threshold is a fundamental observable across physics, biology, and finance. While renewal shot noise is a canonical model for such signals, analytical results for its FPT have remained confined to the Poisson (Markovian) case, despite the prevalence of non-Poisson arrival statistics in applications from neuronal spiking to gene expression. We break this long-standing barrier by deriving the first universal asymptotic formula for the mean FPT $\langle T_b \rangle$ to reach level $b$ for renewal shot noise with general arrival statistics and exponential marks. Our central result is a closed-form expression that reveals precisely how general inter-arrival statistics impact the naive Arrhenius law. We show that the short-time behavior of the interarrival distribution dictates universal scaling corrections, ranging from stretched-exponential to algebraic, that can dramatically accelerate threshold crossing. Furthermore, we argue and confirm numerically that the full FPT distribution becomes exponential at large thresholds, implying that $\langle T_b \rangle$ provides a complete asymptotic characterization. Our work, enabled by a novel exact solution for the moments of the noise, establishes a general framework for analyzing extreme events in non-Markovian systems with relaxation.</description>

      <title>A Probability Space at Inception of Stochastic Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, progress has been made in the theory of turbulence, which provides a framework on how a deterministic process changes to a stochastic one owing to the change in thermodynamic states. It is well known that, in the framework of Newtonian mechanics, motions are dissipative; however, when subjected to periodic motion, a system can produce nondissipative motions intermittently and subject to resonance. It is in resonance that turbulence occurs in fluid flow, solid vibration, thermal transport, etc. In this, the findings from these physical systems are analyzed in the framework of statistics with their own probability space to establish their compliance to the stochastic process. In particular, a systematic alignment of the inception of the stochastic process with the signed measure theory, signed probability space, and stochastic process was investigated. It was found that the oscillatory load from the dissipative state excited the system and resulted in a quasi-periodic probability density function with the negative probability regimes. In addition, the vectorial nature of the random velocity splits the probability density function along both the positive and negative axes with slight asymmetricity. By assuming that a deterministic process has a probability of 1, we can express the inception of a stochastic process, and the subsequent benefit is that a dynamic fractal falls on the probability density function. Moreover, we leave some questions of inconsistency between the physical system and the measurement theory for future investigation. We believe that the establishment of the probability density function of resonance nondissipative dynamics in contemporary statistics should make many mathematical tools available and the analytical formulas for the random velocity and probability density function can provide a convenient platform for the development of statistics.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories: fermionic gauging, transmutation, and Kramers-Wannier dualities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the gauging of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries by inserting Majorana fermions, establishing parallel duality correspondences for bosonic and fermionic lattice systems. Using this fermionic gauging, we construct fermionic analogs of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theories dual to the transverse-field Ising model, interpretable as Majorana stabilizer codes. We demonstrate a unitary equivalence between the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory obtained by gauging the fermion parity of a free fermionic system and the conventional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory with potentially nonlocal terms on the square lattice with toroidal geometry. This equivalence is implemented by a linear-depth local unitary circuit, connecting the bosonic and fermionic toric codes through a direction-dependent anyonic transmutation. The gauge theory obtained by gauging fermion parity is further shown to be equivalent to a folded Ising chain obtained via the Jordan--Wigner transformation. We clarify the distinction between the recently proposed Kramers--Wannier dualities and those obtained by gauging the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry along a space-covering path. Our results extend naturally to higher-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories, providing a unified framework for bosonic and fermionic dualities and offering new insights for quantum computation and simulation.</description>

      <title>Searching for emergent spacetime in spin glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work on algebraic formulations of holographic dualities in terms of large $N$ algebras has revealed a deep connection between the properties of the associated spectral functions and the emergence of a semiclassical spacetime and causal horizons therein. One of the main lessons is that, for a radial direction to emerge, the spectral function has to exhibit non-compact support. Furthermore, there exist conjectures upon a possible duality between complex gravitational configurations and glassy systems. The goal of this paper is to combine these ideas by studying many-body quantum-mechanical systems and assess in which parameter regimes they could potentially be holographic. Thus, we compute the spectral functions of three many-body systems with quenched disorder, the SYK model, the $p$-spin model and the SU$(M)$ Heisenberg chain in the large $N$ limit and present results in different parameter regimes. Our main finding is that in the quantum spin glass phase of the SU$(M)$ Heisenberg model, the spectral function develops an exponential tail, similar to the large $q$ limit of SYK. Furthermore, we demonstrate the presence of an infinite family of quasiparticle excitations deep in the spin liquid phase of the $p$-spin model, which could point towards an emergent type I von Neumann algebra. In addition, we demonstrate the presence of an exponential tail in the spectral function for all cases without compact support and conformal symmetry. Motivated by this observation, we prove that no low-energy operator can detect a nontrivial bulk causal structure, if the spectral function has exponentially decaying tails.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic decoupling in the deep-strong coupling regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the deep-strong coupling (DSC) regime, the interaction between light and matter exceeds their bare frequencies, leading to an effective decoupling. Theoretical and experimental evidence for this behavior has relied solely on measurements of local observables at equilibrium. However, such a local approach is insufficient to accurately describe energy fluxes in critical and nonequilibrium phenomena. Here, we use a two-terminal quantum junction to derive a thermodynamically consistent global master equation. We demonstrate that the associated heat current, a key nonlocal observable in any quantum thermal machine, also approaches zero in this extreme coupling scenario, underscoring the role of virtual photons in the vacuum ground state. Our results indicate that the decoupling is a more general feature of the DSC regime, with implications for quantum thermotronics.</description>

      <title>The geometry and dynamics of annealed optimization in the coherent Ising machine with hidden and planted solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coherent Ising machine (CIM) is a nonconventional hardware architecture for finding approximate solutions to large-scale combinatorial optimization problems.It operates by annealing a laser gain parameter to adiabatically deform a high-dimensional energy landscape over a set of soft spins, going from a simple convex landscape to the more complex optimization landscape of interest. We address how the evolving energy landscapes guides the optimization dynamics against problems with hidden planted solutions. We study the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass with ferromagnetic couplings that favor a hidden configuration by combining the replica method, random matrix theory, the Kac-Rice method and dynamical mean field theory. We characterize energy, number, location, and Hessian eigenspectra of global minima, local minima, and critical points as the landscape evolves. We find that low energy global minima develop soft-modes which the optimization dynamics can exploit to descend the energy landscape. Even when these global minima are aligned to the hidden configuration, there can be exponentially many higher energy local minima that are all unaligned with the hidden solution. Nevertheless, the annealed optimization dynamics can evade this cloud of unaligned high energy local minima and descend near to aligned lower energy global minima. Eventually, as the landscape is further annealed, these global minima become rigid, terminating any further optimization gains from annealing. We further consider a second optimization problem, the Wishart planted ensemble, which contains a hidden planted solution in a landscape with tunable ruggedness. We describe CIM phase transitions between recoverability and non-recoverability of the hidden solution. Overall, we find intriguing relations between high-dimensional geometry and dynamics in analog machines for combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>Scrambling Without Chaos in Random Free-Fermionic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the role of randomness in the scrambling of quantum information within integrable free-fermionic systems. Considering quadratic Hamiltonians with varying degrees of randomness, we analyze entanglement-based measures to characterize the scrambling structure. We show that the memory effect in the entanglement of disjoint subsystems of Gaussian states vanishes when the local couplings are random, indicating information delocalization. The tripartite mutual information exhibits negative saturation values similar to those in chaotic systems, albeit with a smaller magnitude, revealing weaker scrambling under integrable quadratic dynamics. Despite integrability, spectral analyses reveal that local random models display a spectral-form-factor ramp and a partial crossover in the single-particle level-spacing ratio from Poisson-like to Wigner--Dyson-like behavior within a certain range of random couplings. These results demonstrate that randomness can act as a minimal ingredient for inducing information scrambling in integrable quadratic fermionic models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the lower bound of the entropy production in a one-dimensional underdamped Langevin system constrained by a time-dependent parabolic potential. We focus on minimizing the entropy production during transitions from a given initial distribution to a given final distribution taking a given finite time. We derive the conditions for achieving the minimum entropy production for the processes with normal distributions, using the evolution equations of the mean and covariance matrix to determine the optimal control protocols for stiffness and center of the potential. Our findings reveal that not all covariance matrices can be given as the initial and final conditions due to the limitations of the control protocol. This study extends existing knowledge of the overdamped systems to the underdamped systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15662v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Ising model under a time-varying, but spatially homogeneous, Gaussian random magnetic field. In the Monte Carlo simulations, we go beyond the standard analysis of the order parameter by measuring the magnetization probability distribution as a function of temperature and field strength, and by computing the time required for the system to escape from a completely ordered state of the magnetization. We identify three distinct phases: a soft-paramagnetic phase, a soft-ferromagnetic phase and a bona-fide ferromagnetic phase. These soft phases display broad magnetization distributions that tend to limiting forms that remain finite in both height and width in the thermodynamic limit. The transition between the soft-paramagnetic and soft-ferromagnetic phases is a noise-induced transition and, for small field amplitudes, occurs at the critical temperature of the field-free Ising model. The transition from the soft-ferromagnetic to the ferromagnetic phase occurs at lower temperatures and is discontinuous, yet it does not fall into the conventional first-order class. Instead, it is characterized by a diverging escape time from an ordered magnetization state.</description>

Abstract: We show that, on a $d-$dimensional hypercubic lattice with $d&gt;1$, conserved-mass transport processes, with {\it multidirectional} hopping that respect all symmetries of the lattice, exhibit power-law correlations for generic parameter values $-$ even {\it far} from phase transition point, if any. The key idea for generating the algebraic decay is the notion of {\it multidirectional} hopping, which means that several chunks of masses, or several particles, can hop out simultaneously from a lattice site in multiple directions, consequently breaking detailed balance. Notably, the systems we consider are described by a continuous-time Markov process, are diffusive, {\it lattice-rotation symmetric}, spatially homogeneous and thus have {\it no} net mass current. Using hydrodynamic and exact microscopic theory, we show that, for spatial dimensions $d &gt; 1$, the steady-state static density-density and ``activity''-density correlation functions in the thermodynamic limit typically decay as $\sim 1/r^{(d+2)}$ at large distance $r=|{\bf r}|$; the strength of the power law is exactly calculated for several models and expressed in terms of the density-dependent bulk-diffusion coefficient and Onsager matrix (or, mobility tensor). In particular, our theory explains why center-of-mass-conserving dynamics, used to model novel disordered {\it hyperuniform} state of matter, result in generic long-ranged correlations. However, in a restricted parameter regime, the correlations can also be short ranged and are characterized through the Onsager matrix.</description>

      <title>Spinning mixtures: nonreciprocity transfers chirality across scales in scalar densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A mixture of spinning particles of two different types represents a system where both nonreciprocity and chirality determine the emergent dynamics. In this work we present a minimal model for a two-species mixture of chiral active particles, formulated solely in terms of the number densities of the species. Both nonreciprocity and chirality enter the bulk part of the chemical potential, taking the form of local and non-local contributions, respectively. The chiral term manifests as the curl of the nonreciprocal current, which is non-zero when chasing interactions produces a local phase shift between the number densities. Chiral domains are localised and, as a result of number conservation, they have either positive or negative sign. The chiral domains pull in or push out particles depending on their sign and strongly modify the nonreciprocal dynamics. Their interplay generates distinctive dynamical states, including phase separation with edge currents and a spatio-temporally disordered phase with both chiral and nonreciprocal signatures.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of the steady state for run-and-tumble particles with a double-well interaction potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $N$ run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) in one dimension interacting via a double-well potential $W(r)=-k_0 \, r^2/2+g \, r^4/4$, which is repulsive at short interparticle distance $r$ and attractive at large distance. At large time, the system forms a bound state where the density of particles has a finite support. We focus on the determination of the total density of particles in the stationary state $\rho_s(x)$, in the limit $N\to+\infty$. We obtain an explicit expression for $\rho_s(x)$ as a function of the ''renormalized" interaction parameter $k=k_0-3m_2$ where $m_2$ is the second moment of $\rho_s(x)$. Interestingly, this stationary solution exhibits a transition between a connected and a disconnected support for a certain value of $k$, which has no equivalent in the case of Brownian particles. Analyzing in detail the expression of the stationary density in the two cases, we find a variety of regimes characterized by different behaviors near the edges of the support and around $x=0$. Furthermore, we find that the mapping $k_0\to k$ becomes multi-valued below a certain value of the tumbling rate $\gamma$ of the RTPs for some range of values of $k_0$ near the transition, implying the existence of two stable solutions. Finally, we show that in the case of a disconnected support, it is possible to observe steady states where the density $\rho_s(x)$ is not symmetric. All our analytical predictions are in good agreement with numerical simulations already for systems of $N = 100$ particles. The non-uniqueness of the stationary state is a particular feature of this model in the presence of active (RTP) noise, which contrasts with the uniqueness of the Gibbs equilibrium for Brownian particles. We argue that these results are also relevant for a class of more realistic interactions with both an attractive and a repulsive part, but which decay at infinity.</description>

      <title>The probability of almost all eigenvalues being real for the elliptic real Ginibre ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate real eigenvalues of real elliptic Ginibre matrices of size $n$, indexed by the parameter of asymmetry $\tau \in [0,1]$. In both the strongly and weakly non-Hermitian regimes, where $\tau \in [0,1)$ is fixed or $1-\tau=O(1/n)$, respectively, we derive the asymptotic expansion of the probability $p_{n,n-2l}$ that all but a finite number $2l$ of eigenvalues are real. In particular, we show that the expansion is of the form \begin{align*} \log p_{n, n-2l} = \begin{cases} a_1 n^2 +a_2 n + a_3 \log n +O(1) &amp;\text{at strong non-Hermiticity}, \\ b_1 n +b_2 \log n + b_3 +o(1) &amp;\text{at weak non-Hermiticity}, \end{cases} \end{align*} and we determine all coefficients explicitly. Furthermore, in the special case where $l=1$, we derive the full-order expansions. For the proofs, we employ distinct methods for the strongly and weakly non-Hermitian regimes. In the former case, we utilise potential-theoretic techniques to analyse the free energy of elliptic Ginibre matrices conditioned to have $n-2l$ real eigenvalues, together with the strong Szeg\H{o} limit theorems. In the latter case, we utilise the skew-orthogonal polynomial formalism and the asymptotic behaviour of the Hermite polynomials.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of kinetic proofreading inherited in ligation-based information replication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate that information replication by templated ligation of DNA strands inherits a kinetic proofreading mechanism and achieves significant error suppression through cascade replication. A simple simulation model derived from the experimental results shows that templated ligation has a significant advantage over replication by polymerization for error suppression of long strands. Specifically, longer chains show lower error rates, significantly distinct from the chain-growth polymerization where errors typically accumulate with chain length. This mechanism provides a plausible route for high-fidelity replication in prebiotic chemistry and illustrates how physical principles such as nonequilibrium kinetics and network architecture can drive reliable molecular information replication. The approach also offers new strategies for error suppression in biotechnology.</description>

      <title>Neural Thermodynamics: Entropic Forces in Deep and Universal Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid discovery of emergent phenomena in deep learning and large language models, understanding their cause has become an urgent need. Here, we propose a rigorous entropic-force theory for understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. Building on the theory of parameter symmetries and an entropic loss landscape, we show that representation learning is crucially governed by emergent entropic forces arising from stochasticity and discrete-time updates. These forces systematically break continuous parameter symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning optimization. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that a combination of entropic forces and symmetry breaking is key to understanding emergent phenomena in deep learning.</description>

      <title>Exact downfolding and its perturbative approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving the many-electron problem, even approximately, is one of the most challenging and simultaneously most important problems in contemporary condensed matter physics with various connections to other fields. The standard approach is to follow a divide and conquer strategy that combines various numerical and analytical techniques. A crucial step in this strategy is the derivation of an effective model for a subset of degrees of freedom by a procedure called downfolding, which often corresponds to integrating out energy scales far away from the Fermi level. In this work we present a rigorous formulation of this downfolding procedure, which complements the renormalization group picture put forward by Honerkamp [PRB 85, 195129 (2012)}]. We derive an exact effective model in an arbitrarily chosen target space (e.g. low-energy degrees of freedom) by explicitly integrating out the the rest space (e.g. high-energy degrees of freedom). Within this formalism we state conditions that justify a perturbative truncation of the downfolded effective interactions to just a few low-order terms. Furthermore, we utilize the exact formalism to formally derive the widely used constrained random phase approximation (cRPA), uncovering underlying approximations and highlighting relevant corrections in the process. Lastly, we detail different contributions in the material examples of fcc Nickel and the infinite-layer cuprate SrCuO$_2$. Our results open up a new pathway to obtain effective models in a controlled fashion and to judge whether a chosen target space is suitable.</description>

      <title>From Confinement to Chaos in AdS/CFT Correspondence via Non-equilibrium Local States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study excited states in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space prepared by local operator insertions of a massive scalar field, corresponding to local operator quenches in a free bulk scalar theory. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we compute the time evolution of boundary observables in the dual CFT states. We then introduce a hard wall in AdS Poincare coordinates to impose an infrared cutoff (hard-wall), creating a confining deformation of the dual conformal field theory, and analyze the dynamics of excited states in this confining background. By comparing the evolution of boundary two-point correlation functions in the deformed theory to the statistics of Gaussian random matrix ensembles, we show that for sufficiently heavy operators, the spacing-ratio statistics of peaks in temporal dynamics are closest to those of the Gaussian Symplectic Ensemble (GSE). Finally, we extend the analysis to the compact BTZ black hole and to its hard-wall deformation, finding qualitatively similar trends.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In biosensing and diagnostic applications, a key objective is to design detection systems capable of identifying targets at very low concentrations, i.e., achieving high sensitivity. Here, we propose a linker-mediated detection scheme in which the presence of target molecules (linkers) facilitates the adsorption of ligand-coated guest nanoparticles onto a receptor-coated host substrate. Through a combination of computer simulations and mean-field theory, we demonstrate that, at fixed overall binding strength, increasing the valency of linkers exponentially lowers the concentration threshold for detection. This enables the identification of targets at extremely low concentrations, which is critical for early-stage disease and pathogen diagnostics. Furthermore, superselectivity with respect to binding strength is preserved for multivalent linkers, allowing for effective discrimination between targets and non-targets. Our findings highlight multivalency engineering of linkers as a powerful strategy to dramatically enhance the sensitivity of biodetection systems.</description>

      <title>A Tale of Two Uplifts: Parisi-Sourlas with Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Defects in conformal field theories (CFTs) play a key role in critical phenomena by modifying scaling behaviors and generating new universality classes. We introduce Parisi-Sourlas (PS) supersymmetry in the presence of extended operators and demonstrate that any $p$-dimensional defect in a CFT$_d$ can be uplifted to a defect in a PS-supersymmetric CFT$_{d+2}$. Surprisingly, there are actually two distinct uplifted defects--of dimensions $p$ and $p+2$--which reduce to the original one. We show how this reduction works for correlators with insertions both in the bulk and on the defect. As a byproduct, we find new relations between defect conformal blocks in dimensions $d$ and $d+2$. We further show that the reduction of the $p$-dimensional defect implies and extend a "global symmetry reduction" previously considered in the literature. Finally, we provide various examples of these uplifts, including perturbative computations in epsilon expansion of the uplift of the Ising magnetic line defect, as well as exact computations of observables in the four-dimensional uplift of minimal models with boundaries.</description>

      <title>Quantum Corrections in the Low-Temperature Fluid/Gravity Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attempts to construct a low-temperature version of the fluid/gravity correspondence have faced obstacles manifested in the form of logarithmic terms in the frequency, $\log(\omega)$, leading to non-local in time constitutive relations for the stress tensor and the charge current. These difficulties can be broadly presented as a breakdown of the hydrodynamic description due to additional infrared modes. We employ new quantum insights into the physics of near-extremal black holes, brought about in the context of Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, as an effective description of quantum fluctuations in the throat, to revisit the fluid/gravity correspondence at very low temperatures. The quantum corrections naturally include a new length scale, $C$, and an effective action that parametrizes the breaking of near-horizon symmetries. We show that with an appropriate choice of order of limits in the derivative expansion within the low-temperature regime, the $\log(\omega)$ infrared divergence can be resolved. By quantum averaging the infrared Schwarzian modes as an effective extra contribution to the long-wavelength fluid modes, the resulting low-temperature effective fluid description is consistent. We present the dispersion relations for all the relevant hydrodynamic modes. We also revisit the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio and find that at very low temperatures the universal $\frac{1}{4\pi}$ bound is violated due to quantum correction.</description>

      <title>Surface-induced ordering and continuous breaking of translational symmetry in conjugated polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface-induced liquid crystalline phase transitions evoke fundamental interest and can provide deeper insight into the nature of low-dimensional phase transitions. Board-like conjugated polymers are particularly interesting because they exhibit novel sanidic liquid crystalline mesophases that remain largely unexplored. Specifically, although preferential molecular orientation near the free surface has been observed in films of conjugated polymers, the mechanism of its formation remains unclear. Here, we use grazing-incidence X-ray scattering to monitor the formation and breaking of positional order in situ in thin films of two conjugated polymers representative of two classes: polythiophenes and polydiketopyrrolopyrroles. Our results reveal that the surface induces positional order in films of both conjugated polymers through the formation of a highly oriented, sanidic disordered mesophase at the surface. This ordering process continues upon cooling and undergoes multiple liquid crystalline transitions into more ordered phases, both at the surface and in the bulk, which can compete with each other. The positional smectic-like order parameter exhibits continuous temperature dependence near the transition, signifying a continuous breaking of translational symmetry by the surface. Theoretical analysis enables us to accurately describe the order parameter when critical behavior is considered.</description>
