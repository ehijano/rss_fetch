      <title>Observation of $t\bar{t}$ production in the lepton+jets and dilepton channels in $p$+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=8.16$ TeV with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports the observation of top-quark pair production in proton-lead collisions in the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The measurement is performed using 165 nb$^{-1}$ of $p$+Pb data collected at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=8.16$ TeV in 2016. Events are categorised in two analysis channels, consisting of either events with exactly one lepton (electron or muon) and at least four jets, or events with two opposite-charge leptons and at least two jets. In both channels at least one $b$-tagged jet is also required. Top-quark pair production is observed with a significance over five standard deviations in each channel. The top-quark pair production cross-section is measured to be $\sigma_{t\bar{t}}= 58.1\pm 2.0\;\mathrm{(stat.)\;^{+4.8}_{-4.4} \;\mathrm{(syst.)}}\;\mathrm{nb}$, with a total uncertainty of 9%. In addition, the nuclear modification factor is measured to be $R_{p\mathrm{A}} = 1.090\pm0.039\;(\mathrm{stat.})\;^{+0.094}_{-0.087}\;(\mathrm{syst.})$. The measurements are found to be in good agreement with theory predictions involving nuclear parton distribution functions.</description>

      <title>High Voltage Determination and Stabilization for Collinear Laser Spectroscopy Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast beam collinear laser spectroscopy is the established method to investigate nuclear ground state properties such as the spin, the electromagnetic moments, and the charge radius of exotic nuclei. These are extracted with high precision from atomic observables, i.e., the hyperfine splitting and its the isotope shift, which becomes possible due to a large reduction of the Doppler broadening by compressing the velocity width of the ion beam through electrostatic acceleration. With the advancement of the experimental methods and applied devices, e.g., to measure and stabilize the laser frequency, the acceleration potential became the dominant systematic uncertainty contribution. To overcome this, we present a custom-built high-voltage divider, which was developed and tested at the German metrology institute (PTB), and a feedback loop that enabled collinear laser spectroscopy to be performed at a 100-kHz level. Furthermore, we describe the impact of field penetration into the laser-ion-interaction region. This strongly affects the determined isotope shifts and hyperfine splittings, if Doppler tuning is applied, i.e., the ion beam energy is altered instead of scanning the laser frequency. Using different laser frequencies that were referenced to a frequency comb, the field penetration was extracted laser spectroscopically. This allowed us to define an effective scanning potential to still apply the faster and easier Doppler tuning without introducing systematic deviations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new isomeric state in $^{162}$Tb at 285.5(32) keV was reported by R. Orford et al. [Phys. Rev. C 102, 011303(R) (2020)] from the Penning-trap mass measurement. Here we show that this result is not compatible with existing experimental data. We also demonstrate that the state identified as the $^{162}$Tb ground state is most likely a contaminant while the mass-excess value of $^{162}$Tb$^{m}$ is the real ground state.</description>

      <title>Onset of scaling violation in pion and kaon elastic electromagnetic form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a symmetry-preserving truncation of the quantum field equations describing hadron properties, parameter-free predictions are delivered for pion and kaon elastic electromagnetic form factors, $F_{P=\pi,K}$, thereby unifying them with kindred results for nucleon elastic electromagnetic form factors. Regarding positive-charge states, the analysis stresses that the presence of scaling violations in QCD entails that $Q^2 F_P(Q^2)$ should exhibit a single maximum on $Q^2&gt;0$. Locating such a maximum is both necessary and sufficient to establish the existence of scaling violations. The study predicts that, for charged $\pi$, $K$ mesons, the $Q^2 F_P(Q^2)$ maximum lies in the neighbourhood $Q^2 \simeq 5\,$GeV$^2$. Foreseeable experiments will test these predictions and, providing their $Q^2$ reach meets expectations, potentially also provide details on the momentum dependence of meson form factor scaling violation.</description>

      <title>Formal Theory of Heavy Ion Double Charge Exchange Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of heavy ion double charge exchange (DCE) reactions $A(Z,N)\to A(Z\pm 2,N\mp 2)$ is recapitulated emphasizing the role of Double Single Charge Exchange (DSCE) and pion-nucleon Majorana DCE (MDCE) reactions. DSCE reactions are of second--order distorted wave character, mediated by isovector nucleon-nucleon (NN) interactions. The DSCE response functions resemble the nuclear matrix elements (NME) of $2\nu 2\beta$ decay. The MDCE process proceeds by a dynamically generated effective rank-2 isotensor interaction, defined by off--shell pion--nucleon DCE scattering. In closure approximation pion potentials and two--nucleon correlations are obtained, similar to the neutrino potentials and the intranuclear exchange of Majorana neutrinos in $0\nu 2 \beta$ Majorana double beta decay (MDBD).</description>

      <title>Ab initio computations of strongly deformed nuclei around $^{80}$Zr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclei around $N\approx Z\approx 40$ are strongly deformed and exhibit coexistence of shapes. These phenomena have challenged nuclear models. Here we perform ab initio coupled-cluster computations of low-lying collective states and electromagnetic quadrupole transitions of the even-even nuclei $^{72}$Kr, $^{76,78}$Sr, $^{78,80}$Zr and $^{84}$Mo starting from chiral nucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon forces. Our calculations reproduce the coexistence of oblate and prolate shapes in these nuclei, yield rotational bands and strong electromagnetic transitions, but are not accurate for some observables and nuclei. These results highlight the advances and challenges of ab initio computations of heavy deformed nuclei.</description>

      <title>Characterization of a novel proton-CT scanner based on Silicon and LaBr$_3$(Ce) detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Treatment planning systems at proton-therapy centres generally use X-ray computed tomography (CT) as primary imaging technique to infer the proton treatment doses to tumour and healthy tissues. However, proton stopping powers in the body, as derived from X-ray images, suffer from important proton-range uncertainties. In order to reduce this uncertainty in range, one could use proton-CT images instead. The main goal of this work is to test the capabilities of a newly-developed proton-CT scanner, based on the use of a set of tracking detectors and a high energy resolution scintillator for the residual energy of the protons. Different custom-made phantoms were positioned at the field of view of the scanner and were irradiated with protons at the CCB proton-therapy center in Krakow. We measured with the phantoms at different angles and produced sinograms that were used to obtain reconstructed images by Filtered Back-Projection (FBP). The obtained images were used to determine the capabilities of our scanner in terms of spatial resolution and proton Relative Stopping Power mapping and validate its use as proton-CT scanner. The results show that the scanner can produce medium-high quality images, with spatial resolution better than 2 mm in radiography, below 3 mm in tomography and resolving power in the RSP comparable to other state of the art pCT cameras.</description>

      <title>Radon Concentration Measurement with a High-Sensitivity Radon Detector at the Yemilab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The radiation emitted from radon is a critical background in rare event search experiments conducted at the Yemi Underground Laboratory (Yemilab) in Jeongseon, Korea. A Radon Reduction System(RRS) has been developed and installed in Yemilab to reduce radon concentration in the air. The RRS primarily provides a purified air of 50 m3/h to the cleanroom used to assemble crystal detectors in the AMoRE, a neutrinoless double beta decay search experiment. RRS can reduce the radon level by a factor of 300, so a high-sensitivity radon detector was required. A highly sensitive radon detector was constructed using a 70 L chamber with a large PIN photodiode to measure radon concentration in the purified air. The radon detector shows an excellent resolution of 72 keV (FWHM) for 6.003 MeV alphas from 218Po decay and a sensitivity down to 23.8 +- 2.1 mBq/m3 with a boil-off N2 gas sample. The radon concentration level from the RRS measured by the radon detector was below 0.29 Bq/m3 with a reduction factor of about 300.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the underlying structure of axial-vector bottom-charm tetraquarks in the light of their magnetic moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16191v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnetic moment yields an excellent framework to explore the inner structure of particles determined by the quark-gluon dynamics of QCD, as it is the leading-order response of a bound system to a weak external magnetic field. Motivated by this, in this study, the magnetic moments of possible axial-vector $T_{bc\bar u \bar u}$, $T_{bc\bar d \bar d}$, and $T_{bc\bar u \bar d}$ tetraquarks are obtained with the help of light-cone QCD sum rules. For this purpose, we assume that these states are represented as a diquark-antidiquark picture with different structures and interpolating currents. The magnetic moment results derived using different diquark-antidiquark configurations differ substantially from each other. This can be translated into more than one tetraquark state with the same quantum number and quark content yet possessing different magnetic moments. From the numerical results obtained, we have concluded that the magnetic moments of the $T_{bc}$ states can project their inner structure, which can be used for their quantum numbers and quark-gluon organization. The contribution of individual quarks to the magnetic moments is also analyzed for completeness. We hope that our predictions of the magnetic moments of the $T_{bc}$ tetraquarks, together with the results of other theoretical investigations of the spectroscopic parameters and decay widths of these interesting tetraquarks, may be valuable in the search for these states in future experiments and in unraveling the internal structure of these tetraquarks.</description>

      <title>The odd-even differences in stability peninsula for $106 \leqslant Z \leqslant 112$ region with the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The predictive power of the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc) with density functional PC-PK1 is demonstrated for superheavy region ($101 \leqslant Z \leqslant 120$) by comparing with available experimental and evaluated data in the AME2020. The DRHBc theory predicts 93 bound nuclei beyond the drip line $N = 258$ in the region of $106 \leqslant Z \leqslant 112$, which form a stability peninsula. The odd-even differences between odd-$N$ and even-$N$ nuclei are remarkable in the stability peninsula; the number of bound odd-$N$ nuclei is less than that of bound even-$N$ nuclei, and the one-neutron separation energy of an odd-$N$ nucleus is smaller than those of its neighboring even-$N$ nuclei due to the blocking effect. The deformation effect is indispensable for the reentrant stability beyond the drip line by significantly affecting the structure of single-particle levels around the Fermi energy. The interplay between deformation and pairing effects affects the position where the odd-$N$ nucleus becomes bound in the stability peninsula. By examining the deformation effect at different orders, it is found that quadrupole deformation makes leading contribution to the appearance of stability peninsula and the effects of hexadecapole and hexacontatetrapole deformations are nonnegligible.</description>
