      <title>Double rotatory power reversal and continuous Kerr angle in bi-isotropic media with anomalous Hall current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate optical properties of bi-isotropic materials under the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) of the axion electrodynamics. Four refractive indices associated with circularly polarized waves are achieved, implying circular birefringence with rotatory power (RP) endowed with double sign reversal, an exotic optical signature for chiral dielectrics. The Kerr rotation and ellipticity are analyzed, with an unusual observation of rotation angle deprived of discontinuity. Anomalous reflection (greater than unity) is also reported, associated with negative refraction stemming from the anomalous transport properties. These effects constitute the singular optical signature of a bi-isotropic media with the AHE.</description>

      <title>Bi, Cr and Ag dopants in PbTe and SnTe: impact of the host band symmetry on doping properties by ab initio calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Doping properties of Bi, Cr and Ag dopants in thermoelectric and topological materials PbTe and SnTe are analyzed based on density functional theory calculations in the local density approximations and the large supercell method. In agreement with experiment, in both PbTe and SnTe, Bi is a donor and Ag is an acceptor with a vanishing magnetic moment. In contrast, Cr is a resonant donor in PbTe, and an resonant acceptor in SnTe. We also consider the electronic structure of cation vacancies in PbTe and SnTe, since these abundant native defects induce $p$-type conductivity in both hosts. The quantitatively different impact of these dopants/defects on the host band structure of PbTe and SnTe (level energies, band splittings, band inversion, and a different level of hybridization between dopant and host states) is explained based on the group-theoretical arguments.</description>

      <title>On the relation between fractional charge and statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit an argument, originally given by Kivelson and Ro\v{c}ek, for why the existence of fractional charge necessarily implies fractional statistics. In doing so, we resolve a contradiction in the original argument, and in the case of a $\nu = 1/m$ Laughlin holes, we also show that the standard relation between fractional charge and statistics is necessary by an argument based on a t'Hooft anomaly in a one-form global ${\mathcal Z}_m$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Shallow shadows: Expectation estimation using low-depth random Clifford circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.12924v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide practical and powerful schemes for learning many properties of an unknown n-qubit quantum state using a sparing number of copies of the state. Specifically, we present a depth-modulated randomized measurement scheme that interpolates between two known classical shadows schemes based on random Pauli measurements and random Clifford measurements. These can be seen within our scheme as the special cases of zero and infinite depth, respectively. We focus on the regime where depth scales logarithmically in n and provide evidence that this retains the desirable properties of both extremal schemes whilst, in contrast to the random Clifford scheme, also being experimentally feasible. We present methods for two key tasks; estimating expectation values of certain observables from generated classical shadows and, computing upper bounds on the depth-modulated shadow norm, thus providing rigorous guarantees on the accuracy of the output estimates. We consider observables that can be written as a linear combination of poly(n) Paulis and observables that can be written as a low bond dimension matrix product operator. For the former class of observables both tasks are solved efficiently in n. For the latter class, we do not guarantee efficiency but present a method that works in practice; by variationally computing a heralded approximate inverses of a tensor network that can then be used for efficiently executing both these tasks.</description>
