      <title>Nanoscale Femtosecond Coherent Radiation and Spatiotemporally Shaped free electron Wavefunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study tunable nanoscale femtosecond coherent radiation based on a coupled nanowire pair (CNP) structure that is excited by a strong laser. The structure functions as a nanoscale undulator (NU): the electrons moving through the nanogap are driven by a spatially periodic, transverse optical near-field. We show that the transverse near-field can actively shape the electron wavefunction by inducing both a periodic oscillation and a quantum squeezing of its width. We then validate this theoretical framework by numerically solving the relativistically corrected time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (RC-TDSE). The generated femtosecond pulse trains can be spectrally, temporally, and spatially controlled. This framework establishes the transverse optical near-field interaction as a novel mechanism to spatiotemporally shape electron wavefunctions, which illuminates a path to versatile platform for on-chip femtosecond coherent light source and the application in free-electron quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Ligand Engineering for Precise Control of Strongly-Confined CsPbI3 Nanoplatelet Superlattices for Efficient Light-Emitting Diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly-confined perovskite nanoplatelets (PeNPLs) offer promising opportunities for photonics and optoelectronics due to their narrowband emission, control over the transition dipole moment, and potential for polarized light emission. However, achieving uniform PeNPLs and effective surface passivation major challenges, especially for red-emitting iodide-based compounds. Here, we address these challenges with an ancillary ligand engineering strategy. Combining experimental and ab-initio modelling techniques, we demonstrate that ligands possessing an optimal backbone with strong surface binding and Pb-coordination not only passivate defects, but also improve thickness uniformity. The PeNPLs self-assemble into superlattices a single emission peak, indicative of uniform monolayer formation and orientation-dependent optical properties. Uniform-monolayer PeNPLs obtained with benzylphosphonic acid (BPAc) self-assemble into well-ordered superlattices with orientation-dependent optical properties. Face-down PeNPL thin films fabricated with solvent engineering exhibit Lambertian-like emission suitable for light-emitting devices, while edge-up oriented films exhibit linearly polarized emission. When integrated into light-emitting diodes, our PeNPL devices achieve a external quantum efficiency of 13.1%, the highest reported for strongly-confined PeNPL-based devices. Taken together, these results establish ancillary ligand-induced synthesis of uniform-monolayer PeNPLs as a decisive route to robust orientation control, positioning it as the central principle for advancing next-generation photonic and display technologies.</description>

      <title>Energy estimates for wave amplification in quasiperiodic Fibonacci time-modulated media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fibonacci time quasicrystals can be approximated by temporal supercells to reveal a fractal collection of $k$ gaps, in which wave energy is amplified exponentially. These estimates are validated by the observation of "super" $k$ gaps that are independent of the duration of the temporal supercell. This approach predicts the regions of parametric amplification and provides accurate estimates of the energy growth rate.</description>

      <title>Perovskite Nanocrystals as Emerging Single-Photon Emitters: Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) have emerged as leading candidates for next-generation quantum emitters, offering a unique combination of high photoluminescence quantum yield, tunable emission, short radiative lifetimes, and record-high single-photon purity under ambient conditions. These properties, together with low-cost and scalable solution-phase fabrication, position PNCs as attractive alternatives to traditional epitaxial and colloidal quantum dots. In this Review, we outline the physical parameters that define quantum emission in PNCs, compare their performance to other established and emerging quantum emitters, and assess the key figures of merit, including photostability, single-photon purity, and photon indistinguishability, required for practical quantum applications. We discuss underlying mechanisms affecting PNC emission behavior and highlight recent advances in improving their quantum emitting properties through synthetic and photonic engineering approaches. While challenges related to environmental stability and photon indistinguishability remain, emerging strategies, such as surface passivation, metal ion doping, and coupling with electromagnetic nano- and micro-cavities, are steadily closing the gap between PNCs and ideal quantum light sources.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Enhanced Analysis for Delineating Anticoagulant Essay Efficacy Using Phase Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coagulation of blood after it is drawn from the body poses a significant challenge for hematological analysis, potentially leading to inaccurate test results and altered cellular characteristics, compromising diagnostic reliability. This paper presents a deep learning-enhanced framework for delineating anticoagulant efficacy ex vivo using Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM). We demonstrate a label-free, non-invasive approach for analyzing human blood samples, capable of accurate cell counting and morphological estimation. A DHM with an automated image processing and deep learning pipeline is built for morphological analysis of the blood cells under two different anti-coagulation agents, e.g. conventional EDTA and novel potassium ferric oxalate nanoparticles (KFeOx-NPs). This enables automated high-throughput screening of cells and estimation of blood coagulation rates when samples are treated with different anticoagulants. Results indicated that KFeOx-NPs prevented human blood coagulation without altering the cellular morphology of red blood cells (RBCs), whereas EDTA incubation caused notable changes within 6 hours of incubation. The system allows for quantitative analysis of coagulation dynamics by assessing parameters like cell clustering and morphology over time in these prepared samples, offering insights into the comparative efficacy and effects of anticoagulants outside the body.</description>

      <title>3D Stokes polarimetric imaging at nanoscales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical fields polarized along three dimensions are frequent in optical microscopy and nanophotonics, and yet retrieving their polarization distribution is challenging. We present the experimental implementation of three-dimensional (3D) Stokes polarimetric imaging of nonparaxial optical fields with nanoscale spatial resolution. This approach extends classical Stokes polarimetry (traditionally limited to paraxial fields) into the nonparaxial regime. We use an array of gold nanospheres, each acting as a localized electric dipolar scatterer, to probe 3D polarization states over a field of view of tens of micrometers. The scattered signal is collected by a high numerical aperture objective lens and separated into its circular polarization components, providing a very simple imaging system. We introduce a computational algorithm to efficiently extract the physical parameters from the generated dipole spread functions with a high throughput across the whole field of view. Finally, we show that this method can also be applied to single-molecule localization and orientation fluorescence microscopy.</description>

      <title>Polarization-Sensitive Module for Optical Coherence Tomography Instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) extends OCT by analyzing the polarization states of backscattered light to quantify tissue birefringence. However, conventional implementations require polarization-diverse detection and are therefore incompatible with most commercial OCT systems. As a result, PS-OCT has largely remained restricted to specialized research groups, limiting its broader scientific and clinical use. Here, we present a modular PS-OCT framework that integrates with a standard spectral-domain OCT platform through a detachable rotating achromatic half-wave plate in the sample arm. This waveplate modulates both incident and reflected polarization states. Three or more repeated measurements at distinct waveplate orientations enable reconstruction of the sample's round-trip Jones matrix and the corresponding polarization properties. To mitigate random phase variations between repeated measurements, we introduce a retarder-constrained phase optimization strategy. We validate the framework with imaging of birefringent phantoms and human retina in vivo, demonstrating reliable reconstruction of retardance and optic axis orientation. This approach requires only minimal hardware modification and is readily deployable on mainstream OCT systems. Lowering technical barriers paves the way for rapid and widespread deployment of PS-OCT across diverse biomedical applications in both research and clinical environments.</description>

      <title>Improving conditional generative adversarial networks for inverse design of plasmonic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a key tool for designing nanophotonic structures that manipulate light at sub-wavelength scales. We investigate how to inversely design plasmonic nanostructures using conditional generative adversarial networks. Although a conventional approach of measuring the optical properties of a given nanostructure is conceptually straightforward, inverse design remains difficult because the existence and uniqueness of an acceptable design cannot be guaranteed. Furthermore, the dimensionality of the design space is often large, and simulation-based methods become quickly intractable. Deep learning methods are well-suited to tackle this problem because they can handle effectively high-dimensional input data. We train a conditional generative adversarial network model and use it for inverse design of plasmonic nanostructures based on their extinction cross section spectra. Our main result shows that adding label projection and a novel embedding network to the conditional generative adversarial network model, improves performance in terms of error estimates and convergence speed for the training algorithm. The mean absolute error is reduced by an order of magnitude in the best case, and the training algorithm converges more than three times faster on average. This is shown for two network architectures, a simpler one using a fully connected neural network architecture, and a more complex one using convolutional layers. We pre-train a convolutional neural network and use it as surrogate model to evaluate the performance of our inverse design model. The surrogate model evaluates the extinction cross sections of the design predictions, and we show that our modifications lead to equally good or better predictions of the original design compared to a baseline model. This provides an important step towards more efficient and precise inverse design methods for optical elements.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary geometry electromagnetic spatiotemporal vortices from phase velocity shearing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In fluids, vortices form at boundaries between flows of different velocities. Here, we show that pulsed electromagnetic waves form spatiotemporal vortices when light straddles media of different phase velocities. When the resulting relative time-delay is on the order of the pulse duration of light, spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOVs) are formed. This method allows generating arbitrary geometry spatiotemporal vortices, something impossible with previously demonstrated generation schemes. We provide experimental results showing THz frequency light can be encoded with arbitrary spatiotemporal vortex geometries using simple planar fused filament prints made from a commercial 3D printer. We provide several demonstrations of unique geometries including squares, triangles, ring arrays, and arbitrary curves that cannot be generated with existing techniques. We also show that multiple ring and line vortices can be formed simultaneously, which undergo complex reconnections with propagation. While demonstrated at THz frequencies, this concept is directly applicable to visible and infrared light and our theory offers a way for optimizing STOVs for the frequency range and pulse duration of a given light source. This technique provides a practical and straight-forward method to generate arbitrary electromagnetic spatiotemporal vortices and enables production of complex spatiotemporal phenomena like vortex reconnections.</description>

      <title>Lattice Resonances in Periodic Arrays of Time-Modulated Scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice resonances are collective optical modes supported by periodic arrays of scatterers, arising from their coherent interaction enabled by the underlying periodicity. Owing to their collective nature, these resonances produce optical responses that are both stronger and spectrally narrower than those of individual scatterers. While such phenomena have been extensively studied in conventional time-invariant systems, recent advances in time-varying photonics present new opportunities to exploit and enhance the extraordinary characteristics of these collective modes. Here, we investigate lattice resonances in periodic arrays of time-modulated scatterers using a simple framework based on the dipolar approximation and time-Floquet theory, where each scatterer is modeled as a harmonic oscillator with periodically varying optical properties. We begin by analyzing the response of an individual scatterer, leveraging our model to identify the complex eigenfrequencies that define its dynamics. We show that, for the appropriate modulation amplitude and frequency, the imaginary part of one of these eigenfrequencies vanishes, leading to amplification. Building on this, we extend our analysis to a periodic array to investigate the effect of the interplay between temporal modulation and lattice resonances. In contrast to isolated scatterers, the collective nature of lattice resonances introduces a markedly more intricate spectral dependence of the amplification regime. Notably, this amplification emerges at substantially lower modulation strengths, facilitated by the enhanced light-matter interaction and increased lifetime provided by these collective resonances. Our work establishes a simple theoretical framework for understanding collective lattice resonances in time-modulated arrays, enabling dynamic control and amplification of these modes.</description>

      <title>Charged-particle control via spatio-temporally tailored pulses from gas-based nonlinear optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas-filled waveguides enable few-cycle, spatio-temporally coupled (STC) pulses with programmable structure, opening new routes to control charged particles with optical fields. This review maps the landscape of optical-field-driven photoemission, then surveys gas-based nonlinear drivers, photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) for low-energy, high-repetition operation and hollow-core capillaries (HCCs) for high-power, few-cycle synthesis. We highlight mechanisms for deterministic pulse shaping, including four-wave-mixing-based spectral-phase transfer in HCCs, and show how tailored STC waveforms steer emission dynamics from the multiphoton to tunneling regimes, enabling sub-cycle gating, momentum control, and brightness scaling. We conclude with open challenges: phase stability, mid-IR scalability, coupling to nanophotonic emitters, metrology of vectorial fields, and outline a path toward compact, ultrafast, phase-coherent electron sources and emerging quantum applications powered by nonlinear photonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) supports the negotiation and sharing of private keys with unconditional security between authorized parties. Over the years, theoretical advances and experimental demonstrations have successfully transitioned QKD from laboratory research to commercial applications. As QKD expands its reach globally, it encounters challenges such as performance limitations, cost, and practical security concerns. Nonetheless, innovations in satellite-based QKD and the development of new protocols are paving the way towards a worldwide network. In this review, we provide an overview of QKD implementations, with a focus on protocols, devices, and quantum channels. We discuss the challenges of practical QKD and explore long-haul QKD. Additionally, we highlight the future research directions that are expected to significantly advance the realization of a global QKD network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum networks and remote quantum entanglement serve as vital future quantum communication resources with broad applicability. A key direction lies in extending the baseline of optical interferometers to enhance angular resolution in interferometric imaging. Here, by measuring a simulated thermal light field, we report the demonstration of a memory-assisted nonlocal interferometer achieving a fiber-link baseline up to 20 km while simultaneously showing its capability to compensate for a geometric delay equivalent to 1.5 km. This result demonstrates potential for enhancing the angular resolution of interferometric imaging in the optical band with delocalized single-photon entanglement, and paves the way for future application of quantum memories in astronomical observation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reflective membrane mirrors provide a lightweight, low-cost alternative to traditional optics for next-generation large-aperture telescopes, but their non-rigid, thin structure poses challenges for surface metrology. We present a phase-measuring deflectometry (PMD) system enhanced with tailored ray-tracing and iterative reconstruction to enable non-contact measurement of large membrane optics. The system successfully characterizes the surface figure and evaluates the dynamic stability of a 1-meter Hencky-type membrane mirror. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PMD as a practical metrology tool for future membrane-based telescope systems.</description>

Abstract: We present a Raman-based Distributed Temperature Sensor (RDTS) with centimetre-scale resolution for thermographic analysis of electronic circuits. Temperature is measured along a single-mode fiber routed across a custom printed circuit board (PCB) with 1 cm$^2$ heating elements, using optical time-domain reflectometry of Raman signals detected by superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs). This approach enables two-dimensional thermal mapping of the PCB under heating configurations with multiple hotspots. A spatial resolution of 3 cm and a temperature accuracy of 2 {\deg}C are achieved with an integration time of 5 minutes. Thermography can be performed down to 77 K, revealing that the PCB thermal resistance decreases by nearly an order of magnitude compared to room temperature, due to enhanced convective cooling in liquid nitrogen. These results establish centimetre-scale RDTS as a robust technique for real-time, spatially resolved thermography of electronic circuits, particularly in regimes where infrared imaging is ineffective, such as at low temperatures or within volumetric electronic architectures.</description>

      <title>Bidimensional measurements of photon statistics within a multimodal temporal framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrafast imaging of photon statistics in two dimensions is a powerful tool for probing non-equilibrium and transient optical phenomena, yet it remains experimentally challenging due to the simultaneous need for high temporal resolution and statistical fidelity. In this work, we demonstrate spatially resolved single-shot measurements of photon number distributions using difference-frequency generation (DFG) in a nonlinear BBO crystal. We show that our platform can discriminate between coherent and thermal photon statistics across two spatial dimensions with picosecond resolution. At the same time, we find that the retrieved distributions deviate from the ideal ones, a consequence of vacuum contamination and the multimodal response of the amplifier. To explain this, we develop a temporal mode decomposition framework that captures the essential physics of signal amplification and fluorescence, and quantitatively reproduces the experimental findings. This establishes a robust approach for measuring two-dimensional photon statistics while clarifying the fundamental factors that limit the fidelity of such measurements.</description>

      <title>Photonic-integrated quantum sensor array for microscale magnetic localisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy centres (NVs) are promising solid-state nanoscale quantum sensors for applications ranging from material science to biotechnology. Using multiple sensors simultaneously offers advantages for probing spatiotemporal correlations of fluctuating fields or the dynamics of point defects. In this work, by integrating NVs with foundry silicon-nitride photonic integrated circuits, we realise the scalable operation of eight localised NV sensors in an array, with simultaneous, distinct readout of the individual sensors. Using the eight NV sensors and machine-learning methods for multi-point magnetic field reconstruction, we demonstrate microscale magnetic localisation of a 30 $\mu$m-sized needle tip. Experimentally, the needle tip can be localised with an error below its dimension and tracked dynamically with high fidelity. We further simulate the feasibility of our platform for monitoring the position and orientation of magnetic microrobots designed for biological and clinical purposes. Without the complexity of bulk optics, our photonic-integrated multi-sensor platform presents a step towards real-life biomedical applications under out-of-the-lab conditions.</description>

Abstract: We present an approach to compute time-optimal control of a quantum system which combines quantum brachistochrone and Lax pair techniques and enables efficient investigation of large-scale quantum systems. We illustrate our method by finding the fastest way to transfer a single-particle excitation in a nearest-neighbor-coupled infinitely large qubit lattice with the fixed sum of squares of the couplings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling second-order ($\chi^{(2)}$) nonlinear optical processes remains computationally expensive due to the need to resolve fast field oscillations and simulate wave propagation using methods like the split-step Fourier method (SSFM). This can become a bottleneck in real-time applications, such as high-repetition-rate laser systems requiring rapid feedback and control. We present an LSTM-based surrogate model trained on SSFM simulations generated from a start-to-end model of the photocathode drive laser at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory's Linac Coherent Light Source II. The model achieves over 250x speedup while maintaining high fidelity, enabling future real-time optimization and laying the foundation for data-integrated modeling frameworks and digital twins of laser systems.</description>

Abstract: We propose an innovative design for an optical Echo State Network (ESN), an advanced type of reservoir computer known for its universal computational capabilities. Our design enables an optical implementation of arbitrary ESNs, featuring flexibility in optical matrix multiplication and nonlinear activation. Leveraging the nonlinear characteristics of stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS), the architecture efficiently realizes measurement-free nonlinear activation. The approach significantly reduces computational overhead and energy consumption compared to traditional software-based methods. Comprehensive simulations validate the system's memory capacity, nonlinear processing strength, and polynomial algebra capabilities, showcasing performance comparable to software ESNs across key benchmark tasks. Our design establishes a feasible, scalable, and universally applicable framework for optical reservoir computing, suitable for diverse machine learning applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our earlier work on harmonic generation with complex light [Nature Communications 15, 6878 (2024)], we demonstrated how the harmonic spectrum of a complex laser beam in a nonlinear medium can be obtained through the judicious application of the ``beat wave'' concept. In this paper, we show how the same results can be obtained via the full set of symmetries of the initial laser-target configuration, and how this can be reconciled with the ``beat wave'' approach. We also highlight the connections between our work and existing theory for diffraction of EM waves from crystals: Laue equations, Mathieu equation, and theorems by Noether, Floquet and Bloch. The specific nature of our approach to harmonic spectra allows these connections to be revealed. We illustrate this with numerous examples taken from existing literature to show the wide applicability of our approach.</description>

      <title>Unveiling architectural and optoelectronic synergies in lead-free perovskite/perovskite/kesterite triple-junction monolithic tandem solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The widespread use of lead-based materials in tandem solar cells raises critical environmental and health concerns due to their inherent toxicity and risk of contamination. To address this challenge, we focused on lead-free tandem architectures based on non-toxic, environmentally benign materials such as tin-based perovskites and kesterites, which are essential for advancing sustainable photovoltaic technologies. In this study, we present the proposition, design, and optimization of two distinct lead-free monolithic tandem solar cell architectures - an all-perovskite dual-junction device employing potassium tin iodide (KSnI3) and formamidinium tin triiodide (FASnI3) as absorbers for the top and bottom subcells, respectively, and a triple-junction monolithic tandem structure incorporating KSnI3, FASnI3, and Ag-doped copper zinc tin selenide (ACZTSe) as absorbers for the top, middle, and bottom subcells, respectively. We simulated the optical and electrical characteristics of these devices using the finite-difference time-domain and finite element methods, explicitly considering radiative, non-radiative, and surface recombination mechanisms. The optimized all-perovskite dual-junction solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 27.3%, with short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 14.74 mA/cm2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 2.227 V, and fill factor (FF) of 83.14%. Conversely, the optimized triple-junction hybrid perovskite-kesterite architecture secured an elevated PCE of 30.69%, along with Jsc of 13.184 mA/cm2, Voc of 2.766 V, and FF of 84.18%. These findings reveal the strong potential of lead-free perovskite and kesterite material based absorbers in promoting high-performance hybrid tandem solar cells, highlighting their importance in advancing sustainable and efficient photovoltaic technologies.</description>

      <title>Nickel Doping Unlocks Ambient-condition Photostability in Individual Cesium Lead Bromide Perovskite Quantum Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing efficient single-photon sources is fundamental to advancing photonic quantum technologies. In particular, achieving scalable, cost-effective, stable, high-rate, and high-purity single-photon emission at ambient conditions is paramount for free-space quantum communication. However, fulfilling all the requirements simultaneously under ambient conditions has remained a significant challenge. Here, the scalable, cost-effective ambient condition synthesis of nickel doped (Ni doped) CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots (NPQDs) is presented using a modified ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP) method. The resulting individual NPQDs demonstrate remarkable photostability, sustaining their performance for over 10 minutes under ambient conditions with environment humidity of ~55%, and exhibit exceptional single-photon purity (&gt;99%) with a narrow emission linewidth (~70 meV). The remarkable photostability could be attributed to the spatial localization of exciton by Ni atoms on the surface of the nanocrystal, reducing its interaction with the environment. Our results demonstrated that NPQDs with outstanding combinations of quantum emitting properties can be both synthesized and operated at ambient conditions. These findings mark a significant step toward scalable, cost-effective quantum light sources for real-world applications, paving the way for robust quantum communication systems and devices.</description>

      <title>Coherent synchrotron radiation by excitation of surface plasmon polariton on near-critical solid microtube surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) is crucial for the development of powerful ultrashort light sources. We present a mechanism for generating CSR in the form of generalised superradiance, based on surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), which are resonantly excited on a solid, near-critical-density inner surface of a microtube. A high-intensity, circularly polarised laser pulse, propagating along the microtube axis, efficiently couples the cylindrical SPP modes. This process creates azimuthally structured, rotating electromagnetic fields. These rotating fields subsequently confine, modulate, and directly accelerate surface electrons to emit CSR in the Vavilov-Cherenkov angle. We further demonstrate that by improving the azimuthal symmetry of these electrons, the helical modulation enables CSR emission across all azimuthal directions in the form of isolated harmonics, significantly enhancing radiation intensity even when full coherence is imperfect. Our full 3D Particle-in-Cell simulations indicate this scheme can generate X-rays with coherence enhanced by up to two orders of magnitude compared to incoherent emission. The challenges to experimentally realise this scheme are discussed, including the need for high-contrast lasers to prevent pre-plasma formation and the demanding tolerances for microtube fabrication and alignment, while these challenges are not beyond the scope of existing or near-future experimental capabilities.</description>

      <title>Violation of local realism with spatially multimode parametric down-conversion pumped by spatially incoherent light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a violation of local realism with highly spatially multimode polarization-entangled two-photon states produced by spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) pumped by a spatially incoherent light source-a light-emitting diode (LED). While existing studies have observed such a violation only by post-selecting the LED-pumped SPDC photons into a single spatial detection mode, we achieve a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality violation of $S = 2.532 \pm 0.069 &gt; 2$ using a spatially multimode detection setup that collects nearly 4,080 SPDC spatial modes. These results indicate that coherent pump sources, such as lasers, are not required for SPDC-based entanglement generation. Our work could enable novel and practical sources of entangled photons for quantum technologies such as device-independent quantum key distribution and quantum-enhanced sensing.</description>

      <title>Experimental investigation of the role of spatial correlations in optical integration with heralded single photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21161v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate optical integration using heralded single photons and explore the influence of spatial correlations between photons on this process. Specifically, we experimentally harness the transverse spatial degrees of freedom of light within an optical processing framework based on heralded single photons. The integration is performed over binary phase patterns encoded via a phase-only spatial light modulator, with polarization serving as an auxiliary degree of freedom. Our findings reveal a distinct contrast in how spatial correlations affect image analysis: spatially uncorrelated photons are more effective at capturing the global features of an image encoded in the modulator, whereas spatially correlated photons exhibit enhanced sensitivity to local image details. Importantly, the optical integration scheme presented here bears a strong conceptual and operational resemblance to the DQC1 (Deterministic Quantum Computation with One Qubit) model. This connection underscores the potential of our approach for quantum-enhanced information processing, even in regimes where entanglement is minimal or absent.</description>

      <title>Scattering theory of frequency-entangled biphoton states facilitated by cavity polaritons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of quantum light to probe exciton properties in semiconductor and molecular nanostructures typically occurs in the low-intensity regime. A substantial enhancement of exciton-photon coupling can be achieved with photonic cavities, where excitons hybridize with cavity modes to form polariton states. To provide a theoretical framework for interpreting experimental efforts in this direction, we develop a scattering theory describing the interaction of frequency-entangled photon pairs with cavity polariton and bipolariton states under various coupling regimes. Employing the Tavis-Cummings model in combination with our scattering approach, we present a quantitative analysis of how the interaction of the entangled photon pair with the polariton/bipolariton modifies its joint spectral amplitude (JSA). Specifically, we examine the effects of the cavity-mode steady-state population, exciton-cavity coupling strength, and different forms of the input photon JSA. Our results show that the entanglement entropy of the scattered photons is highly sensitive to the interplay between the input JSA and the spectral line shapes of the polariton resonances, emphasizing the cavity filtering effects. We suggest that biphoton scattering quantum light spectroscopy best serves as a sensitive probe of polariton and bipolariton states in the photon-vacuum cavity state.</description>

Abstract: This is the manuscript of my "Habilitation \`a diriger des recherches", where I present the research work that I have done after my PhD, defended in 2009. The manuscript is divided in two parts. The first one is dedicated to atomic-structure calculations with neutral and trivalent lanthanides, in the contexts of ultracold gases and rare-earth doped solids. The second part deals with long-range interactions in ultracold gases of alkali-metal atoms and diatomic molecules, as well as lanthanide atoms. The detailed description of long-range interactions serves to characterize ultralow-temperature phenomena, like photoassociation and collisional shielding.</description>
