      <title>An improved point-to-surface contact algorithm with penalty method for peridynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is significantly challenging to obtain accurate contact forces in peridynamics (PD) simulations due to the difficulty of surface particles identification, particularly for complex geometries. Here, an improved point-to-surface contact model is proposed for PD with high accuracy. First, the outer surface is identified using the eigenvalue method and then we construct a Verlet list to identify potential contact particle pairs efficiently. Subsequently, a point-to-surface contact search algorithm is utilized to determine precise contact locations with the penalty function method calculating the contact force. Finally, the accuracy of this point-to-surface contact model is validated through several representative contact examples. The results demonstrate that the point-to-surface contact model model can predict contact forces and deformations with high accuracy, aligning well with the classical Hertz contact theory solutions. This work presents a contact model for PD that automatically recognizes external surface particles and accurately calculates the contact force, which provides guidance for the study of multi-body contact as well as complex contact situations.</description>

      <title>SSAAM: Sentiment Signal-based Asset Allocation Method with Causality Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study demonstrates whether financial text is useful for tactical asset allocation using stocks by using natural language processing to create polarity indexes in financial news. In this study, we performed clustering of the created polarity indexes using the change-point detection algorithm. In addition, we constructed a stock portfolio and rebalanced it at each change point utilizing an optimization algorithm. Consequently, the asset allocation method proposed in this study outperforms the comparative approach. This result suggests that the polarity index helps construct the equity asset allocation method.</description>

      <title>High-order projection-based upwind method for simulation of transitional turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a scalable, high-order implicit large-eddy simulation (ILES) approach for incompressible transitional flows. This method employs the mass-conserving mixed stress (MCS) method for discretizing the Navier-Stokes equations. The MCS method's low dissipation characteristics, combined with the introduced operator-splitting solution technique, result in a high-order solver optimized for efficient and parallel computation of under-resolved turbulent flows. We further enhance the inherent capabilities of the ILES model by incorporating high-order upwind fluxes and are examining its approximation behaviour in transitional aerodynamic flow problems. In this study, we use flows over the Eppler 387 airfoil at Reynolds numbers up to $3 \cdot 10^5$ as benchmarks for our simulations.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network Approach to Predict the Effects of Road Capacity Reduction Policies: A Case Study for Paris, France</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid urbanization and growing urban populations worldwide present significant challenges for cities, including increased traffic congestion and air pollution. Effective strategies are needed to manage traffic volumes and reduce emissions. In practice, traditional traffic flow simulations are used to test those strategies. However, high computational intensity usually limits their applicability in investigating a magnitude of different scenarios to evaluate best policies. This paper introduces an innovative approach to assess the effects of traffic policies using Graph Neural Networks (GNN). By incorporating complex transport network structures directly into the neural network, this approach could enable rapid testing of various policies without the delays associated with traditional simulations. We provide a proof of concept that GNNs can learn and predict changes in car volume resulting from capacity reduction policies. We train a GNN model based on a training set generated with a MATSim simulation for Paris, France. We analyze the model's performance across different road types and scenarios, finding that the GNN is generally able to learn the effects on edge-based traffic volume induced by policies. The model is especially successful in predicting changes on major streets. Nevertheless, the evaluation also showed that the current model has problems in predicting impacts of spatially small policies and changes in traffic volume in regions where no policy is applied due to spillovers and/or relocation of traffic.</description>

      <title>Implicit Neural Representation For Accurate CFD Flow Field Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the plethora of deep learning frameworks for flow field prediction, most of them deal with flow fields on regular domains, and although the best ones can cope with irregular domains, they mostly rely on graph networks, so that real industrial applications remain currently elusive. We present a deep learning framework for 3D flow field prediction applied to blades of aircraft engine turbines and compressors. Crucially, we view any 3D field as a function from coordinates that is modeled by a neural network we call the backbone-net. It inherits the property of coordinate-based MLPs, namely the discretization-agnostic representation of flow fields in domains of arbitrary topology at infinite resolution. First, we demonstrate the performance of the backbone-net solo in regressing 3D steady simulations of single blade rows in various flow regimes: it can accurately render important flow characteristics such as boundary layers, wakes and shock waves. Second, we introduce a hyper-net that maps the surface mesh of a blade to the parameters of the backbone-net. By doing so, the flow solution can be directly predicted from the blade geometry, irrespective of its parameterization. Together, backbone-net and hyper-net form a highly-accurate memory-efficient data-driven proxy to CFD solvers with good generalization on unseen geometries.</description>

      <title>Automatic Feature Recognition and Dimensional Attributes Extraction From CAD Models for Hybrid Additive-Subtractive Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Computer-Aided Design (CAD), Computer-Aided Process Planning (CAPP), and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) plays a crucial role in modern manufacturing, facilitating seamless transitions from digital designs to physical products. However, a significant challenge within this integration is the Automatic Feature Recognition (AFR) of CAD models, especially in the context of hybrid manufacturing that combines subtractive and additive manufacturing processes. Traditional AFR methods, focused mainly on the identification of subtractive (machined) features including holes, fillets, chamfers, pockets, and slots, fail to recognize features pertinent to additive manufacturing. Furthermore, the traditional methods fall short in accurately extracting geometric dimensions and orientations, which are also key factors for effective manufacturing process planning. This paper presents a novel approach for creating a synthetic CAD dataset that encompasses features relevant to both additive and subtractive machining through Python Open Cascade. The Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Neural Network (HGCNN) model is implemented to accurately identify the composite additive-subtractive features within the synthetic CAD dataset. The key novelty and contribution of the proposed methodology lie in its ability to recognize a wide range of manufacturing features, and precisely extracting their dimensions, orientations, and stock sizes. The proposed model demonstrates remarkable feature recognition accuracy exceeding 97% and a dimension extraction accuracy of 100% for identified features. Therefore, the proposed methodology enhances the integration of CAD, CAPP, and CAM within hybrid manufacturing by providing precise feature recognition and dimension extraction. It facilitates improved manufacturing process planning, by enabling more informed decision-making.</description>

      <title>Online Vehicle Routing with Pickups and Deliveries under Time-Dependent Travel-Time Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Vehicle Routing Problem with pickups, deliveries and spatiotemporal service constraints ($VRPPDSTC$) is a quite challenging algorithmic problem that can be dealt with in either an offline or an online fashion. In this work, we focus on a generalization, called $VRPPDSTCtd$, in which the travel-time metric is \emph{time-dependent}: the traversal-time per road segment (represented as a directed arc) is determined by some function of the departure-time from its tail towards its head. Time-dependence makes things much more complicated, even for the simpler problem of computing earliest-arrival-time paths which is a crucial subroutine to be solved (numerous times) by $VRPPDSTCtd$ schedulers.
  We propose two \emph{online} schedulers of requests to workers, one which is a time-dependent variant of the classical Plain-Insertion heuristic, and an extension of it trying to digest some sort of forecasts for future demands for service. We enrich these two online schedulers with two additional heuristics, one targeting for distance-balanced assignments of work loads to the workers and another that makes local-search-improvements to the produced solutions.
  We conduct a careful experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithms on a real-world instance, with or without these heuristics, and compare their quality with human-curated assignments provided by professional experts (human operators at actual pickup-and-delivery control centers), and also with feasible solutions constructed from a relaxed MILP formulation of $VRPPDSTCtd$, which is also introduced in this paper.
  Our findings are quite encouraging, demonstrating that the proposed algorithms produce solutions which (i) are significant improvements over the human-curated assignments, and (ii) have overall quality pretty close to that of the (extremely time-consuming) solutions provided by an exact solver for the MILP formulation.</description>

      <title>Separable Operator Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Operator learning has become a powerful tool in machine learning for modeling complex physical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Although Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet) show promise, they require extensive data acquisition. Physics-informed DeepONets (PI-DeepONet) mitigate data scarcity but suffer from inefficient training processes. We introduce Separable Operator Networks (SepONet), a novel framework that significantly enhances the efficiency of physics-informed operator learning. SepONet uses independent trunk networks to learn basis functions separately for different coordinate axes, enabling faster and more memory-efficient training via forward-mode automatic differentiation. We provide a universal approximation theorem for SepONet proving that it generalizes to arbitrary operator learning problems, and then validate its performance through comprehensive benchmarking against PI-DeepONet. Our results demonstrate SepONet's superior performance across various nonlinear and inseparable PDEs, with SepONet's advantages increasing with problem complexity, dimension, and scale. For 1D time-dependent PDEs, SepONet achieves up to $112\times$ faster training and $82\times$ reduction in GPU memory usage compared to PI-DeepONet, while maintaining comparable accuracy. For the 2D time-dependent nonlinear diffusion equation, SepONet efficiently handles the complexity, achieving a 6.44\% mean relative $\ell_{2}$ test error, while PI-DeepONet fails due to memory constraints. This work paves the way for extreme-scale learning of continuous mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces.
