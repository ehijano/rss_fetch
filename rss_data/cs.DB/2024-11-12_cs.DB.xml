      <title>SiriusBI: Building End-to-End Business Intelligence Enhanced by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), is establishing a new paradigm for Business Intelligence (BI). Despite the emergence of pioneering work in enhancing BI systems with LLMs, we have identified the following three issues when deployed in real industrial scenarios: interaction limitations, performance bottlenecks, and functionality deficiencies.
  In this paper, we present SiriusBI, an end-to-end business intelligence system that is designed to address the three issues simultaneously. First, we propose an intelligent and application-oriented module called multi-round dialogue with querying, which aims to overcome the prevalent interaction limitations in current BI solutions. Next, to mitigate the performance bottlenecks caused by scenario migration, we introduce two SQL generation methods that strike a balance between accuracy and deployment costs. Finally, to tackle the practical challenges posed by functionality deficiencies, we develop an end-to-end workflow that covers the entire BI process, ensuring that SiriusBI delivers a robust and complete set of functionalities.
  As an independent cloud service in Tencent's data platform, SiriusBI has been applied across Tencent's finance, advertising, and cloud sectors, providing services to dozens of enterprise clients. Experiments on real-world datasets and practical applications in industrial BI scenarios demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of SiriusBI. Remarkably, SiriusBI achieves remarkable accuracy rates of 97% in SQL generation for Tencent Finance, 89% for Tencent Advertisement, and 91% for Tencent Cloud.</description>

      <title>Fast High-dimensional Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search with Efficient Index Time and Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximate K nearest neighbor (AKNN) search in high-dimensional Euclidean space is a fundamental problem with widespread applications. Vector quantization which maps vectors to discrete quantized code, can significantly reduce the space cost of AKNN search while also accelerating the AKNN search speed. The exclusive use of vector quantization without precise vectors leads to a substantial decline in search accuracy. Recent research RaBitQ addresses this issue by using geometry relation to enhance quantization accuracy and employing error bound for distance correction with precise vector. However, this method requires that the quantization bit must be equal to the vector dimension resulting in a fixed compression ratio which limits its efficiency and flexibility. In this paper, we propose a new and efficient method MRQ to address this drawback. MRQ leverage leverages data distribution to achieve better distance correction and a higher vector compression ratio. MRQ reduces the query latency based on a highly efficient distance computation and correction scheme. Our results demonstrate that MRQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art AKNN search methods based on graph or vector quantization, achieving up to a 3x efficiency speed-up with only 1/3 length of quantized code while maintaining the same accuracy.</description>

      <title>Towards Establishing Guaranteed Error for Learned Database Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning models have demonstrated substantial performance enhancements over non-learned alternatives in various fundamental data management operations, including indexing (locating items in an array), cardinality estimation (estimating the number of matching records in a database), and range-sum estimation (estimating aggregate attribute values for query-matched records). However, real-world systems frequently favor less efficient non-learned methods due to their ability to offer (worst-case) error guarantees - an aspect where learned approaches often fall short. The primary objective of these guarantees is to ensure system reliability, ensuring that the chosen approach consistently delivers the desired level of accuracy across all databases. In this paper, we embark on the first theoretical study of such guarantees for learned methods, presenting the necessary conditions for such guarantees to hold when using machine learning to perform indexing, cardinality estimation and range-sum estimation. Specifically, we present the first known lower bounds on the model size required to achieve the desired accuracy for these three key database operations. Our results bound the required model size for given average and worst-case errors in performing database operations, serving as the first theoretical guidelines governing how model size must change based on data size to be able to guarantee an accuracy level. More broadly, our established guarantees pave the way for the broader adoption and integration of learned models into real-world systems.</description>

      <title>LSMGraph: A High-Performance Dynamic Graph Storage System with Multi-Level CSR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing volume of graph data may exhaust the main memory. It is crucial to design a disk-based graph storage system to ingest updates and analyze graphs efficiently. However, existing dynamic graph storage systems suffer from read or write amplification and face the challenge of optimizing both read and write performance simultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose LSMGraph, a novel dynamic graph storage system that combines the write-friendly LSM-tree and the read-friendly CSR. It leverages the multi-level structure of LSM-trees to optimize write performance while utilizing the compact CSR structures embedded in the LSM-trees to boost read performance. LSMGraph uses a new memory structure, MemGraph, to efficiently cache graph updates and uses a multi-level index to speed up reads within the multi-level structure. Furthermore, LSMGraph incorporates a vertex-grained version control mechanism to mitigate the impact of LSM-tree compaction on read performance and ensure the correctness of concurrent read and write operations. Our evaluation shows that LSMGraph significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (graph) storage systems on both graph update and graph analytical workloads.</description>

      <title>Pushing the Limit: Verified Performance-Optimal Causally-Consistent Database Transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern web services crucially rely on high-performance distributed databases, where concurrent transactions are isolated from each other using concurrency control protocols. Relaxed isolation levels, which permit more complex concurrent behaviors than strong levels like serializability, are used in practice for higher performance and availability.
  In this paper, we present Eiger-PORT+, a concurrency control protocol that achieves a strong form of causal consistency, called TCCv (Transactional Causal Consistency with convergence). We show that Eiger-PORT+ also provides performance-optimal read transactions in the presence of transactional writes, thus refuting an open conjecture that this is impossible for TCCv. We also deductively verify that Eiger-PORT+ satisfies this isolation level by refining an abstract model of transactions. This yields the first deductive verification of a complex concurrency control protocol. Furthermore, we conduct a performance evaluation showing Eiger-PORT+'s superior performance over the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Analysis of Learned Database Operations under Distribution Shift through Distribution Learnability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Use of machine learning to perform database operations, such as indexing, cardinality estimation, and sorting, is shown to provide substantial performance benefits. However, when datasets change and data distribution shifts, empirical results also show performance degradation for learned models, possibly to worse than non-learned alternatives. This, together with a lack of theoretical understanding of learned methods undermines their practical applicability, since there are no guarantees on how well the models will perform after deployment. In this paper, we present the first known theoretical characterization of the performance of learned models in dynamic datasets, for the aforementioned operations. Our results show novel theoretical characteristics achievable by learned models and provide bounds on the performance of the models that characterize their advantages over non-learned methods, showing why and when learned models can outperform the alternatives. Our analysis develops the distribution learnability framework and novel theoretical tools which build the foundation for the analysis of learned database operations in the future.</description>

      <title>Structuring the Processing Frameworks for Data Stream Evaluation and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The following work addresses the problem of frameworks for data stream processing that can be used to evaluate the solutions in an environment that resembles real-world applications. The definition of structured frameworks stems from a need to reliably evaluate the data stream classification methods, considering the constraints of delayed and limited label access. The current experimental evaluation often boundlessly exploits the assumption of their complete and immediate access to monitor the recognition quality and to adapt the methods to the changing concepts. The problem is leveraged by reviewing currently described methods and techniques for data stream processing and verifying their outcomes in simulated environment. The effect of the work is a proposed taxonomy of data stream processing frameworks, showing the linkage between drift detection and classification methods considering a natural phenomenon of label delay.</description>

      <title>xNVMe: Unleashing Storage Hardware-Software Co-design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NVMe SSD hardware has witnessed widespread deployment as commodity and enterprise hardware due to its high performance and rich feature set. Despite the open specifications of various NVMe protocols by the NVMe Express group and NVMe being of software abstractions to program the underlying hardware. The myriad storage I/O paths such as POSIX storage API, ad-hoc OS mechanisms, and userspace I/O libraries have different syntax and semantics that complicate software development and stand in the way of mass adoption and evolution of the NVMe ecosystem. To unify the diverse I/O storage paths, we built xNVMe that exposes a single message-passing API to support both asynchronous and synchronous communication with NVMe devices. xNVMe provides various command sets to support diverse storage I/O paths in different OS (e.g., Linux, FreeBSD, Windows, and MacOS) and userspace libraries (e.g., SPDK) with minimal overhead. xNVMe is an Open Source project and has gained traction amongst various industry stakeholders. In this paper, we elaborate on the lessons that we have learned in the project during its evolution. We also provide some ongoing and future work planned for the project. We hope the database and storage systems community can join in the effort to both extend xNVMe and leverage it as a building block for innovative co-design of storage systems on modern NVMe hardware.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Conditional Tabular GAN for Multi-Tabular Synthetic Data Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of synthetic data is a state-of-the-art approach to leverage when access to real data is limited or privacy regulations limit the usability of sensitive data. A fair amount of research has been conducted on synthetic data generation for single-tabular datasets, but only a limited amount of research has been conducted on multi-tabular datasets with complex table relationships. In this paper we propose the algorithm HCTGAN to synthesize multi-tabular data from complex multi-tabular datasets. We compare our results to the probabilistic model HMA1. Our findings show that our proposed algorithm can more efficiently sample large amounts of synthetic data for deep and complex multi-tabular datasets, whilst achieving adequate data quality and always guaranteeing referential integrity. We conclude that the HCTGAN algorithm is suitable for generating large amounts of synthetic data efficiently for deep multi-tabular datasets with complex relationships. We additionally suggest that the HMA1 model should be used on smaller datasets when emphasis is on data quality.</description>

      <title>Ultraverse: A System-Centric Framework for Efficient What-If Analysis for Database-Intensive Web Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05327v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing what-if analysis systems are predominantly tailored to operate on either only the application layer or only the database layer of software. This isolated approach limits their effectiveness in scenarios where intensive interaction between applications and database systems occurs. To address this gap, we introduce Ultraverse, a what-if analysis framework that seamlessly integrates both application and database layers. Ultraverse employs dynamic symbolic execution to effectively translate application code into compact SQL procedure representations, thereby synchronizing application semantics at both SQL and application levels during what-if replays. A novel aspect of Ultraverse is its use of advanced query dependency analysis, which serves two key purposes: (1) it eliminates the need to replay irrelevant transactions that do not influence the outcome, and (2) it facilitates parallel replay of mutually independent transactions, significantly enhancing the analysis efficiency. Ultraverse is applicable to existing unmodified database systems and legacy application codes. Our extensive evaluations of the framework have demonstrated remarkable improvements in what-if analysis speed, achieving performance gains ranging from 7.7x to 291x across diverse benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Joinable Search over Multi-source Spatial Datasets: Overlap, Coverage, and Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for joinable data is pivotal for numerous applications, such as data integration, data augmentation, and data analysis. Although there have been many successful joinable search studies for table discovery, the study of finding joinable spatial datasets for a given query from multiple spatial data sources has not been well considered. This paper studies two cases of joinable search problems from multiple spatial data sources. In addition to the overlap joinable search problem (OJSP), we also propose a novel coverage joinable search problem (CJSP) that has not been considered before, motivated by many real world applications in the field of spatial search. To support two cases of joinable search over multiple spatial data sources seamlessly, we propose a multi-source spatial dataset search framework. Firstly, we design a DIstributed Tree-based Spatial index structure called DITS, which is used not only to design acceleration strategies to speed up joinable searches, but also to support efficient communication between multiple data sources. Additionally, we prove that the CJSP is NP-hard and design a greedy approximate algorithm to solve the problem. We evaluate the efficiency of our search framework on five real-world data sources, and the experimental results show that our framework can significantly reduce running time and communication costs compared with baselines.</description>

      <title>GastCoCo: Graph Storage and Coroutine-Based Prefetch Co-Design for Dynamic Graph Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14396v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An efficient data structure is fundamental to meeting the growing demands in dynamic graph processing. However, the dual requirements for graph computation efficiency (with contiguous structures) and graph update efficiency (with linked list-like structures) present a conflict in the design principles of graph structures. After experimental studies of existing state-of-the-art dynamic graph structures, we observe that the overhead of cache misses accounts for a major portion of the graph computation time. This paper presents GastCoCo, a system with graph storage and coroutine-based prefetch co-design. By employing software prefetching via stackless coroutines and introducing a prefetch-friendly data structure CBList, GastCoCo significantly alleviates the performance degradation caused by cache misses. Our results show that GastCoCo outperforms state-of-the-art graph storage systems by 1.3x - 180x in graph updates and 1.4x - 41.1x in graph computation.</description>

      <title>QDA-SQL: Questions Enhanced Dialogue Augmentation for Multi-Turn Text-to-SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for specific domain tasks has achieved great success in Text-to-SQL tasks. However, these fine-tuned models often face challenges with multi-turn Text-to-SQL tasks caused by ambiguous or unanswerable questions. It is desired to enhance LLMs to handle multiple types of questions in multi-turn Text-to-SQL tasks. To address this, we propose a novel data augmentation method, called QDA-SQL, which generates multiple types of multi-turn Q\&amp;A pairs using LLMs. In QDA-SQL, we introduce a method incorporating validation and correction mechanisms to handle complex multi-turn Text-to-SQL tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that QDA-SQL enables fine-tuned models to exhibit higher performance on SQL statement accuracy and enhances their ability to handle complex, unanswerable questions in multi-turn Text-to-SQL tasks. The generation script and test set are released at https://github.com/mcxiaoxiao/QDA-SQL</description>
