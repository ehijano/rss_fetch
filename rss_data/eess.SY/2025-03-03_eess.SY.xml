      <title>Cooperative Multi-Agent Assignment over Stochastic Graphs via Constrained Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning offers the framework to design scalable and almost surely feasible solutions for teams of agents operating in dynamic environments to carry out conflicting tasks. We address the challenges of multi-agent coordination through an unconventional formulation in which the dual variables are not driven to convergence but are free to cycle, enabling agents to adapt their policies dynamically based on real-time constraint satisfaction levels. The coordination relies on a light single-bit communication protocol over a network with stochastic connectivity. Using this gossiped information, agents update local estimates of the dual variables. Furthermore, we modify the local dual dynamics by introducing a contraction factor, which lets us use finite communication buffers and keep the estimation error bounded. Under this model, we provide theoretical guarantees of almost sure feasibility and corroborate them with numerical experiments in which a team of robots successfully patrols multiple regions, communicating under a time-varying ad-hoc network.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Convex Relaxation to Identify the Feasibility of Conducting AC False Data Injection Attack in Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FDI (False Data Injection) attacks are critical to address as they can compromise the integrity and reliability of data in cyber-physical systems, leading to potentially severe consequences in sectors such as power systems. The feasibility of FDI attacks has been extensively studied from various perspectives, including access to measurements and sensors, knowledge of the system, and design considerations using residual-based detection methods. Most research has focused on DC-based FDI attacks; however, designing AC FDI attacks involves solving a nonlinear optimization problem, presenting additional challenges in assessing their feasibility. Specifically, it is often unclear whether the infeasibility of some designed AC FDI attacks is due to the nonconvexity and nonlinearity inherent to AC power flows or if it stems from inherent infeasibility in specific cases, with local solvers returning infeasibility. This paper addresses this issue by leveraging the principle that if a convexified AC FDI attack design problem is infeasible, the attack design itself is infeasible, irrespective of nonlinear solution challenges. We propose an AC FDI attack design based on convexified power flow equations and assess the feasibility of the proposed attack by examining the extent of the attackable region. This approach utilizes a Quadratic Convex (QC) relaxation technique to convexify AC power flows. To evaluate the proposed method, we implement it on the IEEE 118-bus test system and assess the feasibility of an AC FDI attack across various attack zones.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Recursive Least Squares Estimation for ARX Systems with Multi-Participants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a differentially private recursive least squares algorithm to estimate the parameter of autoregressive systems with exogenous inputs and multi-participants (MP-ARX systems) and protect each participant's sensitive information from potential attackers. We first give a rigorous differential privacy analysis of the algorithm, and establish the quantitative relationship between the added noises and the privacy-preserving level when the system is asymptotically stable. The asymptotic stability of the system is necessary for ensuring the differential privacy of the algorithm. We then give an estimation error analysis of the algorithm under the general and possible weakest excitation condition without requiring the boundedness, independence and stationarity on the regression vectors. Particularly, when there is no regression term in the system output and the differential privacy only on the system output is considered, $\varepsilon$-differential privacy and almost sure convergence of the algorithm can be established simultaneously. To minimize the estimation error of the algorithm with $\varepsilon$-differential privacy, the existence of the noise intensity is proved. Finally, two examples are given to show the efficiency of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient Safe Control of Linear Systems under Severe Sensor Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber-physical systems are prone to sensor attacks that can compromise safety. A common approach to synthesizing controllers robust to sensor attacks is secure state reconstruction (SSR) -- but this is computationally expensive, hindering real-time control. In this paper, we take a safety-critical perspective on mitigating severe sensor attacks, leading to a computationally efficient solution. Namely, we design feedback controllers that ensure system safety by directly computing control actions from past input-output data. Instead of fully solving the SSR problem, we use conservative bounds on a control barrier function (CBF) condition, which we obtain by extending the recent eigendecomposition-based SSR approach to severe sensor attack settings. Additionally, we present an extended approach that solves a smaller-scale subproblem of the SSR problem, taking on some computational burden to mitigate the conservatism in the main approach. Numerical comparisons confirm that the traditional SSR approaches suffer from combinatorial issues, while our approach achieves safety guarantees with greater computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Geometric Reachability for Attitude Control Systems via Contraction Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a geometric framework for the reachability analysis of attitude control systems. We model the attitude dynamics on the product manifold $\mathrm{SO}(3) \times \mathbb{R}^3$ and introduce a novel parametrized family of Riemannian metrics on this space. Using contraction theory on manifolds, we establish reliable upper bounds on the Riemannian distance between nearby trajectories of the attitude control systems. By combining these trajectory bounds with numerical simulations, we provide a simulation-based algorithm to over-approximate the reachable sets of attitude systems. We show that the search for optimal metrics for distance bounds can be efficiently performed using semidefinite programming. Additionally, we introduce a practical and effective representation of these over-approximations on manifolds, enabling their integration with existing Euclidean tools and software. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of joint input design and parameter estimation for identifying nonlinear system models through the sequential acquisition of measurements while adhering to system constraints. We utilize a receding horizon approach and propose a new scale-invariant input design criterion, which is tailored to continuously updated parameter estimates, along with a new sequential parameter estimator. We demonstrate the ability of the method to design informative experiments online, while steering the system within operational constraints.</description>

      <title>Optimality and Suboptimality of MPPI Control in Stochastic and Deterministic Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model predictive path integral (MPPI) control has recently received a lot of attention, especially in the robotics and reinforcement learning communities. This letter aims to make the MPPI control framework more accessible to the optimal control community. We present three classes of optimal control problems and their solutions by MPPI. Further, we investigate the suboptimality of MPPI to general deterministic nonlinear discrete-time systems. Here, suboptimality is defined as the deviation between the control provided by MPPI and the optimal solution to the deterministic optimal control problem. Our findings are that in a smooth and unconstrained setting, the growth of suboptimality in the control input trajectory is second-order with the scaling of uncertainty. The results indicate that the suboptimality of the MPPI solution can be modulated by appropriately tuning the hyperparameters. We illustrate our findings using numerical examples.</description>

      <title>A Demo of Radar Sensing Aided Rotatable Antenna for Wireless Communication System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotatable antenna (RA) represents a novel antenna architecture that enhances wireless communication system performance by independently or collectively adjusting each antenna's boresight/orientation. In this demonstration, we develop a prototype of radar sensing-aided rotatable antenna that integrates radar sensing with dynamic antenna orientation to enhance wireless communication performance while maintaining low hardware costs. The proposed prototype consists of a transmitter (TX) module and a receiver (RX) module, both of which employ universal software radio peripherals (USRPs) for transmitting and receiving signals. Specifically, the TX utilizes a laser radar to detect the RX's location and conveys the angle of arrival (AoA) information to its antenna servo, which enables the RA to align its boresight direction with the identified RX. Experimental results examine the effectiveness of the proposed prototype and indicate that the RA significantly outperforms the traditional fixed-antenna system in terms of increasing received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).</description>

      <title>Lifted Frequency-Domain Identification of Closed-Loop Multirate Systems: Applied to Dual-Stage Actuator Hard Disk Drives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency-domain representations are crucial for the design and performance evaluation of controllers in multirate systems, specifically to address intersample performance. The aim of this paper is to develop an effective frequency-domain system identification technique for closed-loop multirate systems using solely slow-rate output measurements. By indirect identification of multivariable time-invariant representations through lifting, in combination with local modeling techniques, the multirate system is effectively identified. The developed method is capable of accurate identification of closed-loop multirate systems within a single identification experiment, using fast-rate excitation and inputs, and slow-rate outputs. Finally, the developed framework is validated using a benchmark problem consisting of a multivariable dual-stage actuator from a hard disk drive, demonstrating its applicability and accuracy.</description>

      <title>System Identification Beyond the Nyquist Frequency: A Kernel-Regularized Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models that contain intersample behavior are important for control design of systems with slow-rate outputs. The aim of this paper is to develop a system identification technique for fast-rate models of systems where only slow-rate output measurements are available, e.g., vision-in-the-loop systems. In this paper, the intersample response is estimated by identifying fast-rate models through least-squares criteria, and the limitations of these models are determined. In addition, a method is developed that surpasses these limitations and is capable of estimating unique fast-rate models of arbitrary order by regularizing the least-squares estimate. The developed method utilizes fast-rate inputs and slow-rate outputs and identifies fast-rate models accurately in a single identification experiment. Finally, both simulation and experimental validation on a prototype wafer stage demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding a positive state-space realization with the minimum dimension for a given transfer function is an open problem in control theory. In this paper, we focus on positive realizations in Markov form and propose a linear programming approach that computes them with a minimum dimension. Such minimum dimension of positive Markov realizations is an upper bound of the minimal positive realization dimension. However, we show that these two dimensions are equal for certain systems.</description>

Abstract: The increasing demands for high accuracy in mechatronic systems necessitate the incorporation of parameter variations in feedforward control. The aim of this paper is to develop a data-driven approach for direct learning of parameter-varying feedforward control to increase tracking performance. The developed approach is based on kernel-regularized function estimation in conjunction with iterative learning to directly learn parameter-varying feedforward control from data. This approach enables high tracking performance for feedforward control of linear parameter-varying dynamics, providing flexibility to varying reference tasks. The developed framework is validated on a benchmark industrial experimental setup featuring a belt-driven carriage.</description>

      <title>A general partitioning strategy for non-centralized control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partitioning is a fundamental challenge for non-centralized control of large-scale systems, such as hierarchical, decentralized, distributed, and coalitional strategies. The problem consists of finding a decomposition of a network of dynamical systems into system units for which local controllers can be designed. Unfortunately, despite its critical role, a generalized approach to partitioning applicable to every system is still missing from the literature. This paper introduces a novel partitioning framework that integrates an algorithmic selection of fundamental system units (FSUs), considered indivisible entities, with an aggregative procedure, either algorithmic or optimization-based, to select composite system units (CSUs) made of several FSUs. A key contribution is the introduction of a global network metric, the partition index, which quantitatively balances intra- and inter-CSU interactions, with a granularity parameter accounting for the size of CSUs, allowing for their selection at different levels of aggregation. The proposed method is validated through case studies in distributed model predictive control (DMPC) for linear and hybrid systems, showing significant reductions in computation time and cost while maintaining or improving control performance w.r.t. conventional strategies.</description>

      <title>Unmasking Stealthy Attacks on Nonlinear DAE Models of Power Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart grids are inherently susceptible to various types of malicious cyberattacks that have all been documented in the recent literature. Traditional cybersecurity research on power systems often utilizes simplified models that fail to capture the interactions between dynamic and steady-state behaviors, potentially underestimating the impact of cyber threats. This paper presents the first attempt to design and assess stealthy false data injection attacks (FDIAs) against nonlinear differential algebraic equation (NDAE) models of power networks. NDAE models, favored in industry for their ability to accurately capture both dynamic and steady-state behaviors, provide a more accurate representation of power system behavior by coupling dynamic and algebraic states. We propose novel FDIA strategies that simultaneously evade both dynamic and static intrusion detection systems while respecting the algebraic power flow and operational constraints inherent in NDAE models. We demonstrate how the coupling between dynamic and algebraic states in NDAE models significantly restricts the attacker's ability to manipulate state estimates while maintaining stealthiness. This highlights the importance of using more comprehensive power system models in cybersecurity analysis and reveals potential vulnerabilities that may be overlooked in simplified representations. The proposed attack strategies are validated through simulations on the IEEE 39-bus system.</description>

      <title>State-Dependent Conformal Perception Bounds for Neuro-Symbolic Verification of Autonomous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It remains a challenge to provide safety guarantees for autonomous systems with neural perception and control. A typical approach obtains symbolic bounds on perception error (e.g., using conformal prediction) and performs verification under these bounds. However, these bounds can lead to drastic conservatism in the resulting end-to-end safety guarantee. This paper proposes an approach to synthesize symbolic perception error bounds that serve as an optimal interface between perception performance and control verification. The key idea is to consider our error bounds to be heteroskedastic with respect to the system's state -- not time like in previous approaches. These bounds can be obtained with two gradient-free optimization algorithms. We demonstrate that our bounds lead to tighter safety guarantees than the state-of-the-art in a case study on a mountain car.</description>

      <title>APIKS: A Modular ROS2 Framework for Rapid Prototyping and Validation of Automated Driving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated driving technologies promise substantial improvements in transportation safety, efficiency, and accessibility. However, ensuring the reliability and safety of Autonomous Vehicles in complex, real-world environments remains a significant challenge, particularly during the early stages of software development. Existing software development environments and simulation platforms often either focus narrowly on specific functions or are too complex, hindering the rapid prototyping of small proofs of concept. To address this challenge, we have developed the APIKS automotive platform, a modular framework based on ROS2. APIKS is designed for the efficient testing and validation of autonomous vehicle software within software-defined vehicles. It offers a simplified, standards-based architecture designed specifically for small-scale proofs of concept. This enables rapid prototyping without the overhead associated with comprehensive platforms. We demonstrate the capabilities of APIKS through an exemplary use case involving a Construction Zone Assist system, illustrating its effectiveness in facilitating the development and testing of autonomous vehicle functionalities.</description>

      <title>Toward Fully Autonomous Flexible Chunk-Based Aerial Additive Manufacturing: Insights from Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel autonomous chunk-based aerial additive manufacturing framework is presented, supported with experimental demonstration advancing aerial 3D printing. An optimization-based decomposition algorithm transforms structures into sub-components, or chunks, treated as individual tasks coordinated via a dependency graph, ensuring sequential assignment to UAVs considering inter-dependencies and printability constraints for seamless execution. A specially designed hexacopter equipped with a pressurized canister for lightweight expandable foam extrusion is utilized to deposit the material in a controlled manner. To further enhance precise execution of the printing, an offset-free Model Predictive Control mechanism is considered compensating reactively for disturbances and ground effect during execution. Additionally, an interlocking mechanism is introduced in the chunking process to enhance structural cohesion and improve layer adhesion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in constructing precise structures of various shapes while seamlessly adapting to practical challenges, proving its potential for a transformative leap in aerial robotic capability for autonomous construction.</description>

      <title>Close-Proximity Satellite Operations through Deep Reinforcement Learning and Terrestrial Testing Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasingly congested and contested space environment, safe and effective satellite operation has become increasingly challenging. As a result, there is growing interest in autonomous satellite capabilities, with common machine learning techniques gaining attention for their potential to address complex decision-making in the space domain. However, the "black-box" nature of many of these methods results in difficulty understanding the model's input/output relationship and more specifically its sensitivity to environmental disturbances, sensor noise, and control intervention. This paper explores the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for satellite control in multi-agent inspection tasks. The Local Intelligent Network of Collaborative Satellites (LINCS) Lab is used to test the performance of these control algorithms across different environments, from simulations to real-world quadrotor UAV hardware, with a particular focus on understanding their behavior and potential degradation in performance when deployed beyond the training environment.</description>

      <title>Delayed-Decision Motion Planning in the Presence of Multiple Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable automated driving technology is challenged by various sources of uncertainties, in particular, behavioral uncertainties of traffic agents. It is common for traffic agents to have intentions that are unknown to others, leaving an automated driving car to reason over multiple possible behaviors. This paper formalizes a behavior planning scheme in the presence of multiple possible futures with corresponding probabilities. We present a maximum entropy formulation and show how, under certain assumptions, this allows delayed decision-making to improve safety. The general formulation is then turned into a model predictive control formulation, which is solved as a quadratic program or a set of quadratic programs. We discuss implementation details for improving computation and verify operation in simulation and on a mobile robot.</description>

      <title>AARC: Automated Affinity-aware Resource Configuration for Serverless Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Serverless computing is increasingly adopted for its ability to manage complex, event-driven workloads without the need for infrastructure provisioning. However, traditional resource allocation in serverless platforms couples CPU and memory, which may not be optimal for all functions. Existing decoupling approaches, while offering some flexibility, are not designed to handle the vast configuration space and complexity of serverless workflows. In this paper, we propose AARC, an innovative, automated framework that decouples CPU and memory resources to provide more flexible and efficient provisioning for serverless workloads. AARC is composed of two key components: Graph-Centric Scheduler, which identifies critical paths in workflows, and Priority Configurator, which applies priority scheduling techniques to optimize resource allocation. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that AARC achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with total search time reductions of 85.8% and 89.6%, and cost savings of 49.6% and 61.7%, respectively, while maintaining SLO compliance.</description>

      <title>Reproducible Optical Tracking Precision: Evaluating a Static, Near-Parallel Support Structure for OptiTrack PrimeX22 Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and evaluation of a physical support structure for the OptiTrack X22 tracking systems, constructed from carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) and Invar steel. These materials were chosen for their low thermal expansion, ensuring geometric stability and rigidity necessary for accurate spatial measurements. The support system is scalable and adaptable for various applications and setups. The study further investigates the effects of camera placement and separation in near-parallel configurations on measurement accuracy and precision. Experimental results show a significant correlation between camera distance and measurement precision - closer camera setups yield higher precision. The optimized camera arrangement allowed the prototype to achieve accuracies of +/-0.74 mm along the camera's line of sight and +/-0.12 mm in orthogonal directions. The experiments show that the standard deviation of the noise on a single measurement plane orthogonal to the camera's line of sight vary between 0.02 and 0.07, indicating that the measurement noise is not constant for every point on that specific plane in the meanurement space. Details of the system's design and validation are provided to enhance reproducibility and encourage further development in areas like industrial automation and medical device tracking. By delivering a modular solution with validated accuracy, this work aims to promote innovation and practical application in precision tracking technology, facilitating broader adoption and iterative improvements. This approach enhances the accessibility and versatility of high-precision tracking technology, supporting future progress in the field.</description>

      <title>CurviTrack: Curvilinear Trajectory Tracking for High-speed Chase of a USV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous robot teams used in marine environments incur time-and-energy penalties when the marine vehicle has to halt the mission to allow the autonomous aerial vehicle to land for recharging. In this paper, we present a solution for this problem using a novel drag-aware model formulation which is coupled with MPC, and therefore, enables tracking and landing during high-speed curvilinear trajectories of an USV without any communication. Compared to the state-of-the-art, our approach yields 40% decrease in prediction errors, and provides a 3-fold increase in certainty of predictions. Consequently, this leads to a 30% improvement in tracking performance and 40% higher success in landing on a moving USV even during aggressive turns that are unfeasible for conventional marine missions. We test our approach in two different real-world scenarios with marine vessels of two different sizes and further solidify our results through statistical analysis in simulation to demonstrate the robustness of our method.</description>

      <title>Exergetic Port-Hamiltonian Systems Modeling Language</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mathematical modeling of real-world physical systems requires the consistent combination of a multitude of physical laws and phenomenological models. This challenging task can be greatly simplified by hierarchically decomposing systems into ultimately simple components. Moreover, the use of diagrams for expressing the decomposition helps make the process more intuitive and facilitates communication, even with non-experts. As an important requirement, models have to respect fundamental physical laws such as the first and the second law of thermodynamics. While some existing modeling frameworks make such guarantees based on structural properties of their models, they lack a formal graphical syntax. We present a compositional and thermodynamically consistent modeling language with a graphical syntax. In terms of its semantics, we essentially endow port-Hamiltonian systems with additional structural properties and a fixed physical interpretation, ensuring thermodynamic consistency in a manner closely related to the metriplectic or GENERIC formalism. While port-Hamiltonian systems are inspired by graphical modeling with bond graphs, neither the link between the two, nor bond graphs themselves, can be easily formalized. In contrast, our syntax is based on a refinement of the well-studied operad of undirected wiring diagrams. By combining a compositional, graphical syntax with an energy-based, thermodynamic approach, the presented modeling language simplifies the understanding, reuse, and modification of complex physical models.</description>

      <title>Discrete-time Indirect Adaptive Control for Systems with Disturbances via Directional Forgetting: Concurrent Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, adaptive control systems with relaxed persistent excitation (PE) conditions have been proposed to guarantee true parameter convergence and improve the transient response. However, in some cases, sufficient control performance and parameter convergence cannot be easily achieved, with stability demonstrated only under ideal conditions, such as the absence of disturbances and matching conditions required. In this study, we propose a novel adaptive control method for discrete-time systems with disturbances, which is not under an ideal case, that combines directional forgetting and concurrent learning. The proposed method does not require the PE condition, information on disturbances, unknown parameters, or matching conditions, and it guarantees uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). It was also theoretically demonstrated that the ultimate bound can be designed based on the forgetting factor, which is a design parameter. In addition, the upper bound decreases with time step, which is independent of the system order and/or target trajectory due to forgetting factor. This also implies stronger stability than a normal UUB. Numerical simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Duality of Stochastic Observability and Constructability and Links to Fisher Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19975v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a set of measurements, observability characterizes the distinguishability of a system's initial state, whereas constructability focuses on the final state in a trajectory. In the presence of process and/or measurement noise, the Fisher information matrices with respect to the initial and final states$\unicode{x2013}$equivalent to the stochastic observability and constructability Gramians$\unicode{x2013}$bound the performance of corresponding estimators through the Cram\'er-Rao inequality. This letter establishes a connection between stochastic observability and constructability of discrete-time linear systems and provides a more numerically robust way for calculating the stochastic observability Gramian. We define a dual system and show that the dual system's stochastic constructability is equivalent to the original system's stochastic observability, and vice versa. This duality enables the interchange of theorems and tools for observability and constructability. For example, we use this result to translate an existing recursive formula for the stochastic constructability Gramian into a formula for recursively calculating the stochastic observability Gramian for both time-varying and time-invariant systems, where this sequence converges for the latter. Finally, we illustrate the robustness of our formula compared to existing (non-recursive) formulas through a numerical example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20275v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alternative Current Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) is essential for efficient power system planning and real-time operation but remains an NP-hard and non-convex optimization problem with significant computational challenges. This paper proposes a novel hybrid classical-quantum deep learning framework for AC-OPF problem, integrating parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) for feature extraction with classical deep learning for data encoding and decoding. The proposed framework integrates two types of residual connection structures to mitigate the ``barren plateau" problem in quantum circuits, enhancing training stability and convergence. Furthermore, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) module is incorporated to guarantee tolerable constraint violation, improving the physical consistency and reliability of AC-OPF solutions. Experimental evaluations on multiple IEEE test systems demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior accuracy, generalization, and robustness to quantum noise while requiring minimal quantum resources.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Techniques for Optimal Control of Reconfigurable Battery Systems: System Modeling and Feasible Search Space Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable battery systems (RBSs) are emerging as a promising solution to improving fault tolerance, charge and thermal balance, energy delivery, etc. To optimize these performance metrics of RBSs, high-dimensional nonlinear integer programming problems need to be formulated and solved. To accomplish this, it is necessary to address several critical challenges stemming from nonlinear battery characteristics, discrete switch states, dynamic system configurations, as well as the curse of dimensionality inherent in large-scale RBSs. Thus, we propose a unified modeling framework to accommodate various possible configurations of an RBS and even to cover different RBS designs and their hybrid combinations, enabling the problem formulation for the RBS optimal control and facilitating the RBS topology design.Further, to solve the formulated RBS optimal control problems, the search space is narrowed to encompass only the feasible solutions, thereby ensuring safe battery connections while substantially curtailing search efforts. These proposed techniques, focusing on unifying the system modeling and narrowing the search space, lay a solid foundation for effectively formulating and efficiently solving RBS optimal control problems. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed techniques are demonstrated by both simulation and experimental tests.</description>

      <title>Distributed Prescribed-Time Observer for Nonlinear Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a distributed prescribed-time observer for nonlinear systems representable in a block-triangular observable canonical form. Using a weighted average of neighbor estimates exchanged over a strongly connected digraph, each observer estimates the system state despite limited local sensor measurements. The proposed design guarantees that distributed state estimation errors converge to zero at a user-specified convergence time, irrespective of observers' initial conditions. To achieve this prescribed-time convergence, distributed observers implement time-varying local output injection gains that asymptotically approach infinity as the prescribed time is approached. The theoretical convergence is rigorously proven and validated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.13479v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A faster response with commendable accuracy in intelligent systems is essential for the reliability and smooth operations of industrial machines. Two main challenges affect the design of such intelligent systems: (i) the selection of a suitable model and (ii) domain adaptation if there is a continuous change in operating conditions. Therefore, we propose an evolutionary Net2Net transformation (EvoN2N) that finds the best suitable DNN architecture with limited availability of labeled data samples. Net2Net transformation-based quick learning algorithm has been used in the evolutionary framework of Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II to obtain the best DNN architecture. Net2Net transformation-based quick learning algorithm uses the concept of knowledge transfer from one generation to the next for faster fitness evaluation. The proposed framework can obtain the best model for intelligent fault diagnosis without a long and time-consuming search process. The proposed framework has been validated on the Case Western Reserve University dataset, the Paderborn University dataset, and the gearbox fault detection dataset under different operating conditions. The best models obtained are capable of demonstrating an excellent diagnostic performance and classification accuracy of almost up to 100% for most of the operating conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15557v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel non-parametric learning paradigm for the identification of drift and diffusion coefficients of multi-dimensional non-linear stochastic differential equations, which relies upon discrete-time observations of the state. The key idea essentially consists of fitting a RKHS-based approximation of the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation to such observations, yielding theoretical estimates of non-asymptotic learning rates which, unlike previous works, become increasingly tighter when the regularity of the unknown drift and diffusion coefficients becomes higher. Our method being kernel-based, offline pre-processing may be profitably leveraged to enable efficient numerical implementation, offering excellent balance between precision and computational complexity.</description>

      <title>KEEC: Koopman Embedded Equivariant Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01544v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An efficient way to control systems with unknown nonlinear dynamics is to find an appropriate embedding or representation for simplified approximation (e.g. linearization), which facilitates system identification and control synthesis. Nevertheless, there has been a lack of embedding methods that can guarantee (i) embedding the dynamical system comprehensively, including the vector fields (ODE form) of the dynamics, and (ii) preserving the consistency of control effect between the original and latent space. To address these challenges, we propose Koopman Embedded Equivariant Control (KEEC) to learn an embedding of the states and vector fields such that a Koopman operator is approximated as the latent dynamics. Due to the Koopman operator's linearity, learning the latent vector fields of the dynamics becomes simply solving linear equations. Thus in KEEC, the analytical form of the greedy control policy, which is dependent on the learned differential information of the dynamics and value function, is also simplified. Meanwhile, KEEC preserves the effectiveness of the control policy in the latent space by preserving the metric in two spaces. Our algorithm achieves superior performances in the experiments conducted on various control domains, including the image-based Pendulum, Lorenz-63 and the wave equation.

      <title>Discrete Shortest Paths in Optimal Power Flow Feasible Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal power flow (OPF) is a critical optimization problem for power systems to operate at points where cost or other operational objectives are optimized. Due to the non-convexity of the set of feasible OPF operating points, it is non-trivial to transition the power system from its current operating point to the optimal one without violating constraints. On top of that, practical considerations dictate that the transition should be achieved using a small number of small-magnitude control actions. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an algorithm for computing a transition path by framing it as a shortest path problem. This problem is formulated in terms of a discretized piece-wise linear path, where the number of pieces is fixed a priori in order to limit the number of control actions. This formulation yields a nonlinear optimization problem (NLP) with a sparse block tridiagonal structure, which we leverage by utilizing a specialized interior point method. An initial feasible path for our method is generated by solving a sequence of relaxations which are then tightened in a homotopy-like procedure. Numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Uncertainty for Safe Social Navigation using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots are increasingly used in pedestrian-rich environments where safe navigation and appropriate human interaction are crucial. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) enables socially integrated robot behavior, challenges persist in novel or perturbed scenarios to indicate when and why the policy is uncertain. Unknown uncertainty in decision-making can lead to collisions or human discomfort and is one reason why safe and risk-aware navigation is still an open problem. This work introduces a novel approach that integrates aleatoric, epistemic, and predictive uncertainty estimation into a DRL navigation framework for policy distribution uncertainty estimates. We, therefore, incorporate Observation-Dependent Variance (ODV) and dropout into the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. For different types of perturbations, we compare the ability of deep ensembles and Monte-Carlo dropout (MC-dropout) to estimate the uncertainties of the policy. In uncertain decision-making situations, we propose to change the robot's social behavior to conservative collision avoidance. The results show improved training performance with ODV and dropout in PPO and reveal that the training scenario has an impact on the generalization. In addition, MC-dropout is more sensitive to perturbations and correlates the uncertainty type to the perturbation better. With the safe action selection, the robot can navigate in perturbed environments with fewer collisions.</description>

      <title>CAT-ORA: Collision-Aware Time-Optimal Formation Reshaping for Efficient Robot Coordination in 3D Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an algorithm designed to address the problem of time-optimal formation reshaping in three-dimensional environments while preventing collisions between agents. The utility of the proposed approach is particularly evident in mobile robotics, where agents benefit from being organized and navigated in formation for a variety of real-world applications requiring frequent alterations in formation shape for efficient navigation or task completion. Given the constrained operational time inherent to battery-powered mobile robots, the time needed to complete the formation reshaping process is crucial for their efficient operation, especially in case of multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The proposed Collision-Aware Time-Optimal formation Reshaping Algorithm (CAT-ORA) builds upon the Hungarian algorithm for the solution of the robot-to-goal assignment implementing the inter-agent collision avoidance through direct constraints on mutually exclusive robot-goal pairs combined with a trajectory generation approach minimizing the duration of the reshaping process. Theoretical validations confirm the optimality of CAT-ORA, with its efficacy further showcased through simulations, and a real-world outdoor experiment involving 19 UAVs. Thorough numerical analysis shows the potential of CAT-ORA to decrease the time required to perform complex formation reshaping tasks by up to 49%, and 12% on average compared to commonly used methods in randomly generated scenarios.</description>
