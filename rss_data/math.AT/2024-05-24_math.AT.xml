      <title>On Topological Complexity of $(r,\rho(R))$-mild spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first prove the existence of relative free models of morphisms (resp. relative commutative models) in the category of $DGA(R)$ (resp. $CDGA(R)$), where $R$ is a principal ideal domain containing $\frac{1}{2}$. Next, we restrict to the category of $(r,\rho(R))$-H-mild algebras and we introduce, following Carrasquel's characterization, $secat(-, R)$, the sectional category for surjective morphisms. We then apply this to the $n$-fold product of the commutative model of an $(r,\rho(R))$-mild CW-complex of finite type to introduce $TC_n(X,R)$, $mTC_n(X,R)$ and $HTC_n(X,R)$ which extend well known rational topological complexities. We do the same for $\operatorname{sc(-, \mathbb{Q})}$ to introduce analogous algebraic $\operatorname{sc(-,R)}$ in terms of their commutative models over $R$ and prove that it is an upper bound for $secat(-, R)$. This also yields, for any $(r,\rho(R))$-mild CW-complex, the algebraic $tc_n(X,R)$, $mtc_n(X,R)$ and $Htc_n(X,R)$ whose relation to the homology nilpotency is investigated. In the last section, in the same spirit, we introduce in $DGA(R)$, $secat(-, R)$, $\operatorname{sc(-,R)}$ and their topological correspondents. We then prove, in particular, that $ATC_n(X,R)\leq TC_n(X,R)$ and $Atc_n(X,R)\leq tc_n(X,R)$.</description>

      <title>Minimal Finite Model of Wedge Sum of Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \cite{Barmak(2007),Barmak(2011)}, Barmak extensively investigates the minimal finite models of the n-dimensional sphere $S^n$ for all $n\geq 0$ and establishes the minimal finite model of the wedge sum of unit circles $\bigvee\limits_{i= 1}^{n} S^{1}$. In this work, we demonstrate that the minimal finite model of the M$\ddot{\rm{o}}$bius band coincides with the minimal finite model of the unit circle $S^1$. Furthermore, we establish that the minimal finite models of the spaces $S^{2}\vee S^{1}$, $S^{2}\vee S^{2}$ consist of only seven points, while the minimal finite models of the spaces $S^{1}\vee S^{1}\vee S^{2}$ and $S^{2}\vee S^{2}\vee S^{1}$ contain eight points. Additionally, we thoroughly discuss all the necessary homotopy groups and homology groups of the aforementioned spaces to provide a comprehensive and self-contained presentation in the paper.</description>

      <title>Generalized topological complexity and its monoidal version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category, researcher T. Srinivasan demonstrated that when the space under consideration is an absolute neighborhood retract, its category can be realized through arbitrary subsets, not necessarily open ones. The primary aim of this survey is to illustrate how this result has been extended to the case of topological complexity and its monoidal version, along with some of its most significant implications.</description>

      <title>Graphcode: Learning from multiparameter persistent homology using graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce graphcodes, a novel multi-scale summary of the topological properties of a dataset that is based on the well-established theory of persistent homology. Graphcodes handle datasets that are filtered along two real-valued scale parameters. Such multi-parameter topological summaries are usually based on complicated theoretical foundations and difficult to compute; in contrast, graphcodes yield an informative and interpretable summary and can be computed as efficient as one-parameter summaries. Moreover, a graphcode is simply an embedded graph and can therefore be readily integrated in machine learning pipelines using graph neural networks. We describe such a pipeline and demonstrate that graphcodes achieve better classification accuracy than state-of-the-art approaches on various datasets.</description>

      <title>New Aspects of Analyzing Amyloid Fibrils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a summary of mathematical tools we used in research of analyzing the structure of proteins with amyloid form \cite{xi2024Top}. We defined several geometry indicators on the discrete curve namely the hop distance, the discrete curvature and the discrete torsion. Then, we used these indicators to analyze the structure of amyloid fibrils by regarding its peptide chains as discrete curves in $\Rds^3$. We gave examples to show that these indicators give novel insights in the characterization analysis of the structure of amyloid fibrils, for example the discrete torsion can detect the hydrogen bonds interactions between layers of amyloid fibril. {Moreover,} the topological tool performs better than the root mean square deviation (RMSD) in quantifying the difference of the structure of amyloid fibrils, etc.</description>

      <title>Representation stability in the intrinsic hyperplane arrangements associated to irreducible representations of the symmetric-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some of the most classically relevant Hyperplane arrangements are the Braid Arrangements $B_n$ and their associated compliment spaces $\mathcal{F}_n$. In their recent work, Tsilevich, Vershik, and Yuzvinsky construct what they refer to as the intrinsic hyperplane arrangement within any irreducible representation of the symmetric group that generalize the classical braid arrangements. Through examples it is also shown that the associated compliment spaces to these intrinsic arrangements display behaviors far removed from $\mathcal{F}_n$. In this work we study the intrinsic hyperplane arrangements of irreducible representations of the symmetric group from the perspective of representation stability.</description>

      <title>Attending to Topological Spaces: The Cellular Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological Deep Learning seeks to enhance the predictive performance of neural network models by harnessing topological structures in input data. Topological neural networks operate on spaces such as cell complexes and hypergraphs, that can be seen as generalizations of graphs. In this work, we introduce the Cellular Transformer (CT), a novel architecture that generalizes graph-based transformers to cell complexes. First, we propose a new formulation of the usual self- and cross-attention mechanisms, tailored to leverage incidence relations in cell complexes, e.g., edge-face and node-edge relations. Additionally, we propose a set of topological positional encodings specifically designed for cell complexes. By transforming three graph datasets into cell complex datasets, our experiments reveal that CT not only achieves state-of-the-art performance, but it does so without the need for more complex enhancements such as virtual nodes, in-domain structural encodings, or graph rewiring.</description>

      <title>Foams with flat connections and algebraic K-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a connection between algebraic K-theory and foam cobordisms, where foams are stratified manifolds with singularities of a prescribed form. We consider $n$-dimensional foams equipped with a flat bundle of finitely-generated projective $R$-modules over each facet of the foam, together with gluing conditions along the subfoam of singular points. In a suitable sense which will become clear, a vertex (or the smallest stratum) of an $n$-dimensional foam replaces an $(n+1)$-simplex with a total ordering of vertices. We show that the first K-theory group of a ring $R$ can be identified with the cobordism group of decorated 1-foams embedded in the plane. A similar relation between the $n$-th algebraic K-theory group of a ring $R$ and the cobordism group of decorated $n$-foams embedded in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is expected for $n&gt;1$. An analogous correspondence is proposed for arbitrary exact categories. Modifying the embedding and other conditions on the foams may lead to new flavors of K-theory groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we combine Sweedler's classic theory of measuring coalgebras -- by which $k$-algebras are enriched in $k$-coalgebras for $k$ a field -- with the theory of W-types -- by which the categorical semantics of inductive data types in functional programming languages are understood. In our main theorem, we find that under some hypotheses, algebras of an endofunctor are enriched in coalgebras of the same endofunctor, and we find polynomial endofunctors provide many interesting examples of this phenomenon. We then generalize the notion of initial algebra of an endofunctor using this enrichment, thus generalizing the notion of W-type. This article is an extended version of arXiv:2303.16793, it adds expository introductions to the original theories of measuring coalgebras and W-types along with some improvements to the main theory and many explicitly worked examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a categorification of Robertson's conjecture analogous to the categorical graph minor conjecture of Miyata--Proudfood--Ramos. We show that these conjectures imply the existence of a finite list of atomic graphs generating the homology of configuration spaces of graphs -- in fixed degree, with a fixed number of particles, under topological embeddings. We explain how the simplest case of our conjecture follows from work of Barter and Miyata--Proudfoot, implying that the category of cographs is Noetherian, a result of potential independent interest.</description>

      <title>Computing 1-Periodic Persistent Homology with Finite Windows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a periodic cell complex endowed with a covering $q:K\to G$ where $G$ is a finite quotient space of equivalence classes under translations acting on $K$. We assume $G$ is embedded in a space whose homotopy type is a $d$-torus for some $d$, which introduces "toroidal cycles" in $G$ which do not lift to cycles in $K$ by $q$ . We study the behaviour of toroidal and non-toroidal cycles for the case $K$ is 1-periodic, i.e. $G=K/\mathbb{Z}$ for some free action of $\mathbb{Z}$ on $K$. We show that toroidal cycles can be entirely classified by endomorphisms on the homology of unit cells of $K$, and moreover that toroidal cycles have a sense of unimodality when studying the persistent homology of $G$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intending to introduce a method for the topological analysis of fields, we present a pipeline that takes as an input a weighted and based chain complex, produces a factored chain complex, and encodes it as a barcode of tagged intervals (briefly, a tagged barcode). We show how to apply this pipeline to the weighted and based chain complex of a gradient-like Morse-Smale vector field on a compact Riemannian manifold in both the smooth and discrete settings. Interestingly for computations, it turns out that there is an isometry between factored chain complexes endowed with the interleaving distance and their tagged barcodes endowed with the bottleneck distance. Concerning stability, we show that the map taking a generic enough gradient-like vector field to its barcode of tagged intervals is continuous. Finally, we prove that the tagged barcode of any such vector field can be approximated by the tagged barcode of a combinatorial version of it with arbitrary precision.</description>

Abstract: This paper builds a novel bridge between algebraic coding theory and mathematical knot theory, with applications in both directions. We give methods to construct error-correcting codes starting from the colorings of a knot, describing through a series of results how the properties of the knot translate into code parameters. We show that knots can be used to obtain error-correcting codes with prescribed parameters and an efficient decoding algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a product of unitary groups and let $(M,\omega)$ be a compact symplectic manifold with Hamiltonian $G$-action. We prove an equivariant formality result for any complex-oriented cohomology theory $\mathbb{E}^*$ (in particular, integral cohomology). This generalizes the celebrated result of Atiyah-Bott-Kirwan for rational cohomology from the 1980s. The proof does not use classical ideas but instead relies on a recent cohomological splitting result of Abouzaid-McLean-Smith for Hamiltonian fibrations over $\mathbb{CP}^1.$ Moreover, we establish analogues of the "localization" and "injectivity to fixed points" theorems for certain cohomology theories studied by Hopkins-Kuhn-Ravenel. As an application of these results, we establish a Goresky-Kottwitz-MacPherson theorem with Morava $K$-theory coefficients for Hamiltonian $T$-manifolds.</description>

      <title>K-theory and localizing invariants of large categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study the so-called continuous $K$-theory for a certain class of "large" stable $\infty$-categories, more precisely, for dualizable presentable categories. For compactly generated categories, the continuous $K$-theory is simply the usual (non-connective) $K$-theory of the full subcategory of compact objects. More generally, we show that any localizing invariant of small stable $\infty$-categories can be uniquely extended to a localizing invariant of dualizable categories.
  We compute the continuous $K$-theory for categories of sheaves on locally compact Hausdorff spaces. Using the special case for sheaves on the real line, we give an alternative proof of the theorem of Kasprowski and Winges \cite{KW19} on the commutation of $K$-theory with infinite products for small stable $\infty$-categories.
  We also study the general theory of dualizable categories. In particular, we give an "explicit" proof of Ramzi's theorem \cite{Ram} on the $\omega_1$-presentability of the category of dualizable categories. Among other things, we prove that dualizability is equivalent to "flatness" in the category of presentable stable categories.</description>
