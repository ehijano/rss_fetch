      <title>Introducing a Novel Systems Thinking approach inspired by STPA: Road Safety Intervention design case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to the latest provisional statistics released by the UK Department for Transport, Great Britain recorded 1,633 road deaths in 2024, representing a slight increase from 2023 and raising concerns about safety progress, which indicates that preventable fatalities remain a challenge. The deployment of advanced mobility systems, even certified and safety-assessed, is not sufficient to deliver improved safety outcomes, and existing road infrastructure is not sufficiently equipped to prevent severe collisions. Successful application of the ``Safe System'' approach demands systems thinking in an integrated and holistic manner, encompassing all aspects of road safety. This paper argues that road safety must be managed as a complex socio-technical system where risk evolves dynamically and must be continuously monitored. To address these safety gaps, we propose a systems thinking approach that identifies factors contributing to fatal outcomes and mitigates them. The framework consists of four steps: 1) List stakeholders who influence road safety, 2) Model the interactions between these stakeholders, 3) List assumptions that might be identified as factors for fatalities, and 4) Monitor these assumptions throughout the system lifecycle. The approach is applied to the United Kingdom (UK) road network to demonstrate feasibility. The study provides actionable guidance and new KPIs categories for stakeholders to implement road safety monitoring and eliminate any unreasonable road safety risks.</description>

      <title>Cooperative stabilization of persistent currents in superfluid ring networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15121v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperative effects in oscillator networks are often associated with enhanced stability of phase-locked solutions, which increases with system size. We show that the stabilization of persistent currents in annular atomic superfluids with periodic barriers is a concrete manifestation of this phenomenon. Under the simplifying assumption of continuity of atomic flow across identical barriers, the system reduces to a ring of locally coupled Kuramoto-like oscillators. We analytically derive the stability diagram of phase-locked configurations and quantify their robustness to noise and small random initial imperfections, finding excellent agreement with experimental observations. These results are inherent to the ring topology and independent of the specific physical platform.</description>

      <title>Crossing the Functional Desert: Critical Cascades and a Feasibility Transition for the Emergence of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of life poses a problem of combinatorial feasibility: How can temporally supported functional organization arise in exponentially branching assembly spaces when unguided exploration behaves as a memoryless random walk? We show that nonlinear threshold-cascade dynamics in connected interaction networks provide a minimal, substrate-agnostic mechanism that can soften this obstruction. Below a critical connectivity threshold, cascades die out locally and structured input-output response mappings remain sparse and transient--a "functional desert" in which accumulation is dynamically unsupported. Near the critical percolation threshold, system-spanning cascades emerge, enabling discriminative functional responses that recur over finite coherence timescales. We illustrate this transition using a minimal toy model and generalize the argument to arbitrary networked systems. Also near criticality, cascades introduce finite-timescale structural and functional coherence, directional bias, and weak dynamical path-dependence into otherwise memoryless exploration, allowing biased accumulation over short coherence timescales. This connectivity-driven transition--functional percolation--requires only generic ingredients: interacting units, nonlinear thresholds, influence transmission, and non-zero coherence times. The mechanism does not explain specific biochemical pathways, but it identifies a necessary dynamical regime in which structured functional organization can emerge and be temporarily supported over finite coherence intervals, providing a physical foundation for how combinatorial feasibility barriers can be crossed through network dynamics alone.</description>
