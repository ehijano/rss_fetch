      <title>PLUMED Tutorials: a collaborative, community-driven learning ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In computational physics, chemistry, and biology, the implementation of new techniques in a shared and open source software lowers barriers to entry and promotes rapid scientific progress. However, effectively training new software users presents several challenges. Common methods like direct knowledge transfer and in-person workshops are limited in reach and comprehensiveness. Furthermore, while the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the benefits of online training, traditional online tutorials can quickly become outdated and may not cover all the software's functionalities. To address these issues, here we introduce ``PLUMED Tutorials'', a collaborative model for developing, sharing, and updating online tutorials. This initiative utilizes repository management and continuous integration to ensure compatibility with software updates. Moreover, the tutorials are interconnected to form a structured learning path and are enriched with automatic annotations to provide broader context. This paper illustrates the development, features, and advantages of PLUMED Tutorials, aiming to foster an open community for creating and sharing educational resources.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Hidden Variables: A Physics Classroom Activity on Correlation and Causation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main goals of physics education is to develop in students the ability to think critically about data and scientific models. This skill is key in everyday life, as it allows one to interpret data accurately, evaluate whether conclusions are based on evidence, and distinguish between meaningful patterns and random occurrences. Although "correlation does not imply causation" it is common to make mistakes when interpreting relationships between variables, either due to bias or the human tendency to seek causal explanations. The history of science is filled with examples where causality was incorrectly inferred from correlation. In today's society, with the rise of fake news, misinterpretation, and data manipulation, educating students about scientific reasoning is more important than ever. In this paper, we present an activity aimed at high school physics students as part of an introductory module on scientific work. The learning objectives of this activity are to adequately plot a set of data, to extract relevant information from these data, and to clearly distinguish between correlation and causation. A brief overview of some types of correlation that do not imply causation follows, followed by a description of the activity, the results obtained, and finally the conclusions.</description>
