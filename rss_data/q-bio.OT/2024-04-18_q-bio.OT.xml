      <title>Guidelines for releasing a variant effect predictor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational methods for assessing the likely impacts of mutations, known as variant effect predictors (VEPs), are widely used in the assessment and interpretation of human genetic variation, as well as in other applications like protein engineering. Many different VEPs have been released to date, and there is tremendous variability in their underlying algorithms and outputs, and in the ways in which the methodologies and predictions are shared. This leads to considerable challenges for end users in knowing which VEPs to use and how to use them. Here, to address these issues, we provide guidelines and recommendations for the release of novel VEPs. Emphasising open-source availability, transparent methodologies, clear variant effect score interpretations, standardised scales, accessible predictions, and rigorous training data disclosure, we aim to improve the usability and interpretability of VEPs, and promote their integration into analysis and evaluation pipelines. We also provide a large, categorised list of currently available VEPs, aiming to facilitate the discovery and encourage the usage of novel methods within the scientific community.</description>

      <title>Six decades of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model: A guide through its spatio-temporal dynamics and influence across disciplines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The FitzHugh-Nagumo equation, originally conceived in neuroscience during the 1960s, became a key model providing a simplified view of excitable neuron cell behavior. Its applicability, however, extends beyond neuroscience into fields like cardiac physiology, cell division, population dynamics, electronics, and other natural phenomena. In this review spanning six decades of research, we discuss the diverse spatio-temporal dynamical behaviors described by the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation. These include dynamics like bistability, oscillations, and excitability, but it also addresses more complex phenomena such as traveling waves and extended patterns in coupled systems. The review serves as a guide for modelers aiming to utilize the strengths of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model to capture generic dynamical behavior. It not only catalogs known dynamical states and bifurcations, but also extends previous studies by providing stability and bifurcation analyses for coupled spatial systems.</description>
