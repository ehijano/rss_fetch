      <title>Uncovering large inconsistencies between machine learning derived gridded settlement datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution human settlement maps provide detailed delineations of where people live and are vital for scientific and practical purposes, such as rapid disaster response, allocation of humanitarian resources, and international development. The increased availability of high-resolution satellite imagery, combined with powerful techniques from machine learning and artificial intelligence, has spurred the creation of a wealth of settlement datasets. However, the precise agreement and alignment between these datasets is not known. Here we quantify the overlap of high-resolution settlement map for 42 African countries developed by Google (Open Buildings), Meta (High Resolution Population Maps) and GRID3 (Geo-Referenced Infrastructure and Demographic Data for Development). Across all studied countries we find large disagreement between datasets on how much area is considered settled. We demonstrate that there are considerable geographic and socio-economic factors at play and build a machine learning model to predict for which areas datasets disagree. It it vital to understand the shortcomings of AI derived high-resolution settlement layers as international organizations, governments, and NGOs are already experimenting with incorporating these into programmatic work. As such, we anticipate our work to be a starting point for more critical and detailed analyses of AI derived datasets for humanitarian, planning, policy, and scientific purposes.</description>

      <title>Crowdsourcing public attitudes toward local services through the lens of Google Maps reviews: An urban density-based perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how urban density impacts public perceptions of urban service is important for informing livable, accessible, and equitable urban planning. Conventional methods such as surveys are limited by their sampling scope, time efficiency, and expense. On the other hand, crowdsourcing through online platforms presents an opportunity for decision-makers to tap into a user-generated source of information that is widely available and cost-effective. To demonstrate such potential, we collect Google Maps reviews for 23,906 points of interest (POIs) in Atlanta, Georgia. Next, we use the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model to classify reviewers' attitudes toward urban density and the Robustly Optimized BERT approach (RoBERTa) to compute sentiment. Finally, a partial least squares regression is fitted to examine the relationships between average sentiment and socio-spatial factors. The findings reveal areas in Atlanta with predominantly negative sentiments toward urban density and highlight the variation in sentiment distribution across different POIs. Further, the regression analysis reveals that minority and low-income communities often express more negative sentiments, and higher land use density exacerbates such negativity. This study introduces a novel data source and methodological framework that can be easily adapted to different regions, offering useful insights into public sentiment toward the built environment and shedding light on how planning policies can be designed to handle related challenges.</description>

      <title>Bubble reachers and uncivil discourse in polarized online public sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early optimism saw possibilities for social media to renew democratic discourse, marked by hopes for individuals from diverse backgrounds to find opportunities to learn from and interact with others different from themselves. This optimism quickly waned as social media seemed to breed ideological homophily marked by "filter bubble" or "echo chambers." A typical response to the sense of fragmentation has been to encourage exposure to more cross-partisan sources of information. But do outlets that reach across partisan lines in fact generate more civil discourse? And does the civility of discourse hosted by such outlets vary depending on the political context in which they operate? To answer these questions, we identified bubble reachers, users who distribute content that reaches other users with diverse political opinions in recent presidential elections in Brazil, where populism has deep roots in the political culture, and Canada, where the political culture is comparatively moderate. Given that background, this research studies unexplored properties of content shared by bubble reachers, specifically the quality of conversations and comments it generates. We examine how ideologically neutral bubble reachers differ from ideologically partisan accounts in the level of uncivil discourse they provoke, and explore how this varies in the context of the two countries considered. Our results suggest that while ideologically neutral bubble reachers support less uncivil discourse in Canada, the opposite relationship holds in Brazil. Even non-political content by ideologically neutral bubble reachers elicits a considerable amount of uncivil discourse in Brazil. This indicates that bubble reaching and incivility are moderated by the national political context. Our results complicate the simple hypothesis of a universal impact of neutral bubble reachers across contexts.</description>

      <title>Demystify Adult Learning: A Social Network and Large Language Model Assisted Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adult learning is increasingly recognized as a crucial way for personal development and societal progress. It however is challenging, and adult learners face unique challenges such as balancing education with other life responsibilities. Collecting feedback from adult learners is effective in understanding their concerns and improving learning experiences, and social networks provide a rich source of real-time sentiment data from adult learners. Machine learning technologies especially large language models (LLMs) perform well in automating sentiment analysis. However, none of such models is specialized for adult learning with accurate sentiment understanding. In this paper, we present A-Learn, which enhances adult learning sentiment analysis by customizing existing general-purpose LLMs with domain-specific datasets for adult learning. We collect adult learners' comments from social networks and label the sentiment of each comment with an existing LLM to form labelled datasets tailored for adult learning. The datasets are used to customize A-Learn from several base LLMs. We conducted experimental studies and the results reveal A-Learn's competitive sentiment analysis performance, achieving up to 91.3% accuracy with 20% improvement over the base LLM. A-Learn is also employed for word cloud analysis to identify key concerns of adult learners. The research outcome of this study highlights the importance of applying machine learning with educational expertise for teaching improvement and educational innovations that benefit adult learning and adult learners.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Social Bot Detection via Structural Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on social bot detection plays a crucial role in maintaining the order and reliability of information dissemination while increasing trust in social interactions. The current mainstream social bot detection models rely on black-box neural network technology, e.g., Graph Neural Network, Transformer, etc., which lacks interpretability. In this work, we present UnDBot, a novel unsupervised, interpretable, yet effective and practical framework for detecting social bots. This framework is built upon structural information theory. We begin by designing three social relationship metrics that capture various aspects of social bot behaviors: Posting Type Distribution, Posting Influence, and Follow-to-follower Ratio. Three new relationships are utilized to construct a new, unified, and weighted social multi-relational graph, aiming to model the relevance of social user behaviors and discover long-distance correlations between users. Second, we introduce a novel method for optimizing heterogeneous structural entropy. This method involves the personalized aggregation of edge information from the social multi-relational graph to generate a two-dimensional encoding tree. The heterogeneous structural entropy facilitates decoding of the substantial structure of the social bots network and enables hierarchical clustering of social bots. Thirdly, a new community labeling method is presented to distinguish social bot communities by computing the user's stationary distribution, measuring user contributions to network structure, and counting the intensity of user aggregation within the community. Compared with ten representative social bot detection approaches, comprehensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of effectiveness and interpretability of UnDBot on four real social network datasets.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study on Enhancing Prediction in Social Network Advertisement through Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the ever-evolving landscape of social network advertising, the volume and accuracy of data play a critical role in the performance of predictive models. However, the development of robust predictive algorithms is often hampered by the limited size and potential bias present in real-world datasets. This study presents and explores a generative augmentation framework of social network advertising data. Our framework explores three generative models for data augmentation - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) - to enrich data availability and diversity in the context of social network advertising analytics effectiveness. By performing synthetic extensions of the feature space, we find that through data augmentation, the performance of various classifiers has been quantitatively improved. Furthermore, we compare the relative performance gains brought by each data augmentation technique, providing insights for practitioners to select appropriate techniques to enhance model performance. This paper contributes to the literature by showing that synthetic data augmentation alleviates the limitations imposed by small or imbalanced datasets in the field of social network advertising. At the same time, this article also provides a comparative perspective on the practicality of different data augmentation methods, thereby guiding practitioners to choose appropriate techniques to enhance model performance.</description>

      <title>A Grassroots Architecture to Supplant Global Digital Platforms by a Global Digital Democracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an architectural alternative to global digital platforms termed grassroots, designed to serve the social, economic, civic, and political needs of local digital communities, as well as their federation. Grassroots platforms may offer local communities an alternative to global digital platforms while operating solely on the smartphones of their members, forsaking any global resources other than the network itself. Such communities may form digital economies without initial capital or external credit, exercise sovereign democratic governance, and federate, ultimately resulting in the grassroots formation of a global digital democracy.</description>

      <title>FedTAD: Topology-aware Data-free Knowledge Distillation for Subgraph Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subgraph federated learning (subgraph-FL) is a new distributed paradigm that facilitates the collaborative training of graph neural networks (GNNs) by multi-client subgraphs. Unfortunately, a significant challenge of subgraph-FL arises from subgraph heterogeneity, which stems from node and topology variation, causing the impaired performance of the global GNN. Despite various studies, they have not yet thoroughly investigated the impact mechanism of subgraph heterogeneity. To this end, we decouple node and topology variation, revealing that they correspond to differences in label distribution and structure homophily. Remarkably, these variations lead to significant differences in the class-wise knowledge reliability of multiple local GNNs, misguiding the model aggregation with varying degrees. Building on this insight, we propose topology-aware data-free knowledge distillation technology (FedTAD), enhancing reliable knowledge transfer from the local model to the global model. Extensive experiments on six public datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of FedTAD over state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Filtering Based on Diffusion Models: Unveiling the Potential of High-Order Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent study has shown that diffusion models are well-suited for modeling the generative process of user-item interactions in recommender systems due to their denoising nature. However, existing diffusion model-based recommender systems do not explicitly leverage high-order connectivities that contain crucial collaborative signals for accurate recommendations. Addressing this gap, we propose CF-Diff, a new diffusion model-based collaborative filtering (CF) method, which is capable of making full use of collaborative signals along with multi-hop neighbors. Specifically, the forward-diffusion process adds random noise to user-item interactions, while the reverse-denoising process accommodates our own learning model, named cross-attention-guided multi-hop autoencoder (CAM-AE), to gradually recover the original user-item interactions. CAM-AE consists of two core modules: 1) the attention-aided AE module, responsible for precisely learning latent representations of user-item interactions while preserving the model's complexity at manageable levels, and 2) the multi-hop cross-attention module, which judiciously harnesses high-order connectivity information to capture enhanced collaborative signals. Through comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets, we demonstrate that CF-Diff is (a) Superior: outperforming benchmark recommendation methods, achieving remarkable gains up to 7.29% compared to the best competitor, (b) Theoretically-validated: reducing computations while ensuring that the embeddings generated by our model closely approximate those from the original cross-attention, and (c) Scalable: proving the computational efficiency that scales linearly with the number of users or items.</description>

      <title>Turbo-CF: Matrix Decomposition-Free Graph Filtering for Fast Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A series of graph filtering (GF)-based collaborative filtering (CF) showcases state-of-the-art performance on the recommendation accuracy by using a low-pass filter (LPF) without a training process. However, conventional GF-based CF approaches mostly perform matrix decomposition on the item-item similarity graph to realize the ideal LPF, which results in a non-trivial computational cost and thus makes them less practical in scenarios where rapid recommendations are essential. In this paper, we propose Turbo-CF, a GF-based CF method that is both training-free and matrix decomposition-free. Turbo-CF employs a polynomial graph filter to circumvent the issue of expensive matrix decompositions, enabling us to make full use of modern computer hardware components (i.e., GPU). Specifically, Turbo-CF first constructs an item-item similarity graph whose edge weights are effectively regulated. Then, our own polynomial LPFs are designed to retain only low-frequency signals without explicit matrix decompositions. We demonstrate that Turbo-CF is extremely fast yet accurate, achieving a runtime of less than 1 second on real-world benchmark datasets while achieving recommendation accuracies comparable to best competitors.</description>

      <title>AI-Generated Faces in the Real World: A Large-Scale Case Study of Twitter Profile Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI) have blurred the lines between authentic and machine-generated content, making it almost impossible for humans to distinguish between such media. One notable consequence is the use of AI-generated images for fake profiles on social media. While several types of disinformation campaigns and similar incidents have been reported in the past, a systematic analysis has been lacking. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale investigation of the prevalence of AI-generated profile pictures on Twitter. We tackle the challenges of a real-world measurement study by carefully integrating various data sources and designing a multi-stage detection pipeline. Our analysis of nearly 15 million Twitter profile pictures shows that 0.052% were artificially generated, confirming their notable presence on the platform. We comprehensively examine the characteristics of these accounts and their tweet content, and uncover patterns of coordinated inauthentic behavior. The results also reveal several motives, including spamming and political amplification campaigns. Our research reaffirms the need for effective detection and mitigation strategies to cope with the potential negative effects of generative AI in the future.</description>

      <title>Moral Sparks in Social Media Narratives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19268v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is increasing interest in building computational models of moral reasoning by people to enable effective interaction by Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents. We examine interactions on social media to understand human moral judgments in real-life ethical scenarios. Specifically, we examine posts from a popular Reddit subreddit (i.e., a subcommunity) called r/AmITheAsshole, where authors and commenters share their moral judgments on who (i.e., which participant of the described scenario) is blameworthy. To investigate the underlying reasoning influencing moral judgments, we focus on excerpts-which we term moral sparks-from original posts that some commenters include to indicate what motivates their judgments. To this end, we examine how (1) events activating social commonsense and (2) linguistic signals affect the identified moral sparks and their subsequent judgments. By examining over 24672 posts and 175988 comments, we find that event-related negative character traits (e.g., immature and rude) attract attention and stimulate blame, implying a dependent relationship between character traits and moral values. Specifically, we focus on causal graphs involving events (c-events) that activate social commonsense. We observe that c-events are perceived with varying levels of informativeness, influencing moral spark and judgment assignment in distinct ways. This observation is reinforced by examining linguistic features describing semantically similar c-events. Moreover, language influencing commenters' cognitive processes enhances the probability of an excerpt becoming a moral spark, while factual and concrete descriptions tend to inhibit this effect.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Neural Diffusion Framework on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08616v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies reveal the connection between GNNs and the diffusion process, which motivates many diffusion-based GNNs to be proposed. However, since these two mechanisms are closely related, one fundamental question naturally arises: Is there a general diffusion framework that can formally unify these GNNs? The answer to this question can not only deepen our understanding of the learning process of GNNs, but also may open a new door to design a broad new class of GNNs. In this paper, we propose a general diffusion equation framework with the fidelity term, which formally establishes the relationship between the diffusion process with more GNNs. Meanwhile, with this framework, we identify one characteristic of graph diffusion networks, i.e., the current neural diffusion process only corresponds to the first-order diffusion equation. However, by an experimental investigation, we show that the labels of high-order neighbors actually exhibit monophily property, which induces the similarity based on labels among high-order neighbors without requiring the similarity among first-order neighbors. This discovery motives to design a new high-order neighbor-aware diffusion equation, and derive a new type of graph diffusion network (HiD-Net) based on the framework. With the high-order diffusion equation, HiD-Net is more robust against attacks and works on both homophily and heterophily graphs. We not only theoretically analyze the relation between HiD-Net with high-order random walk, but also provide a theoretical convergence guarantee. Extensive experimental results well demonstrate the effectiveness of HiD-Net over state-of-the-art graph diffusion networks.</description>

      <title>The Great Ban: Efficacy and Unintended Consequences of a Massive Deplatforming Operation on Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11254v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the current landscape of online abuses and harms, effective content moderation is necessary to cultivate safe and inclusive online spaces. Yet, the effectiveness of many moderation interventions is still unclear. Here, we assess the effectiveness of The Great Ban, a massive deplatforming operation that affected nearly 2,000 communities on Reddit. By analyzing 16M comments posted by 17K users during 14 months, we provide nuanced results on the effects, both desired and otherwise, of the ban. Among our main findings is that 15.6% of the affected users left Reddit and that those who remained reduced their toxicity by 6.6% on average. The ban also caused 5% users to increase their toxicity by more than 70% of their pre-ban level. Overall, our multifaceted results provide new insights into the efficacy of deplatforming. As such, our findings can inform the development of future moderation interventions and the policing of online platforms.</description>

Abstract: Fact-checking is an effective approach to combat misinformation on social media, especially regarding significant social events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the U.S. presidential elections. In this study, we evaluated the performance of Google Fact Check, a fact-checking search engine. By analyzing the search results regarding 1,000 COVID-19-related false claims, we found Google Fact Check not likely to provide sufficient fact-checking information for most false claims, even though the results obtained are generally reliable and helpful. We also found that the corresponding false claims of different fact-checking verdicts (i.e., "False", "Partly False", "True", and "Unratable") tend to reflect diverse emotional tones, and fact-checking sources are likely to check the claims in different lengths and using dictionary words to various extents. Claims addressing the same issue yet described differently are likely to obtain disparate fact-checking results. This research aims to shed light on the best practices for performing fact-checking searches for the general public.</description>

      <title>Simulating Relational Event Histories -- Why and How</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many important social phenomena result from repeated interactions among individuals over time such as email exchanges in an organization, or face-to-face interactions in a classroom. Insights into the mechanisms underlying the dynamics of these interactions can be achieved through simulations of networks on a fine temporal granularity. In this paper, we present statistical frameworks to simulate relational event networks under dyadic and actor-oriented relational event models. These simulators have a broad applicability in temporal social network research such as model fit assessment, theory building, network intervention planning, making predictions, understanding the impact of network structures, to name a few. We show this in three extensive applications. First, it is shown why simulation-based techniques are crucial for relational event model assessment, for example to investigate how past events affect future interactions in the network. Second, we demonstrate how simulation techniques contribute to a better understanding of the longevity of network interventions. Third, we show how simulation techniques are important when building and extending theories about social phenomena such as understanding social identity dynamics using optimal distinctiveness theory.</description>

      <title>Pre-Construction of Opinion Dynamics Considering Structural Inequality: Interdisciplinary Analysis of Complex Social Stratification, Media Influence, and Functionalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study analyzes the role of meritocracy, media influence, and scheduled theory from multiple perspectives as mechanisms that maintain inequality in social classes. Social inequality exists in complex forms in the educational, media, and political spheres. The study focuses on how inequality in society is structured and reproduced and how the theory of scheduled harmony justifies this.</description>

      <title>A Simple Quantum Blockmodeling with Qubits and Permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blockmodeling of a given problem represented by an $N\times N$ adjacency matrix can be found by swapping rows and columns of the matrix (i.e. multiplying matrix from left and right by a permutation matrix). Although classical matrix permutations can be efficiently done by swapping pointers for the permuted rows (or columns) of the matrix, by changing row-column order, a permutation changes the location of the matrix elements, which determines the membership of a group in the matrix based blockmodeling. Therefore, a brute force initial estimation of a fitness value for a candidate solution involving counting the memberships of the elements may require going through all the sum of the rows (or the columns).
  Similarly permutations can be also implemented efficiently on quantum computers, e.g. a NOT gate on a qubit. In this paper, using permutation matrices and qubit measurements, we show how to solve blockmodeling on quantum computers. In the model, the measurement outcomes of a small group of qubits are mapped to indicate the fitness value. However, if the number of qubits in the considered group is much less than $n=log(N)$, it is possible to find or update the fitness value based on the state tomography in $O(poly(log(N)))$. Therefore, when the number of iterations is less than $log(N)$ time and the size of the considered qubit group is small, we show that it may be possible to reach the solution very efficiently.</description>

      <title>RELIANCE: Reliable Ensemble Learning for Information and News Credibility Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of information proliferation, discerning the credibility of news content poses an ever-growing challenge. This paper introduces RELIANCE, a pioneering ensemble learning system designed for robust information and fake news credibility evaluation. Comprising five diverse base models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), naive Bayes, logistic regression, random forest, and Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory Networks (BiLSTMs), RELIANCE employs an innovative approach to integrate their strengths, harnessing the collective intelligence of the ensemble for enhanced accuracy. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of RELIANCE over individual models, indicating its efficacy in distinguishing between credible and non-credible information sources. RELIANCE, also surpasses baseline models in information and news credibility assessment, establishing itself as an effective solution for evaluating the reliability of information sources.</description>

      <title>Using Graph Neural Networks to Predict Local Culture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17905v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urban research has long recognized that neighbourhoods are dynamic and relational. However, lack of data, methodologies, and computer processing power have hampered a formal quantitative examination of neighbourhood relational dynamics. To make progress on this issue, this study proposes a graph neural network (GNN) approach that permits combining and evaluating multiple sources of information about internal characteristics of neighbourhoods, their past characteristics, and flows of groups among them, potentially providing greater expressive power in predictive models. By exploring a public large-scale dataset from Yelp, we show the potential of our approach for considering structural connectedness in predicting neighbourhood attributes, specifically to predict local culture. Results are promising from a substantive and methodologically point of view. Substantively, we find that either local area information (e.g. area demographics) or group profiles (tastes of Yelp reviewers) give the best results in predicting local culture, and they are nearly equivalent in all studied cases. Methodologically, exploring group profiles could be a helpful alternative where finding local information for specific areas is challenging, since they can be extracted automatically from many forms of online data. Thus, our approach could empower researchers and policy-makers to use a range of data sources when other local area information is lacking.</description>

      <title>A Review of Graph Neural Networks in Epidemic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19852v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a growing interest in studying epidemiological models. Traditional mechanistic models mathematically describe the transmission mechanisms of infectious diseases. However, they often suffer from limitations of oversimplified or fixed assumptions, which could cause sub-optimal predictive power and inefficiency in capturing complex relation information. Consequently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a progressively popular tool in epidemic research. In this paper, we endeavor to furnish a comprehensive review of GNNs in epidemic tasks and highlight potential future directions. To accomplish this objective, we introduce hierarchical taxonomies for both epidemic tasks and methodologies, offering a trajectory of development within this domain. For epidemic tasks, we establish a taxonomy akin to those typically employed within the epidemic domain. For methodology, we categorize existing work into Neural Models and Hybrid Models. Following this, we perform an exhaustive and systematic examination of the methodologies, encompassing both the tasks and their technical details. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of existing methods from diverse perspectives and systematically propose future research directions. This survey aims to bridge literature gaps and promote the progression of this promising field, with a list of relevant papers at https://github.com/Emory-Melody/awesome-epidemic-modelingpapers. We hope that it will facilitate synergies between the communities of GNNs and epidemiology, and contribute to their collective progress.</description>
