      <title>Realizing string breaking dynamics in a $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory on quantum hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate static and dynamical aspects of string breaking in a $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory coupled to Kogut-Susskind staggered fermions. Using Tensor Network simulations, we demonstrate that the static potential as well as the site-resolved configuration of the matter sites and gauge links allows us to identify the regimes in which string breaking occurs. Furthermore, we develop a variational quantum eigensolver that allows for reliably preparing the ground state of the theory in both the absence and presence of static charges and to capture the static aspects of the phenomenon. Carrying out state preparation on real quantum hardware for up to 19 qubits, we demonstrate its suitability for current quantum devices. In addition, we study the real-time dynamics of a flux tube between two static charges using both Tensor Networks and quantum hardware. Using a trotterization for the time-evolution operator, we are able to show that the breaking process starts with the creation of charges inside the string. These eventually redistribute towards the static charges and screen them, which leads to the breaking of the flux tube.</description>

      <title>Generalized Parton Distributions from Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI/ML informed Symbolic Regression is the next stage of scientific modeling. We utilize a highly customizable symbolic regression package "PySR" to model the x and t dependence of the flavor isovector combination $H_{u-d}(x,t,\zeta,Q^2)$ at $\zeta=0$ and $Q^2$= 4 GeV$^2$. These PySR models were trained on GPD pseudodata provided by both Lattice QCD and phenomenological sources GGL, GK, and VGG. We demonstrate, for the first time, the consistency and systematic convergence of Symbolic Regression by quantifying the disparate models through their Taylor expansion coefficients. In addition to PySR penalizing models with higher complexity and mean-squared error, we implement schemes that test specific physics hypotheses, including FF$x$ and $t$ dependence and Regge behavior in PySR GPDs. We show that PySR can identify factorizing GPD sources based on their response to the Force-Factorized model. Knowing the precise behavior of the GPDs, and their uncertainties in in a wide range in $x$ and $t$, crucially impacts our ability to concretely and quantitatively predict hadronic spatial distributions and their derived quantities.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the electromagnetic structure and intrinsic dynamics of spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ hidden-charm pentaquarks: A comprehensive QCD analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the internal structure of hadrons remains a fundamental challenge in experimental and theoretical hadron physics. This pursuit is crucial for advancing our comprehension of QCD and for refining the models that describe the strong interaction. The discovery of exotic states, such as hidden-charm pentaquarks, has further emphasized the complexity of hadronic systems and the need to uncover the fundamental mechanisms governing their formation and behavior. Addressing these challenges not only deepens our understanding of QCD but also tests the limits of existing theoretical frameworks, paving the way for new insights into the nature of matter. Motivated by these challenges, the present study investigates the electromagnetic properties$-$ specifically, the magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole, and magnetic octupole moments$-$ of six hidden-charm pentaquark states: $[u u][d c] \bar c$, $[dd][u c] \bar c$, $[u u][s c] \bar c$, $[dd] [s c] \bar c$, $[s s][u c] \bar c$, and $[s s][d c] \bar c$. Employing the framework of QCD light-cone sum rules and utilizing two distinct diquark-diquark-antiquark interpolating currents, we focus on pentaquark configurations with spin-parity quantum numbers $\mathrm{J^P =\frac{3}{2}^-}$. From the numerical results, we observe significant deviations between the magnetic dipole moment predictions obtained using different diquark-diquark-antidiquark structures. These results suggest that multiple pentaquark states with identical quantum numbers and quark constituents may exhibit distinct magnetic dipole moments, depending on their internal quark configurations. The obtained electromagnetic moments, particularly the variations in magnetic dipole moments, may provide insights into the internal structure of hidden-charm pentaquark states.</description>

      <title>Extracting the chiral anomaly from $e^+e^-\to 3\pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strength of the interaction of three pions and a photon, $F_{3\pi}$ is predicted by the axial anomaly in terms of the pion decay constant, a relation that is frequently used to constrain low-energy radiative processes involving pions, but only tested experimentally at the $10\%$ level. Here, we present a new avenue to test this prediction, via a fit of a dispersive description of the $\gamma^*\to3\pi$ amplitude to data for $e^+e^-\to 3\pi$. From the global fit to SND, CMD-2, and BaBar data we obtain $F_{3\pi}=33.1(1.7)\,\text{GeV}^{-3}$, in agreement with the chiral prediction at the level of $5\%$. We also consider dispersive fits to the recent data by Belle II, in which case we observe tensions with the dispersive constraints, the width parameters of $\omega$ and $\phi$, and the chiral anomaly.</description>
