      <title>Nonequilibrium Phase Transitions in Large $N$ Matrix Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is believed that the theory of quantum gravity describing our universe is unitary. Nonetheless, if we only have access to a subsystem, its dynamics is described by nonequilibrium physics. Motivated by this, we investigate the planar limit of large $N$ one-matrix quantum mechanics obeying the Lindblad master equation with dissipative jump terms, focusing on the existence, uniqueness, and properties of steady states. After showing that Lindblad dissipation is absent in the gauged model at large $N$, we study nonequilibrium phase transitions in planar ungauged matrix quantum mechanics. In the first class of examples, where potentials are unbounded from below, we study nonequilibrium critical points above which strong dissipation allows for the existence of normalizable steady states that would otherwise not exist. In the second class of examples, termed matrix quantum optics, we find evidence of nonequilibrium phase transitions analogous to those recently reported in the quantum optics literature for driven-dissipative Kerr resonators. Preliminary results on two-matrix quantum mechanics are also presented. We implement bootstrap methods to obtain concrete and rigorous results for the nonequilibrium steady states of matrix quantum mechanics in the planar limit.</description>

      <title>Scalar and spinor fields in gravitating cosmic string spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the scattering behavior of scalar and spinor fields in the background of a gravitating cosmic string spacetime. The model explored here for the background vortex is non-abelian, becoming abelian in an appropriate limiting case. We adopted the formalism we developed in \cite{silva2021scattering}, modifying the standard partial wave approach. We apply the method for a scalar and also a fermion field interacting with the background spacetime with a nontrivial asymptotic structure. The spacetime metric, obtained numerically in \cite{de2015gravitating}, forms the basis of our state-of-the-art numerical study. We make an exhaustive analysis and compare all the results in the non-abelian model with the corresponding abelian one for both massless and massive fields. We analyze the field configuration's total cross-section and angular profile at small and large distances from the core. We show that the total cross-section oscillates with the incident momentum of the wave, as anticipated in \cite{silva2021scattering}, and also, the angular profile can be explained reasonably well with a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern, especially for the scalar field scattering.</description>

      <title>On invariants of two-dimensional minimally supersymmetric field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a new invariant of two-dimensional $\mathcal{N}{=}(0,1)$ supersymmetric quantum field theories (SQFTs), under a couple of assumptions on the general properties of such SQFTs motivated by considerations in heterotic string theory. This new invariant is in addition to the known 'primary' invariants, i.e. the ordinary elliptic genus and the mod-2 elliptic genus, and the known 'secondary' invariant, which can be considered as an SQFT analog of the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer $\eta$-invariant when its continuous variation vanishes.
  We also define a spectral invariant of supercharge more generally by the integration of the expectation value of the supercharge over the fundamental region of $\mathrm{ SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$. With this spectral invariant, we construct a spectral pairing which can be used to systematically detect all the known invariants, including the new one we introduce in the first half of this paper.</description>

      <title>BC-type open $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We diagonalize the $B$-element of monodromy matrix for noncompact open $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ spin chain with boundary interaction. The monodromy matrix is defined in terms of $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ $L$-operator and boundary $K$-matrix. The eigenfunctions of $B$-operator are constructed iteratively using raising $\Lambda$-operators. The key role in the calculations plays the Baxter $Q$-operator commuting with the $B$-operator. The main building blocks for $\Lambda$- and $Q$-operators are $\mathcal{K}$-operator -- the general solution of reflection equation and $\mathcal{R}$-operator -- the reduction of the general solution of the Yang-Baxter equation. Two types of the symmetry of eigenfunctions are established. The first kind is the invariance under permutations and reflections of spectral variables, or in other words, under the action of Weyl group of B and C root systems. The second kind is the symmetry with respect to transformation $(s,g) \to (1-s,1-g)$, where $s$ is the spin variable and $g$ is the parameter of $K$-matrix. We prove that obtained system of eigenfunctions is orthogonal and complete. The calculation of the scalar product of eigenfunction is given in initial coordinate representation. We derive the Mellin-Barnes integral representation for eigenfunctions and use it to prove the comleteness.</description>

      <title>Generalization of anomaly formula for time reversal symmetry in (2+1)D abelian bosonic TQFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study time-reversal symmetry in (2+1)-dimensional abelian bosonic topological phases. Z_2 x Z_2 classifies the time-reversal anomalies in such systems symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in (3+1) dimensions and can be diagnosed via partition functions on manifolds such as RP^4 and CP^2. These partition functions are related by an anomaly formula of the form Z(RP^4) * Z(CP^2) = theta_M, where theta_M is the Dehn twist phase associated with the crosscap state.
  Meanwhile, the existence of gapped boundaries is constrained by so-called higher central charges, denoted xi_n, which serve as computable invariants encoding obstruction data. Motivated by the known relation Z(CP^2) = xi_1, we propose a generalization of the anomaly formula involving both the higher central charges xi_n and a new time-reversal invariant eta_n. By introducing a distinguished subset M^n of the set A of anyons, we establish the relation
  eta_n * xi_n = (sum of theta(a)^n over a in M^n) divided by its absolute value.
  This generalizes the known anomaly formula. We analyze the algebraic structure of the subset M^n, derive consistency relations it satisfies, and clarify its connection to the original anomaly formula.</description>

      <title>Crossing symmetry including non planar diagrams in perturbative QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We venture a proof of crossing symmetry for non-planar diagrams in perturbative QFT. For the planar diagrams a proof of crossing is available in the literature and our method closely follows the one depicted in that case. We classify the non-planar diagrams broadly into two types. For one of these types the proof is pretty straightforward and hence the result extends to all point all loop on-shell amplitudes. These are called the "trivial" cases while for the other type we find certain cases called the "non trivial" cases for which the proof is much more subtle. We present an explicit example of such a "non trivial" case at 3-loop order and argue how the proof of crossing symmetry holds true when all subtleties are taken into consideration. Although a general proof for these "nontrivial cases" at higher loop is beyond the scope of this paper, we do conjecture that the proof of crossing shall hold in a similar fashion, for higher loops as well since the subtlety of the resolution in 3-loop case lies with the type of Landau singularity we need to consider and not the number of internal propagators or loop momenta.</description>

      <title>Algebra structure of conformal Killing-Yano forms in geometries with skew-symmetric torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider conformal Killing-Yano forms corresponding to the antisymmetric generalizations of conformal Killing vectors to higher degree forms in the presence of skew-symmetric torsion. Integrability conditions for torsionful conformal Killing-Yano forms are found and a graded Lie bracket for conformal Killing-Yano forms to constitute a graded Lie algebra structure is proposed. It is found that a graded Lie algebra structure for a special subset of torsionful conformal Killing-Yano forms can be constructed for a closed and parallel skew-symmetric torsion on constant curvature and Einstein manifolds. Similar structure for generalized hidden symmetries defined from generalized connection in generalized geometry is also constructed.</description>

      <title>Twisted Homotopy Algebras: Supersymmetric Twists, Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking, Anomalies and Localisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisting and classical background fields are two foundational techniques in supersymmetric quantum field theory, central to developments ranging from the Higgs mechanism to topological twisting and supersymmetric localisation. While traditionally treated as distinct procedures, they appear on an equal footing in the homotopy-algebraic approach to quantum field theory. In this work, we formalise this connection by interpreting both twisting and the introduction of classical backgrounds as instances of twisting curved quantum $L_\infty$-superalgebras. Using the language of homotopy algebras and the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism, we provide a unified algebraic framework that encompasses topological/holomorphic twists, spontaneous symmetry breaking, computation of anomalies, and supersymmetric localisation \`a la Festuccia--Seiberg. As a byproduct, we introduce a notion of twisting for quantum $L_\infty$-algebras and a homotopy-algebraic reformulation of the one-particle-irreducible effective action.</description>

      <title>Entanglement measures for causally connected subregions and holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate entanglement for causally connected subregions $A$ and $B$ in quantum field theory and holography. Recent developments have established that a transition operator $T_{AB}$ can be well-defined for such subregions, which is generally non-Hermitian. By employing the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and the real-time replica method, we show how to construct $T_{AB}$ and compute associated entanglement measures. In certain configurations, this leads to a notion of timelike entanglement entropy, for which we provide explicit quantum field theory computations and propose a holographic dual via analytic continuation from the Euclidean setup. Both analytical and numerical results are compared and found consistent.
  If entanglement between causally connected subregions is to be meaningful, it should also be able to define other entanglement measures. Motivated by the spacelike case, we propose a timelike extension of the entanglement wedge cross section, though we do not expect it to carry the same physical interpretation. In AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, we compute explicit examples and find that the timelike entanglement wedge cross section is generally positive. Furthermore, we show that the reflected entropy for timelike intervals -- obtained via analytic continuation of twist correlators -- coincides with twice the timelike entanglement wedge cross section at leading order in $G$, supporting a holographic duality in the timelike case. We also discuss the extension of other entanglement measures, such as logarithmic negativity, to timelike separated regions using replica methods. We highlight conceptual challenges in defining reflected entropy via canonical purification for non-Hermitian operators.</description>

      <title>Operator lift of Reshetikhin-Turaev formalism to Khovanov-Rozansky TQFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological quantum field theory (TQFT) is a powerful tool to describe homologies, which normally involve complexes and a variety of maps/morphisms, what makes a functional integration approach with a sum over a single kind of maps seemingly problematic. In TQFT this problem is overcame by exploiting the rich set of zero modes of BRST operators, which appear sufficient to describe complexes. We explain what this approach looks like for the important class of Khovanov-Rozansky (KR) cohomologies, which categorify the observables (Wilson lines or knot polynomials) in 3d Chern-Simons theory. We develop a construction of odd differential operators, associated with all link diagrams, including tangles with open ends. These operators become nilpotent only for diagram with no external legs, but even for open tangles one can develop a factorization formalism, which preserve Reidemeister/topological invariance -- the symmetry of the problem. This technique seems much more ``physical'' than conventional language of homological algebra and should have many applications to various problems beyond Chern-Simons theory. We also hope that this language will provide efficient algorithms, and finally allow to computerize the calculation of KR cohomologies -- for closed diagrams and for open tangles.</description>

      <title>Explorations of Universality in the Entropy and Hawking Radiation of Non-Extremal Kerr AdS$_4$ Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We comprehensively discuss various microscopic approaches to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for rotating, electrically charged, asymptotically AdS$_4$ non-extremal black holes in gauged supergravity. We apply the covariant phase space formalism to the near-horizon region to obtain a Cardy-formula-based microscopic explanation for the entropy, consistent with the Kerr/CFT correspondence. From the dual boundary CFT point of view, we estimate the free partition function in the matrix model approximation in the high-temperature regime and find qualitative agreement with the supergravity answer. All these different approaches match in the appropriate limits and support the universality of AdS black hole entropy even at high temperatures, far away from extremality. Prompted by the consistency of the results of statistical explanations for the AdS$_4$ black hole entropy, we discuss aspects of the rate of Hawking radiation at high temperatures from the CFT$_2$ perspective and found it to be universally proportional to the horizon area.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Packaging I: Irreducible Representation Blocks, Superselection, and Packaged Entanglement in Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of symmetry packaging for quantum field excitations: in a quantum field theory with a gauge group $G$, every local creation operator carries its full set of internal quantum numbers (IQNs) as a single irreducible $G$-block and forbids any partial factorization. We elevate this observation to a symmetry packaging principle, which asserts that packets of IQNs remain intact throughout all physical processes. We analyze a quantum-field excitation in six successive stages: (1) particle creation/annihilation, (2) hybridization with gauge-blind external degrees of freedom (DOFs), (3) tensor-product assembly, (4) isotypic decomposition, (5) packaged superposition/entanglement, and (6) local Gauge-Invariance constraint. We show that packaging survives every stage and culminates in a gauge-invariant physical Hilbert space. These stages unfold within a three packaging layer hierarchy (raw-Fock $\to$ isotypic $\to$ physical) with distinct packaging characters. Packaging alone reproduces familiar charge-superselection rules and, within any fixed-charge sector, admits a new class of packaged entangled states where internal and external DOFs are inseparably locked. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for such superpositions and show that packaged irreps behave as noise-protected logical qudits. This framework unifies representation theory, superselection, and entanglement under a single mathematical roof and provides a roadmap for constructing and manipulating packaged states in any gauge theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weak cosmic censorship conjecture (wCCC) might not be as robust as one would expect. We present a potential counterexample to the wCCC in a rotating three-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS$_3$) spacetime. We extend the parameter range of the quantum corrected BTZ (qBTZ) black hole. We examine the infall of test particles with large orbital angular momentum into an extremal black hole. Our findings indicate that, under certain conditions -- such as neglecting the self-force effects -- the event horizon can be destroyed, leading to a violation of the wCCC. The results suggest that this solution should either be excluded from the applicability of the wCCC or should be examined with self-force effects incorporated.</description>

      <title>Cogito, ergo - strings: Supersymmetric ergoregions and their stringy excitations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supergravity solutions describing supersymmetric rotating bound states of NS fivebranes, fundamental strings and momentum can sometimes have an ergoregion but no horizon. In such supersymmetric ergoregions, there is an unusual feature that there exist BPS "excitations" that cost negative (or zero) energy as measured from asymptotic infinity. We study the spectrum of supergravity and string excitations of these backgrounds using their worldsheet description as gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) models, and construct their holographic map to transitions in the dual spacetime CFT. The backgrounds generically contain orbifold singularities, and we exhibit vertex operators corresponding to twisted sector ground states localized at the orbifold fixed points. The gauged WZW model thus provides a valuable tool to explore the stringy structure of such heavy BPS states in $AdS_3/CFT_2$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate how the positive geometry framework for loop integrands in $\mathcal{N}{=}4$ super Yang-Mills theory constrains the structure of the integrated answers. This is done in the context of a geometric expansion of Wilson loops with a Lagrangian insertion, called negative geometries, extending ideas previously used for scattering amplitudes related to the Amplituhedron. The procedure we adopt combines the knowledge of all maximal codimension boundaries of the geometry, which characterize all possible leading singularities of the integral, with a geometrically informed Landau analysis. The interplay between geometry and Landau analysis arises from associating Landau diagrams to geometric boundaries. The boundary structure of the geometry then determines which solutions to the Landau equations are spurious and which ones are physical, that is, which singularities are actually present in the integral. This method allows us to efficiently determine the symbol alphabet of the associated integral, and serves as a starting point for the symbol bootstrap. We successfully implement this procedure and compute the six-point two-loop and five-point three-loop ladder negative geometries at the symbol level. We also present the conjectural alphabet for ladder negative geometries at two loops for all multiplicities. These are finite integrals that serve as building blocks for the Wilson loop with Lagrangian insertion, and therefore provide insights into the function space of the latter.</description>

      <title>Krylov exponents and power spectra for maximal quantum chaos: an EFT approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the effective field theory (EFT) of maximal chaos through the lens of Krylov complexity and the Universal Operator Growth Hypothesis. We test the relationship between two measures of quantum chaos: out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) and Krylov complexity. In the EFT, a shift symmetry of the hydrodynamic modes enforces the maximal Lyapunov exponent in OTOCs, $\lambda_L = 2\pi T$, while simultaneously constraining thermal two-point autocorrelators. We solve these constraints on the autocorrelator, and calculate the Lanczos coefficients and Krylov exponents for several examples, finding both $\lambda_K = \lambda_L$ and $\lambda_K = \lambda_L/2$. This demonstrates that, within the EFT, the shift symmetry alone is insufficient to enforce maximal Krylov exponents even when the Lyapunov exponent is maximal. In particular, this result suggests a tension with the conjectured bound $\lambda_L \leq \lambda_K \leq 2\pi T$. Finally, we identify autocorrelator solutions whose power spectra closely resemble the so-called thermal product formula seen in holographic systems.</description>

      <title>Gluon amplitudes in first quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute tree-level gluon amplitudes as worldline correlators of vertex operators in a bosonic spinning particle model. In this framework, the particle's position degrees of freedom are extended by complex bosonic variables that encode its spin. In the free theory, the model exhibits a first-class constraint algebra whose gauging ensures the unitarity of the quantum theory. This algebra is a contraction of the $sl(2,\mathbb{R})$ algebra, which is by itself a subalgebra of the Virasoro algebra. In string theory, gauging the Virasoro algebra plays a similar role. Our model admits a consistent truncation to describe a pure spin-1 particle. Non-abelian interactions are introduced by using BRST techniques, which allow us to extract the vertex operators of the theory as suitable deformations of the BRST charge. BRST invariance is central to ensuring the consistency of the tree-level amplitudes analyzed in this work. We discuss connections with similar worldline constructions and comment on the potential relevance of this framework for uncovering the structures underlying the double-copy program in gauge and gravitational theories.</description>

      <title>Massive Spinor Helicity Amplitudes, Cross Sections, and Coalescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine recent advancements of the spinor helicity formalism of massive particles. Technical aspects about the formulation of massive helicity spinors are presented in detail to analyze the projective-geometry kinematics of helicity spinors as well as the diagrammatical and analytical structure of their interactions. Two new methods for calculating massive cross sections are derived and tested on Bhabha and Compton processes: a quasi-high-energy limit and an assembly of partial cross sections. The acquisition of mass, where ultrarelativistic amplitudes coalesce at low energy, is given a physical interpretation as the localization of particle worldlines in twistor theory. By subsuming the spinor helicity formalism in this way, both spacetime and particle content can emerge from null, lightlike, and timelike twistors.</description>

      <title>On a 5D UV completion of Argyres-Douglas theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a novel UV completion of a class of Argyres-Douglas (AD) theories by its embedding into the renormalisation group flow from five dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theories (SCFT) on $S^1$. This is obtained via analysing these theories in the light of ($q$-)Painlev\'e/gauge theory correspondence, which allows to compute the five dimensional BPS partition functions as an expansion in the Wilson loop vev with integer $q$-polynomials coefficients. These are derived formulating the gauge theory on a blown-up geometry and using a five-dimensional lift of (topological) operator/state correspondence. We discuss in detail the phase diagram of the four dimensional limits, pinpointing the special AD loci. Explicit computations are reported for $\tilde E_1$ SCFT and its limit to H$_0=(A_1,A_2)$ AD theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-point correlation functions encode the data of infinitely many 4-point correlators in conformal field theory (CFT). In this paper, we develop new tools to efficiently extract this data from multi-point crossing equations. Concretely, we generalize the functionals constituting the so-called Polyakov bootstrap of 4-point correlators to the case of 5-point functions in one-dimensional CFTs. We first construct the crossing symmetric Polyakov blocks, and then derive sum-rules by requiring consistency with the operator product expansion (OPE). This procedure leads to two classes of functionals controlling OPE coefficients of double- and triple-twist families. After extensively checking the validity of the associated sum-rules, we apply our functionals to the truncated 5-point bootstrap where we find several advantages with respect to more standard derivative functionals.</description>

      <title>The Mass of the Baryon Junction: a lattice computation in 2 +1 dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of baryonic flux tubes in SU(3) Yang-Mills theory in (2 + 1) dimensions. A recent next-to-leading-order derivation within the Effective String theory framework has, for the first time, made explicit the correction proportional to the baryon-junction mass $M$, up to order $1/R^2$ (where $R$ id the length of thr confining string), opening the possibility of its non-perturbative determination. One of the main goals of this paper is, through high-precision simulations of the three-point Polyakov loop correlator, to measure for the first time the baryon-junction mass. By isolating the predicted $1/R^2$ term in the open strin channel, we obtain the value $M/\sqrt{\sigma}=0.1355(36)$, similar to the phenomenological value which is used to describe a hadron. In addition, studying th high temperature behaviourof the baryon, we present a new test of the Svetitsky-Yaffe conjecture for the SU(3) theory in three dimensions. Focussing on the high temperature regime just below the deconfinement transition, we compare our lattice results for Polyakov loop correlators with the quantitative prediction obtained by applying conformal perturbation theory to the three states Potts model in two dimension, and find excellent agreement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation offers a tractable description of the high-energy growth of gauge-theory scattering amplitudes and the nonlinear saturation effects that eventually tame it. Motivated by the upcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), whose extended kinematic reach promises more decisive tests of saturation at high energies, we present a framework based on the spacelike-timelike correspondence that streamlines the computation of multi-loop corrections to the BK equation. We explicitly verify the correspondence at three loops in the large-flavor limit and predict the full nonconformal component of the three-loop BK Hamiltonian in the planar limit of a generic gauge theory, treating the numbers of fermions and scalars as free parameters.</description>

      <title>Compact stars with gravitational wave echoes in $f(R,L_{m},T)$ gravitational theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the gravitational wave echoes (GWEs) from the compact stellar configurations in the backdrop of $f(R,L_{m},T)$ gravity within static and spherically symmetric framework. Our study has utilized the MIT Bag model and color-favour-locked (CFL) phase equations of state (EoS) for matter description. Mass-radius profiles were determined by solving the hydrostatic equilibrium equations. Model parameter variations were used to assess the configuration stability here. TOV solutions helped to evaluate compactness. Our results indicate that MIT bag model and CFL EoS in $f(R,L_{m},T)$ modified gravitational theory are capable of producing GWEs. The calculated wave frequencies lie within the range of $ 7.5-11 $ kHz range. We have also demonstrated that how different gravitational theory parametrization within $f(R,L_{m},T)$ theory affect our star structure and echo frequency characteristics. Surface redshift and adiabatic index analysis confirm the stability of our stellar model here.</description>

      <title>Constraining $f(Q,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ gravity with redshift-dependent pressure: Insights from observational probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the late time cosmological dynamics of the Universe within the framework of $f(Q,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ gravity by considering the specific form $f(Q, \mathcal{L}_m)=-Q+2\mathcal{L}_m+\gamma$. To describe the cosmic pressure evolution, a redshift dependent parametrization of $p(z)=\alpha+\frac{\beta z}{1+z}$ is introduced. MCMC analysis is performed using a combined datasets from Hubble ($46$ points), BAO ($15$ points including DESI DR2) and Pantheon$+$ ($1701$ SNe Ia), the model parameters are constrained as $H_{0}=67.9476^{+0.7534}_{-0.7523}$ (km/s/Mpc), $\alpha=-0.0002^{+0.0211}_{-0.0208}$, $\beta=-0.0001^{+0.0410}_{-0.0404}$ and $\gamma=0.0002^{+0.0599}_{-0.0602}$. The model predicts a transition from deceleration to acceleration at $z_{tr} \approx 0.493$ with present values $q_{0}=-0.255$ and $\omega_{0}=-0.9001$. The evolution of energy density and pressure aligns with observational expectations. An analysis of energy conditions shows that NEC and DEC are satisfied, while SEC is violated, consistent with late time acceleration. Moreover, the slow roll parameters $\epsilon_{1}$ and $\epsilon_{2}$ confirm a smooth inflationary regime. These results demonstrate the capability of the model to unify early Universe inflation with the current phase of cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Four-scalar model and spherically symmetric solution in $f({\cal T})$ theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the construction of spherically symmetric solutions within the framework of modified teleparallel gravity, focusing in particular on $f({\cal T})$ theory, where ${\cal T}$ represents the torsion scalar. Conventional mimetic gravity and its extension with two scalar fields are unable to reproduce general spherically symmetric geometries in $f({\cal T})$ gravity, since consistency requires either a constant torsion scalar or a linear form of $f({\cal T})$, which corresponds to the teleparallel equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR). To overcome this restriction, we introduce a four-scalar field formulation that generalizes the two-scalar model and enables the realization of arbitrary spherically symmetric spacetimes. We further demonstrate that the model avoids ghost degrees of freedom by imposing appropriate constraints through Lagrange multipliers. As an application of the formalism, we examine a specific spherically symmetric metric and determine the corresponding four scalar fields, analyzing their properties. In the presence of a quadratic extension of the action, ${\cal T} + \tfrac{\alpha}{2}{\cal T}^2$, our approach successfully reconstructs physically viable solutions free from ghost instabilities. These findings highlight the potential of scalar-field-based constructions for generating consistent spacetime geometries in modified gravity theories, thereby extending beyond the standard formulations.</description>

      <title>On the Kaluza-Klein geometric theory in affine spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a generalization of Kaluza-Klein theory by considering a purely affine framework, without assuming a prior metric structure. We formulate the dimensional reduction using the geometry of principal fiber bundles and the Ehresmann connection, introducing adapted bases that allow an explicit decomposition of tensors, vectors, and connections. This formalism provides a natural geometric definition of the electromagnetic field as the difference between the horizontal space and the space generated by the observer's frame. We demonstrate that the presence of a nontrivial electromagnetic field requires the non-integrability of the horizontal distribution, and we derive a complete ansatz for decomposing the affine connection into fields defined on the reduced space. Under assumptions such as vanishing torsion, autoparallel fibers, and suitable normalization conditions, we show that the reduced theory corresponds to the Einstein-Maxwell system for purely radiative electromagnetic fields. Furthermore, we propose an interpretation where the metric emerges dynamically from the affine structure through the dynamics of the electromagnetic field.</description>

      <title>A new class of rotating charged black holes with non-aligned electromagnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a large family of twisting and expanding solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations of algebraic type D, for which the two double principal null directions (PNDs) of the Weyl tensor are not aligned with the null eigendirections of the Faraday tensor. In addition to systematically deriving this new class, we present its various metric forms and convenient parameterizations. We show that in Boyer-Lindquist-type coordinates these solutions depend on 7 parameters, namely the Kerr and NUT (Newman-Unti-Tamburino) twist parameters $a$ and $l$, mass parameter $m$, acceleration $\alpha$, strength of the Maxwell field $|c|$, and angular parameters $\beta, \gamma$ that represent two duality rotations of the Faraday tensor, which include the rotation between the electric and magnetic charges generating the aligned part of the Maxwell field. This coordinate parameterization, analogous to the Griffiths-Podolsk\'y form of the Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski solutions, allows us to perform various limits, explicitly identify the subcases, and determine the physical interpretation of the new class. Interestingly, by considering the limit with no acceleration ($\alpha\to 0$), one obtains either the famous Kerr-Newman-NUT black holes (if the parameter $|c|$ remains constant) or the novel Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson black holes, announced recently in our work arXiv:2507.05199 (if $|c|\rightarrow \infty$ while $\alpha |c|=\mathrm{const.}$). We may thus conclude that this new class of spacetimes represents twisting charged accelerating black holes, immersed in an external magnetic (or electric) field. In the non-twisting subcase, we obtain the previously known solutions of Alexeev-Garcia and Van den Bergh-Carminati.</description>

      <title>Quark confinement in presence of both chromoelectric and chromomagnetic fields and the structure of spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong interaction between quarks inside hadrons in curved spacetime is investigated in the presence of a new non-abelian gauge potential based on the $SU(3)$ group. This potential presented both chromo-electric and chromo-magnetic fields, including a magnetic monopole-like term, together with a radial non-Abelian Coulomb-like component. A spacetime metric induced by the presence of a Yang-Mills field is derived by solving Einstein's equations in the specific limit where the $SU(3)$ gauge symmetry is reduced to an embedded $SU(2)$ subgroup, accompanied by a dynamical $U(1)$ monopole sector. It is explicitly shown that the Schwarzschild radius of the strong interaction between quarks within hadrons corresponds approximately to the size of these latter and that the corresponding, for both quarks and gluons, wave function presents a discontinuity at Schwarzschild surface. The obtained results allow us to interpret the confinement of quarks as a geometric property of spacetime, emerging naturally from its structure without introducing any confinement potential. Moreover, the energy spectra of quarks in presence of chromo-electric and chromo-magnetic fields reproduce the mass of hadrons with a very good accuracy compared to the experimental data, and the presence of the residual non-abelian term correction enhance our numerical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether artificial intelligence can autonomously recover known structures of the Standard Model of particle physics using only experimental data and without theoretical inputs. By applying unsupervised machine learning techniques -- including data dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms -- to intrinsic particle properties and decay modes, we uncover key organizational features of particle physics, such as the relative strength of different interactions and the difference between baryons and mesons. We also identify conserved quantities such as baryon number, strangeness and charm as well as the structure of isospin and the Eightfold Way multiplets. Our analysis then reveals that clustering can separate particles by interaction, flavor symmetries as well as quantum numbers. Additionally, we observe patterns consistent with Regge trajectories in baryon excitations. Our results demonstrate that machine learning can reproduce key aspects of the Standard Model directly from data, suggesting a promising path toward data-driven discovery in fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic modifications to the transport phenomena and observables in a hot QCD medium at finite baryon asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have studied how the transport of charge and heat as well as associated observables become influenced by a weak-momentum anisotropy arising due to the asymptotic expansion of baryon asymmetric matter in the initial stages of heavy ion collisions. This study facilitates the understanding of the local equilibrium property of the medium through the Knudsen number, and explores the correlation between the heat flow and the charge flow through the Lorenz number in the Wiedemann-Franz law for an anisotropic hot QCD medium at finite baryon asymmetry. We have determined the electrical and the thermal conductivities by solving the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation in the relaxation time approximation within the kinetic theory approach. The interactions among partons are appended through the particle distribution functions within the quasiparticle model of the hot QCD medium at finite temperature, anisotropy and baryon asymmetry. We have observed a decrease in both electrical and thermal conductivities in the presence of expansion-induced anisotropy for baryonless scenario as well as for baryon asymmetric scenario. Conversely, these conductivities are found to be larger in the baryon asymmetric matter as compared to their counterparts in the baryonless matter. The impact of anisotropy on the baryon asymmetric matter is as conspicuous as on the baryonless matter. The above results are attributed to the squeezing of the distribution function due to the momentum anisotropy generated by the asymptotic expansion of baryon asymmetric matter and the dispersion relations of partons in the presence of anisotropy. Additionally, the aforesaid observables are also modulated by the expansion-induced anisotropy in the baryon asymmetric medium, indicating new predictions for the equilibrium characteristic and the relative behavior between the heat and charge flow for the said medium.</description>

      <title>Corner functions from entanglement indices of harmonic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement indices such as logarithmic negativities (LNs) and mutual informations (MIs) between two adjacent subsets in a isolated universal set $U$ of harmonic oscillators arranged on a two dimensional lattice within a sufficiently large square. First, we verify the values of the corner functions of angle $\pi/2, \pi/4, 3\pi/4$ presented in the previous study which adopts periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) for the $U$. The values of each corner function obtained from LNs are nearly equal to those in the previous ones, while those of $3\pi/4$ from MIs are not sufficiently consistent with those computed from LNs. Next, for the case where the universal system $U$ satisfies the fixed end boundary conditions(FBCs), we calculate LNs, MIs at several locations in $U$, compare them, especially corner functions with the values obtained in the PBCs case, and examine the effect of the fixed ends. In addition, we examine Renyi entropies for sets of three dimensional lattice sites, the corner functions and the edge terms with solid angles and dihedral angles $\pi/2,\pi/4$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Type-III Seesaw in Non-Holomorphic Modular Symmetry and Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Qu and Ding, have proposed a formalism where modular invariance is extended to non-supersymmetric scenario considering Yukawa couplings as non-holomorphic functions of modules field $\tau$. Adopting this formalism in this work, we propose a Type-III seesaw model as a unified framework to explain lepton masses and mixing and baryogenesis via leptogenesis. $\chi^2$ analysis is performed to fit the neutrino oscillation data from NuFIT~6.0 leading to a normal hierarchical pattern of neutrino masses and constrained $CP$ phases. Furthermore, we analyze the generation of the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe via thermal leptogenesis where the decays of the lightest fermion triplet $\Sigma_1$ into lepton-Higgs final states produce a $CP$ asymmetry $\varepsilon_{CP}$. The complex modules $\tau$ is responsible for the $CP$ asymmetry produced during leptogenesis. The washout processes dominated by gauge scatterings and inverse decays are studied through the full set of Boltzmann equations. The resulting $B-L$ asymmetry, $Y_{B-L}\sim 10^{-9}$ successfully reproduces the baryon-to-photon ratio demonstrating the model's capability to link low-energy neutrino data with the baryogenesis. The strong gauge-mediated washout of fermion triplets necessitates a leptogenesis scale of $\mathcal{O}(10^{12}\,\mathrm{GeV})$ ensuring compatibility with both the Davidson-Ibarra bound and the thermal history of the Universe. Future pursuits remain open to the exploration of novel avenues aimed at lowering the energy scale associated with leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>The sixth order QED radiative corrections to lepton anomalies due to the fourth order vacuum polarization insertions within the Mellin-Barnes representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The explicit form of the sixth order radiative corrections to the lepton $L$ ($L=e, ~\mu $ and $\tau$) anomalous magnetic moment from QED Feynman diagrams with insertion of the fourth-order polarization operators consisting of either two closed lepton loops or one lepton loop crossed by a photon line is discussed in detail. The approach is based on the consistent application of dispersion relations for vacuum polarization operators and the Mellin-Barnes transform for massive photon propagators. Explicit analytical expressions for corrections to the lepton anomaly are obtained for the first time in the whole interval $0 &lt;r&lt; \infty $ of the ratio $r$ of lepton masses $m_\ell/m_L$. Asymptotic expansions in the limit of both small $r\ll 1$ and large $r\gg 1$ computed from the exact expressions are found to be in perfect agreement with the ones earlier reported in the literature. We argue that in the region wherethe physical lepton mass ratios are located, the asymptotic expansions hold with an accuracy higher than the experimentally measured anomalies. The two loop diagrams with all three leptons different from each other are computed numerically and compared with the corresponding corrections from the pure two-bubble and one-bubble mixed diagrams. It is shown that there are regions of ratios $r$ where all three types of the fourth order polarization operator contribute equally to the anomaly.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the $Nc^1$ scaling in the confined but chirally symmetric phase at high T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is lattice evidence that the QCD matter above the chiral restoration temperature Tch and below the deconfinement temperature Td, called stringy fluid, is characterized by an approximate chiral spin symmetry, which is a symmetry of confinement in QCD with light quarks. The energy density, pressure and entropy density in the stringy fluid scale as Nc^1, which is in contrast to the Nc^0 scaling in the hadron gas and to the Nc^2 scaling in the quark-gluon plasma. Here we clarify the origin of the Nc^1 scaling. We employ a solvable field-theoretical large $N_c$ chirally symmetric and confining model. In vacuum the confining potential induces a spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. The mesons are spatially localized states of quarks and antiquarks. Still in the confining regime the system undergoes the chiral restoration phase transition at $T_{ch}$ because of Paili blocking of the quark levels required for the existence of the quark condensate, by the thermal excitation of quarks and antiquarks. The same Paili blocking leads to a delocalization of the color singlet low-spin meson-like states that become infinitely large in the chiral limit. Consequently the stringy fluid represents a very dense medium of the overlapping huge color-singlet low-spin quark-antiquark systems. The Bethe-Salpeter equation that determines the rest-frame excitation energies of the color-singlet quark-antiquark system is Nc-independent both in vacuum and in the medium in the confining regime. The excitation energy of the quark-antiquark color-singlet systems scales as Nc^0, i.e. as meson mass in vacuum. The Nc^1 scaling of the energy density in the stringy fluid is provided by the fluctuations of the color-singlet quark-antiquark systems.</description>

      <title>Partially flavour non-universal $U(1)$ and radiative fermion masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate an extension of the Standard Model with a partially flavour non-universal abelian gauge symmetry that enables radiative mass generation for lighter fermions. With flavour-universal charges for the first two generations, gauge-induced loop corrections generate second-generation masses while keeping the first generation massless. Small first-generation masses can arise from subdominant scalar loops within this framework. A single anomaly-free $U(1)$ is sufficient for a realistic model, and the partial universality relaxes the gauge boson mass bound from several thousand TeV to about 200 TeV compared with previous frameworks of this type. We also identify an alignment limit matching the lightest scalar to the observed Higgs and compute its couplings with the fermions, which largely agree with Standard Model values but show testable deviations.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative determination of meson masses and low-energy constants in large-$N$ QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide first-principles non-perturbative determinations of the low-lying meson mass spectrum of large-$N$ QCD in the 't Hooft limit $N_{\scriptscriptstyle{\rm f}}/N\to 0$, as well as of three low-energy constants appearing in the QCD chiral expansion: the quark condensate $\Sigma$, the pion decay constant $F_\pi$, and the next-to-leading-order coupling $\bar{\ell}_4$. Using the excited state masses in the $\pi$ and $\rho$ channels, we are able to investigate the behavior of their radial Regge trajectories. Concerning QCD low-energy constants, we are able to assess the magnitude of sub-leading corrections in $1/N$ by combining our $N=\infty$ results with previous finite-$N$ determinations. Our calculation exploits large-$N$ twisted volume reduction to efficiently perform numerical Monte Carlo simulations of the large-$N$ lattice discretized theory. We employ several values of $N$ up to $N=841$, 5 values of the lattice spacing, and several values of the quark mass, to achieve controlled continuum and chiral extrapolations.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Resolved Entanglement Entropy in a Non-Abelian Fractional Quantum Hall State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy provides a powerful framework for probing the internal structure of quantum many-body states by decomposing entanglement into contributions from distinct symmetry sectors. In this work, we apply matrix product state techniques to study the bosonic, non-Abelian Moore-Read quantum Hall state, enabling precise numerical evaluation of both the full counting statistics and symmetry-resolved entanglement entropies. Our results reveal an approximate equipartition of entanglement among symmetry sectors, consistent with theoretical expectations and subject to finite-size corrections. The results also show that these expectations for symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy remain valid in the case of a non-Abelian state where the topological sectors cannot be distinguished by the Abelian $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry alone, and where neutral and charged modes possess distinct velocities. We additionally perform a detailed comparison of the entanglement spectrum with predictions from the Li-Haldane conjecture, finding remarkable agreement, and enabling a more precise understanding of the effects of the distinct neutral and charged velocities. This not only provides a stringent test of the conjecture but also highlights its explanatory power in understanding the origin and structure of finite-size effects across different symmetry sectors.</description>

      <title>Vertex corrections and wavefunction renormalization for atoms, nuclei, and other heavy composite particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study one-loop QED corrections to operator matrix elements involving heavy composite particles (e.g., heavy-mesons, nuclei, and atoms). We define a new notion of reducible and irreducible graphs which is useful for systems with many discrete excited states. The equivalence of the LSZ reduction formula and old fashioned perturbation theory is explicitly demonstrated. The self energy and vertex corrections are defined (to all orders), and the one-loop corrections are reduced to operator matrix elements which may be evaluated by hadronic, nuclear, or atomic theorists. The gauge dependence of the various pieces are studied in detail, and cancellation of spurious contributions are demonstrated in a class of covariant gauges; Coulomb gauge is also discussed. The formalism is applied to superallowed beta decay where we identify a number of effects that arise at one loop that are, to the best of our knowledge, not included in current extractions of $|V_{ud}|$. In particular we find an electromagnetic isospin breaking correction at $O(\alpha)$ in addition to the well known $O(Z^2\alpha^2)$ corrections from the intranuclear Coulomb field.</description>

      <title>Gradient and Hessian-Based Temperature Estimator in Lattice Gauge Theories: A Diagnostic Tool for Stability and Consistency in Numerical Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a field configuration-based temperature estimator in lattice gauge theories. It is constructed from the gradient and Hessian of the Euclidean action of the theory. Adapted from geometric formulations of entropy in classical statistical mechanics, this estimator provides a gauge-invariant, non-kinetic diagnostic of thermodynamic consistency in Monte Carlo simulations of lattice gauge theories. We validate the method in compact U(1) lattice gauge theories across one, two, and four dimensions, comparing the estimated temperature to the input temperature. Our results show that the estimator accurately reproduces the input temperature and remains robust across a range of lattice volumes and coupling strengths. The temperature estimator offers a general-purpose diagnostic for lattice field theory simulations, with potential applications to non-Abelian theories, anisotropic lattices, and real-time monitoring in hybrid Monte Carlo algorithms.</description>

Abstract: We study a conformal field theory that arises in the infinite-volume limit of a spin chain with $U_q(sl_2)$ global symmetry. Most operators in the theory are defect-ending operators which allows $U_q(sl_2)$ symmetry transformations to act on them in a consistent way. We use Coulomb gas techniques to construct correlation functions and compute all OPE coefficients of the model, as well as to prove that the properties imposed by the quantum group symmetry are indeed satisfied by the correlation functions. In particular, we treat the non-chiral operators present in the theory. Free boson realization elucidates the origin of the defects attached to the operators. We also comment on the role of quantum group in generalized minimal models.</description>

Abstract: Based on an important mathematical conjecture, together with hypothesis of homological mirror symmetry in the context of Landau-Ginzburg models, we show that a class of compound Du Val singularities do not admit a crepant resolution. Most of these singularities sit in the type cEn. This implies that those singularities are not dual to four dimensional N =1 superconformal quiver gauge theories through stacks of D3 branes placed at the singularities. We verify this statement on the physics side by enumerating consistent gauge theories.</description>

Abstract: Understanding which effective field theories are consistent with an ultraviolet completion in quantum gravity is an important theoretical question. Therefore, it is important to know the structure of the 4D effective theory associated with a given compactification of string theory. We present a first-principles derivation of the low-energy 4D effective theory of geometric moduli in a warped Calabi-Yau compactification of type IIB string theory with imaginary self-dual 3-form flux. This completes the derivation of the metric on K\"ahler moduli space from the 10D equations of motion. We also give the first derivation of an effective action for flat directions in the complex structure moduli space of the Calabi-Yau (which generically mix with the axiodilaton) and work out explicit examples of complex structure flat directions in toroidal compactifications. Finally, we outline applications to a variety of settings, including precision string phenomenology and the tadpole conjecture.</description>

      <title>S-duality in higher-derivative corrections of heterotic supergravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00357v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the consistency of heterotic supergravity, where the $B$-field gauge transformation becomes anomalous due to the Green-Schwarz mechanism, under T-duality transformations. We establish that preserving T-duality necessitates an infinite tower of higher-derivative couplings proportional to $e^{-2\Phi}$. For spacetimes featuring a Killing self-dual circle, these couplings remain immune to quantum corrections. Leveraging S-duality in heterotic/type I string theory, we then identify the corresponding couplings in type I theory. Notably, our analysis reveals that standard S-duality transformations do not involve higher-derivative corrections. Building on this insight, we derive the explicit form of the effective action for type I theory at the $\alpha'$ order, adhering to a scheme that omits derivatives of the dilaton.</description>

      <title>Meromorphic higher-genus integration kernels via convolution over homology cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polylogarithms on arbitrary higher-genus Riemann surfaces can be constructed from meromorphic integration kernels with at most simple poles, whose definition was given by Enriquez via functional properties. In this work, homotopy-invariant convolution integrals over homology cycles are shown to provide a direct construction of Enriquez kernels solely from holomorphic Abelian differentials and the prime form. Our new representation is used to demonstrate the closure of the space of Enriquez kernels under convolution over homology cycles and under variations of the moduli. The results of this work further strengthen the remarkable parallels of Enriquez kernels with the non-holomorphic modular tensors recently developed in an alternative construction of higher-genus polylogarithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reinvestigate the Calogero-Sutherland-type (CS-type) models and generalized hypergeometric functions. We construct the generalized CS operators for circular, Hermite, Laguerre, Jacobi and Bessel cases and establish the generalized Lassalle-Nekrasov correspondence. A family of operators are constructed based on the spherical degenerate double affine Hecke algebra. In terms of these operators, we provide concise representations and constraints for the generalized hypergeometric functions. We analyze the superintegrability for the $\beta$-deformed integrals, where the measures are associated with the corresponding ground state wave functions of Hermite, Laguerre, Jacobi and Bessel type CS models. Then based on the generalized Laplace transformation of Jack polynomials, we construct certain two integral chains and analyze the superintegrability property.</description>

      <title>ER=EPR and Strange Metals from Quantum Entanglement: Disorder theory vs quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19431v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an understanding how strange metals arise from the spatially random Yukawa-SYK model based on the wormhole picture and find a parallelism between the disorder theory and quantum gravity. We start from the observation that the Gaussian average over the spatial random coupling gives a wormhole, defined as a mechanism for long range interaction without causal suppression outside the lightcone. We find that the large-$N$ limit equivalence of the quenched and annealed averages provides a field theory version of the ER=EPR. Since the wormhole establishes momentum exchanges over arbitrary distance without causal suppression, it provides a mechanism of the planckian dissipation. It also tells us why SYK-like models describe strongly interacting systems even in the small coupling case. We classify the disorder samples into two classes: I) spatially random coupling with wormholes and no information loss, II) spatially uniform coupling with decoherence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) is known to have an underlying quantum group theoretical description. We precisely pinpoint the quantum group structure, improving upon earlier work in the literature. This allows us to utilize this framework for bulk gravitational applications. We explain bulk discretization in DSSYK from the underlying irreducibility of the representations. We derive trumpet and brane amplitudes using character insertions of the quantum group, simplifying earlier calculations. Most importantly, we factorize the bulk Hilbert space dual to DSSYK in the quantum group description using a complete set of edge degrees of freedom living at a bulk entangling surface. An analogous treatment for $\mathcal{N}=1$ DSSYK is provided in the same quantum group theoretical framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the gravitational phase space associated to a stretched horizon within a finite-sized causal diamond in $(d+2)$-dimensional spacetimes. By imposing the Raychaudhuri equation, we obtain its constrained symplectic form using the covariant phase space formalism and derive the relevant quantum commutators by inverting the symplectic form and quantizing. Finally, we compute the area fluctuations of the causal diamond by taking a Carrollian limit of the stretched horizon in pure Minkowski spacetime, and derive the relationship $\langle (\Delta A)^2 \rangle \geq \frac{2\pi G}{d}\langle A \rangle$, showing that the variance of the area fluctuations is proportional to the area itself.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We elaborate on a string world-sheet connection to flat space-time holography. More specifically, in the high energy (zero tension) limit of tree-level string scattering in flat backgrounds the underlying string world-sheets can be related to the celestial sphere, with the saddle points of the high energy string description representing points on the celestial sphere. We show that this picture continues to hold at all subleading orders in the quantum fluctuations around this classical configuration. As a consequence there is a dual description of the high energy limit of string theory as the large energy expansion on the celestial sphere organized by (light) higher spin modes. This approach points to an intrinsic construction of celestial conformal field theory (CFT) by relating it to a (free) world-sheet CFT of string theory. We also elaborate on the high energy representations of tree-level open and closed string amplitudes and work out their subleading corrections. Their number theoretic properties and relevance as amplitudes of tensionless strings are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the timelike entanglement entropy (TEE) in two dimensional conformal field theories (CFT) with gravitational anomalies. We employ analytical continuation to compute the timelike entanglement entropy for a pure timelike interval in such CFTs. We find that, unlike the real part, the imaginary part of the TEE displays an asymmetric dependence on the central charges of the left and right moving modes. We propose that the asymmetric dependence on central charges of the imaginary part of the TEE can be used to probe the presence of gravitational anomalies in chiral CFT. Furthermore, we propose a holographic construction to obtain the timelike entanglement entropy from the bulk dual geometries involving topologically massive gravity in AdS$_3$. The holographic results obtained match exactly with the dual field theory results.</description>

Abstract: We study the stress-energy tensor of a massless, conformally coupled, quantum scalar field in a rigidly-rotating thermal state on three- and four-dimensional anti-de Sitter space-time. We first find the stress-energy tensor using relativistic kinetic theory, modelling the field as a thermal gas of massless bosons. We then compute the renormalized stress-energy tensor of the scalar field in quantum field theory and compare it with that resulting from relativistic kinetic theory.</description>

Abstract: Recently it is asserted that the standard beta function does not describe the correct running of the coupling constant in some theories. We show that the problem arises from the assumption $\mu=p$ ($\mu$ is a renormalization point) and that a suitable choice of $\mu$ gives the correct running. It is also claimed that neither the cosmological constant nor Newton coupling run. We argue that running can be discussed when we consider the curved spacetime.</description>

      <title>Jet Quenching in Holographic QCD as an Indicator of Phase Transitions in Anisotropic Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the gauge/gravity duality to study jet quenching (JQ) phenomena in the quark-gluon plasma. For this purpose, we implement holographic QCD models constructed from an Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity at finite temperature and finite chemical potential for light and heavy quarks. The models capture both the confinement and deconfinement phases of QCD and the first-order phase transitions. We calculate the JQ parameter in different models and compare them with the experimental data obtained in heavy-ions studies. In particular, we investigate how JQ, as a function of temperature $T$, chemical potential $\mu$, and magnetic field $c_B$, serves as a probe for identifying first-order phase transitions within the $(T,\mu,c_B)$ parameter space of holographic QCD. Particular attention is paid to the dependence of JQ on the parameter $\nu$, which characterizes longitudinal versus transverse anisotropy relative to the heavy-ion collision axis. By analyzing the dependence of the JQ parameters on these thermodynamic variables, we map critical regions associated with phase boundaries. We compare our findings to earlier studies of the running coupling constant's behavior within the gauge-gravity duality framework. This approach provides new insights into the interplay between non-perturbative dynamics and phase structure in strongly coupled systems.</description>

      <title>Extremal AdS Black Holes as Fluids: A Matrix Large-Charge EFT Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a simple, yet powerful, matrix-valued large-charge EFT that captures the thermodynamic behavior of rotating extremal large-charge AdS black holes. We introduce a minimal "matrix EFT" by promoting the complex scalar in large charge EFT to a complex $N\times N$ adjoint scalar, whose $O(N^2)$ modes contribute at zero temperature. Employing a mean-field approximation, we solve the self-consistency equations and obtain explicit rigidly rotating fluid solutions. We demonstrate that their energy, angular momenta, and charge densities exactly reproduce the thermodynamics and boundary stress tensor of zero-temperature conformal fluids. A microscopic mode-counting further accounts for the $O(N^2)$ entropy. Via the fluid/gravity correspondence, this fluid describes an extremal AdS black hole in large charge limit. We also comment on supersymmetric BPS black holes, which fall outside the usual hydrodynamic regime but nevertheless exhibit simple, universal behavior in the large angular momentum limit. In this regime, their non-linear charge-spin relations simplify to form reminiscent of our extremal fluid solutions at large angular momentum limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the ADM energy of a Kaluza-Klein bubble of nothing is unbounded from below even if the size of the circle at infinity and the size of the minimal sphere at the bubble are fixed. We demonstrate this by presenting a family of explicit time-symmetric initial data satisfying these boundary conditions with arbitrarily negative energy. In particular, this is true for very small bubbles, which indicates that the standard Kaluza-Klein vacuum is more unstable than previously thought.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We build and discuss a low energy effective field theory for anisotropic anti-ferromagnets in presence of an external magnetic field. Such an effective theory is simple yet rich, and features a number of phenomena such as the appearance of gapped Goldstones, pseudo-Goldstones and a "spin flop" phase transition, all within the regime of validity of the theory. We also discuss in detail, the quantization procedure of the free theory in the presence of a magnetic field, which is made non-trivial by the presence of a single-time derivative term. This class of materials make a precious test field for exotic phenomena in quantum field theory. Moreover, we explicitly perform the matching of the effective theory to the short distance theory of a specific anti-ferromagnet, namely, nickel oxide. The latter is particularly relevant in light of recent proposals of employing this material towards the hunt for light dark matter. As a byproduct of our study, we also re-evaluate the role played by discrete symmetries in magnetic materials, presenting it in a way that is completely consistent with the proper low energy EFT ideology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14410v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum information method for measuring fractional charges in ballistic quantum wires generalizing bipartite fluctuations to the chiral quasiparticles in Luttinger liquids, i.e. adding charge and current fluctuations in a region of the wire. Bipartite fluctuations at equilibrium are characterized through a logarithmic scaling with distance encoding the entangled nature of these fractional charges in one-dimensional (1D) fluids. This approach clarifies the physical meaning of the dephasing factor of electronic interferences in a ballistic ring geometry at zero temperature, as a result of charge fractionalization. We formulate an analogy towards ground-state energetics. We show how bipartite current fluctuations represent a useful tool to locate quantum phase transitions associated to Mott physics. We address a spin chain equivalence and verify the fractional charges through an algorithm such as Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). Adding a potential difference between the two sides (parties) of the wire, bipartite fluctuations can detect a bound state localized at the interface through the Jackiw-Rebbi model coexisting with fractional charges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study a vector model of spontaneous spacetime-symmetry breaking coupled to gravity: the bumblebee model. The primary focus is on static spherically symmetric solutions. Complementing previous work on black hole solutions, we study the effects on the solutions when the vector field does not lie at the minimum of its potential. We first investigate the flat spacetime limit, which can be viewed as a modified electrostatic model with a nonlinear interaction term. We study the stability of classical solutions generally and in the spherically-symmetric case. We also find that certain potentials, based on hypergeometric functions, yield a Hamiltonian bounded from below. With gravity, we solve for the spherically-symmetric metric and vector field, for a variety of choices of the potential energy functions, including ones beyond the quadratic potential like the hypergeometric potentials. Special case exact solutions are obtained showing Schwarszchild-Anti de Sitter and Reissner-Nordstrom spacetimes. We employ horizon and asymptotic analytical expansions along with numerical solutions to explore the general case with the vector field away from the potential minimum. We discover interesting features of these solutions including naked singularities, repulsive gravity, and rapidly varying gravitational field near the source. Finally, we discuss observational constraints on these spacetimes using the resulting orbital behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances, including gravitational wave detections and imaging of black hole shadows, have strongly validated general relativity. Nevertheless, ongoing cosmological observations suggest potential limitations of general relativity, spurring interest in modified theories of gravity. This work investigates the Lorentz-gauge formulation of gravity-a novel framework that addresses key conceptual challenges in quantum gravity and cosmology by leveraging the recent black hole solutions presented in Ref. \cite{Koivisto:2024asr}. By analyzing black hole shadow structures and gravitational lensing effects-both weak and strong deflection regimes-we highlight unique observational signatures of Lorentz gauge gravity. Our findings provide valuable tools for future observational tests, potentially distinguishing these modified gravity models from general relativity and advancing our understanding of spacetime geometry and fundamental gravitational interactions.</description>

Abstract: 't Hooft anomalies of global symmetries play a fundamental role in quantum many-body systems and quantum field theory (QFT). In this paper, we make a systematic analysis of lattice anomalies - the analog of 't Hooft anomalies in lattice systems - for which we give a precise definition. Crucially, a lattice anomaly is not a feature of a specific Hamiltonian, but rather is a topological invariant of the symmetry action. The controlled setting of lattice systems allows for a systematic and rigorous treatment of lattice anomalies, shorn of the technical challenges of QFT. We find that lattice anomalies reproduce the expected properties of QFT anomalies in many ways, but also have crucial differences. In particular, lattice anomalies and QFT anomalies are not, contrary to a common expectation, in one-to-one correspondence, and there can be non-trivial anomalies on the lattice that are infrared (IR) trivial: they admit symmetric trivial gapped ground states, and map to trivial QFT anomalies at low energies. Nevertheless, we show that lattice anomalies (including IR-trivial ones) have a number of interesting consequences in their own right, including connections to commuting projector models, phases of many-body localized (MBL) systems, and quantum cellular automata (QCA). We make substantial progress on the classification of lattice anomalies and develop several theoretical tools to characterize their consequences on symmetric Hamiltonians. Our work places symmetries of quantum many-body lattice systems into a unified theoretical framework and may also suggest new perspectives on symmetries in QFT.</description>
