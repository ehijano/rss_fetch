      <title>Interference effects in new physics searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interference effects are an important consequence of a correct description in physics theories within and beyond the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. However, many current theoretical descriptions as well as experimental searches neglect such effects, which can, among others, lead to an incorrect description of e.g. kinematical distributions, at least within the context of UV-complete models. In this review, I briefly discuss the current status and most common descriptions as well as existing studies of such effects, where I focus on models with extended scalar searches.</description>

      <title>Wave-like amplification of near-threshold two-particle reactions: from muon-catalyzed fusion to $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ production at $e^-e^+$ annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple model is proposed to explain the recently found wave-like enhancement of the $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ pair production near the threshold at the $e^-e^+$ annihilation, which allows extracting parameters of the $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ interaction and the $\Lambda$-hyperon rms-radius from the oscillatory nature of the measured cross section. In particular, it predicts a single bound state of $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ with a binding energy of $\varepsilon_{\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}}=(36\pm5)$MeV. The model is a generalization of the formulas obtained in our earlier work [1] to explain the effect of wave-like amplification found in it near the threshold of fusion reactions screened by a muon or electron. The analysis allows us to conclude that the effect of wave-like amplification is an integral feature of any two-particle near-threshold reaction. In this regard, it seems promising to investigate, within the framework of our model, the oscillatory nature of the electromagnetic form factors of hyperons and nucleons extracted in experiments on $e^- e^+$ annihilation. A natural further development of the model could be its generalization to processes of producing various hadron pairs in $e^-e^+$ annihilation.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of $\Upsilon(11020)$ as an $S$-Wave $B_1\bar{B}$--$B_1\bar{B}^*$ Molecular State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although heavy-quark symmetry predicts a $B_1\bar{B}$ molecular partner of the $D_1\bar{D}$ molecule, no such state has been observed. We propose that the experimentally observed $\Upsilon(11020)$ may be a candidate for such a state, possibly containing a $B_1\bar{B}^{*}$ component. To test this, we interpret $\Upsilon(11020)$ as an $S$-wave $B_1\bar{B}$--$B_1\bar{B}^{*}$ molecule and compute its strong decay widths using the compositeness condition and effective Lagrangians. The couplings to $B_1$ and $\bar{B}^{(*)}$ are extracted by fitting $\Upsilon(11020)\to e^+ e^-$ and $\Upsilon(11020)\to \chi_{bJ} \pi\pi\pi$ data. Using these couplings, we evaluate partial widths into $B^{(*)}_{(s)}\bar{B}^{(*)}_{(s)}$, $\pi\pi \Upsilon(nS)$, $\pi\pi h_b(nP)$, and $\pi\pi\pi \chi_{b1}$ via hadronic loops, as well as three-body $B^{*}\pi \bar{B}^{(*)}$ decays via tree diagrams. The results indicate that $\Upsilon(11020)$ is predominantly a $B_1\bar{B}$ molecule, with its main decay channel being $B_s^{*}\bar{B}^{*}$. The $\pi\pi \Upsilon(nS)$ and $\pi\pi h_b(nP)$ widths are only a few eV, whereas $\pi\pi\pi \chi_{b1}$ reaches 0.167~MeV and the unobserved $\pi\pi\pi \chi_{b0}$ could be 0.754~keV. These distinctive decay patterns provide clear experimental signatures of the molecular nature of $\Upsilon(11020)$ and offer a test of heavy-quark symmetry.</description>

      <title>Inclusive beauty-charmed baryons decay $\Xi_{bcq} \to \Xi_{ccq} +X$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the inclusive weak decay $\Xi_{bcq} \to \Xi_{ccq} + X$ ($q=u,d,s$) within the framework of the non-relativistic potential quark model. Treating the heavy diquarks $\Phi_{bc}$ and $\Phi_{cc}$ as compact color anti-triplet bound states, we calculate the transition form factors via the overlap integral of Schr\"odinger wave functions derived from the Cornell potential. The decay rates for four dominant channels-$\Phi_{bc} \to \Phi_{cc} + \bar{c}s$, $\Phi_{bc} \to \Phi_{cc} + \bar{u}s$, $\Phi_{bc} \to \Phi_{cc} + e/\mu + \bar{\nu}$, and $\Phi_{bc} \to \Phi_{cc} + \tau + \bar{\nu}_{\tau}$-are computed, yielding a total inclusive decay width of $\Gamma(\Xi_{bcq} \to \Xi_{ccq} + X) \approx 4.1 \times 10^{-13}$ GeV. We also evaluate the potential background from $B_c^- \to \Xi_{cc} + X$ decays, finding a rate of approximately $ 3.0 \times 10^{-14}$ GeV, which is roughly one order of magnitude smaller than the signal process. Our results suggest that the inclusive decay $\Xi_{bc} \to \Xi_{cc} + X$ , followed by the well-established $\Xi_{cc}$ decay chains, provides a viable discovery channel for the doubly heavy baryon $\Xi_{bc}$ at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Analysis of ATLAS pp elastic measurements at $\sqrt{s}$=13 TeV and comparison with TOTEM measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comparative description is made of the measurements at LHC of pp elastic scattering at 13 TeV by the ATLAS and TOTEM Collaborations. In the total and differential cross sections we show that the differences are justified through single numerical factor. It seems that there is no fundamental physical difference, but only a difference of normalization between the two experiments. We study the real and imaginary amplitudes disentangled with the KFK (Kohara-Ferreira-Kodama) model and show that the properties are similar in qualitative aspects for both experiments. The real and imaginary parts have different slopes at the origin and present zeros, with distributions that are common to several models, with three zeros in the real part and one zero in the imaginary amplitude. A zero in the real part, known as Martin's zero, influences the determination of the $\rho$ parameter.</description>

      <title>Inclusive electron-proton measurement prospects in the Electron-Ion Collider early science stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential for extracting proton structure functions, proton parton density functions (PDFs), and the strong coupling $\alpha_s(M_z^2)$, using early science data from the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), both standalone, and in combination with HERA data. Different scenarios are considered in which samples with modest luminosity are collected at either two or three EIC beam energy configurations. The Rosenbluth separation method is used to extract the proton structure functions $F_2$ and $F_L$ from simulated data in a model-independent manner, showing that $F_L$ can be extracted significantly more precisely with three centre of mass energies than with two, whilst also obtaining $F_2$ to higher precision than has been achieved previously. The inclusion of a third beam configuration is also beneficial in the extraction of the strong coupling $\alpha_s(M_z^2)$ that is obtainable with unprecedented experimental precision with the early EIC data. Additionally, the precision of the proton PDFs is improved when adding these data, especially for large values of Bjorken-$x$, for both two and three EIC beam energy configurations. These studies show that EIC data will already be a highly competitive probe of perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics within the first five years of data taking.</description>

      <title>Vacuum polarization and pair production in time-dependent electric fields: A quantum-kinetic-equation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of the vacuum state in a time-dependent external electric field of arbitrary polarization is investigated within a nonperturbative framework of quantum kinetic equations (QKEs). In our previous work [Phys. Rev. Res. 6, 043009 (2024)], a revised version of the QKEs was derived by using an adiabatic basis constructed from one-particle Hamiltonian eigenfunctions in a spatially homogeneous electric field. In this study, we present an extensive analysis of these equations with particular emphasis on observable quantities. Specifically, we compute momentum-resolved particle yields, the induced electron-positron current, the energy-momentum tensor, and the angular-momentum tensor. We also discuss in detail the charge-renormalization procedure required to remove logarithmic divergences. It is shown that our results are consistent with the previous findings obtained via the Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner formalism. Our analysis provides a firmer theoretical basis for investigations of nonperturbative effects in strong electric fields.</description>

      <title>Search for Vector-Like Singlet Top ($T$) Quark in a Future Muon-Proton ($\mu p$) Collider at $\sqrt{s} = 5.29, 6.48,$ and $9.16$ TeV using Advanced Machine Learning Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the discovery potential of Vector-Like Singlet Top quarks ($T$) at a future $\mu p$ collider with center-of-mass energies of 5.29, 6.48, and 9.16 TeV, providing a unique environment to probe beyond Standard Model limits. We analyze the $T \to Wb$ decay mode in both fully hadronic ($bjj$) and leptonic ($bl\nu$) final states, offering a multi-channel assessment of $T$-quark sensitivity across a mass range of 2 to 5 TeV. Our methodology employs multivariate classifiers such as Boosted Decision Trees (BDTs) and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) to optimize signal-to-background discrimination in complex final states. The results demonstrate that the 9.16 TeV benchmark acts as a definitive discovery machine; even with 100 fb$^{-1}$ of data, the statistical significance exceeds $5\sigma$ up to 4 TeV masses. We identify a crossover effect where hadronic channels provide superior reach at intermediate masses due to higher branching ratios, while leptonic channels offer robustness at 5 TeV where purity limits detection. Incorporating a 20\% systematic uncertainty via Asimov significance ($Z_A$), we quantify the transition from fluctuation-dominated to systematic-dominated regimes at high luminosities. At 3000 fb$^{-1}$, regions with $g^{*} \in [0.20, 0.50]$ and $m_T$ up to 4 TeV are discoverable via the hadronic channel with MLP, and regions with $g^{*} \in [0.10, 0.50]$ and $m_T$ up to 5 TeV are accessible through the leptonic channel with BDT, highlighting the collider's potential to probe new physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Insights into the exotic charged states $Z_b(10610)$ and $Z_b(10650)$ from their photoproduction off nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility to study the nature of the famous charged bottomonium-like states $Z_b(10610)$ and $Z_b(10650)$, which is by far the best known, from their inclusive photoproduction off nuclei near the kinematic threshold is investigated within the collision model based on the nuclear spectral function. The model accounts for $Z_b(10610)^{\pm}$ and $Z_b(10650)^{\pm}$ production in direct photon--nucleon interactions as well as four different scenarios for their intrinsic configurations: compact tetraquarks, molecules of the two open-beauty mesons and two mixtures of both of them for each of $Z_b$ state. We calculate within these scenarios the absolute and relative excitation functions on $^{12}$C and $^{184}$W nuclei at photon energies of 61--90 GeV, the absolute momentum differential cross sections and ratios of them for their production off these target nuclei at laboratory polar angles of 0$^{\circ}$--5$^{\circ}$ and for photon energy of 75 GeV as well as the A-dependences of the transparency ratios for the $Z_b(10610)^{\pm}$ mesons at photon energy of 75 GeV. We show that the absolute and relative observables considered reveal distinct sensitivity to the $Z_b(10610)^{\pm}$ and $Z_b(10650)^{\pm}$ internal structures. Therefore, they might be useful for the determination of these structures from the comparison of them with the experimental data from the future high-precision experiments at the upcoming experimental facilities, such as the planned high-luminosity electron-ion colliders in the United States and China.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the fragmentation functions for a gluon into $P$-wave $B_c$ mesons within the nonrelativistic QCD factorization framework, incorporating color-singlet and color-octet contributions. Ultraviolet divergences arising from phase-space integrals are removed via operator renormalization in the modified minimal subtraction scheme. The resulting fragmentation functions are presented in both graphical form and as fitted analytic expressions.</description>

      <title>Constraints on birefringence-free photon theory within standard-model extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraints on the birefringence-free subset of Lorentz-violating (LV) operators are derived using 14 GRB photons in the GeV-band. These constraints target the isotropic $c_{(I)00}^{(d)}$ coefficients for dimensions $d=6,8,10$ within the framework of the Standard-Model Extension (SME). Employing theory-agnostic Bayesian parameter estimation methods, our analysis indicates a preference for subluminal LV effects. Focusing on this case, we further refine the parameter constraints, yielding results that are mutually consistent. Within the 95\% posterior credible interval, our constraints yield the bounds, $|c_{(I)00}^{(6)}|\le7.75 \times 10^{-20} ~ {\rm GeV}^{-2}$, $|c_{(I)00}^{(8)}|\le4.92 \times 10^{-24} ~ {\rm GeV}^{-4}$, and $|c_{(I)00}^{(10)}|\le3.46 \times 10^{-28} ~ {\rm GeV}^{-6}$, which improve upon the most stringent credible-interval bounds reported in the literature by at least five orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Two-loop renormalisation of the quark fields in the presence of four-fermion SMEFT operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the contributions of the dimension-6 SMEFT operators involving four third-generation quarks to the two-loop renormalisation of the quark fields and masses. We perform the computations in both the Naive Dimensional Regularisation (NDR) and the Breitenlohner-Maison-`t Hooft-Veltman (BMHV) schemes, and we present results for all relevant field and mass renormalisation constants in the on-shell and MS-bar schemes. We carefully discuss all scheme choices which affect the final results. This completes the computation of field and mass renormalisation constants relevant for two-loop computations in QCD involving dimension-six SMEFT operators.</description>

      <title>An introduction to gauge theories and group theory in particle physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this review, the fundamental concepts of group theory and representation theory are introduced. Special emphasis is placed on the unitary irreducible representations of the $SU(N)$ Lie group, the Poincare group, Little Group, discrete group, and their applications in particle physics. Based on the principle of local gauge symmetry, the construction of gauge-invariant Lagrangians and their quantization procedure are discussed. To address gauge redundancy, the modern on-shell amplitude approach is applied to gauge theories, demonstrating both conceptual and computational advantages. From the perspective of symmetry, the Standard Model is presented through the identification of its gauge symmetry, its anomaly-free matter content, and its global symmetries, including flavor symmetry, custodial symmetry, and baryon and lepton number conservation, etc.</description>

Abstract: We investigate CP violation in the process H^\pm \to W^\pm Z within the framework of the two-Higgs-Doublet model (2HDM). Amplitudes are expressed transparently in terms of physical couplings. Our analysis qualitatively confirms recent results by Kanemura and Mura, for the interference between one-loop bosonic and fermionic amplitudes. Furthermore, we identify additional sources of CP violation arising from internal interference among the bosonic and also among the fermionic loop amplitudes. In the alignment limit, the asymmetry would vanish in the absence of fermionic loop contributions when the sum of the masses of the additional neutral scalars is higher than the mass of the Z. Our results allow for generic Yukawa couplings, and cover both explicit and spontaneous CP violation. For inclusive W^\pm and Z decays, the CP violation will only manifest itself as a charge asymmetry.</description>

      <title>HDSense: An efficient method for ranking observable sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying which observables most effectively constrain model parameters can be computationally prohibitive when considering full likelihoods of many correlated observables. This is especially important for, e.g., hadronization models, where high precision is required to interpret the results of collider experiments. We introduce the High-Dimensional Sensitivity (HDSense) score, a computationally efficient metric for ranking observable sets using only one-dimensional histograms. Derived by profiling over unknown correlations in the Fisher information framework, the score balances total information content against redundancy between observables. We apply HDSense to rank a set observables in terms of their constraining power with respect to five parameters of the Lund string model of hadronization implemented in Pythia using simulated leptonic collider events at the $Z$ pole. Validation against machine-learning--based full-likelihood approximations demonstrates that HDSense successfully identifies near-optimal observable subsets. The framework naturally handles data from multiple experiments with different acceptances and incorporates detector effects. While demonstrated on hadronization models, the methodology applies broadly to generic parameter estimation problems where correlations are unknown or difficult to model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an extension of our prior work, we analyze the resonance contributions for the kaon pair originating from the intermediate $\rho(770)$, $\omega(782)$ and their excited states in the three-body decays $B\to \eta^{(\prime)} K\bar{K}$ within the perturbative QCD approach. The information of subprocesses $\rho(770,1450,1700)\to K\bar K$ and $\omega(782,1420,1650)\to K\bar K$ are included in the distribution amplitudes for $K\bar K$ system by using the kaon vector time-like form factors. We calculate the $CP$ averaged branching fractions and the direct $CP$ asymmetries for the relevant quasi-two-body $B$ meson decays. The branching fractions of the virtual contributions for $K\bar K$ from the Breit-Wigner formula tails of $\rho(770)$ and $\omega(782)$ for these decays are found comparable to the corresponding contributions from the resonances $\rho(1450,1700)$ and $\omega(1420,1650)$. Consequently, they constitute a significant component that should be accounted for in the considered three-body decays. All the predictions in this work are expected to be tested by the LHCb and Belle-II experiments in the future.</description>

      <title>Impact of Colliding Beams Helicity on the Production of Leptoquarks and Collider Experimental Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector Leptoquarks (VLQs) have emerged as primary candidates for resolving discrepancies in the Standard Model, specifically within $B$-meson decay channels and the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. This work presents a rigorous evaluation of VLQ pair production across $e^{-}e^{+}$ collision modes at future linear colliders with center-of-mass energies ranging from 14~TeV to 100~TeV. Our analysis demonstrates that longitudinal beam polarization is a transformative tool for enhancing signal sensitivity. We find that $e^{-}e^{+}$ annihilation consistently yields superior cross-sections compared to photon fusion processes across a mass range of 500--3000~GeV. By optimizing beam helicity to specific configurations, such as $P_{e^{-}} = -0.8$ and $P_{e^{+}} = +0.6$, the production cross-section can be maximized to 120~fb at $\sqrt{s} = 3$~TeV. We further establish that the Left-Right Asymmetry ($A_{LR}$) serves as a robust discriminator for the chiral structure of new physics, peaking at 0.16 under full polarization. Additionally, we show that effective luminosity can be enhanced to 95\% of the total luminosity, while high polarization degrees significantly suppress relative uncertainties in the effective polarization. These results provide a quantitative roadmap for optimizing discovery potential and minimizing systematic errors in future high-energy physics experiments.</description>

      <title>Fully strange tetra- and penta-quarks in a chiral quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recently reported resonant structure $X(2300)$, a strong candidate for a fully strange tetraquark with positive parity, we perform a systematic study of fully strange tetra- and penta-quark systems within a chiral quark model. Low-lying $S$-wave configurations of the $ss\bar s\bar s$ and $ssss\bar s$ systems are investigated using the Gaussian Expansion Method (GEM) combined with the Complex Scaling Method (CSM), which allows for a unified treatment of bound, resonant, and scattering states. For tetraquarks, all possible configurations: meson-meson, diquark-antidiquark, and K-type structures, with complete color bases, are incorporated, while baryon-meson and diquark-diquark-antiquark configurations are considered for pentaquarks. Several weakly bound states and narrow resonances are identified in both sectors. In particular, a compact fully strange tetraquark with $J^P=1^+$ is found near $2.3\,\text{GeV}$, providing a natural interpretation of the $X(2300)$ resonance. Additional exotic states with dominant hidden-color and K-type components are predicted in the mass ranges $1.6-3.1$ GeV for tetraquarks and $2.6-3.2$ GeV for pentaquarks. The internal structure of these states is analyzed through their sizes, magnetic moments, and wave-function compositions, highlighting the essential role of channel coupling and exotic color configurations. Finally, promising two-body strong decay channels are proposed to facilitate future experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Production of $\phi \Lambda$, $D_s^{*-} \Lambda_c^+$, and $J/\psi \Lambda$ in kaon-induced reactions off the nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the reaction mechanism of strangeness production in $K^- p \to \phi \Lambda$ within a hybrid Regge approach, taking into account $t$-channel $K$- and $K^*$-Reggeon exchanges. We present results for the total cross section, $t$-dependent differential cross sections, and spin-density matrix elements (SDMEs), and compare them with the available experimental data. We find that $K^*$-Reggeon exchange provides the dominant contribution, while $K$-Reggeon exchange remains nonnegligible, particularly in describing the SDMEs. In contrast, the $s$-channel $\Lambda$ and $u$-channel nucleon exchanges are negligible. To obtain reliable predictions for the open-charm reaction $K^- p \to D_s^{*-} \Lambda_c^+$, we employ a Quark-Gluon String Model (QGSM)-motivated Regge framework that incorporates both pseudoscalar- and vector-Reggeon exchanges. Within this framework, the Regge trajectories $\alpha(t)$ and energy-scale parameters $s_0$ are determined consistently, thereby constaining the model and reducing theoretical ambiguities. For the hidden-charm reaction $K^- p \to J/\psi \Lambda$, we use the same quark-level diagrammatic correspondence. The total cross sections for $K^- p \to D_s^{*-} \Lambda_c^+$ and $K^- p \to J/\psi \Lambda$ are suppressed by approximately 5-6 and 8-9 orders of magnitude, respectively, compared with that for $K^- p \to \phi \Lambda$. We also examine possible $s$-channel contributions from the hidden-charm pentaquark states with strangeness, $P_{cs}(4337)^0$ and $P_{cs}(4459)^0$, to both $D_s^{*-} \Lambda_c^+$ and $J/\psi \Lambda$ production.</description>

      <title>Disappearing Track Signals from a Light Charged Higgs in the Alternative Left-Right Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phenomenology of a light charged Higgs boson in the framework of the Alternative Left--Right Symmetric Model (ALRM). In this model, stringent flavor constraints are evaded due to a non-conventional fermion spectrum in which the right-handed up-type quarks are paired with the exotic down-type quarks rather than the Standard Model down-type quarks, leading to the absence of tree-level flavor-changing neutral currents. Furthermore, a specific assignment of the global $U(1)_S$ symmetry and the resulting emergent $R$-parity prevent mixing between the right- and left-handed charged gauge bosons, $W_R$ and $W_L$, providing additional suppression of flavor-violating effects. The ALRM accommodates potentially viable dark matter candidates, both fermionic and scalar ones. In this context, an associated charged Higgs state, $H_2^\pm$, belonging to the dark sector can naturally acquire a sub-TeV to TeV-scale mass without conflicting with any experimental constraints. We focus on scenarios in which $H_2^\pm$ behaves as a long-lived particle due to a sub-GeV mass splitting with the dark matter candidate. We identify regions of parameter space consistent with the observed dark matter relic density and other experimental constraints. A detailed analysis of disappearing track signatures is performed, including realistic tracklet reconstruction efficiencies, and the existing ATLAS search are recast to assess the current limits and future sensitivities. We find that the HL-LHC has limited sensitivity to TeV-scale charged Higgs bosons in this scenario, while the 27 TeV HE-LHC can effectively probe the relevant parameter space, with a 100 TeV collider offering substantially enhanced discovery potential.</description>

      <title>Systematical decomposition of dimension-11 short-range neutrinoless double beta decay operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) may receive sizable contributions from short-range physics beyond the Standard Model. We present a systematical classification of all tree-level ultraviolet completions of the dimension-11 short-range $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay operators, renormalizable scenarios with scalar and fermion mediators are considered. We identify eight distinct topologies and twenty-eight viable diagrams, from which all consistent UV completions are generated by imposing Standard Model gauge invariance. All these models involve a total of 61 new fields beyond the Standard Model and they typically feature fractionally charged fermions and exotic bosons such as dileptons, diquarks, and leptoquarks. We further study a representative model without colored mediators and analyze its implications for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay half-life and light neutrino masses. We find that current and future $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay experiments impose stringent constraints. Our systematic decomposition provides a general framework for exploring exotic short-range contributions to $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Shallow $T_{bc}$ states from an EFT analysis of $B^{(*)} \bar D^{(*)}$ scattering on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an effective field theory (EFT) framework for coupled-channel $B^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$ scattering, applying it to recent lattice QCD results by Alexandrou et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 151902 (2024)]. Two complementary EFT approaches are developed: (1) A low-energy theory near the $B \bar D$ ($J=0$) and $B^* \bar D$ ($J=1$) thresholds, where coupled-channel effects are integrated out; (2) A coupled-channel formulation, where all relevant momentum scales are treated as soft, incorporating contact interactions and one-pion exchange (OPE). Importantly, OPE contributes to the lowest channels only through off-diagonal transitions, thus resulting in the appearance of the left-hand cut from two-pion exchange. The two approaches yield mutually consistent results, supporting the existence of shallow bound states in both channels, in agreement with the lattice findings. The finite-volume spectra and extracted pole positions show a near-degeneracy in $J=0$ and $J=1$ channels, consistent with heavy-quark spin symmetry (HQSS). Using HQSS, we predict additional shallow bound states near the $B \bar{D}^*$ and $B^* \bar{D}^*$ thresholds, which are accessible to future lattice simulations. The effect of OPE on the finite volume spectra is found to be small, with only moderate impact on HQSS partners.</description>

      <title>A Novel Implementation of the Matrix Element Method at Next-to-Leading Order for the Measurement of the Higgs Self-Coupling ${\lambda}_{3H}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The determination of the Higgs boson trilinear self-coupling ${\lambda}_{3H}$ is a key goal of the LHC physics programme. Its precise measurement will provide unique insight into the scalar potential and the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking. Higgs boson pair production in the ${gg}\to{HH}$ process, and particularly in the ${HH}\to{b}\bar{b}{\gamma}{\gamma}$ final state, offers direct sensitivity to ${\lambda}_{3H}$.
  We present the first implementation of the Matrix Element Method at Next-to-Leading Order (MEM@NLO) for this process, which is publicly available. The MEM is a statistically optimal approach that maximises information extraction from collision events. Extending it to NLO represents a major methodological challenge, which we address with a new formalism integrated into the MoMEMta framework. Results with simulated pseudo-experiments demonstrate, in a proof-of-principle study, the strong discriminating power of the method and its ability to extract the coupling modifier ${\kappa}_{\lambda}$=${\lambda}_{3H}$/${\lambda}_{3H}^{SM}$ with high precision.</description>

      <title>Chasing Long-Lived Doubly Charged Scalars at Future Lepton Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We come up with a novel search strategy for long-lived doubly charged scalars at future proposed lepton colliders. The doubly charged scalar studied in this work belongs to an $SU(2)_L$ complex scalar triplet that accounts for tiny neutrino masses via the Type-II Seesaw mechanism. For scalar masses $\lesssim 200 $ GeV and appropriate values of the triplet vacuum expectation value, this state can be long-lived and decay predominantly into like-sign muon pairs (e.g. $\mu^+\mu^+ $ or $\mu^-\mu^-$), producing distinctive displaced-vertex signals. We investigate the pair production of these scalars at the International Linear Collider (ILC) and a prospective muon collider, considering their planned center-of-mass energies. Incorporating theoretical and experimental constraints, we study the resulting signature of four leptons accompanied by missing transverse energy. Displaced vertices offer direct evidence of the scalar's long lifetime, while we further show that the invariant mass distribution of same-sign dilepton pairs serves as a powerful complementary probe for discovering doubly charged Higgs bosons at both the ILC and muon collider.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence and Symmetries: Learning, Encoding, and Discovering Structure in Physical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetries play a central role in physics, organizing dynamics, constraining interactions, and determining the effective number of physical degrees of freedom. In parallel, modern artificial intelligence methods have demonstrated a remarkable ability to extract low-dimensional structure from high-dimensional data through representation learning. This review examines the interplay between these two perspectives, focusing on the extent to which symmetry-induced constraints can be identified, encoded, or diagnosed using machine learning techniques.
  Rather than emphasizing architectures that enforce known symmetries by construction, we concentrate on data-driven approaches and latent representation learning, with particular attention to variational autoencoders. We discuss how symmetries and conservation laws reduce the intrinsic dimensionality of physical datasets, and how this reduction may manifest itself through self-organization of latent spaces in generative models trained to balance reconstruction and compression. We review recent results, including case studies from simple geometric systems and particle physics processes, and analyze the theoretical and practical limitations of inferring symmetry structure without explicit inductive bias.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Goldstone Neutrinos and Majoron Phenomenology from Spontaneous $U(1){L\mu-L_\tau}$ Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a predictive framework for neutrino mass generation based on the spontaneous breaking of a leptonic $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ symmetry within a supersymmetric setting. The breaking of the global symmetry gives rise to a Majoron-like axion-like particle and a pseudo-Goldstone right-handed neutrino whose mass is naturally suppressed by supersymmetry-breaking effects. The interplay between the pseudo-Goldstone neutrino and the low-scale seesaw mechanism leads to a structured neutrino mass matrix capable of reproducing the observed neutrino masses, mixing angles, and CP-violating phase without invoking extreme parameter hierarchies.
  We perform a numerical fit to current neutrino oscillation data and identify representative benchmark solutions consistent with laboratory constraints as well as cosmological and astrophysical bounds. A characteristic outcome of the framework is the emergence of correlated relations linking the symmetry breaking scale, heavy neutrino masses, Majoron couplings, and neutrino lifetimes. Majoron-induced invisible neutrino decay arises generically and can significantly modify cosmological neutrino mass constraints for sufficiently low symmetry breaking scales.
  We discuss the phenomenological implications across neutrino oscillation experiments, cosmology, and collider searches for long-lived heavy neutrinos. While a detailed experimental simulation is beyond the scope of this work, existing sensitivity projections indicate that portions of the parameter space may become accessible in future facilities. The combined interplay of laboratory probes and cosmological observations provides a consistent and testable picture of neutrino mass generation tied to spontaneous leptonic symmetry breaking and axion-like physics.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the decays $B_c^- \rightarrow D_{s}^{(*)-}\ell^+\ell^-$ and $B_c^- \rightarrow D_{s}^{(*)-}\nu\bar{\nu}$ within the Standard Model (SM), employing perturbative QCD form factors that are sensitive to the wave functions of $B_c$ and $D_{s}^{(*)}$ mesons. We determine the shape parameters of these mesons and the $B_c \to D_s^{(*)}$ form factors at $q^2 = 0$ from available lattice QCD inputs for $B_s \to D_s^{(*)}$ and $B_c \to D_s$ transitions. To obtain the $q^2$ dependence of the $B_c \to D_s^*$ form factors, we employ heavy-quark spin symmetry and an appropriate parametrisation scheme over the allowed $q^2$ region. Based on these inputs, we present predictions for branching ratios and lepton-flavour-sensitive observables. Furthermore, we perform a detailed angular analysis of the cascade decay $B_c^- \to D_s^{*-}(\to D_s^- \pi^0)\,\ell^+\ell^-$, providing Standard Model predictions for several angular observables.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of non-relativistic stochastic fluids via the Metropolis algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic hydrodynamics provides a dynamical framework for the evolution of fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions, but poses significant challenges in numerical simulations. We present an algorithm for the simulation of non-relativistic stochastic fluids in two spatial dimensions in a box. We use the robust Metropolis algorithm, handling fluctuations and dissipation at once by systematically replacing dissipative terms in the hydrodynamic equations by random forces. The algorithm can easily be modified for numerical simulations of other hydrodynamic theories. We present test cases as well as numerical calculations of the renormalization of shear viscosity.</description>

      <title>Realization of quintom dark energy after DESI DR2 in Nieh-Yan modified teleparallel gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations from the DESI Collaboration indicate a preference for quintom dark energy, i.e., its equation of state evolves across the cosmological constant boundary $w=-1$. It is well known that models with single perfect fluid or single scalar field minimally coupled to Einstein gravity develop perturbative instabilities around the crossing, thereby cannot realize the quintom scenario. In this paper, we provide a method to circumvent the instability problem of these models by introducing the coupling of dark energy to the Nieh-Yan density in teleparallel gravity. We show that with this coupling the background evolution is not affected, but the dark energy perturbation is removed from the menu of dynamical degrees of freedom, thus avoiding the intrinsic difficulties in the old models.</description>

      <title>Model Study of Eigen-Microstate Signatures of Criticality in Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive model study of the eigen-microstate approach (EMA) for identifying critical fluctuations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Using UrQMD and two stochastic baseline models, we demonstrate that EMA is insensitive to conventional short-range correlations and effectively filters out non-critical backgrounds. Critical fluctuations embedded via event-level or particle-level replacement with CMC events generate characteristic cluster-like eigen-microstate patterns and enhanced leading eigenvalues, with event-level criticality producing stronger responses. The eigen microstates exhibit the same pattern across different scales, demonstrating that the fractal nature of critical fluctuations is captured by the eigen microstates. Finite-size scaling of eigenvalue ratios exhibits fixed-point behavior, confirming the largest eigenvalue as an effective order-parameter-like quantity. These results demonstrate that EMA offers a robust and background-independent method for critical-point searches in the RHIC Beam Energy Scan and future heavy-ion experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Different bases for the spin-1 density matrix are discussed to clarify the connection between its components and observables measured in heavy-ion collisions. The theoretical advantage of using the adjoint representation for spin matrices is emphasized. Next, the equilibrium spin density matrix and the corresponding Wigner function are introduced. With appropriate definitions of the energy-momentum and spin tensors, this framework allows for the formulation of perfect spin hydrodynamics in the same way as previously done for spin-1/2 particles. Together, these results provide a unified description of spin-1/2 and spin-1 particles.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Dynamics of Multi-Axion Quintessence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One fundamental physics interpretation of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) results is that the observed accelerated expansion of the Universe is driven not by the cosmological constant, but by a slowly rolling scalar field, a natural model for which is an axion with a decay constant close to the Planck scale. In the ``string axiverse'' one expects not one, but many, axions and this may allow the ability to engineer large effective decay constants. We thus investigate dark energy dynamics in a toy model with two axions, and compute the prior probability for the dark energy equation of state parameters $(w_0,w_a)$ implied by priors on the fundamental parameters of the model conditioned weakly on the resulting cosmology. We find various interesting behaviours, for example where both fields can be in an oscillating regime while maintaining $w_0&lt;-1/3$, and models with opposite sign for $w_a$ than in a single-field model. The prior probability in $(w_0,w_a)$ gains support away from the ``thawing quintessence'' behaviour preferred by DESI, and when the axions have cross-interactions this effect becomes stronger. When the axions interact, one in general still requires large decay constants, but if the axions are non-interacting the largest decay constant can be reduced. The novel equations of state we illustrate may also be of relevance to models of early dark energy or inflation/reheating with mutliple axions. Further exploration of dynamics in models with $N\gg 1$ axions is warranted.</description>

      <title>Detectability and Model Discriminability of the Dark Ages 21 cm Global Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 21 cm signal from neutral hydrogen atom is almost the only way to directly probe the Dark Ages. The Dark Ages 21 cm signal, observed at frequencies below 50 MHz, can serve as a powerful probe of cosmology, as the standard cosmological model predicts a well-defined 21 cm spectral shape. In this work, we assess the detectability and model-selection power of 21 cm observations assuming physically motivated foregrounds, optimistic error levels, and several observing strategies for the signals predicted in various cosmological models. Using a Bayesian evidence-based comparison, we find that wide-band observations covering 1-50 MHz can identify the evidence of non-zero 21 cm signals from models considered in this paper except the one with a smooth spectrum that peaks at lower frequencies. In particular, observations below 15 MHz are essential to avoid degeneracies with the foreground. Furthermore, even with observations measured at 5 MHz intervals over the frequency range 1-50 MHz, the 21 cm signal can be identified if the errors are sufficiently small. This indicates that the intrinsic 21 cm spectral shape can be captured without foreground degeneracy even with a limited number of frequency channels.</description>

Abstract: Using $(10087 \pm 44) \times 10^6$ $J/\psi$ events collected with the BESIII detector at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=3.097$ GeV, the antihyperon-nucleon annihilation processes $\bar{\Lambda} p \to K^+ \pi^+ \pi^- + k\pi^0$ ($k=1,2,3$) are studied at an incident $\bar{\Lambda}$ momentum of approximately 1.074 GeV/$c$. The reactions $\bar{\Lambda} p \to K^+ \pi^+ \pi^- \pi^0$ and $\bar{\Lambda} p \to K^+ \pi^+ \pi^- 2\pi^0$ are observed for the first time, with corresponding cross sections $\sigma_{\bar{\Lambda} p \to K^+ \pi^+ \pi^- \pi^0} = 8.5^{+1.2}_{-1.1} (\rm{stat.}) \pm 0.4 (\rm {syst.})$ mb and $\sigma_{\bar{\Lambda} p \to K^+ \pi^+ \pi^- 2\pi^0} = 7.9^{+1.9}_{-1.7} \pm 0.4$ mb. No significant signal is found for $\bar{\Lambda} p \to K^+ \pi^+ \pi^- 3\pi^0$, and an upper limit of 7.2 mb is set at a 90\% confidence level. An evidence for the $K^{*}(892)^+$ resonance is seen in the $K^+\pi^0$ invariant mass spectrum $M_{K^+\pi^0}$ for $k=1$, and the corresponding cross section for $\bar{\Lambda} p \to K^{*}(892)^+ \pi^+ \pi^-$ is measured to be $\sigma_{\bar{\Lambda} p \to K^{*}(892)^+ \pi^+ \pi^-} = 12.5^{+3.8}_{-3.4} \pm 1.2$ mb. Owing to the limited statistics, possible interference effects are not considered. These findings offer crucial input to deepen our understanding of the antihyperon-nucleon interactions.</description>

      <title>Factorized neural posterior estimation for rapid and reliable inference of parameterized post-Einsteinian deviation parameters in gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs) by LIGO has strikingly confirmed general relativity (GR), but testing GR via GWs requires estimating parameterized post-Einsteinian (ppE) deviation parameters in waveform models. Traditional Bayesian inference methods like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) provide reliable estimates but suffer from prohibitive computational costs, failing to meet the real-time demands and surging data volume of future GW detectors. Here, we propose a factorized neural posterior estimation framework: we construct independent normalizing flow models for each of the nine ppE deviation parameters and effectively integrate prior information from other source parameters via a conditional embedding network. Leveraging a hybrid neural network with a convolutional neural network and a Residual Neural Network for feature extraction, our method performs rapid and statistically reliable posterior inference directly from binary black hole signals. Compared to conventional MCMC, our approach achieves millisecond-scale inference time with a speedup factor of $9 \times 10^4$. Comprehensive validations show that the posterior estimates pass the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and achieve empirical coverage probabilities close to theoretical targets. This work demonstrates the great potential of deep learning for GW parameter estimation and provides a viable technical solution for real-time GR tests with next-generation detectors.</description>

      <title>Resonant production of heavy particles during inflation and its gravitational wave signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a quadratic $U(1)$-breaking term, together with an effective chemical potential induced by a dimension five derivative coupling between the inflaton and the $U(1)$ current, can drive efficient particle production during inflation even when the $U(1)$ field is heavier than the Hubble scale. Notably, the chemical potential enables efficient production even when the $U(1)$-breaking mass is smaller than the effective diagonal mass. We compute the gravitational wave signal generated by this mechanism during inflation, derive the primordial tensor spectrum, and map it to the present day energy density $\Omega_{\mathrm GW}(f)$. Assuming the $U(1)$ field constitutes the dominant component of dark matter, this mapping fixes the characteristic frequency, which we compare with projected sensitivity curves of ongoing and proposed gravitational wave observatories. Finally, we argue that the same dynamics are accompanied by a cosmological collider signal, providing an independent cross validation of the framework.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the Tsallis Parameter from a deformed Neutrino Sector in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize neutrino energy density content in the early universe near BBN era $T\simeq1$ MeV within Tsallis nonextensive statistics. By using Curado-Tsallis constraints we obtain generalized distribution functions $f_q(E)$. We compute the generalized thermodynamic integral for the energy density $\rho_q$. We define a reescaling $R^{(\xi = +1)}_{\rho}(q) = \rho_q/\rho^{\rm std}$ which is a ratio between the deformed energy density and the standard extensive case. The last was used to directly map and deform neutrino content via the effective number of neutrinos $N_{\rm eff}$. The deformation prediction was confronted against CMB$+$BAO and BBN data for $N_{\rm eff}$ by a joint/combined $\chi^2$ type-fit. We obtained the constraints $|q-1|\le 1.09\times 10^{-2}$ (95\% CL) and $|q-1|\le 1.32\times 10^{-2}$ (99\% CL) from the combined analysis by numerically calculating the best value of the Tsallis parameter $q_{\rm best}$.</description>

      <title>On the stability of Born-Infeld-regularised electroweak monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cho-Maison monopole provides a monopole solution of the electroweak field equations, but possesses an infinite classical energy due to the Maxwell form of the hypercharge sector. Motivated by string-inspired effective field theories, we study the perturbative stability of the Cho-Maison monopole when the hypercharge kinetic term is regularised by a Born-Infeld extension, which renders the monopole energy finite. Focusing on the bosonic electroweak theory with an unmodified $SU(2)_L$ sector and a Born-Infeld U(1)_Y sector, we analyze linear fluctuations about the regularised monopole background. Using a complex tetrad and a spin-weighted harmonic decomposition, we reduce the fluctuation equations to coupled radial Schroedinger-type eigenvalue problems and examine the spectrum of the resulting operators. We extend the separation-of-variables framework developed by Gervalle and Volkov to this non-linear gauge-field setting. We show that, after appropriate gauge fixing and constraint elimination, the Born-Infeld deformation preserves the angular channel structure of the Maxwell theory and leads to a self-adjoint Sturm-Liouville type problem for the stability of the radial modes, with modified radial coefficients determined by the background Born-Infeld profile. The resulting operator represents a smooth deformation of the Maxwell case and retains positive kinetic weight. Our results provide plausible evidence for the stability of the Born-Infeld deformed monopole and, most importantly, a systematic framework for future numerical or variational studies aimed at a definitive spectral analysis.</description>

      <title>Universal Relations and Correlation Analysis of Proto-Neutron Star Properties in Energy-Momentum Squared Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proto-neutron stars (PNSs) are the hot, lepton-rich remnants of the core collapse supernovae, which go through a cooling phase and become cold, stable Neutron stars (NSs). Since PNSs are also superdense objects with strong gravitational fields, we can use them to probe general relativity (GR) in the high-curvature regime, similar to NSs. In this study, we analyze the macroscopic properties like mass, radius, compactness, tidal deformability, $f$-mode oscillations and gravitational binding energy of PNSs using four different relativistic mean-field (RMF) equations of state (EOSs) with fixed entropy per baryon ($S$ =1, 2) and varying the lepton fractions ($Y_l$). The variation of $S$ and $Y_l$ has a noticeable effect on these properties. Extending our study beyond GR, we explore these effects within the framework of Energy-Momentum Squared Gravity (EMSG). This modified gravity theory adds the squared energy-momentum terms to the field equations with a free parameter $\alpha$. In the weak-field regimes, EMSG remains indistinguishable from GR, but in the strong-field regimes, such as PNSs or NSs, it shows measurable deviations. Varying the free parameter $\alpha$, we observe significant changes in the macroscopic properties of the PNSs. After that, we focus on the universal relations of the macroscopic properties and the correlations of the universal relations. We find that, despite significant changes in the macroscopic properties induced by the variations of $S$, $Y_l$ and $\alpha$, the correlations remain strong and nearly unaffected.</description>

Abstract: Quantum simulations of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) require a representation of gauge fields and fermions on the finitely many degrees of freedom available on a quantum computer. We introduce a truncation of lattice QCD coupled to staggered fermions that includes (i) a local Krylov truncation that generates allowed basis states; (ii) a maximum allowed electric energy per link; (iii) a limit on the number of fermions per site; and (iv) a truncation in the large N_c scaling of Hamiltonian matrix elements. Explicit truncated Hamiltonians for 1+1D and 2+1D lattices are given, and numerical simulations of string-breaking dynamics are performed.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Contribution of Active Galactic Nuclei to the Diffuse High-Energy Neutrino Flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of high-energy neutrinos from NGC 1068 and TXS-0506+56 suggests that active galactic nuclei (AGN) may contribute significantly to the the diffuse neutrino flux measured by IceCube. Using 10 years of publicly available IceCube data, we performed a systematic population analysis of X-ray-bright and gamma-ray-bright AGN to evaluate the extent to which this diffuse flux could originate from these sources. We find that gamma-ray-bright blazars can account for no more than 16\% of IceCube's total diffuse flux. Although we find no evidence of neutrino emission from gamma-ray-bright, non-blazar AGN, we cannot exclude the possibility that these sources contribute significantly to the diffuse flux. In contrast, we report (pre-trials) evidence of neutrino emission from several nearby, X-ray-bright, Seyfert-type AGN, including \mbox{NGC 1068} ($4.9\sigma$), SWIFT J1041.4-1740 ($2.6\sigma$), SWIFT J0202.4+6824A/B ($2.6\sigma$), SWIFT J0744.0+2914 (2.6$\sigma$), NGC 4151 ($2.5\sigma$), and NGC 3079 ($2.5\sigma$). Although not fully conclusive, these results suggest that IceCube may be detecting neutrinos from a larger population of Seyfert galaxies. The fact that these sources are not gamma-ray bright indicates that their neutrino production must be taking place in optically thick environments, such as in the coronae surrounding these galaxies' supermassive black holes. We also identify a $4.2\sigma$ correlation between the neutrinos detected by IceCube and members of the Swift-BAT catalog of X-ray-bright AGN, although this correlation is dominated by NGC 1068. We estimate that this class of sources contributes between 11.2\% and the entirety of IceCube's total diffuse neutrino flux. These results strengthen the emerging case for the prevalence of gamma-ray-obscured AGN as significant sources of high-energy neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Wilson loops with neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wilson loops are essential objects in QCD and have been pivotal in scale setting and demonstrating confinement. Various generalizations are crucial for computations needed in effective field theories. In lattice gauge theory, Wilson loop calculations face challenges, including excited-state contamination at short times and the signal-to-noise ratio issue at longer times. To address these problems, we develop a new method by using neural networks to parametrize interpolators for the static quark-antiquark pair. We construct gauge-equivariant layers for the network and train it to find the ground state of the system. The trained network itself is then treated as our new observable for the inference. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement in the signal compared to traditional Wilson loops, performing as well as Coulomb-gauge Wilson-line correlators while maintaining gauge invariance. Additionally, we present an example where the optimized ground state is used to measure the static force directly, as well as another example combining this method with the multilevel algorithm. Finally, we extend the formalism to find excited-state interpolators for static quark-antiquark systems. To our knowledge, this work is the first study of neural networks with a physically motivated loss function for Wilson loops.</description>

      <title>Comparable Dark Matter and Baryon energy densities from Dark Grand Unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16860v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a theory of $SU(9)$ dark grand unification, where dark matter consists of asymmetric dark baryons from the $Sp(4)_D$ dark QCD sector. By unifying the dark color gauge group with the Standard Model gauge group, the asymmetry generation in both sectors originates from a common process that preserves a $U(1)_{D-(B-L)}$ symmetry, resulting in comparable number densities. Furthermore, thanks to dark grand unification, the $Sp(4)_D$ dark QCD sector shares a similar matter content with the QCD sector, leading to comparable running of the gauge couplings from the scale as high as $10^{15}$ GeV. This predicts a dark color confinement scale and thus dark baryon masses around the GeV scale, comparable to visible baryon masses. Together with the similar number densities, the model provides an explanation for the observed similarity between the energy densities of dark matter and baryons, $\rho_D \approx 5\,\rho_B$. The model also features some novel phenomenology, including a GeV-scale flavored dark QCD sector with diquark dark baryons and light dark mesons. The interaction between the dark sector and the visible sector occurs via a new $Z'$ boson with a mass of $\mathcal{O}(10)$ TeV, which could be searched for at future hadron colliders. We also briefly discuss an $SU(8)$ dark grand unified theory featuring an $SU(3)_D$ dark QCD sector.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relation of the neutrino plasma: Unifying fast, slow, and collisional instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20389v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In neutrino-dense astrophysical environments, these particles exchange flavor through a coherent weak field, forming a collisionless neutrino plasma with collective flavor dynamics. Instabilities, which grow and affect the environment, may arise from neutrino-neutrino refraction alone (fast limit), vacuum energy splittings caused by masses (slow limit), or neutrino-matter scattering (collisional limit). We present a comprehensive analytical description of the dispersion relation governing these unstable modes. Treating vacuum energy splittings and collision rates as small perturbations, we construct a unified framework for fast, slow, and collisional instabilities. We classify modes into gapped, where collective excitations are already present in the fast limit but rendered unstable by slow or collisional effects, and gapless, which are purely generated by these effects. For each class, we derive approximate dispersion relations for generic energy and angle distributions, which reveal the order of magnitude of the growth rates and the nature of the instabilities without solving directly the dispersion relation. This approach confirms that slow and collisionally unstable waves generally grow much more slowly than they oscillate. Consequently, the common fast-mode approximation of local evolution within small boxes is unjustified. Even for fast modes, neglecting large-distance propagation of growing waves, as usually done, may be a poor approximation. Our unified framework provides an intuitive understanding of the linear phase of flavor evolution across all regimes and paves the way for a quasi-linear treatment of the instability's nonlinear development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02331v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study parity violation in the early universe by examining the four-point correlation function within the axion inflation model. Using an open quantum system formalism from our previous work, we calculate the influence functional to fourth order, from which we then derive the inflaton four-point correlation function. When we decompose this function using isotropic basis functions, the expansion coefficients $\zeta_{\ell',\ell'',\ell'''}$ naturally split into parity-even and parity-odd components. In the large $\xi$ approximation, which enhances the production of right-handed photons in the model, the derivation of these coefficients simplifies. We work out the lowest-order nonvanishing parity-odd $\zeta_{234}$ term which clearly indicates the presence of parity violation. Moreover, our derived values of the coefficients are consistent with recent observational data from galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Extraction of Effective Parameters from Transverse Momentum Spectra of Heavy Quarkonia in Proton-Proton Collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10702v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effective string tension ($\kappa$) in the Schwinger mechanism and the effective temperature ($T$) in Bose-Einstein statistics are extracted from the transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra of heavy quarkonia produced in proton-proton (p+p) collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Here, $T$ derived from the heavy quarkonium $p_T$ spectra also serves as the initial effective temperature (effective temperature at the initial stage) of small collision systems. This is because, despite the absence of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation during the collisions, which leaves $T$ largely unaffected by QGP-related effects, the initial geometric asymmetry and local partonic thermalization still induce radial and transverse flows, thereby contributing to an increase in $T$. The effective parameters ($\kappa$ and $T$) are obtained by fitting the experimental $p_T$ spectra of $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon(nS)$ ($n=1$, 2, and 3) within various rapidity intervals, produced in p+p collisions at center-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s}=13$ and 8 TeV, as measured by the LHCb Collaboration. It is found that the multi-component distribution structured within the framework of the Schwinger mechanism or Bose-Einstein statistics can effectively describe the heavy quarkonium $p_T$ spectra in small collision systems. With decreasing rapidity in the forward region, both $\kappa$ and $T$ increase, indicating a directly proportional relationship between them. Based on $\kappa$, the average minimum strong force radius of participant quarks is determined.</description>

  flavor symmetries, we analyze the implications of recent results from ATLAS, CMS, LHCb, and dark matter direct
  detection experiments. Our numerical scans, conducted with SARAH and SPheno, identify viable low-energy regions
  consistent with third-generation Yukawa unification, the observed Higgs boson mass, dark matter relic density,
  and flavor observables such as $B \to X_s \gamma$, $B_s \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ and $B_u \to \tau \nu_{\tau}$ .
  Our findings suggest that while current bounds severely constrain much of the
  MSSM-like parameter space, substantial regions remain experimentally viable and testable in the ongoing LHC run
  and next-generation dark matter experiments.</description>

Abstract: The Cutkosky cutting rules establish a direct connection between the imaginary parts of loop amplitudes and physical observables such as decay rates and cross sections, providing heuristic insights into the underlying processes. This work lays a robust theoretical foundation for the application of cutting rules in solid-state systems involving instantaneous dark matter (DM)-electron Yukawa interaction as well as the Coulomb potential. The cutting rules are formulated using the single-electron wavefunctions and corresponding energy eigenvalues obtained from the Kohn-Sham equations within density functional theory (DFT). This framework is not only of considerable theoretical interest but also holds significant practical relevance for studying DM phenomenology in condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Heavy Quark Decays in the Bilepton Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the current absence of new physics signals at the LHC, it is increasingly important to investigate alternative scenarios beyond those commonly explored. In this work, we study a variant of the 331 model that predicts the existence of vector bileptons with electric charge and lepton number +/-2, as well as TeV-scale exotic quarks carrying charges +/- 5/3 and +/- 4/3. Specifically, we focus on the primary production of heavy quarks with charge +/- 5/3, which decay into a bottom quark and a bilepton, followed by the bilepton's decay into same-sign muon pairs. As a case study, we select a benchmark point that complies with current experimental exclusion limits and theoretical expectations for the bilepton mass. Our analysis shows that the resulting signal stands out clearly from Standard Model backgrounds and could be observed at a future 100 TeV hadron collider such as FCC-hh. In contrast, the LHC, even in its high-luminosity phase, lacks the sensitivity required to detect this signal.</description>

      <title>Direct Evaluation of CP Phase of CKM matrix, General Perturbative Expansion and Relations with Unitarity Triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, using a rephasing invariant formula $\delta = \arg [ { V_{ud} V_{us} V_{c b} V_{tb} / V_{ub} \det V_{\rm CKM} }]$, we evaluate the CP phase $\delta$ of the CKM matrix $V_{\rm CKM}$ perturbatively for small quark mixing angles $s_{ij}^{u,d}$ with associated phases $\rho_{ij}^{u,d}$.
  Consequently, we derived a relation $\delta \simeq \arg [\Delta s_{12} \Delta s_{23} / ( \Delta s_{13} - s^u_{12} e^{-i \rho^u_{12}} \Delta s_{23} )]$ with $\Delta s_{ij} \equiv s^d_{ij} e^{-i \rho^d_{ij}} - s^u_{ij} e^{-i \rho^u_{ij}}$. Such a result represents the analytic behavior of the CKM phase. The uncertainty in the relation is of order $O(\lambda^{2}) \sim 4\%$, which is comparable to the current experimental precision. Comparisons with experimental data suggest that the hypothesis of some CP phases being maximal. We also discussed relationships between the phase $\delta$ and unitarity triangles. As a result, several relations between the angles $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ and $\delta$ are identified through other invariants $V_{il} V_{jm} V_{kn} / \det V_{\rm CKM}$.</description>

      <title>Partial pressure and susceptibilities of charmed sector in the van der Waals hadron resonance gas model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the general susceptibilities in the charm sector by using the van der Waals hadron resonance gas model (VDWHRG). We argue that the ideal hadron resonance gas (HRG), which assumes no interactions between hadrons, and the excluded volume hadron resonance gas (EVHRG), which includes only repulsive interactions, fail to explain the lQCD data at very high temperatures. In contrast, the VDWHRG model, incorporating both attractive and repulsive interactions, extends the degree of agreement with lQCD up to nearly 180 MeV. We estimate the partial pressure in the charm sector and study charm susceptibility ratios in a baryon-rich environment, which is tricky for lattice quantum chromodynamics (lQCD) due to the fermion sign problem. Our study further solidifies the notion that the hadrons shouldn't be treated as non-interacting particles, especially when studying higher order fluctuations, but rather one should consider both attractive and repulsive interactions between the hadrons.</description>

      <title>Probing $0\nu\beta\beta$ and $\mu\to e\gamma$ via Fully Determined Dirac Mass Terms in LRSM with Double Seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) and charged lepton flavor violation (cLFV) experiments provide promising avenues to probe new physics contributions from extended neutrino sectors in beyond Standard Model (BSM) scenarios. We consider a Left-Right Symmetric Model (LRSM) extended with three generations of sterile neutrinos to realize a double type-I seesaw mechanism for light neutrino mass generation. The double seesaw induces maximal lepton number violation in the right-handed sector and facilitates enhanced Majorana masses for right-handed neutrinos, thereby leading to their dominant contributions in both cLFV and $0\nu\beta\beta$ processes. We perform a comprehensive exploration of the parameter space for new-physics contributions to the cLFV decay $\mu \to e \gamma$ and to $0\nu\beta\beta$, considering two different textures for the Dirac mass matrices: (i) a symmetry-motivated limit with $M_D \propto \mathbb{1}$, and (ii) a texture fully determined by the model framework. A detailed analysis of the common parameter regions accessible to current experiments like KamLAND-Zen and LEGEND-200, and upcoming experiments, such as MEG-II and LEGEND-1000, is presented, underscoring the phenomenological relevance of this framework. Our results aim to provide optimistic benchmarks for future searches targeting right-handed current-mediated neutrino interactions.</description>

      <title>The $\Lambda_{b} \to \Lambda$ transition form factors in perturbative QCD approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda$ transition form factors in the perturbative QCD (PQCD) approach, incorporating higher-twist light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs). The resulted form factors show that higher-twist LCDAs are dominant numerically. By combining our PQCD predictions at low-$q^2$ with lattice QCD results at high-$q^2$, $z$-series expansion fits are performed to parametrize the form factors over the full kinematic range. We also provide the prediction for physical observables in the rare decay $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda \mu^+ \mu^-$, including the differential branching fraction, dilepton longitudinal polarization fraction, and forward-backward asymmetries (lepton-side, hadron-side, and combined lepton-hadron). Our obtained form factors are consistent with those in other theoretical methods within the uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Soret and Dufour effects in hot and dense QCD matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gradients act as invisible engines of transport, converting microscopic imbalances into macroscopic flows, and thus providing deep insights into the dynamics of physical systems. Thermal gradients do not merely drive the flow of heat, but they also set the microscopic constituents of the system into motion. In such scenarios, the constituents of the system not only transport energy but also diffuse collectively under the influence of these gradients. For the very first time, we present a first-principles investigation of the Soret and Dufour effects in hot and dense quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter. We use the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation under the relaxation time approximation. By incorporating chemical potential and temperature gradients into the kinetic theory framework, we derive explicit expressions for the Dufour coefficient, which quantifies the heat flow due to concentration gradients, and the Soret coefficient, which describes the particle diffusion induced by thermal gradients. These coupled-transport phenomena are traditionally studied in multi-component classical systems at low energy scales. In this study, we follow quasiparticle models for the deconfined phase and the hadron resonance gas model for the confined hadronic phase in the context of heavy-ion collisions. This study provides novel insights into the thermo-diffusion and diffusion-thermo phenomena and opens avenues for incorporating such effects in hydrodynamic modeling and transport simulations of QCD matter.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature stability from doublet inflation field with right-handed neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the augmentation of the Standard Model (SM) with another $SU(2)$ Higgs doublet and right-handed neutrinos. The second Higgs doublet ($\Phi_2$) is defined to be odd under the $Z_2$ symmetry, and hence, the lightest stable neutral particle from the additional doublet becomes the cold dark matter candidate. The right-handed neutrino field coupled to the Higgs field provides non-zero mass for the neutrinos. The inert doublet field coupled non-minimally to gravity as $\zeta_2 \Phi_2^\dagger \Phi_2 R$ also acts as an inflaton field. The inflationary bounds restrict the interaction couplings as $\lambda_2/\zeta_2^2 \approx 4\times 10^{-10}$. After inflation ends, the scalar bosonic degrees of freedom from the inert doublet can contribute to the electroweak phase transition. The strongly first-order phase transition bound, i.e., $\frac{\phi_{+}(T_c)}{T_c} \geq 1.0$ restricts the bare mass parameter of the additional doublet to $m_{22}=400.0$ GeV, demanding GUT scale perturbative unitarity for $Y_N=0.01$. The increase in $Y_N$ reduces the strength of phase transition, and it is no longer satisfied even for vanishing bare mass parameter. The Planck scale perturbative unitarity allows for the first-order phase transition, $\frac{\phi_{+}(T_c)}{T_c} \geq 0.6$, until $m_{22}=70.0$ GeV for $Y_N=0.01$, and none of the mass values satisfies the first-order phase transition for $Y_N=0.4$. The thermal corrections also affect the probability of tunneling from the false vacuum to the true vacuum, and hence, the finite temperature stability of the electroweak vacuum has been studied, including the finite-temperature effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26069v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quality of the invariant mass reconstruction of the di-{\tau} system is crucial for searches and analyses of di-{\tau} resonances. Due to the presence of neutrinos in the final state, the {\tau} {\tau} invariant mass cannot be calculated directly at hadron colliders, where the longitudinal momentum sum constraint cannot be applied. A number of approaches have been adopted to mitigate this issue. The most general one uses Matrix Element (ME) integration for likelihood estimation, followed by invariant mass reconstruction as the value maximizing the likelihood. However, this method has a significant computational cost due to the need for integration over the phase space of the decay products. We propose an algorithm that reduces the computational cost by two orders of magnitude, while maintaining the resolution of the invariant mass reconstruction at a level comparable to the ME-based method. Moreover, we introduce additional features to estimate the uncertainty of the reconstructed mass and the kinematics of the initial {\tau} leptons (e.g., their momenta).</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of neutrino-induced decoherence in macroscopic matter-wave interferometry experiments designed to search for dark matter and beyond-Standard Model physics. Our calculation includes contributions from the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B), solar neutrinos, and reactor antineutrinos, accounting for coherent scattering processes across nuclear, atomic, and macroscopic length scales. Within the Standard Model, we find negligible decoherence rates for planned experiments such as MAQRO ($s/\sigma_s \sim 10^{-27}$) and terrestrial interferometers like Pino ($s/\sigma_s \sim 10^{-22}$). However, these experiments achieve competitive sensitivity to beyond-Standard Model physics through light vector mediator interactions, with C$\nu$B constraining coupling products to $g_\nu g_n \lesssim 10^{-17}$ for $Z'$ masses below 1 eV. Our results provide a theoretical framework for interpreting matter-wave interferometry measurements in terms of neutrino interaction physics and for deriving constraints on BSM models from experimental data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06065v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A false vacuum could be a profound ingredient of fundamental physics, yet its direct detection in laboratories is hindered when the lifetime is exponentially long. Conventional static phase diagrams often discard metastable false vacuum, we show that, however, in a dynamical treatment of a first-order QCD phase transition at large quark chemical potential that strongly suppresses tunneling, cosmologically long-lived, and thus indispensable false vacuum naturally arises, and makes nontrivial contribution to constituting primordial quark objects. We identify two distinct branches of such primordial quark objects: quark star crusted with false vacuum, and nugget specifically referring to quark star in global false vacuum, which may account for a population of small compact stars. Some long-lived primordial objects may have survived until the late Universe, and hopefully sow the seeds of high red-shift galaxies. Its false vacuum decay can power ultra-energetic long $\gamma$-ray bursts and kHz gravitational waves within multi-messenger facilities, rendering itself an astrophysical and thus testable phenomenon.</description>

Abstract: Although the axion is the most compelling solution to the strong CP problem, the ad hoc introduced global Peccei-Quinn symmetry suffers from a severe fine-tuning problem known as the quality problem. In this Letter, we show that the discrete gauge symmetry $\mathbb Z_4 \times \mathbb Z_3$ motivated from the internal structure of the Standard Model can naturally predict a high-quality axion, leading to a distinct and testable parameter space. Remarkably, this minimal framework simultaneously accounts for neutrino masses, baryon asymmetry, and dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic inflation is the leading theory to explain early Universe history and structure formation. Non-oscillatory inflation is a class of models which can naturally introduce a post-inflationary stiff period of the Universe's evolution which boosts the signal of primordial gravitational waves (GWs), making it possible to observe them in forthcoming GW experiments. However, this pushes the GW energy density high enough to destabilise the process of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). This problem can be overcome by "softening" the stiff period, so that the field is gradually tending towards freefall from a frozen start. Here, we consider a modified hybrid inflation model where the stiff period is driven by the waterfall field, allowing the barotropic parameter of the Universe to vary, so that it does not violate the BBN constraint but produces a characteristic gravitational wave spectrum soon to be observable.</description>

      <title>Revealing dipion correlations for the observed substructure near the $\pi^+\pi^-$ mass threshold in $\psi(3686)\to J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10345v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the world's largest $\psi(3686)$ data sample, the BESIII Collaboration recently reported a substructure near the $\pi^+\pi^-$ mass threshold in the decay $\psi(3686) \to J/\psi \pi^+\pi^-$, challenging the established understanding of the dipion invariant mass spectrum. We propose that this substructure arises directly from dipion correlations. Using a chiral unitary approach, we successfully reproduce the observed anomaly, thereby providing strong evidence of dipion correlation in heavy quarkonium decays. This approach also allows us to predict the corresponding dipion correlation function.</description>

      <title>Two-lepton tales: Dalitz decays of heavy quarkonia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Dalitz decays of heavy quarkonia, which result from the internal virtual photon conversion into an $\ell^+ \ell^-$ lepton pair. Heavy-quark symmetries allow us to establish systematic relations between transitions of different quarkonium states, and to precisely determine the branching fractions for several charmonium and bottomonium decay modes. For charmonium, existing data on $\chi_{cJ}(1P)\to J/\psi \ell^+ \ell^-$ and $\psi(2S)\to \chi_{cJ}(1P) \ell^+ \ell^-$ enable us to determine the parameters of the transition form factors and to predict the rates of yet-unobserved modes. The Dalitz transitions of $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ are important, as they can help assessing the structure of this meson. For bottomonium, recent LHCb measurements allow us to predict the branching fractions of $\chi_{bJ}(nP)\to \Upsilon(1S)\ell^+ \ell^-$ and $h_b(nP)\to \eta_b(1S) \ell^+ \ell^-$ ($n=1,\,2)$. We also investigate the sensitivity of heavy quarkonia Dalitz modes to the contribution of a new light vector mediator, such as the putative $X(17)$.</description>

      <title>The role of charm and unflavored mesons in prompt atmospheric lepton fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The all-sky very-high-energy ($10^4-10^6$ GeV) atmospheric muon flux measured by IceCube shows a spectral hardening at the highest energies, indicating the presence of a prompt component. IceCube has also measured the atmospheric muon neutrino flux at high energy. However, since this flux is dominated by astrophysical neutrinos, only an upper bound can be placed on the prompt atmospheric $\nu_\mu+\bar{\nu}_\mu$ contribution. In this work, we provide a new evaluation of the prompt atmospheric muon flux including an intrinsic charm component in the cosmic ray-air interactions. The latter enhances the forward production of $\bar{D}^0$, $D^-$, and $\Lambda_c$, which subsequently decay into final states containing muons and muon neutrinos. We show how the increase in the prompt muon flux due to intrinsic charm is accompanied by a corresponding enhancement in the prompt muon neutrino flux. We implement different intrinsic charm production models in \texttt{MCEq} to calculate the resulting lepton fluxes. We discuss the challenges of achieving predictions that are simultaneously consistent with both IceCube's high-energy atmospheric muon flux measurements and IceCube upper bounds on the prompt muon neutrino flux, and we quantify the resulting discrepancies. As possible solutions, we explore scaling of the unflavored meson contributions to the prompt atmospheric muon flux to assess how such adjustments can reconcile these differences. The tensions emphasized in our work call for a refinement of the hadronic interaction models, especially the production of unflavored mesons, and for new experimental data sensitive to unflavored meson and heavy flavor production with reliable estimates of the associated uncertainties. We suggest that the energy and zenith angle dependence of muon and neutrino flux ratios from future neutrino telescope measurements may help to disentangle different scenarios.</description>

      <title>Investigations on heavy quarkonium hybrid mesons with exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC}=2^{+-}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the heavy quarkonium hybrid mesons with exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC}=2^{+-}$ via QCD sum rule method. We construct the currents with three Lorentz indices and calculate the correlation functions up to dimension six at the leading order of $\alpha _{s}$. The states with $J^{PC}=2^{+-}$ are extracted by constructing the corresponding projection operators. The obtained results indicate that the masses of $2^{+-}$ $\bar{c}Gc$ and $\bar{b}Gb$ hybrid states are about $4.49~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $10.48~\mathrm{GeV}$, respectively. We suggest to search for $\bar{c}Gc$ hybrid meson with $J^{PC}=2^{+-}$ in $J/\psi f_{0,1,2}$ and $\chi_{c0,1,2} \omega$ final states.</description>

      <title>Probing the pair production of first-generation vector-like leptons at future $e^+e^-$ colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores the discovery potential of the first-generation weak isosinglet Vector-Like Leptons (VLLs), denoted by $E^\pm$, via pair production at future electron-positron colliders. Our analysis adopts a comprehensive framework that incorporates beam polarization configurations and leverages detailed detector simulations. We focus on two distinct multilepton signatures: the $2\ell + 2j + \slashed{E}_T$ and $3\ell + 2j + \slashed{E}_T$ final states ($\ell = e, \mu$). Both signatures arise from the decay $E^{\pm} \to Z e^{\pm} / W^{\pm} \nu_\ell$ and are distinguished by the decay patterns of the associated gauge bosons. By applying optimized selection criteria to both signal and background events, we establish exclusion sensitivities and discovery prospects across the VLL mass spectrum. Our findings demonstrate that, for integrated luminosities of $\SI{25}{fb^{-1}}$, $\SI{90}{fb^{-1}}$ and $\SI{1000}{fb^{-1}}$ at corresponding center-of-mass (c.m.) energies of $\SI{1}{TeV}$, $\SI{1.5}{TeV}$ and $\SI{3}{TeV}$, the accessible mass range extends to approximately $\SI{490}{GeV}$, $\SI{740}{GeV}$ and $\SI{1440}{GeV}$, which represents a substantially improvement over the detection limits of existing hadron collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Addicted to Flavour: 1976-2026</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I describe my activities in Flavour Physics from 1976 to 2026. However, this 50th anniversary is not the only motivation for this writing. The second reason is the 350th anniversary of the discovery of the first animalcula by van Leeuvanhoek in 1676. Flavour physics makes it possible to search for new animalcula at distance scales far shorter than those resolved by van Leeuwenhoek in 1676 and even shorter than those directly accessible at the Large Hadron Collider. Achieving this goal requires not only precise measurements of a wide variety of processes, but also equally precise theoretical calculations, both within the Standard Model (SM) and beyond it. In this respect, next-to-leading-order (NLO) and next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) QCD calculations of various Wilson coefficients in the SM and beyond it, in which I was involved for two decades, as well as reliable treatments of non-perturbative QCD effects, are indispensable. Equally important is the proper choice of observables that are best suited to revealing these new animalcula of particle physics. Moreover, in my view it is crucial to develop strategies for the search for New Physics (NP) that go beyond the global fits that are very popular today. While effective field theories such as WET and SMEFT are formulated in terms of Wilson coefficients of the relevant operators, with correlations characteristic of the SM and of specific NP scenarios, the most direct tests of the SM and its extensions are, in my opinion, correlations among different observables that are characteristic of particular new animalcula at work. Numerous colourful plots in this article illustrate this point. I hope that these ideas are clearly conveyed in my Flavour Autobiography, which also includes my memories of many conferences, workshops, and schools, as well as related anecdotes that are not always directly connected to physics.</description>

      <title>Compatibility of the Updated $(g-2)_\mu$, $(g-2)_e$ and PADME-Favored Couplings with the Preferred Region of ATOMKI X17</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We re-evaluate the viability of a kinetically mixed dark photon ($A^{\prime}$) as a solution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment $(g-2)\mu$ discrepancy and the ATOMKI nuclear anomalies near 17~MeV, using the final FNAL measurement and the latest theory predictions (BMW21, WP25). For $m_{A^{\prime}} = 17$~MeV, the allowed kinetic mixing parameter narrows to $\varepsilon_\mu = 7.03(58)\times10^{-4}$ (WP25). We then directly compare the allowed region for the muon and X17 bands to those preferred by the electron magnetic moment measurements. For the electron, we obtain $\varepsilon_e = 1.19(15)\times10^{-3}$ (Cs, 2018) and $\varepsilon_e = 0.69(15)\times10^{-3}$ (Rb, 2020), based on two recent measurements of the fine structure constant compared to the most recent experimental value determined using a one-electron quantum cyclotron. This study focuses on the protophobic vector interpretation of X17 and assumes $\varepsilon_\nu&lt;&lt;\varepsilon_l$. While a mild tension persists, we identify a narrow overlapping region, $6.8\times10^{-4} \lesssim \varepsilon \lesssim 9.6\times10^{-4}$, between recent PADME results, the NA64 exclusion, and within the 2$\sigma$ preferred coupling region given by the Rb 2020 determination of $\alpha_\varepsilon$. These results provide well-defined targets for future experimental searches and motivate further theoretical refinements, both of which will play a decisive role in assessing the validity of the ATOMKI anomaly claims. Of particular note is the fixed target X17 experiment to be conducted in Hall-B of Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Summer of 2026.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Singlet Fermion Dark Matter with a Scalar Portal: Connecting Higgs Phenomenology and Strong Electroweak Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13147v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a minimal extension of the Standard Model with a real singlet scalar and a singlet Dirac fermion acting as dark matter. Unlike a conventional singlet scalar setup, we assume that the singlet scalar does not acquire a vacuum expectation value at zero temperature. This decouples the scalar mixing angle from the Higgs-portal quartic coupling responsible for the strong first-order electroweak phase transition, allowing it to coexist with current collider and direct-detection constraints. The Higgs-singlet mixing is generated independently through a trilinear portal interaction. We check theoretical consistency conditions, various LHC limits on heavy scalar resonances, dark matter relic abundance, and direct detection bounds to delineate the viable parameter space. We perform a detailed analysis of the electroweak phase transition and show that a strong first-order transition is realized for a selected set of benchmark points. We further compute the resulting stochastic gravitational wave spectra and find that several scenarios yield signals potentially observable at future space-based interferometers. Our results establish a unified and testable framework that connects collider phenomenology, first-order electroweak phase transition, and the resulting production of gravitational waves, along with the dark matter phenomenology, all within a simple renormalizable extension of the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Testing the three massive neutrino paradigm: Constraints on Neutrino Properties and Interactions from Recent Experimental Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino physics offers unique insights into phenomena beyond the Standard Model (BSM). This thesis presents phenomenological investigations organized around three pillars: consolidation of the three-flavor oscillation paradigm, exploration of new physics viability, and precise determination of solar neutrino fluxes.
  The theoretical framework introduces massive neutrinos, leptonic mixing, and flavor transitions, followed by experimental results emphasizing Borexino and NOvA data analyses.
  The first pillar establishes the three-flavor framework through global analysis of solar, atmospheric, reactor, and accelerator data, providing updated determinations of mixing angles ($\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{13}$, $\theta_{23}$) and mass-squared differences ($\Delta m^2_{21}$, $\Delta m^2_{31}$), while quantifying ambiguities in mass ordering and $\theta_{23}$ octant.
  The second pillar investigates Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) with electrons and quarks, combining Borexino data with COHERENT's CE$\nu$NS measurements to establish bounds on propagation and detection couplings, excluding viable NSI parameter regions including potential LMA-D solutions.
  The third pillar advances solar neutrino physics through precision flux determinations, integrating pp-chain and CNO-cycle measurements. Results show preference for high-metallicity Standard Solar Models and incompatibility between $3+1$ mixing parameters favored by Gallium experiments and solar observations.
  This synthesis guides future experiments toward resolving mass ordering, CP violation, and dark sector interactions.</description>

      <title>Discriminating QCD Compton and Quark-Antiquark Annihilation Processes in $\gamma$ + Jets Using Interpretable Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how effectively final-state jet substructure can discriminate between QCD Compton and quark-antiquark annihilation processes from photon-jet production in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. Using infrared- and collinear-safe jet observables, multivariate classifiers -- boosted decision trees and multilayer perceptrons -- are trained on labeled quark- and gluon-initiated jets from dijet events and applied to photon-jet samples. Observables probing soft and wide-angle radiation, in particular jet multiplicity and jet girth, dominate the discrimination. The jet mass provides a complementary but weaker contribution, while the jet charge exhibits negligible discriminating power. A comparison of the two classifiers demonstrates that the achievable separation is limited primarily by QCD radiation effects rather than by classifier complexity. These findings quantify the extent to which information about the underlying hard process survives hadronization and realistic jet reconstruction, providing a physics-driven baseline for precision jet measurements in $pp$, $ep/$A, and heavy-ion collisions.</description>

Abstract: Neutrino oscillations continue to provide one of the most promising avenues for uncovering physics beyond the Standard Model. In particular, beyond-standard-model neutrino matter interactions may perturb neutrino oscillations in matter, leading to an observable signal in long baseline oscillation experiments. Moreover, such interactions can be a possible explanation of the rising tension between T2K and NOvA's $\delta_{\text{CP}}$ measurements. We examine IceCube DeepCore's sensitivity to these Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) by employing a model-independent NSI parameterization, and examine IceCube DeepCore's ability to comment on NSI being the cause of the T2K-NOvA $\delta_{\text{CP}}$ tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the possibility that supersymmetric structures may leave observable imprints in the stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background generated during the reheating era. To this end, we construct a phenomenological interaction vertex describing the coupling between a single inflaton and the D-term sectors of a pair of chiral and anti-chiral superfields. In contrast to the conventional Yukawa coupling between the inflaton and structureless matter fields, we find that the supersymmetry-preserving chiral multiplet structure leads to a substantial enhancement, by at least one order of magnitude, in the amplitude of the resulting GWs spectrum. Our results therefore suggest that the interplay between reheating-era stochastic GWs and supersymmetric phenomenology merits further exploration and development.</description>

Abstract: In nuclear and particle physics, reconciling sophisticated simulations with experimental data is vital for understanding complex systems like the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) generated in heavy-ion collisions. However, computational demands pose challenges, motivating using Gaussian Process emulators for efficient parameter extraction via Bayesian calibration. We conduct a comparative analysis of Gaussian Process emulators in heavy-ion physics to identify the most adept emulator for parameter extraction with minimal uncertainty. Our study contributes to advancing computational techniques in heavy-ion physics, enhancing our ability to interpret experimental data and understand QGP properties.</description>

Abstract: We develop a generative model for the nuclear matter equation of state at zero net baryon density using the Gaussian Process Regression method. We impose first-principles theoretical constraints from lattice QCD and hadron resonance gas at high- and low-temperature regions, respectively. By allowing the trained Gaussian Process Regression model to vary freely near the phase transition region, we generate random smooth cross-over equations of state with different speeds of sound that do not rely on specific parameterizations. We explore a collection of experimental observable dependencies on the generated equations of state, which paves the groundwork for future Bayesian inference studies to use experimental measurements from relativistic heavy-ion collisions to constrain the nuclear matter equation of state.</description>

      <title>Boundary topological orders of (4+1)d fermionic $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\mathrm{F}}$ SPT states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate (3+1)d topological orders in fermionic systems with an anomalous $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\mathrm{F}}$ symmetry, where its $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathrm{F}}$ subgroup is the fermion parity. Such an anomalous symmetry arises as the discrete subgroup of the chiral U(1) symmetry of $\nu$ copies of Weyl fermions of the same chirality. Inspired by the crystalline correspondence principle, we deform the anomalous $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^\mathrm{F}$ symmetry of (3+1)d Weyl fermion to the anomalous $C_N \times \mathbb{Z}_2^\mathrm{F}$ symmetry. Then we microscopically construct symmetry-preserving gapped boundary states of the closely-related (4+1)d $C_N\times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathrm{F}}$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT) state (with $C_N$ being the $N$-fold rotation), whenever it is possible. In particular, for $\nu=N$, we show that the (3+1)d symmetric gapped state admits a topological $\mathbb{Z}_4$ gauge theory description at low energy, and propose that a similar theory saturates the corresponding $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^\mathrm{F}$ anomaly. For $N \nmid \nu$, our construction admits no topological quantum field theory (TQFT) symmetric gapped state; while for $\nu=N/2$, we find a non-TQFT symmetric gapped state via stacking lower-dimensional (2+1)d non-discrete-gauge-theory topological order inhomogeneously. For other values of $\nu$, no symmetric gapped state is possible within our construction, which is consistent with the no-go theorem by Cordova-Ohmori.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity in early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lanczos algorithm offers a framework for constructing wave functions in closed and open quantum systems from their Hamiltonians. Since the early universe is inherently an open system, we employ this algorithm to investigate Krylov complexity across various cosmological phases: inflation, radiation domination (RD), and matter domination (MD). Our results highlight a clear distinction in Krylov complexity between the closed- and open-system methodologies. To accurately capture the influence of potentials during RD and MD, we examine a set of inflationary potentials, including the Higgs potential, $R^2$ inflation, and chaotic inflation, while incorporating violations of slow-roll conditions. This study is conducted in conformal time through the preheating stage. Numerically, we find that the evolution of Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy shows remarkable similarity across different potentials during RD and MD. Furthermore, we rigorously construct an open two-mode squeezed state using the second kind of Meixner polynomial. Based on this construction, we derive for the first time the evolution equations for the squeezing parameter $r_k$ and phase $\phi_k$ in terms of the scale factor. Our analysis indicates that dissipative effects lead to rapid decoherence-like behavior. In addition, we observe that the inflationary universe behaves as a strongly dissipative system, whereas during the RD and MD epochs the universe exhibits weak dissipative characteristics. This work opens new perspectives for studying the universe from a quantum-informational viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Strongly Coupled Sectors in Inflation: Gapless Theories and Unparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17840v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute correlation functions of the primordial density perturbations when they couple to a gapless, strongly coupled sector of spectator fields -- ``unparticles" -- during inflation. We first derive a four-point function of conformally coupled scalars for all kinematic configurations in de Sitter, which exchanges an unparticle at tree-level, by performing direct integration using the Mellin-Barnes method. To obtain inflationary bispectra and trispectra, we apply weight-shifting operators to the conformally coupled scalar correlator. We show that the correlators solve differential equations determined by the additional symmetries enjoyed by the unparticle propagator. Based on these differential equations, we are able to discuss the spinning-unparticle exchanges, focusing on two possible cases where the currents or the stress tensor of unparticles are coupled to inflatons, with the help of spin-raising operators. Finally, we study the phenomenology of the resulting shape functions. Depending on the value of the unparticle scaling dimension, we classify three characteristic shapes for the inflationary bispectra, including near-equilateral, near-orthogonal, and a novel shape which appears when the scaling dimensions are close to half-integers. More generally, we find that the leading order squeezed limits are insufficient to conclusively determine the detection of a light particle or unparticle. Only the full shapes of bispectra and trispectra can break this degeneracy.</description>

      <title>The neural networks with tensor weights and emergent fermionic Wick rules in the large-width limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05303v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study complex-valued neural network (CVNNs) with tensor-valued hidden-to-output weights within the framework of neural-network quantum field theory (NN-QFT). For standard CVNNs with scalar weights, we derive the generating functional and identify the exact Gaussian process that arises in the infinite-width limit, together with its associated effective quantum state. When the last-layer weights are promoted to Clifford-algebra-valued tensors, the network output becomes complex matrix-valued, and a fermion-like sign structure in the large-width correlation functions of the network output is induced. We show that, in the infinite-width limit, correlators with equal numbers of $f^{\dag}$ and $f$ obey fermionic Wick rules and can be written as determinants built from a scalar Euclidean kernel $S(x,y)=\langle f^{\dag}(x)f(y)\rangle$. This provides a sign-structured extension of NN-QFT at the level of Euclidean correlators and Feynman rules, even though a microscopic Grassmann path integral representation for the network parameters has not yet been constructed. Our analysis thus pushes the NN-QFT correspondence beyond purely bosonic Gaussian fields and suggests a possible route to encoding fermion-like symmetries in neural architectures for QFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>Stochastic-tail of the curvature perturbation in hybrid inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exponential-tail behaviours of the probability density function (PDF) of the primordial curvature perturbation are confirmed in the mild-waterfall variants of hybrid inflation with the use of the stochastic formalism of inflation. On top of these tails, effective upper bounds on the curvature perturbation are also observed, corresponding to the exact hilltop trajectory during the waterfall phase. We find that in the model where the leading and higher-order terms in the expansion of the inflaton potential around the critical point are fine-tuned to balance, this upper bound can be significantly reduced, even smaller than the primordial black hole (PBH) threshold, as a novel perturbation-reduction mechanism than the one proposed by Tada and Yamada. It makes PBH formation much difficult compared to the Gaussian or exponential-tail approximation. We also introduce Johnson's $S_U$-distribution as a useful fitting function for the PDF, which reveals a nonlinear mapping between the Gaussian field and the curvature perturbation.</description>

      <title>Dynamical backreaction of a mass-acquiring scalar field on first-order phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase transitions in the early Universe give rise to effective masses for massless fields in the symmetry-broken phase. We perform lattice simulations to study the dynamical impact of a mass-acquiring spectator field on the evolution of first-order phase transitions and the associated gravitational-wave production, while keeping the effective potential responsible for bubble nucleation fixed. In addition to the well-known friction effects, we identify a novel effect that significantly enhances the strength of first-order phase transitions. In contrast to the general scenario, although the effective potential governs the tunneling rate, the amplitude of the $\chi$ field is strongly suppressed inside the true vacuum bubble, resulting in a faster bubble expansion than predicted by the effective potential alone. The amplitude of the mass-acquiring field is highly suppressed in the true vacuum bubbles, resulting in additional release of vacuum energy that concentrate on the bubble walls. We further develop an analytical framework that not only explains our numerical results but can also be used to improve the estimation of gravitational-wave signals in related phase-transition scenarios.</description>

      <title>Crossing the phantom divide in scalar-tensor and vector-tensor theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DESI observations of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type-Ia supernova (SN Ia) data, suggest that the dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm DE}$ crosses the phantom divide from $w_{\rm DE} &lt; -1$ to $w_{\rm DE} &gt; -1$ at low redshifts. In shift-symmetric Horndeski and generalized Proca theories with luminal gravitational-wave speed and no direct couplings to dark matter, we show that such a phantom-divide crossing is generically difficult without theoretical pathologies. Breaking the shift symmetry in Horndeski theories allows this transition. We construct an explicit model with broken shift symmetry, in which the scalar field has a potential in addition to a Galileon self-interaction and a quadratic kinetic term. This model realizes the desired phantom-divide crossing at low redshifts without introducing ghosts and Laplacian instabilities.</description>

      <title>Environmentally-induced chaos: Extreme-mass-ratio systems of rotating black holes in astrophysical environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals, in which a stellar-mass object orbits a supermassive black hole, are prime sources of millihertz gravitational waves for upcoming space-based detectors. While most studies assume idealized vacuum backgrounds, realistic extreme-mass-ratio binaries are embedded in astrophysical environments such as accretion disks, stellar clusters, or dark matter spikes, disks, and halos, which can significantly alter the orbital dynamics. We explore bound geodesics around general-relativistic solutions describing rotating black holes surrounded by matter halos for the first time, mapping how environmental effects interfere with the spacetime symmetries of vacuum spinning (Kerr) black holes. In particular, we find that the loss of a Carter-like constant leads to geodesic non-integrability and the onset of chaos. This manifests through the formation of resonant islands and chaotic layers around transient orbital resonances in phase space--features that are otherwise completely absent in integrable Kerr geodesics. Resonant islands, which are extended, non-zero volume regions in phase space, encapsulate periodic orbit points. Non-integrability dictates that all geodesics inside the resonant island share the periodicity of the resonance. Thus, the lifespan of resonances around non-Kerr objects can be significantly enhanced beyond the predicted lifetime of Kerr resonances. Consequently, these effects can leave distinct imprints on gravitational-wave signals, with significant implications for gravitational-wave modeling and parameter inference of astrophysical extreme-mass-ratio inspirals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22632v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A finite formulation of quantum field theory based on a system of differential equations reminiscent of the Callan-Symanzik equations is discussed. This system of equations was previously formulated in the bare language. We rederive it in a fully renormalized language. For the latter, within a simple $\phi^4$ toy model, it is shown that with a specific choice of renormalization conditions - namely, the on-shell scheme for the renormalized mass - this class of finite renormalization prescriptions is equivalent to the standard renormalization-group equation written in the Callan-Symanzik-Ovsyannikov form.</description>

      <title>One-Loop Renormalization of Anisotropic Two-Scalar Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a basis--covariant one--loop renormalization framework for two interacting real scalars in $D=4-\epsilon$ with the most general two--derivative Lorentz--violating quadratic form, allowing anisotropic spatial gradients and direction--dependent kinetic mixing, together with general cubic and quartic interactions forming RG complete set of operators at one-loop. In dimensional regularization with minimal subtraction we compute the full set of one--loop UV divergences and obtain closed beta functions for quartic and cubic couplings, masses.
  The pole coefficients admit a universal spectral representation as angular averages over the direction--dependent eigenvalues and projectors of the UV kinetic matrix; all anisotropy dependence enters through a single universal kernel admitting two--particle phase--space interpretation. We classify fixed points and fixed manifolds and show, in particular, that anisotropy restricts the existence of the coupled Wilson--Fisher--type fixed point. When the cross--gradients are turned on the coefficients in beta functions are governed by six phase--space weights admitting interpretation in terms of encoding ``populations'' and ``coherences'' of the UV normal modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel semiclassical framework tailored to determine the scaling dimensions of heavy neutral composite operators in conformal field theories (CFTs) which are inaccessible with other current methodologies. It utilizes the state-operator correspondence to map the desired scaling dimensions to the semiclassical energy spectrum of periodic homogeneous field configurations on a cylinder. As concrete applications, we provide detailed analyses for the $\phi^4$ theory near four dimensions and $\phi^6$ near three dimensions, semiclassically determining the full spectrum of neutral operators in the traceless symmetric Lorentz representations. Our methodology is presented pedagogically and is readily applicable to a vast class of CFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the type-A conformal anomaly in $2n$ dimensions follows from standard Stora-Zumino descent, starting from the Euler invariant polynomial for the Euclidean conformal group $SO(2n+1,1)$ in $6d$, thereby placing type-A anomalies on the same footing as ordinary perturbative t Hooft anomalies. We discuss implications for anomaly inflow, and t Hooft anomaly matching for the full conformal group with a Wess-Zumino-Witten term. In 4d, this enables the construction of a dilaton effective action matching the full type-A $SO(5,1)$ conformal anomaly.</description>
