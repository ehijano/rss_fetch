      <title>Quantitative selection theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The point selection theorem says that the convex hull of any finite point set contains a point that lies in a positive proportion of the simplices determined by that set. This paper proves several new volumetric versions of this theorem which replace the points by sets of large volume, including the first volumetric selection theorem for $(d+1)$-tuples. As consequences, we significantly decrease the upper bound for the number of sets necessary in a volumetric weak $\epsilon$-net, from $O_d(\epsilon^{-d^2(d+3)^2/4})$ to $O_d(\epsilon^{-(d+1)})$, and substantially reduce the the piercing number for volumetric $(p,q)$-theorems.
  We also prove a volumetric version of the homogeneous point selection theorem. To do so, we introduce a volumetric same-type lemma and a new volumetric colorful Tverberg theorem.
  We prove all of our results for diameter as well as volume.</description>

      <title>Topological cones and positively polarizable hyperbolic norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part of this article, we study linear cones over totally ordered fields. We show that for each such cone there uniquely exists a universal vector space (called its spanned vector space) into which it embeds as a generating convex cone. Moreover, we investigate topologies on cones for which the natural cone operations are continuous, and study how these topologies carry over to the spanned vector space. In the second part, we deal with hyperbolic norms which satisfy a polarization identity and are defined on cones over the real numbers. We show that, under reasonable assumptions, such hyperbolic norms induce a Lorentzian inner product on the spanned vector space. Finally, we establish a link between completeness under the Wick rotation of a Lorentzian inner product and order-theoretic completeness.</description>

      <title>Geometric properties of a new hyperbolic type metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new distance function $\tilde{S}_{G,c}$ in metric space $(X,d)$ is introduced as \begin{align*} &amp;\tilde{S}_{G,c}(x,y)=\log{\left(1+\frac{cd(x,y)}{\sqrt{1+d(x)}\sqrt{1+d(y)}}\right)} \end{align*} for $x$, $y\in X$ and $c$ is an arbitrary positive real number. We find that $\tilde{S}_{G,c}$ is a metric for $c\ge 2$. In general, the condition $c\geq2$ can not be improved. In this paper we investigate some geometric properties of the metric $\tilde{S}_{G,c}$ including the comparison inequalities between this metric and the triangular ratio metric and the inclusion relation between some metric balls. We show the quasiconformality of a bilipschitz mapping in metric $\tilde{S}_{G,c}$ and the distortion property of the metric $\tilde{S}_{\partial\mathbb{B}^n,c}$ under M\"obius transformations of the unit ball.</description>

      <title>A Mixed-Gauge Caratheodory Measure Bridging Lebesgue Volume and Surface Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a one-parameter family of Borel regular measures on $\mathbb{R}^n$ that enhances Lebesgue measure by incorporating a scale-invariant penalty for codimension-1 boundary structures. Utilizing Carath\'eodory's outer measure construction with the mixed gauge $h_\lambda(r) = r^n + \lambda r^{n-1}$ for $\lambda &gt; 0$, the resulting measure $\mu_\lambda$ seamlessly combines $n$-dimensional volume with $(n-1)$-dimensional surface contributions in a single $\sigma$-additive framework. Key results include: (i) $\mu_\lambda$ is a metric outer measure, with all Borel sets measurable and Borel regular; (ii) the scaling property $\mu_\lambda(tE) = t^n \mu_{\lambda/t}(E)$ for $t &gt; 0$; (iii) quantitative comparability for bounded Lipschitz domains $\Omega$, where dimensional constants $c_n, C_n &gt; 0$ satisfy $c_n (|\Omega| + \lambda \mathcal{H}^{n-1}(\partial \Omega)) \leq \mu_\lambda(\Omega) \leq C_n (|\Omega| + \lambda \mathcal{H}^{n-1}(\partial \Omega))$, directly relating $\mu_\lambda$ to perimeter. This addresses Lebesgue measure's oversight of boundary complexity while preserving compatibility with the Carath\'eodory-Hausdorff paradigm. Potential applications span robust numerical integration on irregular domains, perimeter-regularized functionals in image and shape processing, and boundary-aware probabilistic modeling. Examples are provided in $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R}^2$, alongside links to Minkowski content and sets of finite perimeter. Open problems encompass optimal constants, coarea formulas in BV spaces, and extensions to rectifiable sets.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Fidelity for Functional Neural Network Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuroscientists face challenges in analyzing high-dimensional neural recording data of dense functional networks. Without ground-truth reference data, finding the best algorithm for recovering neurologically relevant networks remains an open question. We implemented hybrid quantum algorithms to construct functional networks and compared them with the results of documented classical techniques. We demonstrated that our quantum state fidelity can provide a competitive alternative to classical metrics by revealing distinct functional networks. Our results suggest that quantum computing offers a viable and potentially advantageous alternative for data-driven modeling in neuroscience, underscoring its broader applicability in high-dimensional graph inference and complex system analysis.</description>

      <title>On the Smallest Singular Value of Log-Concave Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be an $N\times n$ random matrix whose entries are coordinates of an isotropic log-concave random vector in $\mathbb{R}^{Nn}$. We prove sharp lower tail estimates for the smallest singular value of $A$ in the following cases: (1) when $N=n$ and $A$ is drawn from an unconditional distribution, with no independence assumption; (2) when the columns of $A$ are independent and $N\geq n$; (3) when $A$ is sufficiently tall, that is $N\geq (1+\lambda)n$ for any positive constant $\lambda$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we provide equivalent definitions for fractal geometric dimensions through dyadic cube constructions. Given a metric space $X$ with finite Assouad dimension, i.e., satisfying the doubling property, we show that the construction of systems of dyadic cubes by Hyt\"onen-Kairema is compatible with many dimensions. In particular, the Hausdorff, Minkowski, and Assouad dimensions can be equivalently expressed solely using dyadic cubes in the aforementioned system. The same is true for the Assouad spectrum, a collection of dimensions introduced by Fraser-Yu.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08396v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study tilings of the plane composed of two repeating tiles of different assigned areas relative to an arbitrary periodic lattice. We classify isoperimetric configurations (i.e., configurations with minimal length of the interfaces) both in the case of a fixed lattice or for an arbitrary periodic lattice. We find three different configurations depending on the ratio between the assigned areas of the two tiles and compute the isoperimetric profile. The three different configurations are composed of tiles with a different number of circular edges, moreover, different configurations exhibit a different optimal lattice. Finally, we raise some open problems related to our investigation.</description>

      <title>Fractal Zeta Functions and Complex Dimensions of Ahlfors Metric Measure Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While classical analysis dealt primarily with smooth spaces, much research has been done in the last half century on expanding the theory to the nonsmooth case. Metric Measure spaces are the natural setting for such analysis, and it is thus important to understand the geometry of subsets of these spaces. In this paper we will focus on the geometry of Ahlfors regular spaces, Metric Measure spaces with an additional regularity condition. Historically, fractals have been studied using different ideas of dimension which have all proven to be unsatisfactory to some degree. The theory of complex dimensions, developed by M.L. Lapidus and a number of collaborators, was developed in part to better understand fractality in the Euclidean case and seeks to overcome these problems. Of particular interest is the recent theory of complex dimensions in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces, as studied by M.L. Lapidus, G. Radunovi\'c, and D. Zubrini\'c, who introduced and studied the properties of the distance zeta function $\zeta_A$. We will show that this theory of complex dimensions naturally generalizes to the case of Ahlfors regular spaces, as the distance zeta function can be modified to these spaces and all of its main properties carry over. We also provide a selection of examples in Ahlfors spaces, as well as hints that the theory can be expanded to a more general setting.</description>

Abstract: A paper torus is an embedded polyhedral torus that is isometric to a flat torus in the intrinsic sense.
  We prove that there does not exist a paper torus with $7$ vertices,
  and that there does exist a paper torus with $8$ vertices.
  This settles the question of the minimum number of
  vertices needed for a paper torus.</description>

      <title>On integer distance sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10821v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new approach to address some classical questions concerning the size and structure of integer distance sets. Our main result is that any integer distance set in the Euclidean plane is either very sparse or has all but an exceedingly small proportion of its points lying on a single line or circle. From this, we deduce a near-optimal lower bound on the diameter of any non-collinear integer distance set of size $n$ and a strong upper bound on the size of any integer distance set in $[-N,N]^2$ with no three points on a line and no four points on a circle.</description>

      <title>Convergence order of the quantization error for self-affine measures on Lalley-Gatzouras carpets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06875v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $E$ be a Lalley-Gatzouras carpet determined by a set of contractive affine mappings $\{f_{ij}\}_{(i,j)\in G}$. We study the asymptotics of quantization error for the self-affine measures $\mu$ on $E$. We prove that the upper and lower quantization coefficient for $\mu$ are both bounded away from zero and infinity in the exact quantization dimension. This significantly generalizes the previous work concerning the quantization for self-affine measures on Bedford-McMullen carpets. The new ingredients lie in the method to bound the quantization error for $\mu$ from below and that to construct auxiliary measures by applying Prohorov's theorem.</description>
