      <title>Strategic A/B testing via Maximum Probability-driven Two-armed Bandit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting a minor average treatment effect is a major challenge in large-scale applications, where even minimal improvements can have a significant economic impact. Traditional methods, reliant on normal distribution-based or expanded statistics, often fail to identify such minor effects because of their inability to handle small discrepancies with sufficient sensitivity. This work leverages a counterfactual outcome framework and proposes a maximum probability-driven two-armed bandit (TAB) process by weighting the mean volatility statistic, which controls Type I error. The implementation of permutation methods further enhances the robustness and efficacy. The established strategic central limit theorem (SCLT) demonstrates that our approach yields a more concentrated distribution under the null hypothesis and a less concentrated one under the alternative hypothesis, greatly improving statistical power. The experimental results indicate a significant improvement in the A/B testing, highlighting the potential to reduce experimental costs while maintaining high statistical power.</description>

      <title>Adjoint Schr\"odinger Bridge Sampler</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational methods for learning to sample from the Boltzmann distribution -- where the target distribution is known only up to an unnormalized energy function -- have advanced significantly recently. Due to the lack of explicit target samples, however, prior diffusion-based methods, known as diffusion samplers, often require importance-weighted estimation or complicated learning processes. Both trade off scalability with extensive evaluations of the energy and model, thereby limiting their practical usage. In this work, we propose Adjoint Schr\"odinger Bridge Sampler (ASBS), a new diffusion sampler that employs simple and scalable matching-based objectives yet without the need to estimate target samples during training. ASBS is grounded on a mathematical model -- the Schr\"odinger Bridge -- which enhances sampling efficiency via kinetic-optimal transportation. Through a new lens of stochastic optimal control theory, we demonstrate how SB-based diffusion samplers can be learned at scale via Adjoint Matching and prove convergence to the global solution. Notably, ASBS generalizes the recent Adjoint Sampling (Havens et al., 2025) to arbitrary source distributions by relaxing the so-called memoryless condition that largely restricts the design space. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ASBS on sampling from classical energy functions, amortized conformer generation, and molecular Boltzmann distributions.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Invariance Modeling of Multi-Environment Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Invariant prediction [Peters et al., 2016] analyzes feature/outcome data from multiple environments to identify invariant features - those with a stable predictive relationship to the outcome. Such features support generalization to new environments and help reveal causal mechanisms. Previous methods have primarily tackled this problem through hypothesis testing or regularized optimization. Here we develop Bayesian Invariant Prediction (BIP), a probabilistic model for invariant prediction. BIP encodes the indices of invariant features as a latent variable and recover them by posterior inference. Under the assumptions of Peters et al. [2016], the BIP posterior targets the true invariant features. We prove that the posterior is consistent and that greater environment heterogeneity leads to faster posterior contraction. To handle many features, we design an efficient variational approximation called VI-BIP. In simulations and real data, we find that BIP and VI-BIP are more accurate and scalable than existing methods for invariant prediction.</description>

      <title>CN-SBM: Categorical Block Modelling For Primary and Residual Copy Number Variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cancer is a genetic disorder whose clonal evolution can be monitored by tracking noisy genome-wide copy number variants. We introduce the Copy Number Stochastic Block Model (CN-SBM), a probabilistic framework that jointly clusters samples and genomic regions based on discrete copy number states using a bipartite categorical block model. Unlike models relying on Gaussian or Poisson assumptions, CN-SBM respects the discrete nature of CNV calls and captures subpopulation-specific patterns through block-wise structure. Using a two-stage approach, CN-SBM decomposes CNV data into primary and residual components, enabling detection of both large-scale chromosomal alterations and finer aberrations. We derive a scalable variational inference algorithm for application to large cohorts and high-resolution data. Benchmarks on simulated and real datasets show improved model fit over existing methods. Applied to TCGA low-grade glioma data, CN-SBM reveals clinically relevant subtypes and structured residual variation, aiding patient stratification in survival analysis. These results establish CN-SBM as an interpretable, scalable framework for CNV analysis with direct relevance for tumor heterogeneity and prognosis.</description>

      <title>AICO: Feature Significance Tests for Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The opacity of many supervised learning algorithms remains a key challenge, hindering scientific discovery and limiting broader deployment -- particularly in high-stakes domains. This paper develops model- and distribution-agnostic significance tests to assess the influence of input features in any regression or classification algorithm. Our method evaluates a feature's incremental contribution to model performance by masking its values across samples. Under the null hypothesis, the distribution of performance differences across a test set has a non-positive median. We construct a uniformly most powerful, randomized sign test for this median, yielding exact p-values for assessing feature significance and confidence intervals with exact coverage for estimating population-level feature importance. The approach requires minimal assumptions, avoids model retraining or auxiliary models, and remains computationally efficient even for large-scale, high-dimensional settings. Experiments on synthetic tasks validate its statistical and computational advantages, and applications to real-world data illustrate its practical utility.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel machine learning approach to compute the optimal transport map between two continuous distributions from their unpaired samples, based on the DeepParticle methods. The proposed method leads to a min-min optimization during training and does not impose any restriction on the network structure. Theoretically we establish a weak convergence guarantee and a quantitative error bound between the learned map and the optimal transport map. Our numerical experiments validate the theoretical results and the effectiveness of the new approach, particularly on real-world tasks.</description>

      <title>Minimax Optimal Two-Stage Algorithm For Moment Estimation Under Covariate Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Covariate shift occurs when the distribution of input features differs between the training and testing phases. In covariate shift, estimating an unknown function's moment is a classical problem that remains under-explored, despite its common occurrence in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the minimax lower bound of the problem when the source and target distributions are known. To achieve the minimax optimal bound (up to a logarithmic factor), we propose a two-stage algorithm. Specifically, it first trains an optimal estimator for the function under the source distribution, and then uses a likelihood ratio reweighting procedure to calibrate the moment estimator. In practice, the source and target distributions are typically unknown, and estimating the likelihood ratio may be unstable. To solve this problem, we propose a truncated version of the estimator that ensures double robustness and provide the corresponding upper bound. Extensive numerical studies on synthetic examples confirm our theoretical findings and further illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Test of partial effects for Frechet regression on Bures-Wasserstein manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel test for assessing partial effects in Frechet regression on Bures Wasserstein manifolds. Our approach employs a sample splitting strategy: the first subsample is used to fit the Frechet regression model, yielding estimates of the covariance matrices and their associated optimal transport maps, while the second subsample is used to construct the test statistic. We prove that this statistic converges in distribution to a weighted mixture of chi squared components, where the weights correspond to the eigenvalues of an integral operator defined by an appropriate RKHS kernel. We establish that our procedure achieves the nominal asymptotic size and demonstrate that its worst-case power converges uniformly to one. Through extensive simulations and a real data application, we illustrate the test's finite-sample accuracy and practical utility.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based population inference of LISA's Galactic binaries: Bypassing the global fit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to detect thousands of individually resolved gravitational wave sources, overlapping in time and frequency, on top of unresolved astrophysical and/or primordial backgrounds. Disentangling resolved sources from backgrounds and extracting their parameters in a computationally intensive "global fit" is normally regarded as a necessary step toward reconstructing the properties of the underlying astrophysical populations. Here, we show that it is possible to infer the properties of the most numerous population of LISA sources - Galactic double white dwarfs - directly from the frequency (or, equivalently, time) strain series, by using a simulation-based approach that bypasses the global fit entirely. By training a normalizing flow on a custom-designed compression of simulated LISA frequency series from the Galactic double white dwarf population, we demonstrate how to infer the posterior distribution of population parameters (e.g., mass function, frequency, and spatial distributions). This allows for extracting information on the population parameters from both resolved and unresolved sources simultaneously and in a computationally efficient manner. Our approach to target population properties directly can be readily extended to other source classes (e.g., massive and stellar-mass black holes, extreme mass ratio inspirals), provided fast simulations are available, and to scenarios involving non-Gaussian or non-stationary noise (e.g., data gaps).</description>

      <title>Exploration Behavior of Untrained Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploration remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in environments with sparse or adversarial reward structures. In this work, we study how the architecture of deep neural policies implicitly shapes exploration before training. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate strategies for generating ballistic or diffusive trajectories from untrained policies in a toy model. Using the theory of infinite-width networks and a continuous-time limit, we show that untrained policies return correlated actions and result in non-trivial state-visitation distributions. We discuss the distributions of the corresponding trajectories for a standard architecture, revealing insights into inductive biases for tackling exploration. Our results establish a theoretical and experimental framework for using policy initialization as a design tool to understand exploration behavior in early training.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Link Between RLHF and Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values has recently garnered significant attention, with prominent examples including the canonical yet costly Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and the simple Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In this work, we demonstrate that both RLHF and DPO can be interpreted from the perspective of mutual information (MI) maximization, uncovering a profound connection to contrastive learning. Within this framework, both RLHF and DPO can be viewed as methods that perform contrastive learning based on the positive and negative samples derived from the base model, leveraging the Donsker-Varadhan (DV) lower bound on MI (equivalently, the MINE estimator). This paradigm further explains why RLHF may not intrinsically incentivize reasoning capacities in LLMs beyond what is already present in the base model. Building on this perspective, we replace the DV/MINE bound with the Jensen-Shannon MI estimator and propose Mutual Information Optimization (MIO). Comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that MIO mitigates the late-stage decline in chosen-likelihood observed in DPO, achieving competitive or superior performance across various challenging reasoning and mathematical benchmarks. We will release the model and code upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Are Fast Methods Stable in Adversarially Robust Transfer Learning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transfer learning is often used to decrease the computational cost of model training, as fine-tuning a model allows a downstream task to leverage the features learned from the pre-training dataset and quickly adapt them to a new task. This is particularly useful for achieving adversarial robustness, as adversarially training models from scratch is very computationally expensive. However, high robustness in transfer learning still requires adversarial training during the fine-tuning phase, which requires up to an order of magnitude more time than standard fine-tuning. In this work, we revisit the use of the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) in robust transfer learning to improve the computational cost of adversarial fine-tuning. We surprisingly find that FGSM is much more stable in adversarial fine-tuning than when training from scratch. In particular, FGSM fine-tuning does not suffer from any issues with catastrophic overfitting at standard perturbation budgets of $\varepsilon=4$ or $\varepsilon=8$. This stability is further enhanced with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, where FGSM remains stable even up to $\varepsilon=32$ for linear probing. We demonstrate how this stability translates into performance across multiple datasets. Compared to fine-tuning with the more commonly used method of projected gradient descent (PGD), on average, FGSM only loses 0.39% and 1.39% test robustness for $\varepsilon=4$ and $\varepsilon=8$ while using $4\times$ less training time. Surprisingly, FGSM may not only be a significantly more efficient alternative to PGD in adversarially robust transfer learning but also a well-performing one.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Modeling and Architecture Optimization: Review and Unified Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation-based problems involving mixed-variable inputs frequently feature domains that are hierarchical, conditional, heterogeneous, or tree-structured. These characteristics pose challenges for data representation, modeling, and optimization. This paper reviews extensive literature on these structured input spaces and proposes a unified framework that generalizes existing approaches. In this framework, input variables may be continuous, integer, or categorical. A variable is described as meta if its value governs the presence of other decreed variables, enabling the modeling of conditional and hierarchical structures.
  We further introduce the concept of partially-decreed variables, whose activation depends on contextual conditions. To capture these inter-variable hierarchical relationships, we introduce design space graphs, combining principles from feature modeling and graph theory. This allows the definition of general hierarchical domains suitable for describing complex system architectures. The framework supports the use of surrogate models over such domains and integrates hierarchical kernels and distances for efficient modeling and optimization. The proposed methods are implemented in the open-source Surrogate Modeling Toolbox (SMT 2.0), and their capabilities are demonstrated through applications in Bayesian optimization for complex system design, including a case study in green aircraft architecture.</description>

      <title>A hierarchical Vovk-Azoury-Warmuth forecaster with discounting for online regression in RKHS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of online regression with the unconstrained quadratic loss against a time-varying sequence of functions from a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). Recently, Jacobsen and Cutkosky (2024) introduced a discounted Vovk-Azoury-Warmuth (DVAW) forecaster that achieves optimal dynamic regret in the finite-dimensional case. In this work, we lift their approach to the non-parametric domain by synthesizing the DVAW framework with a random feature approximation. We propose a fully adaptive, hierarchical algorithm, which we call H-VAW-D (Hierarchical Vovk-Azoury-Warmuth with Discounting), that learns both the discount factor and the number of random features. We prove that this algorithm, which has a per-iteration computational complexity of $O(T\ln T)$, achieves an expected dynamic regret of $O(T^{2/3}P_T^{1/3} + \sqrt{T}\ln T)$, where $P_T$ is the functional path length of a comparator sequence.</description>

      <title>Diversity by Design: Addressing Mode Collapse Improves scRNA-seq Perturbation Modeling on Well-Calibrated Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent benchmarks reveal that models for single-cell perturbation response are often outperformed by simply predicting the dataset mean. We trace this anomaly to a metric artifact: control-referenced deltas and unweighted error metrics reward mode collapse whenever the control is biased or the biological signal is sparse. Large-scale \textit{in silico} simulations and analysis of two real-world perturbation datasets confirm that shared reference shifts, not genuine biological change, drives high performance in these evaluations. We introduce differentially expressed gene (DEG)-aware metrics, weighted mean-squared error (WMSE) and weighted delta $R^{2}$ ($R^{2}_{w}(\Delta)$) with respect to all perturbations, that measure error in niche signals with high sensitivity. We further introduce negative and positive performance baselines to calibrate these metrics. With these improvements, the mean baseline sinks to null performance while genuine predictors are correctly rewarded. Finally, we show that using WMSE as a loss function reduces mode collapse and improves model performance.</description>

      <title>Cost-effective Reduced-Order Modeling via Bayesian Active Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning surrogates have been developed to accelerate solving systems dynamics of complex processes in different science and engineering applications. To faithfully capture governing systems dynamics, these methods rely on large training datasets, hence restricting their applicability in real-world problems. In this work, we propose BayPOD-AL, an active learning framework based on an uncertainty-aware Bayesian proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) approach, which aims to effectively learn reduced-order models from high-fidelity full-order models representing complex systems. Experimental results on predicting the temperature evolution over a rod demonstrate BayPOD-AL's effectiveness in suggesting the informative data and reducing computational cost related to constructing a training dataset compared to other uncertainty-guided active learning strategies. Furthermore, we demonstrate BayPOD-AL's generalizability and efficiency by evaluating its performance on a dataset of higher temporal resolution than the training dataset.</description>

      <title>VERA: Variational Inference Framework for Jailbreaking Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of API-only access to state-of-the-art LLMs highlights the need for effective black-box jailbreak methods to identify model vulnerabilities in real-world settings. Without a principled objective for gradient-based optimization, most existing approaches rely on genetic algorithms, which are limited by their initialization and dependence on manually curated prompt pools. Furthermore, these methods require individual optimization for each prompt, failing to provide a comprehensive characterization of model vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we introduce VERA: Variational infErence fRamework for jAilbreaking. VERA casts black-box jailbreak prompting as a variational inference problem, training a small attacker LLM to approximate the target LLM's posterior over adversarial prompts. Once trained, the attacker can generate diverse, fluent jailbreak prompts for a target query without re-optimization. Experimental results show that VERA achieves strong performance across a range of target LLMs, highlighting the value of probabilistic inference for adversarial prompt generation.</description>

      <title>DistShap: Scalable GNN Explanations with Distributed Shapley Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growing adoption of graph neural networks (GNNs), explaining their predictions has become increasingly important. However, attributing predictions to specific edges or features remains computationally expensive. For example, classifying a node with 100 neighbors using a 3-layer GNN may involve identifying important edges from millions of candidates contributing to the prediction. To address this challenge, we propose DistShap, a parallel algorithm that distributes Shapley value-based explanations across multiple GPUs. DistShap operates by sampling subgraphs in a distributed setting, executing GNN inference in parallel across GPUs, and solving a distributed least squares problem to compute edge importance scores. DistShap outperforms most existing GNN explanation methods in accuracy and is the first to scale to GNN models with millions of features by using up to 128 GPUs on the NERSC Perlmutter supercomputer.</description>

      <title>General Autonomous Cybersecurity Defense: Learning Robust Policies for Dynamic Topologies and Diverse Attackers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the face of evolving cyber threats such as malware, ransomware and phishing, autonomous cybersecurity defense (ACD) systems have become essential for real-time threat detection and response with optional human intervention. However, existing ACD systems rely on limiting assumptions, particularly the stationarity of the underlying network dynamics. In real-world scenarios, network topologies can change due to actions taken by attackers or defenders, system failures, or time evolution of networks, leading to failures in the adaptive capabilities of current defense agents. Moreover, many agents are trained on static environments, resulting in overfitting to specific topologies, which hampers their ability to generalize to out-of-distribution network topologies. This work addresses these challenges by exploring methods for developing agents to learn generalizable policies across dynamic network environments -- general ACD (GACD).</description>

      <title>Generalized Linear Mode Connectivity for Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the geometry of neural network loss landscapes is a central question in deep learning, with implications for generalization and optimization. A striking phenomenon is linear mode connectivity (LMC), where independently trained models can be connected by low- or zero-loss paths, despite appearing to lie in separate loss basins. However, this is often obscured by symmetries in parameter space -- such as neuron permutations -- which make functionally equivalent models appear dissimilar. Prior work has predominantly focused on neuron re-ordering through permutations, but such approaches are limited in scope and fail to capture the richer symmetries exhibited by modern architectures such as Transformers. In this work, we introduce a unified framework that captures four symmetry classes: permutations, semi-permutations, orthogonal transformations, and general invertible maps -- broadening the set of valid reparameterizations and subsuming many previous approaches as special cases. Crucially, this generalization enables, for the first time, the discovery of low- and zero-barrier linear interpolation paths between independently trained Vision Transformers and GPT-2 models. These results reveal deeper structure in the loss landscape and underscore the importance of symmetry-aware analysis for understanding model space geometry.</description>

      <title>Robust Tensor Completion via Gradient Tensor Nulclear L1-L2 Norm for Traffic Data Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In real-world scenarios, spatiotemporal traffic data frequently experiences dual degradation from missing values and noise caused by sensor malfunctions and communication failures. Therefore, effective data recovery methods are essential to ensure the reliability of downstream data-driven applications. while classical tensor completion methods have been widely adopted, they are incapable of modeling noise, making them unsuitable for complex scenarios involving simultaneous data missingness and noise interference. Existing Robust Tensor Completion (RTC) approaches offer potential solutions by separately modeling the actual tensor data and noise. However, their effectiveness is often constrained by the over-relaxation of convex rank surrogates and the suboptimal utilization of local consistency, leading to inadequate model accuracy. To address these limitations, we first introduce the tensor L1-L2 norm, a novel non-convex tensor rank surrogate that functions as an effective low-rank representation tool. Leveraging an advanced feature fusion strategy, we further develop the gradient tensor L1-L2 norm by incorporating the tensor L1-L2 norm in the gradient domain. By integrating the gradient tensor nuclear L1-L2 norm into the RTC framework, we propose the Robust Tensor Completion via Gradient Tensor Nuclear L1-L2 Norm (RTC-GTNLN) model, which not only fully exploits both global low-rankness and local consistency without trade-off parameter, but also effectively handles the dual degradation challenges of missing data and noise in traffic data. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the RTC-GTNLN model consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in complex recovery scenarios involving simultaneous missing values and noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern methods for explainable machine learning are designed to describe how models map inputs to outputs--without deep consideration of how these explanations will be used in practice. This paper argues that explanations should be designed and evaluated with a specific end in mind. We describe how to formalize this end in a framework based in statistical decision theory. We show how this functionally-grounded approach can be applied across diverse use cases, such as clinical decision support, providing recourse, or debugging. We demonstrate its use to characterize the maximum "boost" in performance on a particular task that an explanation could provide an idealized decision-maker, preventing misuse due to ambiguity by forcing researchers to specify concrete use cases that can be analyzed in light of models of expected explanation use. We argue that evaluation should meld theoretical and empirical perspectives on the value of explanation, and contribute definitions that span these perspectives.</description>

      <title>Doubly robust estimation of causal effects for random object outcomes with continuous treatments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal inference is central to statistics and scientific discovery, enabling researchers to identify cause-and-effect relationships beyond associations. While traditionally studied within Euclidean spaces, contemporary applications increasingly involve complex, non-Euclidean data structures that reside in abstract metric spaces, known as random objects, such as images, shapes, networks, and distributions. This paper introduces a novel framework for causal inference with continuous treatments applied to non-Euclidean data. To address the challenges posed by the lack of linear structures, we leverage Hilbert space embeddings of the metric spaces to facilitate Fr\'echet mean estimation and causal effect mapping. Motivated by a study on the impact of exposure to fine particulate matter on age-at-death distributions across U.S. counties, we propose a nonparametric, doubly-debiased causal inference approach for outcomes as random objects with continuous treatments. Our framework can accommodate moderately high-dimensional vector-valued confounders and derive efficient influence functions for estimation to ensure both robustness and interpretability. We establish rigorous asymptotic properties of the cross-fitted estimators and employ conformal inference techniques for counterfactual outcome prediction. Validated through numerical experiments and applied to real-world environmental data, our framework extends causal inference methodologies to complex data structures, broadening its applicability across scientific disciplines.</description>

      <title>Deep neural networks can provably solve Bellman equations for Markov decision processes without the curse of dimensionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete time stochastic optimal control problems and Markov decision processes (MDPs) are fundamental models for sequential decision-making under uncertainty and as such provide the mathematical framework underlying reinforcement learning theory. A central tool for solving MDPs is the Bellman equation and its solution, the so-called $Q$-function. In this article, we construct deep neural network (DNN) approximations for $Q$-functions associated to MDPs with infinite time horizon and finite control set $A$. More specifically, we show that if the the payoff function and the random transition dynamics of the MDP can be suitably approximated by DNNs with leaky rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation, then the solutions $Q_d\colon \mathbb R^d\to \mathbb R^{|A|}$, $d\in \mathbb{N}$, of the associated Bellman equations can also be approximated in the $L^2$-sense by DNNs with leaky ReLU activation whose numbers of parameters grow at most polynomially in both the dimension $d\in \mathbb{N}$ of the state space and the reciprocal $1/\varepsilon$ of the prescribed error $\varepsilon\in (0,1)$. Our proof relies on the recently introduced full-history recursive multilevel fixed-point (MLFP) approximation scheme.</description>

      <title>FuzzCoh: Robust Canonical Coherence-Based Fuzzy Clustering of Multivariate Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain cognitive and sensory functions are often associated with electrophysiological activity at specific frequency bands. Clustering multivariate time series (MTS) data like EEGs is important for understanding brain functions but challenging due to complex non-stationary cross-dependencies, gradual transitions between cognitive states, noisy measurements, and ambiguous cluster boundaries. To address these issues, we develop a robust fuzzy clustering framework in the spectral domain. Our method leverages Kendall's tau-based canonical coherence, which extracts meaningful frequency-specific monotonic relationships between groups of channels or regions. KenCoh effectively captures dominant coherence structures while remaining robust against outliers and noise, making it suitable for real EEG datasets that typically contain artifacts. Our method first projects each MTS object onto vectors derived from the KenCoh estimates (i.e, canonical directions), which capture relevant information on the connectivity structure of oscillatory signals in predefined frequency bands. These spectral features are utilized to determine clusters of epochs using a fuzzy partitioning strategy, accommodating gradual transitions and overlapping class structure. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to EEG data where latent cognitive states such as alertness and drowsiness exhibit frequency-specific dynamics and ambiguity. Our method captures both spectral and spatial features by locating the frequency-dependent structure and brain functional connectivity. Built on the KenCoh framework for fuzzy clustering, it handles the complexity of high-dimensional time series data and is broadly applicable to domains such as neuroscience, wearable sensing, environmental monitoring, and finance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new anomaly detection method called kernel outlier detection (KOD) is proposed. It is designed to address challenges of outlier detection in high-dimensional settings. The aim is to overcome limitations of existing methods, such as dependence on distributional assumptions or on hyperparameters that are hard to tune. KOD starts with a kernel transformation, followed by a projection pursuit approach. Its novelties include a new ensemble of directions to search over, and a new way to combine results of different direction types. This provides a flexible and lightweight approach for outlier detection. Our empirical evaluations illustrate the effectiveness of KOD on three small datasets with challenging structures, and on four large benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>Feature-Wise Mixing for Mitigating Contextual Bias in Predictive Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bias in predictive machine learning (ML) models is a fundamental challenge due to the skewed or unfair outcomes produced by biased models. Existing mitigation strategies rely on either post-hoc corrections or rigid constraints. However, emerging research claims that these techniques can limit scalability and reduce generalizability. To address this, this paper introduces a feature-wise mixing framework to mitigate contextual bias. This was done by redistributing feature representations across multiple contextual datasets. To assess feature-wise mixing's effectiveness, four ML classifiers were trained using cross-validation and evaluated with bias-sensitive loss functions, including disparity metrics and mean squared error (MSE), which served as a standard measure of predictive performance. The proposed method achieved an average bias reduction of 43.35% and a statistically significant decrease in MSE across all classifiers trained on mixed datasets. Additionally, benchmarking against established bias mitigation techniques found that feature-wise mixing consistently outperformed SMOTE oversampling and demonstrated competitive effectiveness without requiring explicit bias attribute identification. Feature-wise mixing efficiently avoids the computational overhead typically associated with fairness-aware learning algorithms. Future work could explore applying feature-wise mixing for real-world fields where accurate predictions are necessary.</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithms for Learning and Compressing Monophonic Halfspaces in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abstract notions of convexity over the vertices of a graph, and corresponding notions of halfspaces, have recently gained attention from the machine learning community. In this work we study monophonic halfspaces, a notion of graph halfspaces defined through closure under induced paths. Our main result is a $2$-satisfiability based decomposition theorem, which allows one to represent monophonic halfspaces as a disjoint union of certain vertex subsets. Using this decomposition, we achieve efficient and (nearly) optimal algorithms for various learning problems, such as teaching, active, and online learning. Most notably, we obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for empirical risk minimization. Independently of the decomposition theorem, we obtain an efficient, stable, and proper sample compression scheme. This makes monophonic halfspaces efficiently learnable with proper learners and linear error rate $1/\varepsilon$ in the realizable PAC setting. Our results answer open questions from the literature, and show a stark contrast with geodesic halfspaces, for which most of the said learning problems are NP-hard.</description>

      <title>Not All Explanations for Deep Learning Phenomena Are Equally Valuable</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing a better understanding of surprising or counterintuitive phenomena has constituted a significant portion of deep learning research in recent years. These include double descent, grokking, and the lottery ticket hypothesis -- among many others. Works in this area often develop ad hoc hypotheses attempting to explain these observed phenomena on an isolated, case-by-case basis. This position paper asserts that, in many prominent cases, there is little evidence to suggest that these phenomena appear in real-world applications and these efforts may be inefficient in driving progress in the broader field. Consequently, we argue against viewing them as isolated puzzles that require bespoke resolutions or explanations. However, despite this, we suggest that deep learning phenomena do still offer research value by providing unique settings in which we can refine our broad explanatory theories of more general deep learning principles. This position is reinforced by analyzing the research outcomes of several prominent examples of these phenomena from the recent literature. We revisit the current norms in the research community in approaching these problems and propose practical recommendations for future research, aiming to ensure that progress on deep learning phenomena is well aligned with the ultimate pragmatic goal of progress in the broader field of deep learning.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Self-Supervised Learning for the Discovery of Solution Singularity for Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The appearance of singularities in the function of interest constitutes a fundamental challenge in scientific computing. It can significantly undermine the effectiveness of numerical schemes for function approximation, numerical integration, and the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs), etc. The problem becomes more sophisticated if the location of the singularity is unknown, which is often encountered in solving PDEs. Detecting the singularity is therefore critical for developing efficient adaptive methods to reduce computational costs in various applications. In this paper, we consider singularity detection in a purely data-driven setting. Namely, the input only contains given data, such as the vertex set from a mesh. To overcome the limitation of the raw unlabeled data, we propose a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for estimating the location of the singularity. A key component is a filtering procedure as the pretext task in SSL, where two filtering methods are presented, based on $k$ nearest neighbors and kernel density estimation, respectively. We provide numerical examples to illustrate the potential pathological or inaccurate results due to the use of raw data without filtering. Various experiments are presented to demonstrate the ability of the proposed approach to deal with input perturbation, label corruption, and different kinds of singularities such interior circle, boundary layer, concentric semicircles, etc.</description>

      <title>Sampling and Identity-Testing Without Approximate Tensorization of Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Certain tasks in high-dimensional statistics become easier when the underlying distribution satisfies a local-to-global property called approximate tensorization of entropy (ATE). For example, the Glauber dynamics Markov chain of an ATE distribution mixes fast and can produce approximate samples in a small amount of time, since such a distribution satisfies a modified log-Sobolev inequality. Moreover, identity-testing for an ATE distribution requires few samples if the tester is given coordinate conditional access to the unknown distribution, as shown by Blanca, Chen, \v{S}tefankovi\v{c}, and Vigoda (COLT 2023).
  A natural class of distributions that do not satisfy ATE consists of mixtures of (few) distributions that do satisfy ATE. We study the complexity of identity-testing and sampling for these distributions. Our main results are the following:
  1. We show fast mixing of Glauber dynamics from a data-based initialization, with optimal sample complexity, for mixtures of distributions satisfying modified log-Sobolev inequalities. This extends work of Huang, Koehler, Lee, Mohanty, Rajaraman, Vuong, and Wu (STOC 2025, COLT 2025) for mixtures of distributions satisfying Poincar\'e inequalities.
  2. Answering an open question posed by Blanca et al., we give efficient identity-testers for mixtures of ATE distributions in the coordinate-conditional sampling access model. We also give some simplifications and improvements to the original algorithm of Blanca et al.</description>

      <title>Overparametrized models with posterior drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of posterior drift on out-of-sample forecasting accuracy in overparametrized machine learning models. We document the loss in performance when the loadings of the data generating process change between the training and testing samples. This matters crucially in settings in which regime changes are likely to occur, for instance, in financial markets. Applied to equity premium forecasting, our results underline the sensitivity of a market timing strategy to sub-periods and to the bandwidth parameters that control the complexity of the model. For the average investor, we find that focusing on holding periods of 15 years can generate very heterogeneous returns, especially for small bandwidths. Large bandwidths yield much more consistent outcomes, but are far less appealing from a risk-adjusted return standpoint. All in all, our findings tend to recommend cautiousness when resorting to large linear models for stock market predictions.</description>

      <title>Training of Spiking Neural Networks with Expectation-Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a unifying message-passing framework for training spiking neural networks (SNNs) using Expectation-Propagation. Our gradient-free method is capable of learning the marginal distributions of network parameters and simultaneously marginalizes nuisance parameters, such as the outputs of hidden layers. This framework allows for the first time, training of discrete and continuous weights, for deterministic and stochastic spiking networks, using batches of training samples. Although its convergence is not ensured, the algorithm converges in practice faster than gradient-based methods, without requiring a large number of passes through the training data. The classification and regression results presented pave the way for new efficient training methods for deep Bayesian networks.</description>

      <title>The Trilemma of Truth in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We often attribute human characteristics to large language models (LLMs) and claim that they "know" certain things. LLMs have an internal probabilistic knowledge that represents information retained during training. How can we assess the veracity of this knowledge? We examine two common methods for probing the veracity of LLMs and discover several assumptions that are flawed. To address these flawed assumptions, we introduce sAwMIL (short for Sparse Aware Multiple-Instance Learning), a probing method that utilizes the internal activations of LLMs to separate statements into true, false, and neither. sAwMIL is based on multiple-instance learning and conformal prediction. We evaluate sAwMIL on 5 validity criteria across 16 open-source LLMs, including both default and chat-based variants, as well as on 3 new datasets. Among the insights we provide are: (1) the veracity signal is often concentrated in the third quarter of an LLM's depth; (2) truth and falsehood signals are not always symmetric; (3) linear probes perform better on chat models than on default models; (4) nonlinear probes may be required to capture veracity signals for some LLMs with reinforcement learning from human feedback or knowledge distillation; and (5) LLMs capture a third type of signal that is distinct from true and false and is neither true nor false. These findings provide a reliable method for verifying what LLMs "know" and how certain they are of their probabilistic internal knowledge.</description>

      <title>Minimax and Bayes Optimal Best-arm Identification: Adaptive Experimental Design for Treatment Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates adaptive experimental design for treatment choice, also known as fixed-budget best-arm identification. We consider an adaptive procedure consisting of a treatment-allocation phase followed by a treatment-choice phase, and we design an adaptive experiment for this setup to efficiently identify the best treatment arm, defined as the one with the highest expected outcome. In our designed experiment, the treatment-allocation phase consists of two stages. The first stage is a pilot phase, where we allocate each treatment arm uniformly with equal proportions to eliminate clearly suboptimal arms and estimate outcome variances. In the second stage, we allocate treatment arms in proportion to the variances estimated in the first stage. After the treatment-allocation phase, the procedure enters the treatment-choice phase, where we choose the treatment arm with the highest sample mean as our estimate of the best treatment arm. We prove that this single design is simultaneously asymptotically minimax and Bayes optimal for the simple regret, with upper bounds that match our lower bounds up to exact constants. Therefore, our designed experiment achieves the sharp efficiency limits without requiring separate tuning for minimax and Bayesian objectives.</description>

      <title>Faster Diffusion Models via Higher-Order Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore provable acceleration of diffusion models without any additional retraining. Focusing on the task of approximating a target data distribution in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to within $\varepsilon$ total-variation distance, we propose a principled, training-free sampling algorithm that requires only the order of
  $$ d^{1+2/K} \varepsilon^{-1/K} $$
  score function evaluations (up to log factor) in the presence of accurate scores, where $K$ is an arbitrarily large fixed integer. This result applies to a broad class of target data distributions, without the need for assumptions such as smoothness or log-concavity. Our theory is robust vis-a-vis inexact score estimation, degrading gracefully as the score estimation error increases -- without demanding higher-order smoothness on the score estimates as assumed in previous work. The proposed algorithm draws insight from high-order ODE solvers, leveraging high-order Lagrange interpolation and successive refinement to approximate the integral derived from the probability flow ODE.</description>

      <title>Data Uniformity Improves Training Efficiency and More, with a Convergence Framework Beyond the NTK Regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.24120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data selection plays a crucial role in data-driven decision-making, including in large language models (LLMs), and is typically task-dependent. Properties such as data quality and diversity have been extensively studied and are known to enhance model performance. However, it remains unclear whether there exist other quantitative and general principles of data selection that can consistently improve performance, especially for complex tasks with limited prior knowledge. In this paper, we demonstrate that selecting more uniformly distributed data can improve training efficiency while enhancing performance. Specifically, we establish that more uniform (less biased) distribution leads to a larger minimum pairwise distance between data points, denoted by $h_{\min}$, and prove that a smaller $h_{\min}$ can slow down the training dynamics of gradient descent (GD). Moreover, we theoretically show that the approximation error of neural networks decreases as $h_{\min}$ increases. Our analysis introduces a convergence framework for GD beyond the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime, applicable to a broad class of architectures, including transformers, without requiring Lipschitz smoothness. This framework further provides theoretical justification for the use of residual connections and function compositions in deep neural architectures. In the end, we conduct comprehensive experiments for supervised fine-tuning across various settings, including different optimization strategies, model sizes, and training datasets. The results consistently demonstrate that selecting data by maximizing pairwise distance significantly accelerates training and achieves comparable or better performance in LLMs across diverse datasets.

Abstract: We consider the problem of approximating the regression function $f_\mu:\, \Omega \to Y$ from noisy $\mu$-distributed vector-valued data $(\omega_m,y_m)\in\Omega\times Y$ by an online learning algorithm using a reproducing kernel Hilbert space $H$ (RKHS) as prior. In an online algorithm, i.i.d. samples become available one by one via a random process and are successively processed to build approximations to the regression function. Assuming that the regression function essentially belongs to $H$ (soft learning scenario), we provide estimates for the expected squared error in the RKHS norm of the approximations $f^{(m)}\in H$ obtained by a standard regularized online approximation algorithm. In particular, we show an order-optimal estimate $$ \mathbb{E}(\|\epsilon^{(m)}\|_H^2)\le C (m+1)^{-s/(2+s)},\qquad m=1,2,\ldots, $$ where $\epsilon^{(m)}$ denotes the error term after $m$ processed data, the parameter $0&lt;s\leq 1$ expresses an additional smoothness assumption on the regression function, and the constant $C$ depends on the variance of the input noise, the smoothness of the regression function, and other parameters of the algorithm. The proof, which is inspired by results on Schwarz iterative methods in the noiseless case, uses only elementary Hilbert space techniques and minimal assumptions on the noise, the feature map that defines $H$ and the associated covariance operator.</description>

Abstract: From benign overfitting in overparameterized models to rich power-law scalings in performance, simple ridge regression displays surprising behaviors sometimes thought to be limited to deep neural networks. This balance of phenomenological richness with analytical tractability makes ridge regression the model system of choice in high-dimensional machine learning. In this paper, we present a unifying perspective on recent results on ridge regression using the basic tools of random matrix theory and free probability, aimed at readers with backgrounds in physics and deep learning. We highlight the fact that statistical fluctuations in empirical covariance matrices can be absorbed into a renormalization of the ridge parameter. This `deterministic equivalence' allows us to obtain analytic formulas for the training and generalization errors in a few lines of algebra by leveraging the properties of the $S$-transform of free probability. From these precise asymptotics, we can easily identify sources of power-law scaling in model performance. In all models, the $S$-transform corresponds to the train-test generalization gap, and yields an analogue of the generalized-cross-validation estimator. Using these techniques, we derive fine-grained bias-variance decompositions for a very general class of random feature models with structured covariates. This allows us to discover a scaling regime for random feature models where the variance due to the features limits performance in the overparameterized setting. We also demonstrate how anisotropic weight structure in random feature models can limit performance and lead to nontrivial exponents for finite-width corrections in the overparameterized setting. Our results extend and provide a unifying perspective on earlier models of neural scaling laws.</description>

      <title>Satisficing Regret Minimization in Bandits: Constant Rate and Light-Tailed Distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06802v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the concept of satisficing in decision-making, we consider the problem of satisficing regret minimization in bandit optimization. In this setting, the learner aims at selecting satisficing arms (arms with mean reward exceeding a certain threshold value) as frequently as possible. The performance is measured by satisficing regret, which is the cumulative deficit of the chosen arm's mean reward compared to the threshold. We propose SELECT, a general algorithmic template for Satisficing REgret Minimization via SampLing and LowEr Confidence bound Testing, that attains constant expected satisficing regret for a wide variety of bandit optimization problems in the realizable case (i.e., a satisficing arm exists). As a complement, SELECT also enjoys the same (standard) regret guarantee as the oracle in the non-realizable case. To further ensure stability of the algorithm, we introduce SELECT-LITE that achieves a light-tailed satisficing regret distribution plus a constant expected satisficing regret in the realizable case and a sub-linear expected (standard) regret in the non-realizable case. Notably, SELECT-LITE can operate on learning oracles with heavy-tailed (standard) regret distribution. More importantly, our results reveal the surprising compatibility between constant expected satisficing regret and light-tailed satisficing regret distribution, which is in sharp contrast to the case of (standard) regret. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to validate the performance of SELECT and SELECT-LITE on both synthetic datasets and a real-world dynamic pricing case study.</description>

      <title>Optimization, Isoperimetric Inequalities, and Sampling via Lyapunov Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02979v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that optimizability of any function F using Gradient Flow from all initializations implies a Poincar\'e Inequality for Gibbs measures mu_{beta} = e^{-beta F}/Z at low temperature. In particular, under mild regularity assumptions on the convergence rate of Gradient Flow, we establish that mu_{beta} satisfies a Poincar\'e Inequality with constant O(C'+1/beta) for beta &gt;= Omega(d), where C' is the Poincar\'e constant of mu_{beta} restricted to a neighborhood of the global minimizers of F. Under an additional mild condition on F, we show that mu_{beta} satisfies a Log-Sobolev Inequality with constant O(beta max(S, 1) max(C', 1)) where S denotes the second moment of mu_{beta}. Here asymptotic notation hides F-dependent parameters. At a high level, this establishes that optimizability via Gradient Flow from every initialization implies a Poincar\'e and Log-Sobolev Inequality for the low-temperature Gibbs measure, which in turn imply sampling from all initializations.
  Analogously, we establish that under the same assumptions, if F can be initialized from everywhere except some set S, then mu_{beta} satisfies a Weak Poincar\'e Inequality with parameters (O(C'+1/beta), O(mu_{beta}(S))) for \beta = Omega(d). At a high level, this shows while optimizability from 'most' initializations implies a Weak Poincar\'e Inequality, which in turn implies sampling from suitable warm starts. Our regularity assumptions are mild and as a consequence, we show we can efficiently sample from several new natural and interesting classes of non-log-concave densities, an important setting with relatively few examples. As another corollary, we obtain efficient discrete-time sampling results for log-concave measures satisfying milder regularity conditions than smoothness, similar to Lehec (2023).</description>

Abstract: We derive a fundamental trade-off between standard and adversarial risk in a rather general situation that formalizes the following simple intuition: "If no (nearly) optimal predictor is smooth, adversarial robustness comes at the cost of accuracy." As a concrete example, we evaluate the derived trade-off in regression with polynomial ridge functions under mild regularity conditions. Generalizing our analysis of this example, we formulate a necessary condition under which adversarial robustness can be achieved without significant degradation of the accuracy. This necessary condition is expressed in terms of a quantity that resembles the Poincar\'{e} constant of the data distribution.</description>

      <title>Semiparametric Double Reinforcement Learning with Applications to Long-Term Causal Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-term causal effects often must be estimated from short-term data due to limited follow-up in healthcare, economics, and online platforms. Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) provide a natural framework for capturing such long-term dynamics through sequences of states, actions, and rewards. Double Reinforcement Learning (DRL) enables efficient inference on policy values in MDPs, but nonparametric implementations require strong intertemporal overlap assumptions and often exhibit high variance and instability. We propose a semiparametric extension of DRL for efficient inference on linear functionals of the Q-function--such as policy values--in infinite-horizon, time-homogeneous MDPs. By imposing structural restrictions on the Q-function, our approach relaxes the strong overlap conditions required by nonparametric methods and improves statistical efficiency. Under model misspecification, our estimators target the functional of the best-approximating Q-function, with only second-order bias. We provide conditions for valid inference using sieve methods and data-driven model selection. A central challenge in DRL is the estimation of nuisance functions, such as density ratios, which often involve difficult minimax optimization. To address this, we introduce a novel plug-in estimator based on isotonic Bellman calibration, which combines fitted Q-iteration with an isotonic regression adjustment. The estimator is debiased without requiring estimation of additional nuisance functions and reduces high-dimensional overlap assumptions to a one-dimensional condition. Bellman calibration extends isotonic calibration--widely used in prediction and classification--to the MDP setting and may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Generalized Venn and Venn-Abers Calibration with Applications in Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring model calibration is critical for reliable prediction, yet popular distribution-free methods such as histogram binning and isotonic regression offer only asymptotic guarantees. We introduce a unified framework for Venn and Venn-Abers calibration that extends Vovk's approach beyond binary classification to a broad class of prediction problems defined by generic loss functions. Our method transforms any perfectly in-sample calibrated predictor into a set-valued predictor that, in finite samples, outputs at least one marginally calibrated point prediction. These set predictions shrink asymptotically and converge to a conditionally calibrated prediction, capturing epistemic uncertainty. We further propose Venn multicalibration, a new approach for achieving finite-sample calibration across subpopulations. For quantile loss, our framework recovers group-conditional and multicalibrated conformal prediction as special cases and yields novel prediction intervals with quantile-conditional coverage.</description>

      <title>LNUCB-TA: Linear-nonlinear Hybrid Bandit Learning with Temporal Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing contextual multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms fail to effectively capture both long-term trends and local patterns across all arms, leading to suboptimal performance in environments with rapidly changing reward structures. They also rely on static exploration rates, which do not dynamically adjust to changing conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose LNUCB-TA, a hybrid bandit model integrating a novel nonlinear component (adaptive k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)) for reducing time complexity, alongside a global-and-local attention-based exploration mechanism. Our approach uniquely combines linear and nonlinear estimation techniques, with the nonlinear module dynamically adjusting k based on reward variance to enhance spatiotemporal pattern recognition. This reduces the likelihood of selecting suboptimal arms while improving reward estimation accuracy and computational efficiency. The attention-based mechanism ranks arms by past performance and selection frequency, dynamically adjusting exploration and exploitation in real time without requiring manual tuning of exploration rates. By integrating global attention (assessing all arms collectively) and local attention (focusing on individual arms), LNUCB-TA efficiently adapts to temporal and spatial complexities. Empirical results show LNUCB-TA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art linear, nonlinear, and hybrid bandits in cumulative and mean reward, convergence, and robustness across different exploration rates. Theoretical analysis further confirms its reliability with a sub-linear regret bound.</description>

Abstract: We present a Representer Theorem result for a large class of weak formulation problems. We provide examples of applications of our formulation both in traditional machine learning and numerical methods as well as in new and emerging techniques. Finally we apply our formulation to generalize the multivariate occupation kernel (MOCK) method for learning dynamical systems from data proposing the more general Riesz Occupation Kernel (ROCK) method. Our generalized methods are both more computationally efficient and performant on most of the benchmarks we test against.</description>

      <title>DGSAM: Domain Generalization via Individual Sharpness-Aware Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) aims to learn models that perform well on unseen target domains by training on multiple source domains. Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), known for finding flat minima that improve generalization, has therefore been widely adopted in DG. However, our analysis reveals that SAM in DG may converge to \textit{fake flat minima}, where the total loss surface appears flat in terms of global sharpness but remains sharp with respect to individual source domains. To understand this phenomenon more precisely, we formalize the average worst-case domain risk as the maximum loss under domain distribution shifts within a bounded divergence, and derive a generalization bound that reveals the limitations of global sharpness-aware minimization. In contrast, we show that individual sharpness provides a valid upper bound on this risk, making it a more suitable proxy for robust domain generalization. Motivated by these insights, we shift the DG paradigm toward minimizing individual sharpness across source domains. We propose \textit{Decreased-overhead Gradual SAM (DGSAM)}, which applies gradual domain-wise perturbations in a computationally efficient manner to consistently reduce individual sharpness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DGSAM not only improves average accuracy but also reduces performance variance across domains, while incurring less computational overhead than SAM.</description>

      <title>Gibbs randomness-compression proposition: An efficient deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A proposition that connects randomness and compression is put forward via Gibbs entropy over set of measurement vectors associated with a compression process. The proposition states that a lossy compression process is equivalent to {\it directed randomness} that preserves information content. The proposition originated from the observed behaviour in newly proposed {\it Dual Tomographic Compression} (DTC) compress-train framework. This is akin to tomographic reconstruction of layer weight matrices via building compressed sensed projections, via so-called {\it weight rays}. This tomographic approach is applied to previous and next layers in a dual fashion, that triggers neuronal-level pruning. This novel model compress-train scheme appears in iterative fashion and acts as a smart neural architecture search, The experiments demonstrated the utility of this dual-tomography producing state-of-the-art performance with efficient compression during training, accelerating and supporting lottery ticket hypothesis. However, random compress-train iterations having similar performance demonstrated the connection between randomness and compression from statistical physics perspective, we formulated the so-called {\it Gibbs randomness-compression proposition}, signifying randomness-compression relationship via Gibbs entropy. Practically, the DTC framework provides a promising approach for massively energy- and resource-efficient deep learning training.</description>

      <title>GL-LowPopArt: A Nearly Instance-Wise Minimax-Optimal Estimator for Generalized Low-Rank Trace Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03074v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present `GL-LowPopArt`, a novel Catoni-style estimator for generalized low-rank trace regression. Building on `LowPopArt` (Jang et al., 2024), it employs a two-stage approach: nuclear norm regularization followed by matrix Catoni estimation. We establish state-of-the-art estimation error bounds, surpassing existing guarantees (Fan et al., 2019; Kang et al., 2022), and reveal a novel experimental design objective, $\mathrm{GL}(\pi)$. The key technical challenge is controlling bias from the nonlinear inverse link function, which we address by our two-stage approach. We prove a *local* minimax lower bound, showing that our `GL-LowPopArt` enjoys instance-wise optimality up to the condition number of the ground-truth Hessian. Applications include generalized linear matrix completion, where `GL-LowPopArt` achieves a state-of-the-art Frobenius error guarantee, and **bilinear dueling bandits**, a novel setting inspired by general preference learning (Zhang et al., 2024). Our analysis of a `GL-LowPopArt`-based explore-then-commit algorithm reveals a new, potentially interesting problem-dependent quantity, along with improved Borda regret bound than vectorization (Wu et al., 2024).</description>

      <title>Global Convergence of Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares for Robust Subspace Recovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust subspace estimation is fundamental to many machine learning and data analysis tasks. Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) is an elegant and empirically effective approach to this problem, yet its theoretical properties remain poorly understood. This paper establishes that, under deterministic conditions, a variant of IRLS with dynamic smoothing regularization converges linearly to the underlying subspace from any initialization. We extend these guarantees to affine subspace estimation, a setting that lacks prior recovery theory. Additionally, we illustrate the practical benefits of IRLS through an application to low-dimensional neural network training. Our results provide the first global convergence guarantees for IRLS in robust subspace recovery and, more broadly, for nonconvex IRLS on a Riemannian manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.13423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit Pollard's classical result on consistency for $k$-means clustering in Euclidean space, with a focus on extensions in two directions: first, to problems where the data may come from interesting geometric settings (e.g., Riemannian manifolds, reflexive Banach spaces, or the Wasserstein space); second, to problems where some parameters are chosen adaptively from the data (e.g., $k$-medoids or elbow-method $k$-means). Towards this end, we provide a general theory which shows that all clustering procedures described above are strongly consistent. In fact, our method of proof allows us to derive many asymptotic limit theorems beyond strong consistency. We also remove all assumptions about uniqueness of the set of optimal cluster centers.</description>

      <title>BELIEF in Dependence: Leveraging Atomic Linearity in Data Bits for Rethinking Generalized Linear Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.10852v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two linearly uncorrelated binary variables must be also independent because non-linear dependence cannot manifest with only two possible states. This inherent linearity is the atom of dependency constituting any complex form of relationship. Inspired by this observation, we develop a framework called binary expansion linear effect (BELIEF) for understanding arbitrary relationships with a binary outcome. Models from the BELIEF framework are easily interpretable because they describe the association of binary variables in the language of linear models, yielding convenient theoretical insight and striking Gaussian parallels. With BELIEF, one may study generalized linear models (GLM) through transparent linear models, providing insight into how the choice of link affects modeling. For example, setting a GLM interaction coefficient to zero does not necessarily lead to the kind of no-interaction model assumption as understood under their linear model counterparts. Furthermore, for a binary response, maximum likelihood estimation for GLMs paradoxically fails under complete separation, when the data are most discriminative, whereas BELIEF estimation automatically reveals the perfect predictor in the data that is responsible for complete separation. We explore these phenomena and provide related theoretical results. We also provide preliminary empirical demonstration of some theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Algorithmic Fairness for Human-AI Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03647v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing approaches to algorithmic fairness aim to ensure equitable outcomes if human decision-makers comply perfectly with algorithmic decisions. However, perfect compliance with the algorithm is rarely a reality or even a desirable outcome in human-AI collaboration. Yet, recent studies have shown that selective compliance with fair algorithms can amplify discrimination relative to the prior human policy. As a consequence, ensuring equitable outcomes requires fundamentally different algorithmic design principles that ensure robustness to the decision-maker's (a priori unknown) compliance pattern. We define the notion of compliance-robustly fair algorithmic recommendations that are guaranteed to (weakly) improve fairness in decisions, regardless of the human's compliance pattern. We propose a simple optimization strategy to identify the best performance-improving compliance-robustly fair policy. However, we show that it may be infeasible to design algorithmic recommendations that are simultaneously fair in isolation, compliance-robustly fair, and more accurate than the human policy; thus, if our goal is to improve the equity and accuracy of human-AI collaboration, it may not be desirable to enforce traditional algorithmic fairness constraints. We illustrate the value of our approach on criminal sentencing data before and after the introduction of an algorithmic risk assessment tool in Virginia.</description>

      <title>Graph Contrastive Learning with Low-Rank Regularization and Low-Rank Attention for Noisy Node Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in learning node representations and have shown strong performance in tasks such as node classification. However, recent findings indicate that the presence of noise in real-world graph data can substantially impair the effectiveness of GNNs. To address this challenge, we introduce a robust and innovative node representation learning method named Graph Contrastive Learning with Low-Rank Regularization, or GCL-LRR, which follows a two-stage transductive learning framework for node classification. In the first stage, the GCL-LRR encoder is optimized through prototypical contrastive learning while incorporating a low-rank regularization objective. In the second stage, the representations generated by GCL-LRR are employed by a linear transductive classifier to predict the labels of unlabeled nodes within the graph. Our GCL-LRR is inspired by the Low Frequency Property (LFP) of the graph data and its labels, and it is also theoretically motivated by our sharp generalization bound for transductive learning. To the best of our knowledge, our theoretical result is among the first to theoretically demonstrate the advantage of low-rank regularization in transductive learning, which is also supported by strong empirical results. To further enhance the performance of GCL-LRR, we present an improved model named GCL-LR-Attention, which incorporates a novel LR-Attention layer into GCL-LRR. GCL-LR-Attention reduces the kernel complexity of GCL-LRR and contributes to a tighter generalization bound, leading to improved performance. Extensive evaluations on standard benchmark datasets evidence the effectiveness and robustness of both GCL-LRR and GCL-LR-Attention in learning meaningful node representations. The code is available at https://github.com/Statistical-Deep-Learning/GCL-LR-Attention.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Inconsistency in Bayesian Deep Learning via Generalized Laplace Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13535v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, inconsistency in Bayesian deep learning has attracted significant attention. Tempered or generalized posterior distributions are frequently employed as direct and effective solutions. Nonetheless, the underlying mechanisms and the effectiveness of generalized posteriors remain active research topics. In this work, we interpret posterior tempering as a correction for model misspecification via adjustments to the joint probability, and as a recalibration of priors by reducing aleatoric uncertainty. We also identify a unique property of the Laplace approximation: the generalized normalizing constant remains invariant, in contrast to general Bayesian learning, where this constant typically depends on model parameters after generalization. Leveraging this property, we introduce the generalized Laplace approximation, which requires only a simple modification to the Hessian calculation of the regularized loss. This approach provides a flexible and scalable framework for high-quality posterior inference. We evaluate the proposed method on state-of-the-art neural networks and real-world datasets, demonstrating that the generalized Laplace approximation enhances predictive performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15495v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When symmetry is present in the loss function, the model is likely to be trapped in a low-capacity state that is sometimes known as a "collapse". Being trapped in these low-capacity states can be a major obstacle to training across many scenarios where deep learning technology is applied. We first prove two concrete mechanisms through which symmetries lead to reduced capacities and ignored features during training and inference. We then propose a simple and theoretically justified algorithm, syre, to remove almost all symmetry-induced low-capacity states in neural networks. When this type of entrapment is especially a concern, removing symmetries with the proposed method is shown to correlate well with improved optimization or performance. A remarkable merit of the proposed method is that it is model-agnostic and does not require any knowledge of the symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16722v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our paper, we focus on robust variable selection for missing data and measurement error. Missing data and measurement errors can lead to confusing data distribution. We propose an exponential loss function with a tuning parameter to apply to Missing and measurement errors data. By adjusting the parameter, the loss function can be better and more robust under various data distributions. We use inverse probability weighting and additive error models to address missing data and measurement errors. Also, we find that the Atan punishment method works better. We used Monte Carlo simulations to assess the validity of robust variable selection and validated our findings with the breast cancer dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02335v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Activation sparsity denotes the existence of substantial weakly-contributed elements within activation outputs that can be eliminated, benefiting many important applications concerned with large language models (LLMs). Although promoting greater activation sparsity within LLMs deserves deep studies, existing works lack comprehensive and quantitative research on the correlation between activation sparsity and potentially influential factors. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on the quantitative scaling properties and influential factors of the activation sparsity within decoder-only Transformer-based LLMs. Specifically, we propose PPL-$p\%$ sparsity, a precise and performance-aware activation sparsity metric that is applicable to any activation function. Through extensive experiments, we find several important phenomena. Firstly, different activation functions exhibit comparable performance but opposite training-time sparsity trends. The activation ratio (i.e., $1-\mathrm{sparsity\ ratio}$) evolves as a convergent increasing power-law and decreasing logspace power-law with the amount of training data for SiLU-activated and ReLU-activated LLMs, respectively. These demonstrate that ReLU is more efficient as the activation function than SiLU and can leverage more training data to improve activation sparsity. Secondly, the activation ratio linearly increases with the width-depth ratio below a certain bottleneck point, indicating the potential advantage of a deeper architecture at a fixed parameter scale. Finally, at similar width-depth ratios, we surprisingly find that the limit value of activation sparsity varies weakly with the parameter scale, i.e., the activation patterns within LLMs are insensitive to the parameter scale. These empirical laws towards LLMs with greater activation sparsity have important implications for making LLMs more efficient and interpretable.</description>

      <title>Doubly robust inference via calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Doubly robust estimators are widely used for estimating average treatment effects and other linear summaries of regression functions. While consistency requires only one of two nuisance functions to be estimated consistently, asymptotic normality typically require sufficiently fast convergence of both. In this work, we correct this mismatch: we show that calibrating the nuisance estimators within a doubly robust procedure yields doubly robust asymptotic normality for linear functionals. We introduce a general framework, calibrated debiased machine learning (calibrated DML), and propose a specific estimator that augments standard DML with a simple isotonic regression adjustment. Our theoretical analysis shows that the calibrated DML estimator remains asymptotically normal if either the regression or the Riesz representer of the functional is estimated sufficiently well, allowing the other to converge arbitrarily slowly or even inconsistently. We further propose a simple bootstrap method for constructing confidence intervals, enabling doubly robust inference without additional nuisance estimation. In a range of semi-synthetic benchmark datasets, calibrated DML reduces bias and improves coverage relative to standard DML. Our method can be integrated into existing DML pipelines by adding just a few lines of code to calibrate cross-fitted estimates via isotonic regression.</description>

      <title>Statistical Mechanics of Support Vector Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key problem in deep learning and computational neuroscience is relating the geometrical properties of neural representations to task performance. Here, we consider this problem for continuous decoding tasks where neural variability may affect task precision. Using methods from statistical mechanics, we study the average-case learning curves for $\varepsilon$-insensitive Support Vector Regression ($\varepsilon$-SVR) and discuss its capacity as a measure of linear decodability. Our analysis reveals a phase transition in training error at a critical load, capturing the interplay between the tolerance parameter $\varepsilon$ and neural variability. We uncover a double-descent phenomenon in the generalization error, showing that $\varepsilon$ acts as a regularizer, both suppressing and shifting these peaks. Theoretical predictions are validated both with toy models and deep neural networks, extending the theory of Support Vector Machines to continuous tasks with inherent neural variability.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of Min-Max Langevin Dynamics and Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20471v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study zero-sum games in the space of probability distributions over the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ with entropy regularization, in the setting when the interaction function between the players is smooth and strongly convex-strongly concave. We prove an exponential convergence guarantee for the mean-field min-max Langevin dynamics to compute the equilibrium distribution of the zero-sum game. We also study the finite-particle approximation of the mean-field min-max Langevin dynamics, both in continuous and discrete times. We prove biased convergence guarantees for the continuous-time finite-particle min-max Langevin dynamics to the stationary mean-field equilibrium distribution with an explicit bias term which does not scale with the number of particles. We also prove biased convergence guarantees for the discrete-time finite-particle min-max Langevin algorithm to the stationary mean-field equilibrium distribution with an additional bias term which scales with the step size and the number of particles. This provides an explicit iteration complexity for the average particle along the finite-particle algorithm to approximately compute the equilibrium distribution of the zero-sum game.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Aleatoric and Epistemic Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ideas of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty are widely used to reason about the probabilistic predictions of machine-learning models. We identify incoherence in existing discussions of these ideas and suggest this stems from the aleatoric-epistemic view being insufficiently expressive to capture all the distinct quantities that researchers are interested in. To address this we present a decision-theoretic perspective that relates rigorous notions of uncertainty, predictive performance and statistical dispersion in data. This serves to support clearer thinking as the field moves forward. Additionally we provide insights into popular information-theoretic quantities, showing they can be poor estimators of what they are often purported to measure, while also explaining how they can still be useful in guiding data acquisition.</description>

      <title>Refined climatologies of future precipitation over High Mountain Asia using probabilistic ensemble learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15690v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High Mountain Asia (HMA) holds the highest concentration of frozen water outside the polar regions, serving as a crucial water source for more than 1.9 billion people. Precipitation represents the largest source of uncertainty for future hydrological modelling in this area. In this study, we propose a probabilistic machine learning framework to combine monthly precipitation from 13 regional climate models developed under the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) over HMA via a mixture of experts (MoE). This approach accounts for seasonal and spatial biases within the models, enabling the prediction of more faithful precipitation distributions. The MoE is trained and validated against gridded historical precipitation data, yielding 32% improvement over an equally-weighted average and 254% improvement over choosing any single ensemble member. This approach is then used to generate precipitation projections for the near future (2036-2065) and far future (2066-2095) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Compared to previous estimates, the MoE projects wetter summers but drier winters over the western Himalayas and Karakoram and wetter winters over the Tibetan Plateau, Hengduan Shan, and South East Tibet.</description>

      <title>Faster Convergence of Riemannian Stochastic Gradient Descent with Increasing Batch Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have theoretically analyzed the use of Riemannian stochastic gradient descent (RSGD) and found that using an increasing batch size leads to faster RSGD convergence rate than using a constant batch size not only with a constant learning rate but also with a decaying learning rate, such as cosine annealing decay and polynomial decay. The convergence rate of RSGD improves from $O(\sqrt{T^{-1}+\text{const.}})$ with a constant batch size to $O(T^{-\frac{1}{2}})$ with an increasing batch size, where $T$ denotes the number of iterations. Using principal component analysis and low-rank matrix completion tasks, we investigated, both theoretically and numerically, how increasing batch size affects computational time as measured by stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity. Increasing batch size reduces the SFO complexity of RSGD. Furthermore, our numerical results demonstrated that increasing batch size offers the advantages of both small and large constant batch sizes.</description>

      <title>Time to Rethink AI for Combinatorial Optimization: Classical Algorithms Remain Tough to Match</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This position paper argues that the machine learning community should fundamentally rethink how AI-inspired methods are developed and evaluated for combinatorial optimization (CO). We present comprehensive empirical benchmarks comparing various recent AI-inspired GPU-based methods with several classical CPU-based solvers on the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem. Strikingly, even on in-distribution random graphs, leading AI-inspired methods are consistently outperformed by the state-of-the-art classical solver KaMIS, and some AI-inspired methods frequently fail to surpass even the simplest degree-based greedy heuristic. To better understand the source of these failures, we introduce a novel analysis, serialization, which reveals that non-backtracking AI methods, such as LTFT (based on GFlowNets), end up reasoning similarly to the simplest degree-based greedy heuristic, and thus worse than KaMIS.
  Our findings reveal three core issues: (1) Limited benchmarks and evaluation - AI-inspired methods are often tested only on small instances with very limited inference time, which covers up issues with scalability and resource usage; (2) Intrinsic hardness and learning limits - even under ideal, in-distribution conditions, learning-based approaches lag behind classical heuristics, highlighting inherent barriers that receive little attention; and (3) Insufficient use and understanding of classical heuristics - current learning frameworks often neglect to incorporate effective classical techniques.
  Although we use MIS as a testbed, similar gaps and challenges have been reported in other combinatorial optimization problems, suggesting broader relevance for our recommendations. We propose that future research must address these issues by rigorous benchmarking, deepening understanding of learning limitations, and integrating classical heuristics into AI-inspired methods.</description>

      <title>Benefits of Early Stopping in Gradient Descent for Overparameterized Logistic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In overparameterized logistic regression, gradient descent (GD) iterates diverge in norm while converging in direction to the maximum $\ell_2$-margin solution -- a phenomenon known as the implicit bias of GD. This work investigates additional regularization effects induced by early stopping in well-specified high-dimensional logistic regression. We first demonstrate that the excess logistic risk vanishes for early-stopped GD but diverges to infinity for GD iterates at convergence. This suggests that early-stopped GD is well-calibrated, whereas asymptotic GD is statistically inconsistent. Second, we show that to attain a small excess zero-one risk, polynomially many samples are sufficient for early-stopped GD, while exponentially many samples are necessary for any interpolating estimator, including asymptotic GD. This separation underscores the statistical benefits of early stopping in the overparameterized regime. Finally, we establish nonasymptotic bounds on the norm and angular differences between early-stopped GD and $\ell_2$-regularized empirical risk minimizer, thereby connecting the implicit regularization of GD with explicit $\ell_2$-regularization.</description>

      <title>A Consequentialist Critique of Binary Classification Evaluation Practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: ML-supported decisions, such as ordering tests or determining preventive custody, often involve binary classification based on probabilistic forecasts. Evaluation frameworks for such forecasts typically consider whether to prioritize independent-decision metrics (e.g., Accuracy) or top-K metrics (e.g., Precision@K), and whether to focus on fixed thresholds or threshold-agnostic measures like AUC-ROC. We highlight that a consequentialist perspective, long advocated by decision theorists, should naturally favor evaluations that support independent decisions using a mixture of thresholds given their prevalence, such as Brier scores and Log loss. However, our empirical analysis reveals a strong preference for top-K metrics or fixed thresholds in evaluations at major conferences like ICML, FAccT, and CHIL. To address this gap, we use this decision-theoretic framework to map evaluation metrics to their optimal use cases, along with a Python package, briertools, to promote the broader adoption of Brier scores. In doing so, we also uncover new theoretical connections, including a reconciliation between the Brier Score and Decision Curve Analysis, which clarifies and responds to a longstanding critique by (Assel, et al. 2017) regarding the clinical utility of proper scoring rules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion generative models have demonstrated remarkable success in visual domains such as image and video generation. They have also recently emerged as a promising approach in robotics, especially in robot manipulations. Diffusion models leverage a probabilistic framework, and they stand out with their ability to model multi-modal distributions and their robustness to high-dimensional input and output spaces. This survey provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art diffusion models in robotic manipulation, including grasp learning, trajectory planning, and data augmentation. Diffusion models for scene and image augmentation lie at the intersection of robotics and computer vision for vision-based tasks to enhance generalizability and data scarcity. This paper also presents the two main frameworks of diffusion models and their integration with imitation learning and reinforcement learning. In addition, it discusses the common architectures and benchmarks and points out the challenges and advantages of current state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods.</description>

      <title>SConU: Selective Conformal Uncertainty in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models are increasingly utilized in real-world applications, guarantees of task-specific metrics are essential for their reliable deployment. Previous studies have introduced various criteria of conformal uncertainty grounded in split conformal prediction, which offer user-specified correctness coverage. However, existing frameworks often fail to identify uncertainty data outliers that violate the exchangeability assumption, leading to unbounded miscoverage rates and unactionable prediction sets. In this paper, we propose a novel approach termed Selective Conformal Uncertainty (SConU), which, for the first time, implements significance tests, by developing two conformal p-values that are instrumental in determining whether a given sample deviates from the uncertainty distribution of the calibration set at a specific manageable risk level. Our approach not only facilitates rigorous management of miscoverage rates across both single-domain and interdisciplinary contexts, but also enhances the efficiency of predictions. Furthermore, we comprehensively analyze the components of the conformal procedures, aiming to approximate conditional coverage, particularly in high-stakes question-answering tasks.</description>

      <title>Perturbation Analysis of Singular Values in Concatenated Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Concatenating matrices is a common technique for uncovering shared structures in data through singular value decomposition (SVD) and low-rank approximations. The fundamental question arises: How does the singular value spectrum of the concatenated matrix relate to the spectra of its individual components? In the present work, we develop a perturbation technique that extends classical results such as Weyl's inequality to concatenated matrices. We setup analytical bounds that quantify stability of singular values under small perturbations in submatrices. The results demonstrate that if submatrices are close in a norm, dominant singular values of the concatenated matrix remain stable enabling controlled trade-offs between accuracy and compression. These provide a theoretical basis for improved matrix clustering and compression strategies with applications in the numerical linear algebra, signal processing, and data-driven modeling.</description>

      <title>Discretion in the Loop: Human Expertise in Algorithm-Assisted College Advising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In higher education, many institutions use algorithmic alerts to flag at-risk students and deliver advising at scale. While much research has focused on evaluating algorithmic predictions, relatively little is known about how discretionary interventions by human experts shape outcomes in algorithm-assisted settings. We study this question using rich quantitative and qualitative data from a randomized controlled trial of an algorithm-assisted advising program at Georgia State University. Taking a mixed-methods approach, we examine whether and how advisors use context unavailable to an algorithm to guide interventions and influence student success. We develop a causal graphical framework for human expertise in the interventional setting, extending prior work on discretion in purely predictive settings. We then test a necessary condition for discretionary expertise using structured advisor logs and student outcomes data, identifying several interventions that meet the criterion for statistical significance. Accordingly, we estimate that 2 out of 3 interventions taken by advisors in the treatment arm were plausibly "expertly targeted" to students using non-algorithmic context. Systematic qualitative analysis of advisor notes corroborates these findings, showing a pattern of advisors incorporating diverse forms of contextual information--such as personal circumstances, financial issues, and student engagement--into their decisions. Our results offer theoretical and practical insight into the real-world effectiveness of algorithm-supported college advising, and underscore the importance of accounting for human expertise in the design, evaluation, and implementation of algorithmic decision systems.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Online RL with Offline Data is All You Need: A Unified Hybrid RL Algorithm Design and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13768v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a hybrid learning framework for reinforcement learning (RL) in which the agent can leverage both an offline dataset and online interactions to learn the optimal policy. We present a unified algorithm and analysis and show that augmenting confidence-based online RL algorithms with the offline dataset outperforms any pure online or offline algorithm alone and achieves state-of-the-art results under two learning metrics, i.e., sub-optimality gap and online learning regret. Specifically, we show that our algorithm achieves a sub-optimality gap $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{1/(N_0/\mathtt{C}(\pi^*|\rho)+N_1}) )$, where $\mathtt{C}(\pi^*|\rho)$ is a new concentrability coefficient, $N_0$ and $N_1$ are the numbers of offline and online samples, respectively. For regret minimization, we show that it achieves a constant $\tilde{O}( \sqrt{N_1/(N_0/\mathtt{C}(\pi^{-}|\rho)+N_1)} )$ speed-up compared to pure online learning, where $\mathtt{C}(\pi^-|\rho)$ is the concentrability coefficient over all sub-optimal policies. Our results also reveal an interesting separation on the desired coverage properties of the offline dataset for sub-optimality gap minimization and regret minimization. We further validate our theoretical findings in several experiments in special RL models such as linear contextual bandits and Markov decision processes (MDPs).</description>

      <title>Multi-Environment GLAMP: Approximate Message Passing for Transfer Learning with Applications to Lasso-based Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithms enable precise characterization of certain classes of random objects in the high-dimensional limit, and have found widespread applications in fields such as signal processing, statistics, and communications. In this work, we introduce Multi-Environment Generalized Long AMP, a novel AMP framework that applies to transfer learning problems with multiple data sources and distribution shifts. We rigorously establish state evolution for multi-environment GLAMP. We demonstrate the utility of this framework by precisely characterizing the risk of three Lasso-based transfer learning estimators for the first time: the Stacked Lasso, the Model Averaging Estimator, and the Second Step Estimator. We also demonstrate the remarkable finite sample accuracy of our theory via extensive simulations.</description>

      <title>What Makes Treatment Effects Identifiable? Characterizations and Estimators Beyond Unconfoundedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most of the widely used estimators of the average treatment effect (ATE) in causal inference rely on the assumptions of unconfoundedness and overlap. Unconfoundedness requires that the observed covariates account for all correlations between the outcome and treatment. Overlap requires the existence of randomness in treatment decisions for all individuals. Nevertheless, many types of studies frequently violate unconfoundedness or overlap, for instance, observational studies with deterministic treatment decisions - popularly known as Regression Discontinuity designs - violate overlap.
  In this paper, we initiate the study of general conditions that enable the identification of the average treatment effect, extending beyond unconfoundedness and overlap. In particular, following the paradigm of statistical learning theory, we provide an interpretable condition that is sufficient and necessary for the identification of ATE. Moreover, this condition also characterizes the identification of the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) and can be used to characterize other treatment effects as well. To illustrate the utility of our condition, we present several well-studied scenarios where our condition is satisfied and, hence, we prove that ATE can be identified in regimes that prior works could not capture. For example, under mild assumptions on the data distributions, this holds for the models proposed by Tan (2006) and Rosenbaum (2002), and the Regression Discontinuity design model introduced by Thistlethwaite and Campbell (1960). For each of these scenarios, we also show that, under natural additional assumptions, ATE can be estimated from finite samples.
  We believe these findings open new avenues for bridging learning-theoretic insights and causal inference methodologies, particularly in observational studies with complex treatment mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Gradient Descent Improves Neural Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide evidence that orthogonalizing gradients during training improves model calibration without sacrificing accuracy. On CIFAR-10 with 10\% labeled data, $\perp$Grad matches SGD in accuracy but yields consistently improved calibration metrics such as lower test loss, reduced softmax overconfidence, and higher predictive entropy. These benefits persist under input corruption (CIFAR-10C) and extended training, where $\perp$Grad models degrade more gracefully than SGD-trained counterparts. $\perp$Grad is optimizer-agnostic, incurs minimal overhead, and works well with post-hoc calibration techniques like temperature scaling.
  Theoretically, we prove convergence of a simplified version of $\perp$Grad under mild assumptions and characterize its stationary points in positive homogeneous networks: $\perp$Grad converges to solutions where further loss reduction requires confidence scaling rather than decision boundary improvement.

      <title>State Entropy Regularization for Robust Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State entropy regularization has empirically shown better exploration and sample complexity in reinforcement learning (RL). However, its theoretical guarantees have not been studied. In this paper, we show that state entropy regularization improves robustness to structured and spatially correlated perturbations. These types of variation are common in transfer learning but often overlooked by standard robust RL methods, which typically focus on small, uncorrelated changes. We provide a comprehensive characterization of these robustness properties, including formal guarantees under reward and transition uncertainty, as well as settings where the method performs poorly. Much of our analysis contrasts state entropy with the widely used policy entropy regularization, highlighting their different benefits. Finally, from a practical standpoint, we illustrate that compared with policy entropy, the robustness advantages of state entropy are more sensitive to the number of rollouts used for policy evaluation.</description>

      <title>Connecting phases of matter to the flatness of the loss landscape in analog variational quantum algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) promise near-term quantum advantage, yet parametrized quantum states commonly built from the digital gate-based approach often suffer from scalability issues such as barren plateaus, where the loss landscape becomes flat. We study an analog VQA ans\"atze composed of $M$ quenches of a disordered Ising chain, whose dynamics is native to several quantum simulation platforms. By tuning the disorder strength we place each quench in either a thermalized phase or a many-body-localized (MBL) phase and analyse (i) the ans\"atze's expressivity and (ii) the scaling of loss variance. Numerics shows that both phases reach maximal expressivity at large $M$, but barren plateaus emerge at far smaller $M$ in the thermalized phase than in the MBL phase. Exploiting this gap, we propose an MBL initialisation strategy: initialise the ans\"atze in the MBL regime at intermediate quench $M$, enabling an initial trainability while retaining sufficient expressivity for subsequent optimization. The results link quantum phases of matter and VQA trainability, and provide practical guidelines for scaling analog-hardware VQAs.</description>

      <title>Equivariance Everywhere All At Once: A Recipe for Graph Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph machine learning architectures are typically tailored to specific tasks on specific datasets, which hinders their broader applicability. This has led to a new quest in graph machine learning: how to build graph foundation models capable of generalizing across arbitrary graphs and features? In this work, we present a recipe for designing graph foundation models for node-level tasks from first principles. The key ingredient underpinning our study is a systematic investigation of the symmetries that a graph foundation model must respect. In a nutshell, we argue that label permutation-equivariance alongside feature permutation-invariance are necessary in addition to the common node permutation-equivariance on each local neighborhood of the graph. To this end, we first characterize the space of linear transformations that are equivariant to permutations of nodes and labels, and invariant to permutations of features. We then prove that the resulting network is a universal approximator on multisets that respect the aforementioned symmetries. Our recipe uses such layers on the multiset of features induced by the local neighborhood of the graph to obtain a class of graph foundation models for node property prediction. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on 29 real-world node classification datasets, demonstrating both strong zero-shot empirical performance and consistent improvement as the number of training graphs increases.</description>

      <title>Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization for Traffic Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern intelligent transportation systems rely on accurate spatiotemporal traffic analysis to optimize urban mobility and infrastructure resilience. However, pervasive missing data caused by sensor failures and heterogeneous sensing gaps fundamentally hinders reliable traffic modeling. This paper proposes a Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF) model that synergizes low-rank tensor algebra with deep representation learning for robust traffic data imputation. The model innovatively embeds CP decomposition into neural architecture through learnable embedding projections, where sparse traffic tensors are encoded into dense latent factors across road segments, time intervals, and mobility metrics. A hierarchical feature fusion mechanism employs Hadamard products to explicitly model multilinear interactions, while stacked multilayer perceptron layers nonlinearly refine these representations to capture complex spatiotemporal couplings. Extensive evaluations on six urban traffic datasets demonstrate NCPF's superiority over six state-of-the-art baselines. By unifying CP decomposition's interpretable factor analysis with neural network's nonlinear expressive power, NCPF provides a principled yet flexible approaches for high-dimensional traffic data imputation, offering critical support for next-generation transportation digital twins and adaptive traffic control systems.</description>

      <title>Learning Causally Predictable Outcomes from Psychiatric Longitudinal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal inference in longitudinal biomedical data remains a central challenge, especially in psychiatry, where symptom heterogeneity and latent confounding frequently undermine classical estimators. Most existing methods for treatment effect estimation presuppose a fixed outcome variable and address confounding through observed covariate adjustment. However, the assumption of unconfoundedness may not hold for a fixed outcome in practice. To address this foundational limitation, we directly optimize the outcome definition to maximize causal identifiability. Our DEBIAS (Durable Effects with Backdoor-Invariant Aggregated Symptoms) algorithm learns non-negative, clinically interpretable weights for outcome aggregation, maximizing durable treatment effects and empirically minimizing both observed and latent confounding by leveraging the time-limited direct effects of prior treatments in psychiatric longitudinal data. The algorithm also furnishes an empirically verifiable test for outcome unconfoundedness. DEBIAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recovering causal effects for clinically interpretable composite outcomes across comprehensive experiments in depression and schizophrenia.</description>

      <title>Learning Time-Aware Causal Representation for Model Generalization in Evolving Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Endowing deep models with the ability to generalize in dynamic scenarios is of vital significance for real-world deployment, given the continuous and complex changes in data distribution. Recently, evolving domain generalization (EDG) has emerged to address distribution shifts over time, aiming to capture evolving patterns for improved model generalization. However, existing EDG methods may suffer from spurious correlations by modeling only the dependence between data and targets across domains, creating a shortcut between task-irrelevant factors and the target, which hinders generalization. To this end, we design a time-aware structural causal model (SCM) that incorporates dynamic causal factors and the causal mechanism drifts, and propose \textbf{S}tatic-D\textbf{YN}amic \textbf{C}ausal Representation Learning (\textbf{SYNC}), an approach that effectively learns time-aware causal representations. Specifically, it integrates specially designed information-theoretic objectives into a sequential VAE framework which captures evolving patterns, and produces the desired representations by preserving intra-class compactness of causal factors both across and within domains. Moreover, we theoretically show that our method can yield the optimal causal predictor for each time domain. Results on both synthetic and real-world datasets exhibit that SYNC can achieve superior temporal generalization performance.</description>

      <title>Experimenting, Fast and Slow: Bayesian Optimization of Long-term Outcomes with Online Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online experiments in internet systems, also known as A/B tests, are used for a wide range of system tuning problems, such as optimizing recommender system ranking policies and learning adaptive streaming controllers. Decision-makers generally wish to optimize for long-term treatment effects of the system changes, which often requires running experiments for a long time as short-term measurements can be misleading due to non-stationarity in treatment effects over time. The sequential experimentation strategies--which typically involve several iterations--can be prohibitively long in such cases. We describe a novel approach that combines fast experiments (e.g., biased experiments run only for a few hours or days) and/or offline proxies (e.g., off-policy evaluation) with long-running, slow experiments to perform sequential, Bayesian optimization over large action spaces in a short amount of time.</description>
