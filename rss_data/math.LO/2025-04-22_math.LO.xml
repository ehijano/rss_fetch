      <title>Measures on bounded perfect PAC fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a construction for producing Keisler measures on bounded perfect PAC fields. As a corollary, we deduce that all groups definable in bounded perfect PAC fields, and even in unbounded perfect Frobenius fields, are definably amenable. This work builds on our earlier constructions of measures for $e$-free PAC fields and a related construction due to Will Johnson.</description>

      <title>The Tree Pulldown Method: McLaughlin's Conjecture and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper finally fully elaborates the tree pulldown method used by one of us (Harrington) to settle McLaughlin's conjecture. This method enables the construction of a computable tree $T_0$ whose paths are incomparable over $0^{(\alpha)}$ and resemble $\alpha$-generics while leaving us almost completely free to specify the homeomorphism class of $[T_0]$. While a version of this method for $\alpha = \omega$ previously appeared in print we give the general construction for an arbitrary ordinal notation $\alpha$. We also demonstrate this method can be applied to a `non-standard' ordinal notation to establish the existence of a computable tree whose paths are hyperarithmetically incomparable and resemble $\alpha$-generics for all $\alpha &lt; \omega_1^{CK}$. Finally, we verify a number of corollaries including solutions to problems 57$^{*}$ , 62, 63 (McLaughlin's conjecture), 65 and 71 from Friedman's famous "One Hundred and Two Problems in Mathematical Logic."</description>

      <title>On the consistency of NF via Fuzzy Forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a proof of the consistency of $NF$. The proof employs the Compactness Theorem and the Universal Fuzzy Consistency Theorem. A brief outline of the proof can be as follows: (1) we extend $ZF$ to \emph{fuzzy} $ZF$ with a membership function $\mu$ over $D=\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]$; (2) we define \emph{unrestricted fuzzy} $NF$ as $\Sigma$; and (3) we derive a crisp $\mathrm{N}$ model of classical $NF$. Our proof, which does not depend on Holmes' $TTT$, establishes that if $ZF$ is consistent, then $NF$ is, via the classical chain $ZF \rightarrow ZF$ \emph{fuzzy} $\rightarrow \Sigma \rightarrow NF$. This method offers a novel perspective connecting fuzzy logic with classical set theory.</description>

      <title>A Smooth Analytical Approximation of the Prime Characteristic Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a smooth real-valued function P(n) in [0,1], defined via a triple integral with a periodic kernel, that approximates the characteristic function of prime numbers. The function is built to suppress when n is divisible by some m &lt; n, and to remain close to 1 otherwise. We prove that P(n) approaches 1 for prime n and P(n) is less than 1 for composite n, under appropriate limits of the smoothing parameters. The construction is fully differentiable and admits both asymptotic and finite approximations, offering a continuous surrogate for primality that is compatible with analytical, numerical, and optimization methods. We compare our approach with classical number-theoretic techniques, explore its computational aspects, and suggest potential applications in spectral analysis, machine learning, and probabilistic models of primes.</description>

      <title>On the Rudin-Blass Ordering of Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Rudin-Blass (and the Rudin-Keisler) ordering on the finite additive measures on $\omega$. We propose a generalization of the notion of Q-point and selective ultrafilter to measures: Q-measures and selective measures. We show some symmetries between Q-points and Q-measures but also we show where those symmetries break up. In particular we present an example of a measure which is minimal in the sense of Rudin-Blass but which is not a Q-measure.</description>

      <title>Wave Arithmetic: A Smooth Integral Representation of Number Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Wave Arithmetic, a smooth analytical framework in which natural, integer, and rational numbers are represented not as discrete entities, but as integrals of smooth, compactly supported or periodic kernel functions. In this formulation, each number arises as the accumulated amplitude of a structured waveform -- an interference pattern encoded by carefully designed kernels. Arithmetic operations such as addition, multiplication, and exponentiation are realized as geometric and tensorial constructions over multidimensional integration domains. Rational numbers emerge through amplitude scaling, and negative values through sign inversion, preserving all classical arithmetic identities within a continuous and differentiable structure. This representation embeds number theory into the realm of smooth analysis, enabling new interpretations of primality, factorization, and divisibility as geometric and spectral phenomena. Beyond technical formulation, Wave Arithmetic proposes a paradigm shift: numbers as the collapsed states of harmonic processes -- analytic resonances rather than atomic symbols.</description>

      <title>On dissociated infinite permutation groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is threefold. First, we describe the notion of dissociation for closed subgroups of the group of permutations on a countably infinite set and explain its numerous consequences on unitary representations (classification of unitary representations, Property (T), Howe-Moore property, etc.) and on ergodic actions (non-existence of type III non-singular actions, Stabilizer rigidity, etc.). Some of the results presented here are new, others were proved in different contexts. Second, we introduce a new method to prove dissociation. It is based on a reinforcement of the classical notion of strong amalgamation, where we allow to amalgamate over countable sets. Third, we apply this technique of amalgamation to provide new examples of dissociated closed permutation groups, including isometry groups of some metrically homogeneous graphs, automorphism groups of diversities, and more.</description>

      <title>The Diophantine problem in isotropic reductive groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We begin to study model-theoretic properties of non-split isotropic reductive group schemes. In this paper we show that the base ring $K$ is e-interpretable in the point group $G(K)$ of every sufficiently isotropic reductive group scheme $G$. In particular, the Diophantine problems in $K$ and $G(K)$ are equivalent. We also compute the centralizer of the elementary subgroup of $G(K)$ and the common normalizer of all its root subgroups.</description>

Abstract: We prove a perfectoid analogue of the Ax-Kochen theorem on zeros of $p$-adic forms: Given $d\in \mathbb{N}$, there is a finite totally ramified extension $E/\mathbb{Q}_p$ such that every untilt of $\mathbb{F}_p(\!(t^{1/p^{\infty}})\!)$ containing $E$ is $C_2(d)$. We also prove a similar result for the existence of rational points in rationally connected varieties over perfectoid field extensions of $\mathbb{Q}_p^{ur}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2002.10712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a way of assigning a realizability notion to each degree of incomputability. In our setting, we make use of Weihrauch degrees (degrees of incomputability/discontinuity of partial multi-valued functions) to obtain Lifschitz-like relative realizability predicates. In this note, we present sample examples on how to lift some separation results on Weihrauch degrees to those over intuitionistic Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory ${\bf IZF}$.</description>

      <title>Stable reducts of elementary extensions of Presburger arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose $N$ is elementarily equivalent to an archimedean ordered abelian group $(G,+,&lt;)$ with small quotients (for all $1 \leq n &lt; \omega$, $[G: nG]$ is finite). Then every stable reduct of $N$ which expands $(G,+)$ (equivalently every reduct that does not add new unary definable sets) is interdefinable with $(G,+)$. This extends previous results on stable reducts of $(\mathbb{Z}, +, &lt;)$ to (stable) reducts of elementary extensions of $\mathbb{Z}$. In particular this holds for $G = \mathbb{Z}$ and $G = \mathbb{Q}$. As a result we answer a question of Conant from 2018.
  This result is a corollary of a more general statement about expansions of weakly-minimal 1-based expansions of abelian groups with small quotients preserving the algebraic closure operator.</description>

      <title>First-Order Intuitionistic Linear Logic and Hypergraph Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lambek calculus is a substructural logic known to be closely related to the formal language theory: on the one hand, it is used for generating formal languages by means of categorial grammars and, on the other hand, it has formal language semantics, with respect to which it is sound and complete. This paper studies a similar relation between first-order intuitionistic linear logic ILL1 along with its multiplicative fragment MILL1 on the one hand and the hypergraph grammar theory on the other. In the first part, we introduce a novel concept of hypergraph first-order logic categorial grammar, which is a generalisation of string MILL1 grammars studied e.g. in Richard Moot's 2014 works. We prove that hypergraph ILL1 grammars generate all recursively enumerable hypergraph languages and that hypergraph MILL1 grammars are as powerful as linear-time hypergraph transformation systems. In addition, we show that the class of languages generated by string MILL1 grammars is closed under intersection and that it includes a non-semilinear language as well as an NP-complete one. This shows how much more powerful string MILL1 grammars are as compared to Lambek categorial grammars.
  In the second part, we develop hypergraph language models for MILL1. In such models, formulae of the logic are interpreted as hypergraph languages and multiplicative conjunction is interpreted using parallel composition, which is one of the operations of HR-algebras introduced by Courcelle. We prove completeness of the universal-implicative fragment of MILL1 with respect to these models and thus present a new kind of semantics for a fragment of first-order linear logic.</description>

      <title>Three Fundamental Questions in Modern Infinite-Domain Constraint Satisfaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Feder-Vardi dichotomy conjecture for Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) with finite templates, confirmed independently by Bulatov and Zhuk, has an extension to certain well-behaved infinite templates due to Bodirsky and Pinsker which remains wide open. We provide answers to three fundamental questions on the scope of the Bodirsky-Pinsker conjecture. Our first two main results provide two simplifications of this scope, one of structural, and the other one of algebraic nature. The former simplification implies that the conjecture is equivalent to its restriction to templates without algebraicity, a crucial assumption in the most powerful classification methods. The latter yields that the higher-arity invariants of any template within its scope can be assumed to be essentially injective, and any algebraic condition characterizing any complexity class within the conjecture closed under Datalog reductions must be satisfiable by injections, thus lifting the mystery of the better applicability of certain conditions over others. Our third main result uses the first one to show that any non-trivially tractable template within the scope serves, up to a Datalog-computable modification of it, as the witness of the tractability of a non-finitely tractable finite-domain Promise Constraint Satisfaction Problem (PCSP) by the so-called sandwich method. This generalizes a recent result of Mottet and provides a strong hitherto unknown connection between the Bodirsky-Pinsker conjecture and finite-domain PCSPs.</description>

      <title>Ramsey expansions of metrically homogeneous graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02612</link>
      <description>arXiv:1707.02612v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate Ramsey expansions, the coherent extension property for partial isometries (EPPA), and the existence of a stationary independence relation for all classes of metrically homogeneous graphs from Cherlin's catalogue. We show that, with the exception of tree-like graphs, all metric spaces in the catalogue have precompact Ramsey expansions (or lifts) with the expansion property. With two exceptions we can also characterise the existence of a stationary independence relation and coherent EPPA.
  Our results are a contribution to Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il's classification programme of Ramsey classes and can be seen as empirical evidence of the recent convergence in techniques employed to establish the Ramsey property, the expansion property, EPPA and the existence of a stationary independence relation. At the heart of our proof is a canonical way of completing edge-labelled graphs to metric spaces in Cherlin's classes. The existence of such a ``completion algorithm'' then allows us to apply several strong results in the areas that imply EPPA or the Ramsey property.
  The main results have numerous consequences for the automorphism groups of the Fraisse limits of the classes. As corollaries, we prove amenability, unique ergodicity, existence of universal minimal flows, ample generics, small index property, 21-Bergman property and Serre's property (FA).</description>

      <title>Decidability of Querying First-Order Theories via Countermodels of Finite Width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06348v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generic framework for establishing the decidability of a wide range of logical entailment problems (briefly called querying), based on the existence of countermodels that are structurally simple, gauged by certain types of width measures (with treewidth and cliquewidth as popular examples). As an important special case of our framework, we identify logics exhibiting width-finite finitely universal model sets, warranting decidable entailment for a wide range of homomorphism-closed queries, subsuming a diverse set of practically relevant query languages. As a particularly powerful width measure, we propose to employ Blumensath's partitionwidth, which subsumes various other commonly considered width measures and exhibits highly favorable computational and structural properties. Focusing on the formalism of existential rules as a popular showcase, we explain how finite partitionwidth sets of rules subsume other known abstract decidable classes but - leveraging existing notions of stratification - also cover a wide range of new rulesets. We expose natural limitations for fitting the class of finite unification sets into our picture and suggest several options for remedy.</description>
