      <title>Technological folie \`a deux: Feedback Loops Between AI Chatbots and Mental Illness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence chatbots have achieved unprecedented adoption, with millions now using these systems for emotional support and companionship in contexts of widespread social isolation and capacity-constrained mental health services. While some users report psychological benefits, concerning edge cases are emerging, including reports of suicide, violence, and delusional thinking linked to perceived emotional relationships with chatbots. To understand this new risk profile we need to consider the interaction between human cognitive and emotional biases, and chatbot behavioural tendencies such as agreeableness (sycophancy) and adaptability (in-context learning). We argue that individuals with mental health conditions face increased risks of chatbot-induced belief destabilization and dependence, owing to altered belief-updating, impaired reality-testing, and social isolation. Current AI safety measures are inadequate to address these interaction-based risks. To address this emerging public health concern, we need coordinated action across clinical practice, AI development, and regulatory frameworks.</description>

      <title>Mixed genetic background better recapitulates developmental and psychiatric phenotypes and heterogeneity than inbred C57BL/6J mice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preclinical models of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions often rely on inbred mouse strains like C57BL/6J (B6), which exhibit limited genetic and behavioral variability. This limitation hampers the modeling of phenotypic heterogeneity, characteristic of these conditions. Recent efforts have explored the use of multiple genetically diverse hybrid strains to address this. In this study, we examined whether one single mixed genetic mouse background, C57BL/6J;129S2/SvPas (B6;129), could simultaneously recapitulate behavioral variability and display improved phenotypes relevant to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions. Compared to the inbred B6 strain, mixed B6;129 mice displayed enhanced sociability and self-grooming, two key discriminating parameters between the two mouse backgrounds and core features of such conditions, alongside a broader spectrum of individual behavioral variability. Although overall behavioral variability was comparable across backgrounds, B6;129 mice were less susceptible to the effects of chronic social isolation than their B6 counterparts.  Together, these findings support that the B6;129 mixed background offers a more representative model of individual variability and behavioral traits associated with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions, thereby enhancing its translational relevance in preclinical studies.</description>

      <title>Dual Mechanisms for Heterogeneous Responses of Inspiratory Neurons to Noradrenergic Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Respiration is an essential involuntary function necessary for survival. This poses a challenge for the control of breathing. The preB\"otzinger complex (preB\"otC) is a heterogeneous neuronal network responsible for driving the inspiratory rhythm. While neuromodulators such as norepinephrine (NE) allow it to be both robust and flexible for all living beings to interact with their environment, the basis for how neuromodulation impacts neuron-specific properties remains poorly understood. In this work, we examine how NE influences different preB\"otC neuronal subtypes by modeling its effects through modulating two key parameters: calcium-activated nonspecific cationic current gating conductance ($g_{\rm CAN}$) and inositol-triphosphate ($\rm IP_3$), guided by experimental studies. Our computational model captures the experimentally observed differential effects of NE on distinct preB\"otC bursting patterns. We show that this dual mechanism is critical for inducing conditional bursting and identify specific parameter regimes where silent neurons remain inactive in the presence of NE. Furthermore, using methods of dynamical systems theory, we uncover the mechanisms by which NE differentially modulates burst frequency and duration in NaP-dependent and CAN-dependent bursting neurons. These results align well with previously reported experimental findings and provide a deeper understanding of cell-specific neuromodulatory responses within the respiratory network.</description>

      <title>The Cognitive Foundations of Economic Exchange: A Modular Framework Grounded in Behavioral Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02945v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origins of economic behavior remain unresolved-not only in the social sciences but also in AI, where dominant theories often rely on predefined incentives or institutional assumptions. Contrary to the longstanding myth of barter as the foundation of exchange, converging evidence from early human societies suggests that reciprocity-not barter-was the foundational economic logic, enabling communities to sustain exchange and social cohesion long before formal markets emerged. Yet despite its centrality, reciprocity lacks a simulateable and cognitively grounded account. Here, we introduce a minimal behavioral framework based on three empirically supported cognitive primitives-individual recognition, reciprocal credence, and cost--return sensitivity-that enable agents to participate in and sustain reciprocal exchange, laying the foundation for scalable economic behavior. These mechanisms scaffold the emergence of cooperation, proto-economic exchange, and institutional structure from the bottom up. By bridging insights from primatology, developmental psychology, and economic anthropology, this framework offers a unified substrate for modeling trust, coordination, and economic behavior in both human and artificial systems.</description>

      <title>beta Hydroxybutyrate Targets C99 Driven Organelle Disruption in a Drosophila Model of Alzheimers Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11395v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The amyloid precursor protein (APP)-derived fragment C99 has emerged as a central driver of subcellular dysfunction in Alzheimers disease (AD), yet its precise interactome and contribution to mitochondrial and autophagy-lysosomal disruption remain incompletely defined. Here, we performed quantitative proteomic mapping of C99 associated proteins in a Drosophila AD model and identified three major functional modules nuclear gene expression, mitochondrial metabolism, and autophagy regulation frequently disrupted in AD. Among these, several C99 interactors showed altered association upon treatment with beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), a metabolic ketone body with emerging neuroprotective properties. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that C99 expression induced severe mitochondrial fragmentation, cristae loss, and the accumulation of dense vesicles with fibrillar contents, indicative of impaired organelle integrity and degradative failure. These abnormalities were substantially reversed by BHB treatment, which restored mitochondrial architecture, improved lysosomal acidification, and reduced the burden of aberrant vesicles. Functional assays confirmed that BHB also rescued lifespan and memory deficits in C99-expressing flies. Further, expression of selected C99 interactors such as PPME1 and VPS35 was sufficient to ameliorate neurodegenerative phenotypes in vivo, underscoring their functional relevance. Together, our findings define a multi-axis cellular pathology driven by C99 accumulation and demonstrate that metabolic intervention via BHB can reprogram disrupted proteomic networks and organelle homeostasis. These results establish a mechanistic link between ketone signaling and early subcellular dysfunction in AD, offering potential new targets for therapeutic intervention.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the geometry of visual relational reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans readily generalize abstract relations, such as recognizing "constant" in shape or color, whereas neural networks struggle, limiting their flexible reasoning. To investigate mechanisms underlying such generalization, we introduce SimplifiedRPM, a novel benchmark for systematically evaluating abstract relational reasoning, addressing limitations in prior datasets. In parallel, we conduct human experiments to quantify relational difficulty, enabling direct model-human comparisons. Testing four models, ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, Wild Relation Network, and Scattering Compositional Learner (SCL), we find that SCL generalizes best and most closely aligns with human behavior. Using a geometric approach, we identify key representation properties that accurately predict generalization and uncover a fundamental trade-off between signal and dimensionality: novel relations compress into training-induced subspaces. Layer-wise analysis reveals where relational structure emerges, highlights bottlenecks, and generates concrete hypotheses about abstract reasoning in the brain. Motivated by these insights, we propose SNRloss, a novel objective explicitly balancing representation geometry. Our results establish a geometric foundation for relational reasoning, paving the way for more human-like visual reasoning in AI and opening promising avenues for extending geometric analysis to broader cognitive tasks.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Recurrent Ensembles for Predicting Brain Responses to Naturalistic Movies (Algonauts 2025)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately predicting distributed cortical responses to naturalistic stimuli requires models that integrate visual, auditory and semantic information over time. We present a hierarchical multimodal recurrent ensemble that maps pretrained video, audio, and language embeddings to fMRI time series recorded while four subjects watched almost 80 hours of movies provided by the Algonauts 2025 challenge. Modality-specific bidirectional RNNs encode temporal dynamics; their hidden states are fused and passed to a second recurrent layer, and lightweight subject-specific heads output responses for 1000 cortical parcels. Training relies on a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum that gradually shifts emphasis from early sensory to late association regions. Averaging 100 model variants further boosts robustness. The resulting system ranked third on the competition leaderboard, achieving an overall Pearson r = 0.2094 and the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63) among all participants, with particularly strong gains for the most challenging subject (Subject 5). The approach establishes a simple, extensible baseline for future multimodal brain-encoding benchmarks.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Seq2Seq Transformer for Predicting Brain Responses to Naturalistic Stimuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge called on the community to develop encoding models that predict whole-brain fMRI responses to naturalistic multimodal movies. In this submission, we propose a sequence-to-sequence Transformer that autoregressively predicts fMRI activity from visual, auditory, and language inputs. Stimulus features were extracted using pretrained models including VideoMAE, HuBERT, Qwen, and BridgeTower. The decoder integrates information from prior brain states and current stimuli via dual cross-attention mechanisms that attend to both perceptual information extracted from the stimulus as well as narrative information provided by high-level summaries of the content. One core innovation of our approach is the use of sequences of multimodal context to predict sequences of brain activity, enabling the model to capture long-range temporal structure in both stimuli and neural responses. Another is the combination of a shared encoder with partial subject-specific decoder, which leverages common representational structure across subjects while accounting for individual variability. Our model achieves strong performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, demonstrating the effectiveness of temporally-aware, multimodal sequence modeling for brain activity prediction.
