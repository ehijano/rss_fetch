      <title>Modified Scattering and Asymptotic Completeness for the Derivative Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a modified scattering and asymptotic completeness for the derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. This is the first result proving asymptotic completeness in a quasilinear setting. Our approach combines the method of testing by wave packets, introduced by Ifrim and Tataru, a bootstrap argument, and the Klainerman Sobolev vector field method.</description>

      <title>Inverse problem for fractional Schr\"{o}dinger equations with drift on closed Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned about the inverse coefficient problems of variable-coefficient fractional Schr\"{o}dinger equations with drift on connected closed Riemannian manifolds. We prove that the knowledge of the underlying equation on any non-empty open subset of the underlying manifold determines the Riemannian metric, the drift and the potential, simultaneously and uniquely, up to a gauge transformation. This paper extends the result in \cite{feizmohammadi2021fractionalanisotropiccalderonproblem} for principal terms. Not only can we retrieve lower order terms, but we are also able to achieve the simultaneous inversion of all terms. The key ingredient is a novel Runge approximation of fractional PDEs on Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Controllability and mixing for acoustic wave motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the dynamical behaviors of acoustic wave motion driven by a force acting through the boundary. If the boundary force is a suitable control, we show that the dynamical system associated to the acoustic wave motion is exactly controllable. Furthermore, when it is random perturbation of white noise type, we prove that the corresponding stochastic system is strong mixing. The bridge between these two problems is the observability inequality, which will be established in this work.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of transonic shock solutions in general approximate nozzles for steady potential flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the uniqueness of solutions with a transonic shock in a two-dimensional Riemannian manifold with a special metric, which can be regarded as an approximate model of the general physical nozzles, within a class of transonic shock solutions for steady potential flow. We first prove the uniqueness of these solutions on the unit 2-sphere: for given uniform supersonic upstream flow at the entry, there exists a unique uniform pressure at the exit such that a transonic shock solution exists in the sphere, which is unique modulo a translation. A similar result is then extended to a class of manifolds. Mathematically, it is equivalent to showing a uniqueness theorem for a free boundary problem of a second-order elliptic-hyperbolic mixed-type partial differential equation in the general approximate nozzles. The proof is based on the maximum/comparison principle with a suitable special transonic shock solution as a comparison function.</description>

Abstract: We study the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations forced by space-time white noise and diffused via the fractional Laplacian with Lions' exponent so that it is precisely the energy-critical case. We prove its global solution theory following the approach of Hairer and Rosati (2024, Annals of PDE, \textbf{10}, pp. 1--46).</description>

      <title>Hypersonic similarity law for steady compressible Euler flows past slender bodies within the framework of Radon measure solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a mathematical theory on statement and validation of the hypersonic similarity law within the framework of Radon measure solutions of steady compressible Euler equations. We consider two scenarios: (1) two-dimensional steady non-isentropic compressible Euler flows past an infinitely long slender curved wedge; (2) three-dimensional steady non-isentropic compressible Euler flows past an infinitely long axisymmetric cone.
  It turns out that, for the hypersonic flow passing through a slender body with tiny slenderness $\tau$, if the parameter $K\doteq M_{\infty}\tau$ is fixed, by taking $\tau \to 0$ (i.e., the Mach number of the upcoming flow $M_{\infty} \to \infty$), the flow field structures (after scaling) no longer depend on the body's shape and the Mach number $M_{\infty}$ independently, but only on $K$ and adiabatic index $\gamma$ of the polytropic gas. Mathematically, for non-isentropic Euler flows, we find a new system of hypersonic small-disturbance equations to describe steady compressible hypersonic flows passing slender bodies. We demonstrate that as $ \tau \to0$, under suitable non-dimensional scalings, the Radon measure solutions of the original problems of hypersonic flow passing bodies converge to those of corresponding hypersonic small-disturbance problems. The explicit forms of the Radon measure solutions derived for the two scenarios effectively simplify the convergence analysis.</description>

      <title>Solitonic and Exact Solutions for a Viscous Traffic Flow Model Via Lie Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies a macroscopic traffic flow model driven by a system of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations. Using Lie symmetry analysis, we determine the infinitesimal generators and construct an optimal system of one-dimensional subalgebras, facilitating symmetry reductions for the governing system. In addition, we discussed the classical symmetry and solution of the traffic flow model with the initial conditions left invariant. By applying the method of nonlinear self-adjointness, conservation laws associated with the model are established and are utilized to obtain exact solutions. Using these exact solutions, we construct solitonic solutions, including kink-type, peakon-type, and parabolic solitons. Additionally, using the weak discontinuity $C^1$ wave illustrates nonlinear wave dynamics in traffic evolution. Moreover, we investigate how these solutions affect traffic behavior, clarifying shock wave development and flow stability. The results provide a basis for useful applications in traffic management, real-time traffic control, and intelligent transportation systems, as well as improving mathematical knowledge of traffic dynamics.</description>

      <title>$(H,H^3)$-smoothing effect and convergence of solutions of stochastic two-dimensional anisotropic Navier-Stokes equations driven by colored noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the higher regularity and convergence of solutions of anisotropic Navier-Stokes (NS) equations with additive colored noise and white noise on two-dimensional torus $\mathbb T^2$. Under the conditions that the external force $f(\textbf{x})$ belongs to the phase space $ H$ and the noise intensity function $h(\textbf{x})$ satisfies $\|\nabla h\|_{L^\infty} \leq \sqrt{\pi\delta} \frac{\nu \lambda_1}{2}$, it was proved that the random anisotropic NS equations possess a tempered $(H,H^2)$-random attractor whose (box-counting) fractal dimension in $H^2$ is finite. This was achieved by establishing, first, an $H^2$ bounded absorbing set and, second, an $(H,H^2)$-smoothing effect of the system which lifts the compactness and finite-dimensionality of the attractor in $H$ to that in $H^2$. Since the force $f$ belongs only to $H$, the $H^2$-regularity of solutions as well as the $H^2$-bounded absorbing set was constructed by an indirect approach of estimating the $H^2$-distance between the solution of the random anisotropic NS equations and that of the corresponding deterministic anisotropic NS equations. When the external force $f(\textbf{x})$ belongs to $H^2$ and the noise intensity function $h(\textbf{x})$ satisfies the Assumption 2, it was proved that the random anisotropic NS equations possess a tempered $(H,H^3)$-random attractor whose (box-counting) fractal dimension in $H^3$ is finite. Finally, we prove the upper semi-continuity of random attractors and the convergence of solutions of (8.3) as $\delta\rightarrow0$ in the spaces $(H,H)$, $(H,H^1)$, $(H^1,H^2)$ and $(H^2,H^3)$, respectively.</description>

      <title>The cut-off resolvent can grow arbitrarily fast in obstacle scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider time-harmonic acoustic scattering by a compact sound-soft obstacle $\Gamma\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ ($n\geq 2$) that has connected complement $\Omega := \mathbb{R}^n\setminus \Gamma$. This scattering problem is modelled by the inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation $\Delta u + k^2 u = -f$ in $\Omega$, the boundary condition that $u=0$ on $\partial \Omega = \partial \Gamma$, and the standard Sommerfeld radiation condition. It is well-known that, if the boundary $\partial \Omega$ is smooth, then the norm of the cut-off resolvent of the Laplacian, that maps the compactly supported inhomogeneous term $f$ to the solution $u$ restricted to some ball, grows at worst exponentially with $k$. In this paper we show that, if no smoothness of $\Gamma$ is imposed, then the growth can be arbitrarily fast. Precisely, given some modestly increasing unbounded sequence $0&lt;k_1&lt;k_2&lt;\ldots$ and some arbitrarily rapidly increasing sequence $0&lt;a_1&lt;a_2&lt;\ldots$, we construct a compact $\Gamma$ such that, for each $j\in \mathbb{N}$, the norm of the cut-off resolvent at $k=k_j$ is $&gt;a_j$.</description>

      <title>Construction of blow-up solution with minimal mass for 2D cubic Zakharov--Kuznetsov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we construct a minimal mass blow-up solution of the two-dimensional cubic (mass-critical) Zakharov--Kuznetsov equation:
  \begin{equation*}
  \partial_t \phi+\partial_{x_1}(\Delta \phi+\phi^3)=0,\quad (t,x)\in [0,\infty)\times \mathbb{R}^2.
  \end{equation*}
  Let $s&gt;\frac{3}{4}$. Bhattacharya-Farah-Roudenko [2] show that $H^{s}$ solutions with $\|\phi\|_{L^{2}}&lt;\|Q\|_{L^{2}}$ are global in time. For such low regularity solutions, we study the dynamics at the threshold $\|\phi\|_{L^{2}}=\|Q\|_{L^{2}}$ and demonstrate that finite time blow-up singularity formation may occur. This result and its proof are inspired by the recent blow-up result [29] for the mass-critical gKdV equation. This result is also complement of previous result [6] for nonexistence of minimal mass blow-up element in the energy space $H^{1}(\mathbb{R}^{2})$ of the two-dimensional cubic Zakharov--Kuznetsov equation.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of a boundary hemivariational inequality for stationary and non-stationary 2D and 3D convective Brinkman-Forchheimer equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates boundary hemivariational inequality problems associated with both stationary and non-stationary two and three-dimensional convective Brinkman-Forchheimer equations (or Navier-stokes equations with damping), which model the flow of viscous incompressible fluids through saturated porous media. The governing equations are nonlinear in both velocity and pressure and are subject to nonstandard boundary conditions. Specifically, we impose the no-slip condition along with a Clarke subdifferential relation between pressure and the normal velocity components. For the stationary case, we establish the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions using a surjectivity theorem for pseudomonotone operators. The existence of weak solutions to the non-stationary hemivariational inequality is established via a limiting process applied to a temporally semi-discrete scheme, where the time derivative is approximated using the backward Euler method-commonly referred to as the Rothe method. It is demonstrated that the discrete problem admits solutions, which possess a weakly convergent subsequence as the time step tends to zero, and that any such weak limit satisfies the original hemivariational inequality. A novel outcome of this paper is that the existence results obtained in this work is applicable to 3D non-stationary Navier-Stokes equations also. Moreover, under appropriate conditions on the absorption exponent, we show that Leray-Hopf weak solutions satisfies the energy equality, the solution is shown to be unique and to depend continuously on the given data.</description>

      <title>Superposition Property in Disjoint Variables for the Infinity Laplace Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a superposition principle in disjoint variables for the inhomogeneous infinity-Laplace equation. We show that the sum of viscosity solutions of the inhomogeneous infinity-Laplace equation in separate domains is a viscosity solution in the product domain. This result has been used in the literature with certain particular choices of solutions to simplify regularity analysis for a general inhomogeneous infinity-Laplace equation by reducing it to the case without sign-changing inhomogeneous terms and vanishing gradient singularities. We present a proof of this superposition principle for general viscosity solutions. We also explore generalization in metric spaces using cone comparison techniques and study related properties for general elliptic and convex equations.</description>

Abstract: We show that the one-dimensional three-component Grad system admits solutions that violate the Chapman--Enskog scaling in Knudsen number. In particular, there exist solutions that do not converge to the analogues of the Euler and Navier--Stokes equations for vanishing Knudsen number. These non-hydrodynamic solutions correspond to a fast spectral manifold in kinetic phase space.</description>

Abstract: The continuous dependence on the initial data and consequently the uniqueness of bounded weak solutions to a class of triangular reaction-cross-diffusion equations is shown. The class includes doubly degenerate equations for nutrient taxis models describing the response of bacteria to nutrient conditions. The proof is based on a careful use of the $H^{-1}$ method. The present manuscript is in draft form and will be revised soon.</description>

      <title>Landau damping and the long-time collisionless limit of the Vlasov-Poisson-Landau Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Vlasov-Poisson-Landau Equations on $\mathbb{T}^3\times \mathbb{R}^3$ with small collision frequency $\nu\ll 1$. We prove that for $\nu$-independent perturbations of the global Maxwellians in Gevrey-$2_-$, solutions display uniform-in-$\nu$ Landau damping and enhanced dissipation. Moreover, the collisionless limit holds, that is, as $\nu\to 0_+$ for $0&lt;t\ll \nu^{-\frac{1}{3}}$, the $\nu &gt; 0$ solutions converge uniformly (and in much stronger norms) to the solution of the Vlasov-Poisson equation with the same initial data. To our knowledge, this work is hence the first justification that the collisionless prediction matches those of collisional plasmas in the nonlinear equations.
  The interaction between Landau damping and collisions requires several new ideas:
  (1) an infinite-regularity commuting vector field method, merged with Guo's weighted energy methods for the Landau operator and hypocoercivity to extract the enhanced dissipation;
  (2) A novel nearly-physical side treatment of the collisionless Vlasov echoes;
  (3) A new set of decomposition methods to treat the effects of the nonlinear collisions in the Volterra equation for the density (i.e., the ``collisional echoes'')
  (4) A new quasi-linearization method for treating the effect of the slowly evolving homogeneous modes over long times.
  As a side result, we also prove Landau damping and enhanced dissipation of $O(\epsilon\nu^{1/3})$ Sobolev-space perturbations of homogeneous distributions that are only $O(\epsilon)$ perturbations of global Maxwellians, generalizing the recent results of Chaturvedi, Luk, and Nguyen. As another side result, our methods also provide a nearly-completely physical-side proof of Mouhot and Villani's theorem in the full range of Gevrey-$3_-$.</description>

      <title>Moving boundary problems with Ermakov symmetry reduction: nonlinear superposition principle and reciprocal transformation applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moving boundary problems of Stefan-type for a novel third order nonlinear evolution equation with temporal modulation are here shown to be amenable to exact Airy-type solution via a classical Ermakov equation with its admitted nonlinear superposition principle. Application of the latter together with a class of involutory transformations sets the original moving boundary problem in a wide class with temporal modulation. As an appendix, reciprocally associated exactly solvable moving boundary problems are derived.</description>

      <title>Controllability of a system of non-autonomous degenerate coupled parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a Carleman estimate for a one-dimensional parabolic equation which degenerates at one extremity of the domain and has a bounded, time dependent coefficient multiplying the diffusion term. Then we use the estimate to show the null controllability of a coupled system characterized by this form of diffusion operator and bounded coefficients.</description>

      <title>Green functions, Hitchin's formula and curvature equations on tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G(z)=G(z;\tau)$ be the Green function on the torus $E_{\tau}=\mathbb{C}/(\mathbb{Z}+\mathbb{Z}\tau)$ with the singularity at $0$. Lin and Wang (Ann. Math. 2010) proved that $G(z)$ has either $3$ or $5$ critical points (depending on the choice of $\tau$). Later, Bergweiler and Eremenko (Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 2016) gave a new proof of this remarkable result by using anti-holomorphic dynamics.
  In this paper, firstly, we prove that once $G(z)$ has $5$ critical points, then these $5$ critical points are all non-degenerate. Secondly, we prove that for any $p\in E_{\tau}$ satisfying $p\neq -p$ in $E_{\tau}$, the number of critical points of $G_p(z):=\frac12(G(z+p)+G(z-p))$ belongs to $\{4,6,8,10\}$ (depending on the choice of $(\tau, p)$) and each number really occurs. We apply Hitchin's formula to prove the generic non-degeneracy of critical points. This allows us to study the distribution of the numbers of critical points of $G_p$ as $p$ varies. Applications to the curvature equation $\Delta u+e^{u}=4\pi(\delta_{p}+\delta_{-p})$ on $E_{\tau}$ are also given. How the geometry of the torus affects the solution structure is studied.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study the existence of ground state solutions for the asymptotically periodic Schr\"odinger-Poisson systems which are coupled by a Schr\"odinger equation of $p$-Laplacian and a Poisson equation of $q$-Laplacian. The method relies on a variational approach and the case of the nonlinearity exhibits a critical growth is also considered. Some results in the literature are extended.</description>

      <title>Barron regularity of many particle Schr\"odinger eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the regularity of Schr\"odinger eigenfunctions and the solvability of Schr\"odinger equations in spectral Barron space $\mathcal{B}^{s}(\mathbb{R}^{nN})$, where neural networks exhibit dimension-free approximation capabilities. Under assumptions that the potential $V$ consists of one-particle and pairwise interaction parts $V_{i},V_{ij}$ in Fourier-Lebesgue space $\mathcal{F}L_{s}^{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n})+\mathcal{F}L_{s}^{\alpha^{\prime}}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ and an additional part $V_{\operatorname{a d}} \in \mathcal{F}L_{s}^{1}(\mathbb{R}^{nN})$, we prove that all eigenfunctions $\psi\in \bigcap_{\gamma&lt;s+2-n/\alpha} \mathcal{B}^{\gamma}(\mathbb{R}^{nN})$ and $\psi\in \mathcal{B}^{s+2}(\mathbb{R}^{nN})$ if $\alpha=\infty$, where $1/\alpha+1/\alpha^{\prime}=1$ and $2+s-|s|-n/\alpha&gt;0$. The assumption accommodates many prevalent singular potentials, such as inverse power potentials. Moreover, under the same assumption or a stronger assumption $V\in\mathcal{B}^{s}(\mathbb{R}^{nN})$, we establish the solvability of Schr\"odinger equations and derive compactness results for $V\in\mathcal{B}^{s}(\mathbb{R}^{nN})$ with $s&gt;-1$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the well-posedness results of the three dimensional stationary Navier--Stokes equations (SNS) in some critical hybrid type Besov spaces with respect to the scaling invariant structure of (SNS). Although such critical functional spaces contain the functions with singularities, we give some sufficient conditions such that the $L^{\infty}$-norm of the solutions of (SNS) decay at the infinity within some polynomial type rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional incompressible inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes equations with odd viscosity, where the shear and the odd viscosity coefficients depend continuously on the unknown density function. We establish the existence of weak solutions in both the evolutionary and stationary cases. Furthermore, we investigate the limit of the weak solutions as the odd viscosity coefficient converges to a constant. Lastly, we consider examples of stationary solutions for parallel, concentric and radial flows.</description>

      <title>Local Well-Posedness of the Cahn-Hilliard-Biot System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show short-time well-posedness of a diffuse interface model describing the flow of a fluid through a deformable porous medium consisting of two phases. The system non-linearly couples Biot's equations for poroelasticity, including phase-field dependent material properties, with the Cahn-Hilliard equation to model the evolution of the solid, where we further distinguish between the absence and presence of a visco-elastic term of Kelvin-Voigt type. While both problems will be reduced to a fixed-point equation that can be solved using maximal regularity theory along with a contraction argument, the first case relies on a semigroup approach over suitable Hilbert spaces, whereas treating the second case under minimal assumptions with respect to spatial regularity necessitates the application of Banach scales.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we show the necessary and sufficient conditions for the inequality $\|u\|_{L_t^qL_x^r}\lesssim \|u\|_{X^{s,b}}$, where $$\|u\|_{X^{s,b}}:=\|\hat{u}(\tau,\xi)\langle \xi\rangle^s\langle \tau-\xi^3\rangle^b \|_{L_{\tau,\xi}^2}. $$ Here, we provide a complete classification of the indices relationships for which this inequality holds true. Such estimates will be very useful in solving the well-posedness for low regularity well-posedness of the Korteweg--de Vries equations and stochastic Korteweg--de Vries equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study extrema of solutions to the heat equation (i.e. hot spots) on certain types of warped product manifolds of the form $([0,L]\times M,dr^2+f(r)^2h)$ where $(M,h)$ is a closed Riemannian manifold. We prove that, under certain conditions on the warping function $f$, the statement of Rauch's hot spots conjecture holds for the corresponding warped product. We then go on to study the long-time behavior of hot spots on infinite cones over closed Riemannian manifolds. In this case, under appropriate hypotheses on the initial condition, there are four possible long-time behaviors depending only on the spectral gap of the fiber $(M,h)$.</description>

      <title>A Regularized Interface Method for Fluid-Poroelastic Structure Interaction Problems with Nonlinear Geometric Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new regularized interface method for proving existence of weak solutions to nonlinear moving boundary problems with low-regularity interfaces. We study a fluid-poroelastic structure interaction (FPSI) problem coupling the Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible viscous fluid with the Biot system for a bulk poroelastic medium. The two phases occupy domains of the same spatial dimension, separated by a moving interface defined by the trace of the poroelastic displacement, which exhibits low regularity and strong geometric nonlinearities. Despite its importance in applications, no existence theory has been available for this nonlinear moving-domain setting, primarily because the lack of interface regularity precludes even the formulation of a weak solution framework.
  To address this gap, we (1) introduce a regularization of the Biot displacement via spatial convolution at scale $\delta &gt; 0$, which defines regularized moving domains and interface, and (2) modify the weak formulation in a way that preserves energy consistency with the original problem. For each fixed $\delta &gt; 0$, we prove existence of a weak solution to the resulting regularized interface problem. The proof strategy involves inserting a thin plate of thickness $h &gt; 0$ at the interface, applying a time-discretization via a Lie operator splitting scheme, establishing uniform a priori bounds, and employing Aubin-Lions compactness on moving domains. The analysis is particularly involved, partly because the thin plate allows displacements in all spatial directions. Passing to the limit $h \to 0$ with uniform-in-h estimates and compactness arguments yields a regularized interface weak solution. The regularization introduced in this manuscript is essential to maintain uniform geometric control of the moving interface and to accommodate vector-valued structural displacements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deep Kolmogorov method is a simple and popular deep learning based method for approximating solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) of the Kolmogorov type. In this work we provide an error analysis for the deep Kolmogorov method for heat PDEs. Specifically, we reveal convergence with convergence rates for the overall mean square distance between the exact solution of the heat PDE and the realization function of the approximating deep neural network (DNN) associated with a stochastic optimization algorithm in terms of the size of the architecture (the depth/number of hidden layers and the width of the hidden layers) of the approximating DNN, in terms of the number of random sample points used in the loss function (the number of input-output data pairs used in the loss function), and in terms of the size of the optimization error made by the employed stochastic optimization method.</description>

      <title>The Free Energy of an Enriched Continuous Random Energy Model in the Weak Correlation Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the proof of the limiting free energy of the continuous random energy model (CREM) using the Hamilton--Jacobi approach for mean-field disordered systems. To achieve this, we introduce an enriched model that interpolates between the CREM and the Ruelle probability cascade. We focus on the weak correlation regime, where the CREM's covariance function $A$ is bounded above by the identity function.
  In the weak correlation regime, we show that the free energy is given by the Hopf formula. The resulting expression is independent of $A$, confirming that in this regime the free energy does not depend on the precise form of the covariance function. Outside of the weak correlation regime, the Hamilton--Jacobi framework no longer applies. Moreover, we provide an example where a formal application of the associated variational principle fails to yield the correct free energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the quantitative homogenization of first-order ODEs. For single-scale scalar ODEs, we obtain a sharp $O(\varepsilon)$ convergence rate and characterize the effective constant. In the multi-scale setting, our results match those of \cite{IM} for long times but improve the short-time error to $O(\varepsilon)$. We also initiate the study of quasi-periodic homogenization in this context. The scalar framework is further extended to higher dimensions under a boundedness assumption on trajectories. For weakly coupled systems with fast switching rates, we obtain for the first time a convergence rate of order $O(\varepsilon)$. These results have applications to linear transport equations and broader connections to PDEs and gradient systems.</description>

Abstract: In their seminal work (Amer. J. Math. 78: 289-309, 1956), Calder\'on and Zygmund introduced the maximal truncated rough singular integral operator and established its $L^p$-boundedness for $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$. However, the endpoint case $p = 1$ remained an open problem. This paper resolves this problem. More precisely, we prove that the maximal truncated rough singular integral operator is of weak type $(1,1)$.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Backscatter Model for Unstructured Solvers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Stochastic Backscatter Model involves the generation of a set of random variables characterised by prescribed correlations in space and time. These variables are obtained by smoothing an initially uncorrelated random field, which produces an exponentially decaying spatial correlation. The smoothing is applied implicitly and sequentially along the three coordinate directions of the computational domain, making the approach suitable only for structured CFD solvers. To extend the method to unstructured solvers, implicit Laplace smoothing can be employed instead. However, the spatial correlation resulting from this alternative approach must be derived analytically. This constitutes the main objective of the present dissertation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a family of periodic scalar operators for which one can define flat bands in the sense of Floquet--Bloch theory. One puzzling question originating in recent physics literature is a quantisation rule for the values of parameters at which these flat bands occur. We present a general theorem about the structure of solutions to the corresponding equation and a heuristic argument explaining their WKB structure in a specific case. That structure also explains the quantisation condition -- both the WKB structure and that rule are confirmed by numerical experiments. Finally, we consider a simplified model in which separation of variables allows the use of complex WKB methods.</description>

Abstract: We consider here a two-dimensional incompressible fluid in a periodic channel, whose density is advected by pure transport, and whose velocity is given by the Stokes equation with gravity source term. Dirichlet boundary conditions are taken for the velocity field on the bottom and top of the channel, and periodic conditions in the horizontal variable. We prove that the affine stratified density profile is stable under small perturbations in Sobolev spaces and prove convergence of the density to another limiting stratified density profile for large time with an explicit algebraic decay rate. Moreover, we are able to precisely identify the limiting profile as the decreasing vertical rearrangement of the initial density. Finally, we show that boundary layers are formed for large times in the vicinity of the upper and lower boundaries. These boundary layers, which had not been identified in previous works, are given by a self-similar Ansatz and driven by a linear mechanism. This allows us to precisely characterize the long-time behavior beyond the constant limiting profile and reach more optimal decay rates.</description>

      <title>A multifluid model with chemically reacting components -- construction of weak solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11911v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of weak solutions to a multi-component system, consisting of compressible chemically reacting components, coupled with the compressible Stokes equation for the velocity. Specifically, we consider the case of irreversible chemical reactions and assume a nonlinear relation between the pressure and the particular densities. These assumptions cause the additional difficulties in the mathematical analysis, due to the possible presence of vacuum.
  It is shown that there exists a global weak solution, satisfying the $L^\infty$ bounds for all the components. We obtain strong compactness of the sequence of densities in $L^p$ spaces, under the assumption that all components are strictly positive. The applied method captures the properties of models of high generality, which admit an arbitrary number of components. Furthermore, the framework that we develop can handle models that contain both diffusing and non-diffusing elements.</description>

      <title>Rectifiability and tangents in a rough Riemannian setting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00589v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing rectifiability of Radon measures in Euclidean space has led to fundamental contributions to geometric measure theory. Conditions involving existence of principal values of certain singular integrals \cite{mattila1995rectifiable} and the existence of densities with respect to Euclidean balls \cite{preiss1987geometry} have given rise to major breakthroughs. We study similar questions in a rough elliptic setting where Euclidean balls $B(a,r)$ are replaced by ellipses $B_{\Lambda}(a,r)$ whose eccentricity and principal axes depend on $a$.
  Given $\Lambda : \mathbb{R}^{n} \to GL(n,\mathbb{R})$, consider the family of ellipses $B_{\Lambda}(a,r) = a + \Lambda(a) B(0,r)$. We characterize $m$-rectifiability in terms of the almost everywhere existence of the densities $$ \theta^{m}_{\Lambda(a)}(\mu,a) = \lim_{r \downarrow 0} \frac{\mu(B_{\Lambda}(a,r))}{r^{m}} \in (0, \infty). $$
  We characterize $m$-rectifiable measures in terms of the existence of the principal values-- and even under the weaker assumptions that $$ \lim_{\epsilon \downarrow 0} \int_{B_{\Lambda}(a,\epsilon R) \setminus B_{\Lambda}(a, \epsilon r)} \frac{\Lambda(a)^{-1}(y-a)}{|\Lambda(a)^{-1}(y-a)|^{m+1}} d \mu(y) = 0 \quad \forall 0 &lt; r &lt; R $$ when $0 &lt; \theta^{m}_{*}(\mu,a) &lt; \infty$ almost everywhere.
  We apply the second result to characterize $(n-1)$-rectifiable measures in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ in terms of the behavior of the gradient of the single layer potential to the PDE $L_{A} u = - \textrm{div}(A \nabla u)$ under weak continuity assumptions on $A$.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many isolas of modulational instability for Stokes waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05854v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proves long-standing conjectures regarding the existence of infinitely many high-frequency modulational instability ``isolas" for a Stokes wave in arbitrary depth $ \mathtt{h} &gt; 0 $, under longitudinal perturbations. We provide a complete characterization of the unstable spectral bands in the $L^2(\mathbb{R})$-spectrum of the water wave equations linearized around a Stokes wave of sufficiently small amplitude $\epsilon$. The unstable spectrum is the union of isolated ``isolas" of elliptical shape, indexed by integers $ \mathtt{p}\geq 2 $, each with semiaxis of size $ |\beta_1^{(\mathtt{p})} (\mathtt{h})| \epsilon^\mathtt{p}+ O(\epsilon^{\mathtt{p}+2} )$. As first key achievement, we obtain an explicit formula for the coefficient $ \beta_1^{(\mathtt{p})} (\mathtt{h}) $ for any $ \mathtt{p} \geq 2 $, that remarkably depends solely on the maximal Taylor-Fourier coefficients of the Stokes wave. We provide simple expressions of the asymptotic expansion of such coefficients in the shallow-water limit $ \mathtt{h} \to 0^+ $, for any $ \mathtt{p} \geq 2 $. This allows to establish that the analytic function $\beta_1^{(\mathtt{p})}(\mathtt{h})$ is not zero for any $\mathtt{p} \geq 2$, by verifying that a combinatorial sum is not zero; this relies on a crucial combinatorial identity due to Koutschan, van Hoeij, and Zeilberger.</description>

Abstract: We look for travelling wave fields $$ E(x,y,z,t)= U(x,y) \cos(kz+\omega t)+ \widetilde U(x,y)\sin(kz+\omega t),\quad (x,y,z)\in\mathbb{R}^3,\, t\in\mathbb{R}, $$ satisfying Maxwell's equations in a nonlinear and cylindrically symmetric medium. We obtain a sequence of solutions with diverging energy that is different from that obtained by McLeod, Stuart, and Troy. In addition, we consider a more general nonlinearity, controlled by an \textit{N}-function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate existence of topologically nontrivial energy minimizing maps of a given positive degree from bounded domains in the plane to $\mathbb S^2$ in a variational model describing magnetizations in ultrathin ferromagnetic films with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Our strategy is to insert tiny truncated Belavin-Polyakov profiles in carefully chosen locations of lower degree objects such that the total energy increase lies strictly below the expected Dirichlet energy contribution, ruling out loss of degree in the limits of minimizing sequences. The argument requires that the domain be either sufficiently large or sufficiently slender to accommodate a prescribed degree. We also show that these higher degree minimizers concentrate on point-like skyrmionic configurations in a suitable parameter regime.</description>

      <title>Rigidly breaking potential flows and a countable Alexandrov theorem for polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05606v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study all the ways that a given convex body in $d$ dimensions can break into countably many pieces that move away from each other rigidly at constant velocity, with no rotation or shearing. The initial velocity field is locally constant, but may be continuous and/or fail to be integrable. For any choice of mass-velocity pairs for the pieces, such a motion can be generated by the gradient of a convex potential that is affine on each piece. We classify such potentials in terms of a countable version of a theorem of Alexandrov for convex polytopes, and prove a stability theorem. For bounded velocities, there is a bijection between the mass-velocity data and optimal transport flows (Wasserstein geodesics) that are locally incompressible.
  Given any rigidly breaking velocity field that is the gradient of a continuous potential, the convexity of the potential is established under any of several conditions, such as the velocity field being continuous, the potential being semi-convex, the mass measure generated by a convexified transport potential being absolutely continuous, or there being a finite number of pieces. Also we describe a number of curious and paradoxical examples having fractal structure.</description>

      <title>Long time well-posedness for the 3D Prandtl boundary layer equations with a special structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10052v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with existence, uniqueness and stability of the solution for the 3D Prandtl equation in a polynomial weighted Sobolev space. The main novelty of this paper is to directly prove the long time well-posedness to 3D Prandtl equation under monotonicity condition $\partial_{z} u &gt;0$ and a special structural assumption $v=Ku$ $\big(\partial_{z}\big(\frac{v}{u}\big) \equiv 0\big)$ by the energy method. Moreover, the solution's lifespan can be extended to any large $T$, provided that the initial data with a perturbation lie in the monotonic shear profile of small size $e^{-T}$. This result extends the local well-posedness results established by Liu-Wang-Yang \cite{Liu-Wang-Yang-1-2017} (Adv. Math. 308 (2017) 1074-1126) and Qin-Wang \cite{Qin-Wang-2024} (J. Math. Pure. Appl. 194 (2025) 103670) for the 3D Prandtl equations to long-time well-posedness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a nonautonomous semilinear elliptic problem where the power nonlinearity is multiplied by a discontinuous coefficient that equals one inside a bounded open set $\Omega$ and it equals minus one in its complement. In the slightly subcritical regime, we prove the existence of concentrating positive and nodal solutions. Moreover, depending on the geometry of $\Omega$, we establish multiplicity of positive solutions. Finally, in the critical case, we show the existence of a blow-up positive solution when $\Omega$ has nontrivial topology. Our proofs rely on a Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction strategy which in these problems turns out to be remarkably simple. We take this opportunity to highlight certain aspects of the method that are often overlooked and present it in a more accessible and detailed manner for nonexperts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let rarefied gas be confined in an infinite layer with diffusely reflecting boundaries that are isothermal and non-moving. The initial-boundary value problem on the nonlinear Boltzmann equation governing the rarefied gas flow in such setting is challenging due to unboundedness of both domain and its boundaries as well as the presence of physical boundary conditions. In the paper, we establish the global-in-time dynamics of such rarefied gas flows near global Maxwellians in three or two-dimensions. For the former case, we also prove that the solutions decay in time at a polynomial rate which is the same as that of solutions to the two-dimensional heat equation. This is the first result on global solutions of the Boltzmann equation with non-compact and diffuse boundaries.</description>

Abstract: In this work we study the level sets of entire solutions of the Allen-Cahn equation and we prove minimality of the zero level set with respect to a certain perimeter functional with density. This provides a direct relationship between phase transition type problems and minimal surfaces with some weight. In addition, we obtain that the zero level set of entire solutions of the Allen-Cahn equation has zero mean curvature. As an application, we establish the De Giorgi conjecture in it's original statement, without the limiting assumption of O. Savin, by reducing it to classical Bernstein type results for minimal graphs, thus directly linking it to the geometric problem.</description>

By the same method, we obtain estimates for solutions to reaction-diffusion systems modelling reversible chemistry.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of Lp Minkowski problem in the supercritical range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06946v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The uniqueness of the $L_p$-Minkowski problem has been a long standing problem in convex geometry. In the groundbreaking paper by Brendle-Choi-Daskalopoulos (Acta Math, {\bf219}, 2017), a full uniqueness result was shown for the subcritical exponents $p\in(-n-1,1]$. In the supercritical range, the uniqueness problem is much more complicated, even on the planar case $n=1$. One of the famous results was shown by Andrews in (J. Amer. Math. Soc., {\bf16}, 2003), where he established that the uniqueness holds in the range $p\in(-7,-2)$ and fails to hold for the other supercritical exponents $p\in(-\infty,-7)$. In this paper, we study the same uniqueness problem in the full supercritical range $p\in(-2n-5,-n-1)$ for all higher dimensional cases $n\geq2$. We will prove that for $p\in(-2n-5,-n-1)$, the unique strongly symmetric solution is given by the unit sphere ${\S}^n$. The uniqueness range $(-2n-5,-n-1)$ is optimal due to our recent preprint (arXiv: 2104.07426), where non-spherical strongly symmetric solutions have been constructed for all $p\in(-\infty,-2n-5)$. When considering general solutions which may not be symmetric, the uniqueness set $\Gamma$ of $p$ for which the uniqueness holds, is shown to be both relatively open and closed in the full interval $(-2n-5,-n-1)$.</description>

      <title>The Brezis-Nirenberg and logistic problem for the Logarithmic Laplacian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the non-local analogue of Brezis-Nirenberg and logistic type elliptic equations involving the logarithmic Laplacian and critical logarithmic non-linearity with superlinear-subcritical perturbation.
  In the first part of this work, we derive new sharp, continuous and compact embeddings of nonlocal Sobolev spaces (of order zero) into Orlicz type spaces. As an application of these embeddings and variational analysis as carried out in \cite{Angeles-Saldana-2023, Santamaria-Saldana-2022}, we prove the existence of a least energy weak solution of the Brezis-Nirenberg and logistic type problem involving the logarithmic Laplacian. For the uniqueness of solution, we prove a new D\'iaz-Saa type inequality, which is of independent interest and can be applied to a larger class of problems.
  In the second part of the work, depending upon the growth of non-linearity and regularity of the weight function, we study the small-order asymptotic of non-local weighted elliptic equations involving the fractional Laplacian of order $2s.$ We show that least energy solutions of a weighted non-local fractional problem with superlinear or sublinear type non-linearity converge to a non-trivial, non-negative least energy solution of a Brezis-Nirenberg type or logistic-type problem, respectively, involving the logarithmic Laplacian.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence of nontrivial solutions of the Dirichlet boundary value problem for the following elliptic system: \begin{equation} \left\{ \begin{aligned} -\Delta u &amp; = au + bv + f(x,u,v); &amp;\quad\mbox{ for }x\in\Omega,\\ -\Delta v &amp; = bu + cv + g(x,u,v), &amp;\quad\mbox{ for }x\in\Omega,\\ u&amp;=v=0,&amp;\quad\mbox{ on }\partial\Omega, \end{aligned} \right.\qquad (1) \end{equation} for $x\in\Omega$, where $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^{N}$ is an open and connected bounded set with a smooth boundary $\partial\Omega$, with $N\geqslant 3,$ $u,v:\overline{\Omega}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, $a,b,c\in\mathbb{R},$ and $f,g : \overline{\Omega} \times\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ are continuous functions with $f(x,0,0)=0$ and $g(x,0,0) = 0$, and with super-quadratic, but sub-critical growth in the last two variables. We prove that the boundary value problem (1) has at least two nontrivial solutions for the case in which the eigenvalues of the matrix $\displaystyle \textbf{M} = \begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b \\ b &amp; c \end{pmatrix}$ are higher than the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian over $\Omega$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions; $u = v= 0$ on $\partial\Omega$. We use variational methods and infinite-dimensional Morse theory to obtain the multiplicity result.</description>

      <title>Global strong solutions for the triangular Shigesada-Kawasaki-Teramoto cross-diffusion system in three dimensions and parabolic regularisation for increasing functions</title>

Abstract: We prove the existence of global strong solutions to the triangular Shigesada-Kawasaki-Teramoto (SKT) cross-diffusion system with Lokta-Volterra reaction terms in three dimensions. A key part is the independent careful study of the parabolic equation $a\partial_t w - \Delta w = f$ with a rough coefficient $a$, homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, and the special assumption $\partial_t w \ge 0$. By the same method, we obtain estimates for solutions to reaction-diffusion systems modelling reversible chemistry.</description>

      <title>Global solutions to cubic Dirac and Dirac-Klein-Gordon systems on spacetimes close to the Minkowski space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish global existence and derive sharp pointwise decay estimates of solutions to cubic Dirac and Dirac-Klein-Gordon systems on a curved background, close to the Minkowski spacetime. By squaring the Dirac operator, we reduce the analysis to a nonlinear wave-type equation involving spinorial connections, and apply energy estimates based on vector field methods and the hyperboloidal foliation framework, introduced by LeFloch-Ma. A key difficulty arises from the commutator structure of the Dirac operator, which exhibits significantly different behaviour from that of scalar field equations and requires refined control throughout the analysis, particularly due to the spacetime-dependent gamma matrices, which reduce to constant matrices in the flat Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <title>Stable Determination of Coefficients in Nonlinear Dynamical Schr\"odinger Equations by Carleman Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of recovering stationary coefficients in a class of dynamical Schr\"odinger equations with locally analytic nonlinear terms. Upon treating the well-posedness for small initial data and trivial boundary data, we proceed to establish stable and unique determination provided knowledge of the coefficients near the boundary and the measured Neumann data of the solution. We discuss both the case of measurement on a subset of the boundary large enough to satisfy a certain geometrical condition and, under stronger assumptions on the regularity and size of the coefficients, the case of measurement on arbitrary subsets of the boundary. Our argument relies on high-order linearization and Carleman estimates for the linear Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>An interacting particle consensus method for constrained global optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00891v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a particle-based optimization method designed for addressing minimization problems with equality constraints, particularly in cases where the loss function exhibits non-differentiability or non-convexity. The proposed method combines components from consensus-based optimization algorithm with a newly introduced forcing term directed at the constraint set. A rigorous mean-field limit of the particle system is derived, and the convergence of the mean-field limit to the constrained minimizer is established. Additionally, we introduce a stable discretized algorithm and conduct various numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>p and hp Spectral Element Methods for Elliptic Boundary Layer Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14426v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose p and hp least-squares spectral element methods for one-dimensional elliptic boundary layer problems. Stability estimates are derived and we design numerical schemes based on minimizing the residuals in the sense of least-squares in appropriate Sobolev norms. We prove parameter robust uniform error estimates i.e. error in the approximation is independent of the boundary layer parameter. For the p-version we prove a robust uniform convergence rate of O(sqrt(log W)/W), where W denotes the polynomial order used in approximation and for the hp-version the convergence rate is shown to be O(e^(-W/logW)). Numerical results are presented for a number of model elliptic boundary layer problems confirming the theoretical estimates and uniform convergence results for the p and hp versions.</description>

      <title>A Littlewood-Paley approach to the Mittag-Leffler function in the frequency space and applications to nonlocal problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $0&lt;\alpha&lt;2$, $\beta&gt;0$ and $\alpha/2&lt;|s|\leq 1$. In a previous work, we obtained all possible values of the Lebesgue exponent $p=p(\gamma)$ for which the Fourier transform of $ E_{\alpha,\beta}(e^{\dot{\imath}\pi s} |\cdot|^{\gamma} )$ is an $L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ function, when $\gamma&gt;(d-1)/2$. We recover the more interesting lower regularity case $0&lt;\gamma\leq (d-1)/2$, using tools from the Littlewood-Paley theory. This question arises in the analysis of certain space-time fractional diffusion and Schr\"{o}dinger problems and has been solved for the particular cases $\alpha\in (0,1)$, $\beta=\alpha,1$, and $s=-1/2,1$ via asymptotic analysis of Fox $H$-functions. The Littlewood-Paley theory provides a simpler proof that allows considering all values of $\beta,\gamma&gt;0$ and $s\in (-1,1]\setminus [-\alpha/2,\alpha/2]$. This enabled us to prove various key estimates for a general class of nonlocal space-time problems.</description>

      <title>Periodic double tilings of the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08396v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study tilings of the plane composed of two repeating tiles of different assigned areas relative to an arbitrary periodic lattice. We classify isoperimetric configurations (i.e., configurations with minimal length of the interfaces) both in the case of a fixed lattice or for an arbitrary periodic lattice. We find three different configurations depending on the ratio between the assigned areas of the two tiles and compute the isoperimetric profile. The three different configurations are composed of tiles with a different number of circular edges, moreover, different configurations exhibit a different optimal lattice. Finally, we raise some open problems related to our investigation.</description>

      <title>On the controllability of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation on multi-dimensional cylindrical domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate null controllability of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation on a cylindrical domain $\Omega=\Omega_x\times \Omega_y$ in $\mathbb R^N$, where $\Omega_x=(0,a),$ $a&gt;0$ and $\Omega_y$ is a smooth domain in $\mathbb R^{N-1}$. We first study the controllability of this system by a control acting on $\{0\}\times \omega$, $\omega\subset \Omega_y$, through the boundary term associated with the Laplacian component. The null controllability of the linearized system is proved using a combination of two techniques: the method of moments and Lebeau-Robbiano strategy. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the null controllability of this system along with an explicit control cost estimate. Furthermore, we show that there exists minimal time $T_0(x_0)&gt;0$ such that the system is null controllable for all time $T &gt; T_0(x_0)$ by means of an interior control exerted on $\gamma = \{x_0\} \times \omega \subset \Omega$, where $x_0/a\in (0,1)\setminus \mathbb{Q}$ and it is not controllable if $T&lt;T_0(x_0).$
  If we assume $x_0/a$ is an algebraic real number of order $d &gt; 1$, then we prove the controllability for any time $T&gt;0.$
  Finally, for the case of $N=2 \text{ or } 3$, we show the local null controllability of the main nonlinear system by employing the source term method followed by the Banach fixed point theorem.</description>
