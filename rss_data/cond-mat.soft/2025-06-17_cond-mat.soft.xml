      <title>Asymmetric Effects Underlying Dynamic Heterogeneity in Miscible Blends of Poly(methyl methacrylate) with Poly(ethylene oxide)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of spatially variable local dynamics, or dynamic heterogeneity, is common in multicomponent polymer systems. Such heterogeneity is understood to arise from differences between the intrinsic dynamical fluctuations associated with one component versus another. However, the nature of the dynamic coupling between these components and how it depends on composition, temperature, and environmental fluctuations is not fully understood. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to characterize nanoscale dynamic heterogeneity in miscible blends of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) as a function of both temperature and blend composition. Probed over timescales of 100~ps, local PMMA segmental dynamics in blends align with neat PMMA when normalized by $T_\text{g}$, whereas PEO exhibits enhanced mobility caused by free-volume effects. The effects of dynamical coupling are found to be asymmetric between the extent of enhancement to PMMA and suppression of PEO dynamics based on analysis of local environment composition within blends. Asymmetric effects in the melt state are also identified over longer timescales according to a Rouse mode analysis over larger sub-chains for each species. These results provide fundamental insights into how dynamic heterogeneity manifests at the nanoscale, across conditions and compositions in miscible polymer blends. They establish a foundation for exploring whether such asymmetries are generalizable and how dynamic heterogeneity can be tuned through temperature, composition, and morphology.</description>

      <title>Chirality across scales in tissue dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral processes that lack mirror symmetry pervade nature from enantioselective molecular interactions to the asymmetric development of organisms. An outstanding challenge at the interface between physics and biology consists in bridging the multiple scales between microscopic and macroscopic chirality. Here, we combine theory, experiments and modern inference algorithms to study a paradigmatic example of dynamic chirality transfer across scales: the generation of tissue-scale flows from subcellular forces. The distinctive properties of our microscopic graph model and the corresponding coarse-grained viscoelasticity are that (i) net cell proliferation is spatially inhomogeneous and (ii) cellular dynamics cannot be expressed as an energy gradient. To overcome the general challenge of inferring microscopic model parameters from noisy high-dimensional data, we develop a nudged automatic differentiation algorithm (NADA) that can handle large fluctuations in cell positions observed in single tissue snapshots. This data-calibrated microscopic model quantitatively captures proliferation-driven tissue flows observed at large scales in our experiments on fibroblastoma cell cultures. Beyond chirality, our inference algorithm can be used to extract interpretable graph models from limited amounts of noisy data of living and inanimate cellular systems such as networks of convection cells and flowing foams.</description>

      <title>Clustering and emergent hyperuniformity by breaking microswimmer shape and actuation symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic interactions driven by particle activity are ubiquitous in active colloidal systems. Although these interactions are strongly influenced by the interfacial actuation mechanism and geometry of the swimming particles, theoretical understanding of how these microscopic design parameters govern collective dynamics remains limited. Here, we investigate the collective dynamics of oblate spheroidal microswimmers. Using an approximate kinetic theory and corroborating boundary element method calculations, we demonstrate that breaking symmetries in both particle shape and interfacial actuation enables the emergence of dynamically stable immotile n-particle clusters. At larger scales, the clustering process drives the system into a dynamically arrested absorbing state characterized by disordered class I hyperuniform structures. Our analysis highlights the essential role of cluster-sourced long-range flows in establishing this long-range order. Overall, our findings reveal a robust, purely hydrodynamic mechanism for hierarchical self-organization in active matter systems, providing a novel strategy for engineering multifunctional hyperuniform materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the condensation of liquid droplets on hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. A stochastic mesoscale model based on the theory of fluctuating hydrodynamics and the thermodynamics of a diffuse interface approach shows how direct simulation of the vapour-liquid transition from the nucleation process to droplet hydrodynamics can be achieved. Such simulations explain the role of wettability in filmwise and dropwise condensation regimes and the main limitations of classical nucleation theory.</description>

      <title>Structure-Dynamics Correlation and Its Link to Fragility and Dynamic Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the connection between structure, dynamics, and fragility (the rate at which relaxation times grow with decreasing temperature) is central to unraveling the glass transition. Fragility is often linked to dynamic heterogeneity, and thus it is commonly assumed that if structure influences dynamics, more fragile systems should exhibit stronger structure--dynamics correlations. In this study, we test the generality of this assumption using three model systems: Lennard-Jones (LJ) and Weeks--Chandler--Andersen, where fragility is tuned via density, and a modified LJ (q, p) system, where potential softness is changed to vary fragility. We employ a structural order parameter derived from the mean--field caging potential and analyze energy barriers at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. While the macroscopic slope of the energy barrier, suitably defined, correlates with fragility, no consistent correlation is found for the microscopic energy barriers. Instead, the latter shows a strong correlation with an independently computed structure--dynamics measure obtained from isoconfigurational ensemble. Surprisingly, the two systems with the highest structure--dynamics correlation, LJ at rho = 1.1 and the (8, 5) model, are respectively the least and most fragile within their classes. These systems exhibit broad mobility distributions, bimodal displacement profiles, and high non-Gaussian parameters, all indicative of dynamic heterogeneity. However, their dynamic susceptibilities remain low, suggesting a decoupling between spatial correlation and temporal heterogeneity. Both systems lie in the enthalpy-dominated regime and are near the spinodal, suggesting mechanical instability as a source of heterogeneity. These findings challenge the conventional linkage among fragility, heterogeneity, and structure--dynamics correlation.</description>

      <title>Kinetic theory of coupled binary-fluid-surfactant systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a self-consistent hydrodynamic theory of coupled binary-fluid-surfactant systems from the underlying microscopic physics using Rayleigh's variational principle. At the microscopic level, surfactant molecules are modelled as dumbbells that exert forces and torques on the fluid and interface while undergoing Brownian motion. We obtain the overdamped stochastic dynamics of these particles from a Rayleighian dissipation functional, which we then coarse-grain to derive a set of continuum equations governing the surfactant concentration, orientation, and the fluid density and velocity. This approach introduces a polarization field, representing the average orientation of surfactants, and yields a mesoscopic free energy functional from which all governing equations are consistently derived. The resulting model accurately captures key surfactant phenomena, including surface tension reduction and droplet stabilization, as confirmed by both perturbation theory and numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Flocking as a second-order phase transition in self-aligning active crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a two-dimensional crystal composed of active units governed by self-alignment. This mechanism induces a torque that aligns a particle's orientation with its velocity and leads to a phase transition from a disordered to a flocking crystal. Here, we provide the first microscopic theory that analytically maps the crystal dynamics onto a Landau-Ginzburg model, in which the velocity-dependent effective free energy undergoes a transition from a single-well shape to a Mexican-hat profile. As confirmed by simulations, our theory quantitatively predicts the transition point and characteristic spatial velocity correlations. The continuous change of the order parameter and the diverging behavior of the analytically predicted correlation length imply that flocking in self-aligning active crystals is a second-order phase transition. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for the flocking phenomenon observed experimentally in active granular particles and migrating cells.</description>

      <title>Implementing van der Waals forces for polytope particles in DEM simulations of clay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clay minerals are non-spherical nano-scale particles that usually form flocculated, house-of-card like structures under the influence of inter-molecular forces. Numerical modeling of clays is still in its infancy as the required inter-particle forces are available only for spherical particles. A polytope approach would allow shape-accurate forces and torques while simultaneously being more performant. The Anandarajah solution provides an analytical formulation for van der Waals forces for cuboid particles but in its original form is not suitable for implementation in DEM simulations. In this work, we discuss the necessary changes for a functional implementation of the Anandarajah solution in a DEM simulation of rectangular particles and their extension to cuboid particles.</description>

      <title>Density-Independent Glassy Behavior in the High-Density Phase of Motility-Induced Phase Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of active matter using a two-dimensional active Brownian particles model. In these systems, self-propelled particles undergo motility-induced phase separation (MIPS), spontaneously segregating into dense and dilute phases. We find that in the high-density phase, local particle mobility exhibits glassy behavior, with diffusivity remaining unchanged despite variations in the global system density. As global density increases further, the system undergoes a transition to a solid-like state through this glassy phase. These findings provide insights into nonequilibrium phase transitions in active matter, revealing a robust glassy phase en route to solidification, and may guide future studies in both synthetic and biological active systems.</description>

      <title>Two-photon 3D printing of functional microstructures inside living cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D printing has revolutionized numerous scientific fields and industries, with printing in biological systems emerging as a rapidly advancing area of research. However, its application to the subcellular level remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the fabrication of custom-shaped polymeric microstructures directly inside living cells using two-photon polymerization. A biocompatible photoresist is injected into live cells and selectively polymerized with a femtosecond laser. The unpolymerized photoresist is dissolved naturally within the cytoplasm, leaving behind stable intracellular structures with submicron resolution within live cells. We printed various shapes, including a $10 \mu m$ elephant, barcodes for cell tracking, diffraction gratings for remote readout, and microlasers. Our top-down intracellular biofabrication approach, combined with existing functional photoresists, could open new avenues for various applications, including intracellular sensing, biomechanical manipulation, bioelectronics, and targeted intracellular drug delivery. Moreover, these embedded structures could offer unprecedented control over the intracellular environment, enabling the engineering of cellular properties beyond those found in nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shape of a cell influences and it is influenced by interactions with its neighbouring partners. Here, we introduce a coarse-grained model of non-reciprocal interactions between single-cell organisms to study emergent morphologies during symbiotic association. We show that the cell membrane can be remodelled into branched protrusions, invaginations, transient blebs and other dynamical phases that depend on the number of interacting partners, the asymmetry, and the magnitude of partnership activity. Our model finds a dynamical feedback between the local deformation of the membrane and its driving force, leading to morphologies not accessible to reciprocal systems.</description>

      <title>Tuning the Viscosity and Jamming Point in Dense Active non-Brownian Suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using numerical simulations, we study the rheological response of dense non-Brownian suspensions containing active particles. The active particles are modelled as run-and-tumble particles with three controlling parameters: the fraction of active particles in the system, an active force applied to the particles, and a persistence time after which the direction of the active force changes randomly. Our simulations reveal that the presence of activity can reduce the viscosity (by an order of magnitude) by decreasing the number of frictional contacts, which also shifts the jamming point to a higher volume fraction. Moreover, the microscopic structure of force chains in the presence of activity is qualitatively different from that in the passive system, showing reduced anisotropy. We also find that while the presence of activity drives the system away from jamming by preventing the formation of force chains, unjamming an already jammed state by breaking existing force chains requires a higher activity strength. Finally, we propose a new constitutive law to describe the rheology of dense active non-Brownian suspensions.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the nanoscopic phase behavior of ternary solutions in the presence of electrolytes: from pre-Ouzo to Ouzo region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we report a comprehensive study of how electrolyte addition governs the structure and stability of surfactant-free microemulsions in a trans-anethol/ethanol/water system. The universal structural response has been validated, spanning the full range of solution dispersed-phase structurings, from sub-10 nm W/O reverse-aggregates to O/W mesoscopic droplets (~100 nm) and classical Ouzo droplets (~1 {\mu}m). Experimental results reveal that there is a threshold for electrolyte levels above which oil-in-water nanodroplet coalescence and phase separation are triggered: screening of electrical double layers and "salting out" of hydrophobic components drives hydrotrope into fewer, larger droplets. The total oil volume sequestered in the dispersed phase remains essentially constant, indicating oil redistribution rather than dissolution. In contrast, water-in-oil nanodroplets in a predominantly organic medium display near-complete insensitivity to ionic strength, owing to low dielectric screening and tight interfacial packing that exclude substantial ion uptake. Finally, addition of high salt to Ouzo droplets accelerates their collapse: large droplets fuse and sediment, leaving only residual nanostructures and confirming electrolyte-driven phase demixing. This insight offers clear guidelines for designing additive-free emulsions with tailored lifetimes and nanostructure architectures across pharmaceutical, food, and materials applications.</description>

      <title>On the diffusion of hard sphere fluids in disordered porous media: New extended Enskog theory description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We proposed a new extended version of Enskog theory for the description of the self-diffusion coefficient of a colloidal hard-sphere fluid adsorbed in a matrix of disordered hard-sphere obstacles. In a considered approach instead of contact values of the fluid-fluid and fluid-matrix pair distribution functions, we introduced by input the new functions that include the dependence on the fraction of the volume free from matrix particles and from fluid particles trapped by matrix particles. It is shown that the introduction of this free volume fraction by the Fermi-like distribution leads to the best agreement between theoretical predictions and computer simulation results [Chang R., Jagannathan K., Yethiraj A., Phys. Rev. E, 2004, 69, 051101].</description>

      <title>The Three-Dimensional Velocity Field of Kinesin-Driven Microtubules in Torroidal Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two regimes of flow in multiple three-dimensional toroidal channels by tracking the fluorescent spherical particles in the kinesin-driven microtubule systems: ``chaotic'' flow and ``coherent'' flow. In the smallest aspect ratio torus, where the channel height $h$ is a quarter of the width $w$, the active system shows zero mean velocity, small-scale isotropy in fluctuation and no persistent flow structure. In other tori with higher aspect ratios $h/w$ close to 1, we find faster coherent flows along the azimuthal direction and increasing fluctuation strengths with growing confinement geometries. Regardless of flow regimes, the flow profiles at $r-z$ cross-section and $r-\theta$ plane are symmetric. The ``coherent'' profiles show two criteria: ``Poiseuille-like'' profiles, which have the peak velocities near the centers of channels; a ``peak-separated'' profile, which has four peak velocities near a certain distance to four confining surfaces. These flow profiles, after scaled by the local isotropic fluctuation strength, reveal universal three-dimensional flow structures among the ``Poiseuille-like'' criterion and the same level of scaled peak velocity at the ``peak-separated'' one. These results illustrate scalable flow structures in this kinesin-driven microtubule active system.</description>

      <title>Fluid-induced snap-through instability of spherical shells</title>

Abstract: From the flutter of aircraft wings to an umbrella flipping inside out in the wind, fluid-induced elastic instabilities are a major concern in aeroelastic design. However, Nature often harnesses these instabilities to achieve new functionalities, such as the mechanical snap-through of the Venus flytrap. Inspired by this, engineers and physicists have increasingly exploited elastic instabilities to enable rapid shape changes in metamaterials and soft robots, provided the structure remains elastic throughout the transition. Here, we study the fluid-induced snapping instability of a spherical elastic shell at low Reynolds numbers, the umbrella flipping problem when life is at low Reynolds numbers. We combine precision desktop-scale experiments, fluid-structure simulations, shell theory, fluid mechanics, and scaling analysis to determine the instability threshold as a function of the geometrical and material parameters of the system. Building on these findings, we devise a snapping-based valve that passively and abruptly alters the hydraulic resistance of a channel, offering robust flow control without active components. These valves could be deployed in soft robotics and, because our results are expressed in terms of key dimensionless parameters, we speculate that the system can be miniaturized for use in microfluidic circuits. Beyond the application, our study presents what we believe to be a prototypical example of fluid-induced elastic instability at low Reynolds numbers, providing a foundation for future explorations in soft hydraulics and flow-responsive structures.</description>

      <title>Prediction of the aqueous redox properties of functionalized quinones using a new QM/MM variational formulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We recently proposed a method coupling quantum mechanics (QM) methods and molecular density functional theory (MDFT) to describe mixed quantum-classical systems [J. Chem. Phys. 161, 014113 (2024)]. This approach is particularly appropriate to account for solvent effect into QM calculations. We introduce a new variational formulation for the grand potential of a mixed quantum-classical system. Within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and neglecting electronic entropy, the quantum solute is described by a product of electronic and nuclear density matrices, both depending parametrically on coordinates of the classical solvent. It can then be shown that a functional of the total density matrix satisfies a variational principle for the grand potential. Using a mean-field approximation, we express the grand potential of the mixed quantum-classical system as a variational problem which depends only on the nuclear density matrix, which experiences an external field generated by the electronic and classical one-particle densities. In practice, the grand potential is computed by a series of coupled classical and quantum DFT calculations, together with geometry optimization.</description>

      <title>Iterative Annealing Mechanism for Protein and RNA Chaperones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular chaperones are machines that consume copious amount of ATP to drive misfolded proteins or RNA to fold into functionally competent native states. Because the folding landscapes of biomolecules with complex native state topology are rugged consisting of multiple minima that are separated by large free energy barriers, folding occurs by the kinetic partitioning mechanism according to which only a small fraction of the molecules reach the folded state in biologically viable times. The rescue of such proteins and RNA require chaperones. Although the protein and RNA chaperones are profoundly different in their structure and action, the principles underlying their activity to produce the folded structures can be understood using a unified theoretical framework based on iterative annealing mechanism (IAM). Our theory shows that both these machines have evolved to the maximize the production of the steady state yield on biological times. Strikingly, theory predicts that only at a moderate level of RNA chaperone activity is the yield of the self-splicing pre-RNA is maximized in \textit{in vivo}.</description>

      <title>Hopfield Networks as Models of Emergent Function in Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hopfield models, originally developed to study memory retrieval in neural networks, have become versatile tools for modeling diverse biological systems in which function emerges from collective dynamics. In this review, we provide a pedagogical introduction to both classical and modern Hopfield networks from a biophysical perspective. After presenting the underlying mathematics, we build physical intuition through three complementary interpretations of Hopfield dynamics: as noise discrimination, as a geometric construction defining a natural coordinate system in pattern space, and as gradient-like descent on an energy landscape. We then survey recent applications of Hopfield networks a variety of biological setting including cellular differentiation and epigenetic memory, molecular self-assembly, and spatial neural representations.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Vortex Clusters on a Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the collective dynamics of multivortex assemblies in a two dimensional (2D) toroidal fluid film of distinct curvature and topology. The incompressible and inviscid nature of the fluid allows a Hamiltonian description of the vortices, along with a self-force of geometric origin, arising from the standard Kirchhoff-Routh regularization procedure. The Hamiltonian dynamics is constructed in terms of $q$-digamma functions $\Psi_q(z)$, closely related to the Schottky-Klein prime function known to arise in multiply connected domains. We show the fundamental motion of the two-vortex system and identify five classes of geodesics on the torus for the special case of a vortex dipole, along with subtle distinctions from vortices in quantum superfluids. In multivortex assemblies, we observe that a randomly initialized cluster of vortices of the same sign and strength (chiral cluster) remains geometrically confined on the torus, while undergoing an overall drift along the toroidal direction, exhibiting collective dynamics. A cluster of fast and slow vortices also show the collective toroidal drift, with the fast ones predominantly occupying the core region and the slow ones expelled to the periphery of the revolving cluster. Vortex clusters of mixed sign but zero net circulation (achiral cluster) show unconfined dynamics and scatter all over the surface of the torus. A chiral cluster with an impurity in the form of a single vortex of opposite sign also show similar behavior as a pure chiral cluster, with occasional ``jets" of dipoles leaving and re-entering the revolving cluster. The work serves as a step towards analysis of vortex clusters in models that incorporate harmonic velocities in the Hodge decomposition.</description>

      <title>Active nematic response to a deformable body or boundary: elastic deformations and anchoring-induced flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15617v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A body immersed in a nematic liquid crystal disturbs the fluid's preferred molecular configuration and increases its stored elastic energy. In an active nematic, the fluid components also generate a stress in the bulk fluid. By introducing either an immersed body or boundary, a large scale flow can be triggered due to anchoring boundary conditions alone -- a global pressure built by active stresses at equilibrium is instantly released everywhere. The fluid then imposes viscous, elastic, and active stresses on such surfaces which, if compliant, may result in a surface deformation. We study the deformations and stresses of a linearly elastic body placed in an active nematic in two dimensions. Using complex variables techniques, exact expressions for the fluid flow, director field, surface tractions, and body deformation are derived. Qualitative differences between elastic and active stress-driven deformations are identified, depending on an active Ericksen number, anchoring conditions, and body material properties, thereby suggesting a new method for measuring mechanical stresses in active anisotropic environments. Flow profiles, external confinement, and anchoring-induced stirring are also addressed.</description>

      <title>Can solvents tie knots? Helical folds of biopolymers in liquid environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Helices are the quintessential geometric motif of the microscale, from alpha-helices in proteins to double helices in DNA. Assembly of the helical geometry of biopolymers is a foundational step in a hierarchy of structure that eventually leads to biological activity. By simulating folding in a simplified setting we probe the role of the solvent in the collaborative processes governing biomaterials. Using a simulation technique based on the morphometric approach to solvation, we performed computer experiments in which a short, flexible tube-modelling a biopolymer in an aqueous environment-folds solely based on the interaction of the tube with the solvent. Our findings reveal a variety of helical structures that assemble depending on solvent conditions, including overhand knots and symmetric double helices. By differentiating the role of solvation, our work illuminates the environment of all soluble biomolecules, demonstrating that the solvent can drive fundamental rearrangements, even up to tying a simple overhand knot.</description>

      <title>Capillary force-driven particle orientation in rod networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypothesis: Anisotropic rod particles in capillary suspensions form complex network structures with distinctive orientation patterns and rheological properties that differ significantly from spherical particle systems. By identifying the orientation of individual particles, we are able to acquire invaluable experimental insight into the bulk particle orientation measurements.
  Experiments: Glass microrods were dispersed in capillary suspensions with varied secondary liquid volume fractions. The resulting microstructural characteristics were analyzed using confocal microscopy. Meanwhile, their rheological properties were measured through rheometry and rheoconfocal techniques. Particle networks were quantified in terms of coordination number, clustering coefficient, and orientation distribution.
  Findings: As the secondary liquid volume fraction increased, rod networks transitioned from point-to-point contact configurations to side-to-side aligned clusters. Unlike spherical systems, the average clustering coefficient decreased with increasing coordination number, indicating the formation of complex particle cluster configurations beyond simple side-to-side alignment. The rod networks demonstrated higher sensitivity to deformation, and samples with higher side-to-side contact probability exhibit higher viscoplastic fragility. These results provide a foundation for designing advanced materials with precisely tunable mechanical properties through controlled anisotropic particle interactions in capillary suspensions.</description>

Abstract: A free surface induces enhanced dynamics in glass formers. We study the dynamical enhancement of glassy films with a distinguishable-particle lattice model of glass free of elastic effects. We demonstrate that the thickness of the surface mobile layer depends on temperature differently under different definitions, although all are based on local structure relaxation rate. The rate can be fitted to a double exponential form with an exponential-of-power-law tail. Our approach and results exclude elasticity as the unique mechanism for the tail. Layer-resolved particle hopping rate, potentially a key measure for activated hopping, is also studied but it exhibits much shallower surface effects.</description>

      <title>Crossover between Solid-like and Liquid-like Behavior in Supercooled Liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In supercooled liquids, at a temperature between the glass transition temperature Tg and the melting point Tm, thermodynamic properties remain continuous, while dynamic behavior exhibits anomalies. The origin of such thermodynamics-dynamic decoupling has long been a puzzle in the field of glass researches. In this study, we show that the ratio of the alpha-relaxation time associated with the relative and center-of-mass coordinate of nearest-neighbor atomic pairs can effectively characterize the dynamic features of supercooled liquids. With this approach, supercooled liquids can be categorized into two distinct 'states' based on their dynamics: solid-like and liquid-like behaviors. We further propose four possible paths from the liquid to the final glass state, each exhibiting unique thermodynamic and dynamic behaviors. Two of these paths predict a characteristic temperature Tx between Tm and Tg, where a crossover between solid-like and liquid-like behaviors occurs in supercooled liquids. The molecular dynamics simulations of several supercooled liquids reveal that the actual path followed by all these systems undergo the crossover between solid-like and liquid-like behaviors. Tx is found to reside in a similar temperature range as the critical temperature Tc in the mode-coupling theory and the breakdown temperature Tb of the Stokes-Einstein relation. This crossover provides a new microscopic perspective for explaining macroscopic dynamic anomalies, and the absence of a typical thermodynamic phase transition at Tg.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03006v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Formation of a fluid drop, such as observed in dripping faucet, has been extensively studied for understanding singular dynamics widely observed in nature. The singular dynamics is often self-similar, i.e., the shape at different times are collapsed onto a master curve after rescaling. Here, we investigate the bubble breakup in an original setup, where a metal disk entrains air into viscous fluid with lubricating films on its surfaces in a confined cell, focusing on the dependence of the dynamics on the film thickness e. As a result, we find out the dynamics is self-similar as expected, but the shape of the master curve and the scaling exponents characterizing the self-similar dynamics are revealed to be sensitively dependent on e. We discuss analogy between the present study and critical phenomena in thermodynamic transitions, to suggest a promising future direction of the singular dynamics.</description>

      <title>Continuous generation of confined bubbles: viscous effect on the gravito-capillary pinch off</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate continuous generation of bubbles from a bath of air in viscous liquid in a confined geometry. In our original setup, bubbles are spontaneously generated by virtue of buoyancy and a gate placed in the cell: the gate acts like an inverted funnel trapping air beneath it before continuously generating bubbles at the tip. The dynamics is characterized by the bubble-formation period and the bubble size as a function of the amount of air under the gate. By analyzing the data obtained for various parameters, we clearly identified that the dynamics of the bubble formation is governed by dissipation in the viscous fluid beneath the trapped air balanced by a gravitational energy change due to buoyancy, after examining numerous possibilities of dissipation, which demonstrates the potential of scaling analysis even in complex cases. Furthermore, we uncover a novel type of pinch-off condition, which convincingly explains the bubble size: in the present case viscosity plays a vital role, different from the conventional mechanism of Tate, in which gravity competes with capillarity, revealing a general mechanism of pinching-off at low Reynolds number. Accordingly, the present study significantly and fundamentally advances our knowledge of generation and pinch-off of bubbles, with the results relevant for a wide variety of applications in many fields. In particular, the present study demonstrates a promising avenue in microfluidics for understanding physical principles by scaling up the system, without losing the characteristics of the flow at low Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>Cell size heterogeneity controls crystallization of the developing fruit fly wing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental question in Biology is to understand how patterns and shapes emerge from the collective interplay of large numbers of cells. Cells forming two-dimensional epithelial tissues behave as active materials that undergo remodeling and spontaneous shape changes. Focussing on the fly wing as a model system, we find that the cellular packing in the wing epithelium transitions from a disordered packing to an ordered, crystalline packing. We investigate biophysical mechanisms controlling this crystallization process. While previous studies propose a role of tissue shear flow in establishing the ordered cell packing in the fly wing, we reveal a role of cell size heterogeneity. Indeed, we find that even if tissue shear have been inhibited, cell packings in the fruit fly wing epithelium transition from disordered to an ordered packing. We propose that the transition is controlled by the cell size heterogeneity, which is quantified by the cell size polydispersity. We use the vertex model of epithelial tissues to show that there is a critical value of cell size polydispersity above which cellular packings are disordered and below which they form a crystalline packing. By analyzing experimental data we find that cell size polydispersity decreases during fly wing development. The observed dynamics of tissue crystallisation is consistent with the slow ordering kinetics we observe in the vertex model. Therefore, although tissue shear does not control the transition, it significantly enhances the rate of tissue scale ordering by facilitating alingment of locally ordered crystallites.</description>
