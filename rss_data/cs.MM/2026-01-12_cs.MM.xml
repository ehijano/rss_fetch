      <title>Meaning over Motion: A Semantic-First Approach to 360{\deg} Viewport Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution 360-degree video streaming is severely constrained by the massive bandwidth required to deliver immersive experiences. Current viewport prediction techniques predominately rely on kinematics or low-level visual saliency, treating users as passive physical objects governed by inertia. This theoretical limitation leads to the "Saccade Trap" -- a critical failure mode where predictors fail to anticipate rapid, meaning-driven shifts in attention, causing rebuffering stalls exactly when user engagement is highest. To resolve this, we propose Semantically-Adaptive Conformal Tiling with Associative Lookahead, a novel framework that integrates cognitive intent into network control. Unlike "one-size-fits-all" approaches, our method utilizes an architectural inversion strategy: heavy semantic reasoning is offloaded to the server to generate lightweight association graphs, which guide a low-latency client-side controller. We construct a personalized Multi-Modal Prediction Set that dynamically tightens safety margins during stable fixation to maximize efficiency, while simultaneously pre-fetching non-adjacent tiles containing semantically linked objects (Associative Lookahead). This mechanism effectively converts the "calm" of fixation into a preparation phase for the next interaction. Trace-driven evaluation on the 360-AV-HM dataset demonstrates that this approach successfully mitigates the Saccade Trap, reducing stall duration by $\ge$ 20% and lowering effective bandwidth consumption by $\ge$ 18% compared to state-of-the-art trajectory-based baselines.</description>

      <title>Sketch&amp;Patch++: Efficient Structure-Aware 3D Gaussian Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observe that Gaussians exhibit distinct roles and characteristics analogous to traditional artistic techniques -- like how artists first sketch outlines before filling in broader areas with color, some Gaussians capture high-frequency features such as edges and contours, while others represent broader, smoother regions analogous to brush strokes that add volume and depth. Based on this observation, we propose a hybrid representation that categorizes Gaussians into (i) Sketch Gaussians, which represent high-frequency, boundary-defining features, and (ii) Patch Gaussians, which cover low-frequency, smooth regions. This semantic separation naturally enables layered progressive streaming, where the compact Sketch Gaussians establish the structural skeleton before Patch Gaussians incrementally refine volumetric detail.
  In this work, we extend our previous method to arbitrary 3D scenes by proposing a novel hierarchical adaptive categorization framework that operates directly on the 3DGS representation. Our approach employs multi-criteria density-based clustering, combined with adaptive quality-driven refinement. This method eliminates dependency on external 3D line primitives while ensuring optimal parametric encoding effectiveness. Our comprehensive evaluation across diverse scenes, including both man-made and natural environments, demonstrates that our method achieves up to 1.74 dB improvement in PSNR, 6.7% in SSIM, and 41.4% in LPIPS at equivalent model sizes compared to uniform pruning baselines. For indoor scenes, our method can maintain visual quality with only 0.5\% of the original model size. This structure-aware representation enables efficient storage, adaptive streaming, and rendering of high-fidelity 3D content across bandwidth-constrained networks and resource-limited devices.</description>

      <title>TF-Mamba: Text-enhanced Fusion Mamba with Missing Modalities for Robust Multimodal Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) with missing modalities has attracted increasing attention recently. While current Transformer-based methods leverage dense text information to maintain model robustness, their quadratic complexity hinders efficient long-range modeling and multimodal fusion. To this end, we propose a novel and efficient Text-enhanced Fusion Mamba (TF-Mamba) framework for robust MSA with missing modalities. Specifically, a Text-aware Modality Enhancement (TME) module aligns and enriches non-text modalities, while reconstructing the missing text semantics. Moreover, we develop Text-based Context Mamba (TC-Mamba) to capture intra-modal contextual dependencies under text collaboration. Finally, Text-guided Query Mamba (TQ-Mamba) queries text-guided multimodal information and learns joint representations for sentiment prediction. Extensive experiments on three MSA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method under missing modality scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/codemous/TF-Mamba.</description>

      <title>Transforming Video Subjective Testing with Training, Engagement, and Real-Time Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subjective video quality assessment is crucial for optimizing streaming and compression, yet traditional protocols face limitations in capturing nuanced perceptual differences and ensuring reliable user input. We propose an integrated framework that enhances rater training, enforces attention through real-time scoring, and streamlines pairwise comparisons to recover quality scores with fewer comparisons. Participants first undergo an automated training quiz to learn key video quality indicators (e.g., compression artifacts) and verify their readiness. During the test, a real-time attention scoring mechanism, using "golden" video pairs, monitors and reinforces rater focus by applying penalties for lapses. An efficient chain-based pairwise comparison procedure is then employed, yielding quality scores in Just-Objectionable-Differences (JOD) units. Experiments comparing three groups (no training, training without feedback, and training with feedback) with 80 participants demonstrate that training-quiz significantly improves data quality in terms of golden unit accuracy and reduces tie rate, while real-time feedback further improves data quality and yields the most monotonic quality ratings. The new training, quiz, testing with feedback, 3-phase approach can significantly reduce the non-monotonic cases on the high quality part of the R-Q curve where normal viewer typically prefer the slightly compressed less-grainy content and help train a better objective video quality metric.</description>

      <title>Indonesian Multimodal Emotion Recognition via Auxiliary-Enhanced LLM Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Indonesian, spoken by over 200 million people, remains underserved in multimodal emotion recognition research despite its dominant presence on Southeast Asian social media platforms. We introduce IndoMER, the first multimodal emotion recognition benchmark for Indonesian, comprising 1,944 video segments from 203 speakers with temporally aligned text, audio, and visual annotations across seven emotion categories. The dataset exhibits realistic challenges including cross-modal inconsistency and long-tailed class distributions shaped by Indonesian cultural communication norms. To address these challenges, we propose OmniMER, a multimodal adaptation framework built upon Qwen2.5-Omni that enhances emotion recognition through three auxiliary modality-specific perception tasks: emotion keyword extraction for text, facial expression analysis for video, and prosody analysis for audio. These auxiliary tasks help the model identify emotion-relevant cues in each modality before fusion, reducing reliance on spurious correlations in low-resource settings. Experiments on IndoMER show that OmniMER achieves 0.582 Macro-F1 on sentiment classification and 0.454 on emotion recognition, outperforming the base model by 7.6 and 22.1 absolute points respectively. Cross-lingual evaluation on the Chinese CH-SIMS dataset further demonstrates the generalizability of the proposed framework. The dataset and code are publicly available. https://github.com/yanxm01/INDOMER</description>
