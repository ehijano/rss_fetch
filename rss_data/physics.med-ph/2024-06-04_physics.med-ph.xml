      <title>Application and prospect of hydrogels in diabetic wound treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diabetic foot patients face persistent, challenging wounds, prompting a quest for innovative therapies. Hydrogel, a promising modality, is increasingly recognized for its potential in diabetic wound care. This review examines hydrogel's emergence as a therapeutic option, and its benefits, and outlines research directions. Diabetic foot ulcers, notoriously hard to heal, demand effective solutions beyond traditional methods. Hydrogel, with its hydrophilic nature and biocompatibility, offers a novel approach. It fosters a moist wound environment, aids healing, and mitigates infection risks. Additionally, its versatility in delivering bioactive agents enhances wound recovery. This analysis provides insights into hydrogel's application, paving the way for improved outcomes and patient well-being in diabetic foot care.</description>

      <title>Clinical utility of automatic treatment planning for proton therapy of head-and-neck cancer patients using JulianA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Automatic treatment planning promises many benefits for both research and clinical environments. For clinics, autoplanning promises to reduce planning time and achieve more comparable treatment plans and thereby reduce inter-planner variability. Further, it can assist clinicians in quality assurance by providing a minimum plan quality standard. Finally, autoplanning is an essential part of patient selection, which is crucial for the advancement of proton therapy itself.
  Methods: A retrospective planning study using a cohort of 17 head-and-neck cancer patients treated at our institute. The clinically accepted plans created by dosimetrists (d-plans) were compared to automatically generated JulianA plans (j-plans). Both methods used the same beam arrangement. The plans were analysed by two expert reviewers without knowing how each plan was created. They assessed the plan quality and stated a preference.
  Results: All of the j-plans were deemed rather or clearly acceptable, resulting in a higher acceptability than the d-plans. The j-plan was considered superior in 14 (82.4%) cases, of equal quality for 1 (5.9%) and inferior to the d-plan for only 2 (11.8%) of the cases. The reviewers concluded that JulianA achieves more conformal dose distributions for the 15 (88.2%) cases where the j-plans were at least as good as the d-plans.
  Conclusions: The results show that the JulianA is ready to be used as a clinical quality assurance tool and research platform at our institute. While these results are encouraging, further research is needed to reduce the number of spots further and introduce robustness considerations into the optimisation algorithm in order to employ it on a daily basis for patient treatment.</description>

      <title>A digital instrument simulator to optimize the development of hyperspectral systems: application for intraoperative functional brain mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intraoperative optical imaging is a localization technique for the functional areas of the human brain cortex during neurosurgical procedures. These areas can be assessed by monitoring cerebral hemodynamics and metabolism. A robust quantification of these biomarkers is complicated to perform during neurosurgery due to the critical context of the operating room. In actual devices, the inhomogeneities of the optical properties of exposed brain cortex are poorly taken into consideration, which introduce quantification errors of biomarkers of brain functionality. Moreover, the choice of the best spectral configuration is still based on an empirical approach.
  We propose a digital instrument simulator to optimize the development of hyperspectral systems. This simulator can provide a realistic modelling of the cerebral cortex and the identification of the optimal wavelengths to monitor cerebral hemodynamics (oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin) and metabolism (oxidized state of cytochromes b, c and cytochrome-c-oxidase).
  The digital instrument allows the modelling of intensity maps collected by a camera sensor as well as images of pathlength to take into account the inhomogeneities of the optical properties. The optimization procedure helps to identify the best wavelength combination of 18 wavelengths that reduce the quantification errors in HbO2, Hb, oxCCO of 61%, 29% and 82% compared to the gold standard of 121 wavelengths between 780 and 900 nm. The optimization procedure does not help to resolve changes in cytochrome b and c in a significant way but help to better resolve oxCCO changes.
  We proposed a digital instrument simulator to optimize the development of hyperspectral systems for intraoperative brain mapping studies. This digital instrument simulator and this optimization framework could be used to optimize the design of hyperspectral imaging devices.</description>

      <title>Extraction of Maternal and fetal ECG in a non-invasive way from abdominal ECG recordings using modified Progressive FastICA Peel-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-invasive abdominal electrocardiogram (AECG) gives a non-invasive way to monitor fetal well-being during pregnancy. Due to the overlap with maternal ECG (MECG) as well as potential noises from other sources, it is challenging to extract weak fetal ECG (FECG) using surface electrodes. Taking advantage of precise source separation capability of the FastICA approach combined with its constrained version specific to FECG, with weak source extraction capability warranted by the peel-off strategy and FECG waveform reconstruction ability ensured by singular value decomposition (SVD) method, a novel framework for FECG extraction from AECG recordings is presented in this paper. Specifically, a periodic constrained FastICA(pcFastICA) was developed to improve the precision of examining and correcting FECG source signals, based on the statistical characteristics of continuous and repetitive ECG emissions. Additionally, a successive judgement algorithm is designed to selected the optimal maternal and fetal ECG. The performance of the proposed method was examined on public datasets, synthetic data and clinical data, with an F1-scores for FECG extraction on ADFECG and NIFECGA dataset of 99.71% and 99.36%, on synthetic data with the highest noise level of 98.77%, on clinical data of 98.09%, which are all superior to other comparative methods. The results indicates that our proposed method has potential and effectiveness to separate weak FECG from multichannel AECG with high precision in high noise condition, which is of vital importance for ensuring the safety of both the fetus and the mother, as well as the advancement of artificial intelligent clinical monitoring.</description>

      <title>Extraction of Weak Surface Diaphragmatic Electromyogram Using Modified Progressive FastICA Peel-Off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diaphragmatic electromyogram (EMGdi) is a crucial electrophysiological signal that contains information about human respiration. Although it is practical to record surface EMGdi (sEMGdi) noninvasively and conveniently by placing electrodes over chest skin, extraction of such weak sEMGdi from noise condition is a challenging task, limiting its clinical use compared with esophageal EMGdi. In this paper, a novel method is presented for extracting weak sEMGdi signal from high-noise condition based on fast independent component analysis (FastICA), constrained FastICA and a peel-off strategy. The constrained FastICA helps to extract and refine respiration-related sEMGdi signals, and the peel-off strategy ensures the complete extraction of weaker sEMGdi components. The method was validated using both synthetic signals and clinical signals. It was demonstrated that our method was able to extract sEMGdi signals efficiently with little distortion. It outperformed state-of-the-art comparison methods in terms of sufficiently high SIR and CORR at all noise levels when tested on synthetic data. Our method also achieved an accuracy of 95.06% and a F2-score of 96.73% for breath identification on clinical data. The study presents a valuable solution for noninvasive extraction of sEMGdi signals, providing a convenient and valuable way of ventilator synchrony. Our study also offers a significant potential in aiding respiratory rehabilitation and health.</description>

      <title>In vivo fundus imaging and computational refocusing with a diffuser-based fundus camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Access to eye care can be expanded with high-throughput, easy-to-use, and portable diagnostic tools. Phase-mask encoded imaging could improve these aspects of the fundus camera by enabling computational refocusing without any moving parts. This approach circumvents the need to adjust lenses to compensate for accommodation or refractive errors. We developed a computational fundus camera by introducing a holographic diffuser at the conjugate plane to the ocular pupil, resulting in a laterally shift-invariant point-spread function. We demonstrate computational refocusing of a model eye fundus over a large range of defocus errors (up to $\pm $12D). We also show computationally-refocused color in vivo human fundus images with a $\geq$35-degree field-of-view (FOV). This technology could eventually be combined with the wavefront-sensing capabilities of phase-mask encoded imaging to create a compact ophthalmic imaging system that simultaneously captures a fundus image and performs aberrometry.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Model-based Deep Learning for Dual-Energy Computed Tomography Material Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dual energy X-ray Computed Tomography (DECT) enables to automatically decompose materials in clinical images without the manual segmentation using the dependency of the X-ray linear attenuation with energy. In this work we propose a deep learning procedure called End-to-End Material Decomposition (E2E-DEcomp) for quantitative material decomposition which directly convert the CT projection data into material images. The algorithm is based on incorporating the knowledge of the spectral model DECT system into the deep learning training loss and combining a data-learned prior in the material image domain. Furthermore, the training does not require any energy-based images in the dataset but rather only sinogram and material images. We show the effectiveness of the proposed direct E2E-DEcomp method on the AAPM spectral CT dataset (Sidky and Pan, 2023) compared with state of the art supervised deep learning networks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Super-Resolution Networks through Realistic Thick-Slice CT Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10182v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based Generative Models have the potential to convert low-resolution CT images into high-resolution counterparts without long acquisition times and increased radiation exposure in thin-slice CT imaging. However, procuring appropriate training data for these Super-Resolution (SR) models is challenging. Previous SR research has simulated thick-slice CT images from thin-slice CT images to create training pairs. However, these methods either rely on simplistic interpolation techniques that lack realism or sinogram reconstruction, which require the release of raw data and complex reconstruction algorithms. Thus, we introduce a simple yet realistic method to generate thick CT images from thin-slice CT images, facilitating the creation of training pairs for SR algorithms. The training pairs produced by our method closely resemble real data distributions (PSNR=49.74 vs. 40.66, p$&lt;$0.05). A multivariate Cox regression analysis involving thick slice CT images with lung fibrosis revealed that only the radiomics features extracted using our method demonstrated a significant correlation with mortality (HR=1.19 and HR=1.14, p$&lt;$0.005). This paper represents the first to identify and address the challenge of generating appropriate paired training data for Deep Learning-based CT SR models, which enhances the efficacy and applicability of SR models in real-world scenarios.</description>
