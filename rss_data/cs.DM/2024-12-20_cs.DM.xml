      <title>Long induced paths and forbidden patterns: Polylogarithmic bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a graph $G$ with a long path $P$. When is it the case that $G$ also contains a long induced path? This question has been investigated in general as well as within a number of different graph classes since the 80s. We have recently observed in a companion paper (Long induced paths in sparse graphs and graphs with forbidden patterns, arXiv:2411.08685, 2024) that most existing results can recovered in a simple way by considering forbidden ordered patterns of edges along the path $P$. In particular we proved that if we forbid some fixed ordered matching along a path of order $n$ in a graph $G$, then $G$ must contain an induced path of order $(\log n)^{\Omega(1)}$. Moreover, we completely characterized the forbidden ordered patterns forcing the existence of an induced path of polynomial size.
  The purpose of the present paper is to completely characterize the ordered patterns $H$ such that forbidding $H$ along a path $P$ of order $n$ implies the existence of an induced path of order $(\log n)^{\Omega(1)}$. These patterns are star forests with some specific ordering, which we called constellations.
  As a direct consequence of our result, we show that if a graph $G$ has a path of length $n$ and does not contain $K_t$ as a topological minor, then $G$ contains an induced path of order $(\log n)^{\Omega(1/t \log^2 t)}$. The previously best known bound was $(\log n)^{f(t)}$ for some unspecified function $f$ depending on the Topological Minor Structure Theorem of Grohe and Marx (2015).</description>

      <title>Some permutation pentanomials over finite fields of even characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper Zhang et al. constructed 17 families of permutation pentanomials of the form $x^t+x^{r_1(q-1)+t}+x^{r_2(q-1)+t}+x^{r_3(q-1)+t}+x^{r_4(q-1)+t}$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ where $q=2^m$. In this paper for 14 of these 17 families we provide a simple explanation as to why they are permutations. We also extend these 14 families into three general classes of permutation pentanomials over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$.</description>

      <title>Large Induced Subgraphs of Bounded Degree in Planar Graphs and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study the following question. Let $\mathcal G$ be a family of graphs and let $k\geq 3$ be an integer. What is the largest value $f_k(n)$ such that every $n$-vertex graph in $\mathcal G$ has an induced subgraph with degree at most $k$ and with $f_k(n)$ vertices? Similar questions, in which one seeks a large induced forest, or a large induced linear forest, or a large induced $d$-degenerate graph, rather than a large induced graph of bounded degree, have been studied for decades and have given rise to some of the most fascinating and elusive conjectures in Graph Theory. We tackle our problem when $\mathcal G$ is the class of the outerplanar graphs, or the class of the planar graphs, or the class of the graphs whose degree is bounded by a value $d&gt;k$. In all cases, we provide upper and lower bounds on the value of $f_k(n)$. For example, we prove that every $n$-vertex planar graph has an induced subgraph with degree at most $3$ and with $\frac{5n}{13}&gt;0.384n$ vertices, and that there exist $n$-vertex planar graphs whose largest induced subgraph with degree at most $3$ has $\frac{4n}{7}+O(1)&lt;0.572n+O(1)$ vertices.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Enumerating Independent Sets in Regular $k$-Partite $k$-Uniform Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The number of independent sets in regular bipartite expander graphs can be efficiently approximated by expressing it as the partition function of a suitable polymer model and truncating its cluster expansion. While this approach has been extensively used for graphs, surprisingly little is known about analogous questions in the context of hypergraphs. In this work, we apply this method to asymptotically determine the number of independent sets in regular $k$-partite $k$-uniform hypergraphs which satisfy natural expansion properties. The resulting formula depends only on the local structure of the hypergraph, making it computationally efficient. In particular, we provide a simple closed-form expression for linear hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Folding One Polyhedral Metric Graph into Another</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the problem of folding one polyhedron, viewed as a metric graph of its edges, into the shape of another, similar to 1D origami. We find such foldings between all pairs of Platonic solids and prove corresponding lower bounds, establishing the optimal scale factor when restricted to integers. Further, we establish that our folding problem is also NP-hard, even if the source graph is a tree. It turns out that the problem is hard to approximate, as we obtain NP-hardness even for determining the existence of a scale factor 1.5-{\epsilon}. Finally, we prove that, in general, the optimal scale factor has to be rational. This insight then immediately results in NP membership. In turn, verifying whether a given scale factor is indeed the smallest possible, requires two independent calls to an NP oracle, rendering the problem DP-complete.</description>

      <title>Continuous Flattening and Reversing of Convex Polyhedral Linkages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove two results about transforming any convex polyhedron, modeled as a linkage L of its edges. First, if we subdivide each edge of L in half, then L can be continuously flattened into a plane. Second, if L is equilateral and we again subdivide each edge in half, then L can be reversed, i.e., turned inside-out. A linear number of subdivisions is optimal up to constant factors, as we show (nonequilateral) examples that require a linear number of subdivisions. For nonequilateral linkages, we show that more subdivisions can be required: even a tetrahedron can require an arbitrary number of subdivisions to reverse. For nonequilateral tetrahedra, we provide an algorithm that matches this lower bound up to constant factors: logarithmic in the aspect ratio.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant Locating-Dominating Sets on the Infinite King Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.09399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph of a network system with vertices, $V(G)$, representing physical locations and edges, $E(G)$, representing informational connectivity. A \emph{locating-dominating (LD)} set $S \subseteq V(G)$ is a subset of vertices representing detectors capable of sensing an "intruder" at precisely their location or somewhere in their open-neighborhood -- an LD set must be capable of locating an intruder anywhere in the graph. We explore three types of fault-tolerant LD sets: \emph{redundant LD} sets, which allow a detector to be removed, \emph{error-detecting LD} sets, which allow at most one false negative, and \emph{error-correcting LD} sets, which allow at most one error (false positive or negative). In particular, we determine lower and upper bounds for the minimum density of these three fault-tolerant locating-dominating sets in the \emph{infinite king grid}.</description>

      <title>Parameterised distance to local irregularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04583v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is \emph{locally irregular} if no two of its adjacent vertices have the same degree. In [Fioravantes et al. Complexity of finding maximum locally irregular induced subgraph. {\it SWAT}, 2022], the authors introduced and studied the problem of finding a locally irregular induced subgraph of a given a graph $G$ of maximum order, or, equivalently, computing a subset $S$ of $V(G)$ of minimum order, whose deletion from $G$ results in a locally irregular graph; $S$ is denoted as an \emph{optimal vertex-irregulator of $G$}. In this work we provide an in-depth analysis of the parameterised complexity of computing an optimal vertex-irregulator of a given graph $G$. Moreover, we introduce and study a variation of this problem, where $S$ is a substet of the edges of $G$; in this case, $S$ is denoted as an \emph{optimal edge-irregulator of $G$}. In particular, we prove that computing an optimal vertex-irregulator of a graph $G$ is in FPT when parameterised by the vertex integrity, neighborhood diversity or cluster deletion number of $G$, while it is $W[1]$-hard when parameterised by the feedback vertex set number or the treedepth of $G$. In the case of computing an optimal edge-irregulator of a graph $G$, we prove that this problem is in FPT when parameterised by the vertex integrity of $G$, while it is NP-hard even if $G$ is a planar bipartite graph of maximum degree $4$, and $W[1]$-hard when parameterised by the size of the solution, the feedback vertex set or the treedepth of $G$. Our results paint a comprehensive picture of the tractability of both problems studied here, considering most of the standard graph-structural parameters.</description>

      <title>Multipartite Entanglement Routing as a Hypergraph Immersion Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multipartite entanglement, linking multiple nodes simultaneously, is a higher-order correlation that offers advantages over pairwise connections in quantum networks (QNs). Creating reliable, large-scale multipartite entanglement requires entanglement routing, a process that combines local, short-distance connections into a long-distance connection, which can be considered as a transformation of network topology. Here, we address the question of whether a QN can be topologically transformed into another via entanglement routing. Our key result is an exact mapping from multipartite entanglement routing to Nash-Williams's graph immersion problem, extended to hypergraphs. This generalized hypergraph immersion problem introduces a partial order between QN topologies, permitting certain topological transformations while precluding others, offering discerning insights into the design and manipulation of higher-order network topologies in QNs.</description>

      <title>Efficient Classical Computation of Single-Qubit Marginal Measurement Probabilities to Simulate Certain Classes of Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06822v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical simulations of quantum circuits are essential for verifying and benchmarking quantum algorithms, particularly for large circuits, where computational demands increase exponentially with the number of qubits. Among available methods, the classical simulation of quantum circuits inspired by density functional theory -- the so-called QC-DFT method, shows promise for large circuit simulations as it approximates the quantum circuits using single-qubit reduced density matrices to model multi-qubit systems. However, the QC-DFT method performs very poorly when dealing with multi-qubit gates. In this work, we introduce a novel CNOT "functional" that leverages neural networks to generate unitary transformations, effectively mitigating the simulation errors observed in the original QC-DFT method. For random circuit simulations, our modified QC-DFT enables efficient computation of single-qubit marginal measurement probabilities, or single-qubit probability (SQPs), and achieves lower SQP errors and higher fidelities than the original QC-DFT method. Despite some limitations in capturing full entanglement and joint probability distributions, we find potential applications of SQPs in simulating Shor's and Grover's algorithms for specific solution classes. These findings advance the capabilities of classical simulations for some quantum problems and provide insights into managing entanglement and gate errors in practical quantum computing.</description>
