      <title>Emerging Challenges in Molecular Paleontology: Misapplication of Environmental DNA Fragments and Misconception of Deamination as a Key Criterion for In Situ DNA Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article critically examines the methodologies applied in ancient DNA (aDNA) research, particularly those developed by Dr. P\"a\"abo's team, which have significantly influenced the field. The focus is on the challenges of distinguishing original in situ DNA (oriDNA) from environmental DNA (eDNA) contamination in fossil samples. Recent analyses indicate that even with rigorous extraction and sequencing protocols, a considerable amount of eDNA remains present, often misinterpreted as oriDNA. This misidentification risks the accuracy of species ascription and evolutionary interpretations derived from fossil analyses. The paper explores fossil preservation's physical and chemical dynamics, which allow eDNA from similar and disparate species to infiltrate bone matrices. We propose enhancements to methodological frameworks, such as broader BLAST database usage and stringent E-value criteria, to improve species-specific aDNA identification. Additionally, the article critiques the reliance on deamination patterns as a definitive marker for aDNA, suggesting a reevaluation of this criterion due to its inconsistency and the potential for misleading sequencing results. Ultimately, our findings advocate for a more cautious and refined approach to aDNA research, ensuring more reliable and verifiable scientific outcomes</description>

      <title>Ancient DNA from 120-Million-Year-Old Lycoptera Fossils Reveals Evolutionary Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High quality ancient DNA (aDNA) is essential for molecular paleontology. Due to DNA degradation and contamination by environmental DNA (eDNA), current research is limited to fossils less than 1 million years old. The study successfully extracted DNA from Lycoptera davidi fossils from the Early Cretaceous period, dating 120 million years ago. Using high-throughput sequencing, 1,258,901 DNA sequences were obtained. We established a rigorous protocol known as the mega screen method. Using this method, we identified 243 original in situ DNA (oriDNA) sequences, likely from the Lycoptera genome. These sequences have an average length of over 100 base pairs and show no signs of deamination. Additionally, 10 transposase coding sequences were discovered, shedding light on a unique self-renewal mechanism in the genome. This study provides valuable DNA data for understanding ancient fish evolution and advances paleontological research.</description>

      <title>DNA Fragments in Crude Oil Reveals Earth's Hidden History</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This groundbreaking research extracted DNA from petroleum using nanoparticle affinity bead technology, yielding 3,159,020 petroleum DNA (pDNA) sequences, primarily environmental DNA. While most original in situ DNA (oriDNA) was lost, ancient DNA (aDNA) from petroleum offers an important source of ecological and evolutionary information, surpassing traditional fossils. This study reveals that oil, mainly sourced from algae and lower aquatic plants, now serves as a new type of fossil, providing detailed insights into Earth's hidden history, including unclassified species and ancient events, revolutionizing petroleum geology and paleontology.</description>

      <title>DART-Eval: A Comprehensive DNA Language Model Evaluation Benchmark on Regulatory DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised models for natural language, vision, and protein sequences have inspired the development of large genomic DNA language models (DNALMs). These models aim to learn generalizable representations of diverse DNA elements, potentially enabling various genomic prediction, interpretation and design tasks. Despite their potential, existing benchmarks do not adequately assess the capabilities of DNALMs on key downstream applications involving an important class of non-coding DNA elements critical for regulating gene activity. In this study, we introduce DART-Eval, a suite of representative benchmarks specifically focused on regulatory DNA to evaluate model performance across zero-shot, probed, and fine-tuned scenarios against contemporary ab initio models as baselines. Our benchmarks target biologically meaningful downstream tasks such as functional sequence feature discovery, predicting cell-type specific regulatory activity, and counterfactual prediction of the impacts of genetic variants. We find that current DNALMs exhibit inconsistent performance and do not offer compelling gains over alternative baseline models for most tasks, while requiring significantly more computational resources. We discuss potentially promising modeling, data curation, and evaluation strategies for the next generation of DNALMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/kundajelab/DART-Eval.</description>

      <title>ProtGO: A Transformer based Fusion Model for accurately predicting Gene Ontology (GO) Terms from full scale Protein Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in next generation sequencing technology have led to the creation of extensive, open-source protein databases consisting of hundreds of millions of sequences. To render these sequences applicable in biomedical applications, they must be meticulously annotated by wet lab testing or extracting them from existing literature. Over the last few years, researchers have developed numerous automatic annotation systems, particularly deep learning models based on machine learning and artificial intelligence, to address this issue. In this work, we propose a transformer-based fusion model capable of predicting Gene Ontology (GO) terms from full-scale protein sequences, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy compared to other contemporary machine learning annotation systems. The approach performs particularly well on clustered split datasets, which comprise training and testing samples originating from distinct distributions that are structurally diverse. This demonstrates that the model is able to understand both short and long term dependencies within the enzyme's structure and can precisely identify the motifs associated with the various GO terms. Furthermore, the technique is lightweight and less computationally expensive compared to the benchmark methods, while at the same time not unaffected by sequence length, rendering it appropriate for diverse applications with varying sequence lengths.</description>
