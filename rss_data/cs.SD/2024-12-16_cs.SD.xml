      <title>SILA: Signal-to-Language Augmentation for Enhanced Control in Text-to-Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of text-to-audio generation has seen significant advancements, and yet the ability to finely control the acoustic characteristics of generated audio remains under-explored. In this paper, we introduce a novel yet simple approach to generate sound effects with control over key acoustic parameters such as loudness, pitch, reverb, fade, brightness, noise and duration, enabling creative applications in sound design and content creation. These parameters extend beyond traditional Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques, incorporating learned representations that capture the subtleties of how sound characteristics can be shaped in context, enabling a richer and more nuanced control over the generated audio. Our approach is model-agnostic and is based on learning the disentanglement between audio semantics and its acoustic features. Our approach not only enhances the versatility and expressiveness of text-to-audio generation but also opens new avenues for creative audio production and sound design. Our objective and subjective evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in producing high-quality, customizable audio outputs that align closely with user specifications.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Multimodal Methods and Spontaneous Speech for Alzheimer's Disease Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognitive impairment detection through spontaneous speech offers potential for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The PROCESS Grand Challenge, part of ICASSP 2025, focuses on advancing this field with innovative solutions for classification and regression tasks. In this work, we integrate interpretable features with temporal features extracted from pre-trained models through a multimodal fusion strategy. For the classification task, our model achieved an F1-score of 0.649 in predicting cognitive states (healthy, MCI, dementia). For the regression task, which involves MMSE score prediction, we obtained a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 2.628. These results led to our team securing the top overall ranking in the competition.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Speech Emotion Recognition with Efficient Channel Attention Guided Deep CNN-BiLSTM Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) is crucial for enhancing affective computing and enriching the domain of human-computer interaction. However, the main challenge in SER lies in selecting relevant feature representations from speech signals with lower computational costs. In this paper, we propose a lightweight SER architecture that integrates attention-based local feature blocks (ALFBs) to capture high-level relevant feature vectors from speech signals. We also incorporate a global feature block (GFB) technique to capture sequential, global information and long-term dependencies in speech signals. By aggregating attention-based local and global contextual feature vectors, our model effectively captures the internal correlation between salient features that reflect complex human emotional cues. To evaluate our approach, we extracted four types of spectral features from speech audio samples: mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, mel-spectrogram, root mean square value, and zero-crossing rate. Through a 5-fold cross-validation strategy, we tested the proposed method on five multi-lingual standard benchmark datasets: TESS, RAVDESS, BanglaSER, SUBESCO, and Emo-DB, and obtained a mean accuracy of 99.65%, 94.88%, 98.12%, 97.94%, and 97.19% respectively. The results indicate that our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to most existing methods.</description>

      <title>CosyVoice 2: Scalable Streaming Speech Synthesis with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous work, we introduced CosyVoice, a multilingual speech synthesis model based on supervised discrete speech tokens. By employing progressive semantic decoding with two popular generative models, language models (LMs) and Flow Matching, CosyVoice demonstrated high prosody naturalness, content consistency, and speaker similarity in speech in-context learning. Recently, significant progress has been made in multi-modal large language models (LLMs), where the response latency and real-time factor of speech synthesis play a crucial role in the interactive experience. Therefore, in this report, we present an improved streaming speech synthesis model, CosyVoice 2, which incorporates comprehensive and systematic optimizations. Specifically, we introduce finite-scalar quantization to improve the codebook utilization of speech tokens. For the text-speech LM, we streamline the model architecture to allow direct use of a pre-trained LLM as the backbone. In addition, we develop a chunk-aware causal flow matching model to support various synthesis scenarios, enabling both streaming and non-streaming synthesis within a single model. By training on a large-scale multilingual dataset, CosyVoice 2 achieves human-parity naturalness, minimal response latency, and virtually lossless synthesis quality in the streaming mode. We invite readers to listen to the demos at https://funaudiollm.github.io/cosyvoice2.</description>

      <title>SonicBoom: Contact Localization Using Array of Microphones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cluttered environments where visual sensors encounter heavy occlusion, such as in agricultural settings, tactile signals can provide crucial spatial information for the robot to locate rigid objects and maneuver around them. We introduce SonicBoom, a holistic hardware and learning pipeline that enables contact localization through an array of contact microphones. While conventional sound source localization methods effectively triangulate sources in air, localization through solid media with irregular geometry and structure presents challenges that are difficult to model analytically. We address this challenge through a feature engineering and learning based approach, autonomously collecting 18,000 robot interaction sound pairs to learn a mapping between acoustic signals and collision locations on the robot end effector link. By leveraging relative features between microphones, SonicBoom achieves localization errors of 0.42cm for in distribution interactions and maintains robust performance of 2.22cm error even with novel objects and contact conditions. We demonstrate the system's practical utility through haptic mapping of occluded branches in mock canopy settings, showing that acoustic based sensing can enable reliable robot navigation in visually challenging environments.</description>

      <title>CSL-L2M: Controllable Song-Level Lyric-to-Melody Generation Based on Conditional Transformer with Fine-Grained Lyric and Musical Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lyric-to-melody generation is a highly challenging task in the field of AI music generation. Due to the difficulty of learning strict yet weak correlations between lyrics and melodies, previous methods have suffered from weak controllability, low-quality and poorly structured generation. To address these challenges, we propose CSL-L2M, a controllable song-level lyric-to-melody generation method based on an in-attention Transformer decoder with fine-grained lyric and musical controls, which is able to generate full-song melodies matched with the given lyrics and user-specified musical attributes. Specifically, we first introduce REMI-Aligned, a novel music representation that incorporates strict syllable- and sentence-level alignments between lyrics and melodies, facilitating precise alignment modeling. Subsequently, sentence-level semantic lyric embeddings independently extracted from a sentence-wise Transformer encoder are combined with word-level part-of-speech embeddings and syllable-level tone embeddings as fine-grained controls to enhance the controllability of lyrics over melody generation. Then we introduce human-labeled musical tags, sentence-level statistical musical attributes, and learned musical features extracted from a pre-trained VQ-VAE as coarse-grained, fine-grained and high-fidelity controls, respectively, to the generation process, thereby enabling user control over melody generation. Finally, an in-attention Transformer decoder technique is leveraged to exert fine-grained control over the full-song melody generation with the aforementioned lyric and musical conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed CSL-L2M outperforms the state-of-the-art models, generating melodies with higher quality, better controllability and enhanced structure. Demos and source code are available at https://lichaiustc.github.io/CSL-L2M/.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Temporal Understanding in Audio Question Answering for Large Audio Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06223v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Audio Question Answering (AQA) task includes audio event classification, audio captioning, and open-ended reasoning. Recently, AQA has garnered attention due to the advent of Large Audio Language Models (LALMs). Current literature focuses on constructing LALMs by integrating audio encoders with text-only Large Language Models (LLMs) through a projection module. While LALMs excel in general audio understanding, they are limited in temporal reasoning, which may hinder their commercial applications and on-device deployment. This paper addresses these challenges and limitations in audio temporal reasoning. First, we introduce a data augmentation technique for generating reliable audio temporal questions and answers using an LLM. Second, we perform a further fine-tuning of an existing baseline using curriculum learning strategy to specialize in temporal reasoning without compromising performance on fine-tuned tasks. We demonstrate the performance of our model using state-of-the-art LALMs on public audio benchmark datasets. Third, we implement our AQA model on-device locally and investigate its CPU inference for edge applications.</description>
