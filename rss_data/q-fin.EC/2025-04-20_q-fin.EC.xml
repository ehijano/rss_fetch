      <title>The heterogeneous causal effects of the EU's Cohesion Fund</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper quantifies the causal effect of cohesion policy on EU regional output and investment focusing on one of its least studied instruments, i.e., the Cohesion Fund (CF). We employ modern causal inference methods to estimate not only the local average treatment effect but also its time-varying and heterogeneous effects across regions. Utilizing this method, we propose a novel framework for evaluating the effectiveness of CF as an EU cohesion policy tool. Specifically, we estimate the time varying distribution of the CF's causal effects across EU regions and derive key distribution metrics useful for policy evaluation. Our analysis shows that relying solely on average treatment effects masks significant heterogeneity and can lead to misleading conclusions about the effectiveness of the EU's cohesion policy. We find that the impact of the CF is frontloaded, peaking within the first seven years after a region's initial inclusion in the program. The distribution of the effects during this first seven-year cycle of funding is right skewed with relatively thick tails. This indicates positive effects but unevenly distributed across regions. Moreover, the magnitude of the CF effect is inversely related to a region's relative position in the initial distribution of output, i.e., relatively poorer recipient regions experience higher effects compared to relatively richer regions. Finally, we find a non-linear relationship with diminishing returns, whereby the impact of CF declines as the ratio of CF funds received to a region's gross value added (GVA) increases.</description>

      <title>Eco-efficiency as a Catalyst for Citizen Co-production: Evidence from Chinese Cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine whether higher eco-efficiency encourages local governments to co-produce environmental solutions with citizens. Using Chinese provincial data and advanced textual analysis, we find that high eco-efficiency strongly predicts more collaborative responses to environmental complaints. Causal inference suggests that crossing a threshold of eco-efficiency increases co-production probabilities by about 24 percentage points, indicating eco-efficiency's potential as a catalyst for participatory environmental governance.</description>

      <title>Balancing Engagement and Polarization: Multi-Objective Alignment of News Content Using LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how media firms can use LLMs to generate news content that aligns with multiple objectives -- making content more engaging while maintaining a preferred level of polarization/slant consistent with the firm's editorial policy. Using news articles from The New York Times, we first show that more engaging human-written content tends to be more polarizing. Further, naively employing LLMs (with prompts or standard Direct Preference Optimization approaches) to generate more engaging content can also increase polarization. This has an important managerial and policy implication: using LLMs without building in controls for limiting slant can exacerbate news media polarization. We present a constructive solution to this problem based on the Multi-Objective Direct Preference Optimization (MODPO) algorithm, a novel approach that integrates Direct Preference Optimization with multi-objective optimization techniques. We build on open-source LLMs and develop a new language model that simultaneously makes content more engaging while maintaining a preferred editorial stance. Our model achieves this by modifying content characteristics strongly associated with polarization but that have a relatively smaller impact on engagement. Our approach and findings apply to other settings where firms seek to use LLMs for content creation to achieve multiple objectives, e.g., advertising and social media.</description>

      <title>The impact of institutional quality on the relation between FDI and house prices in ASEAN emerging countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the relationship between house prices and capital inflows in ASEAN emerging economies, and the impact of institutional quality on that relation. Using a unique balanced panel data set of six emerging countries in ASEAN from 2009 to 2019, we employ various econometric techniques to examine the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) on the house price index. Our findings indicate a long-run relationship and Granger causality from FDI to the house price index in these markets, and we also find evidence of co-movement between the stock price index and the house price index. Additionally, our results suggest that better institutions reduce the impact of FDI on host country housing markets in the context of ASEAN emerging economies. This is one of the first studies to shed light on the role of institutional quality in the effect of FDIs on housing prices in this region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized AI agent networks, such as Gaia, allows individuals to run customized LLMs on their own computers and then provide services to the public. However, in order to maintain service quality, the network must verify that individual nodes are running their designated LLMs. In this paper, we demonstrate that in a cluster of mostly honest nodes, we can detect nodes that run unauthorized or incorrect LLM through social consensus of its peers. We will discuss the algorithm and experimental data from the Gaia network. We will also discuss the intersubjective validation system, implemented as an EigenLayer AVS to introduce financial incentives and penalties to encourage honest behavior from LLM nodes.</description>

      <title>Divergent LLM Adoption and Heterogeneous Convergence Paths in Research Writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are reshaping content creation and academic writing. This study investigates the impact of AI-assisted generative revisions on research manuscripts, focusing on heterogeneous adoption patterns and their influence on writing convergence. Leveraging a dataset of over 627,000 academic papers from arXiv, we develop a novel classification framework by fine-tuning prompt- and discipline-specific large language models to detect the style of ChatGPT-revised texts. Our findings reveal substantial disparities in LLM adoption across academic disciplines, gender, native language status, and career stage, alongside a rapid evolution in scholarly writing styles. Moreover, LLM usage enhances clarity, conciseness, and adherence to formal writing conventions, with improvements varying by revision type. Finally, a difference-in-differences analysis shows that while LLMs drive convergence in academic writing, early adopters, male researchers, non-native speakers, and junior scholars exhibit the most pronounced stylistic shifts, aligning their writing more closely with that of established researchers.</description>

      <title>Wealth inequality and utility: Effect evaluation of redistribution and consumption morals using the macro-econophysical coupled approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reducing wealth inequality and increasing utility are critical issues. This study reveals the effects of redistribution and consumption morals on wealth inequality and utility. To this end, we present a novel approach that couples the dynamic model of capital, consumption, and utility in macroeconomics with the interaction model of joint business and redistribution in econophysics. With this approach, we calculate the capital (wealth), the utility based on consumption, and the Gini index of these inequality using redistribution and consumption thresholds as moral parameters. The results show that: under-redistribution and waste exacerbate inequality; conversely, over-redistribution and stinginess reduce utility; and a balanced moderate moral leads to achieve both reduced inequality and increased utility. These findings provide renewed economic and numerical support for the moral importance known from philosophy, anthropology, and religion. The revival of redistribution and consumption morals should promote the transformation to a human mutual-aid economy, as indicated by philosopher and anthropologist, instead of the capitalist economy that has produced the current inequality. The practical challenge is to implement bottom-up social business, on a foothold of worker coops and platform cooperatives as a community against the state and the market, with moral consensus and its operation.</description>

      <title>Particle-Hole Creation in Condensed Matter: A Conceptual Framework for Modeling Money-Debt Dynamics in Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a field-theoretic framework that models money-debt dynamics in economic systems through a direct analogy to particle-hole creation in condensed matter physics. In this formulation, issuing credit generates a symmetric pair-money as a particle-like excitation and debt as its hole-like counterpart-embedded within a monetary vacuum field. The model is formalized via a second-quantized Hamiltonian that incorporates time-dependent perturbations to represent real-world effects such as interest and profit, which drive asymmetry and systemic imbalance. This framework successfully captures both macroeconomic phenomena, including quantitative easing (QE) and gold-backed monetary regimes, and microeconomic credit creation, under a unified quantum-like formalism. In particular, QE is interpreted as generating entangled-like pairs of currency and bonds, exhibiting systemic correlations akin to nonlocal quantum interactions. Asset-backed systems, on the other hand, are modeled as coherent superpositions that collapse upon use. This approach provides physicists with a rigorous and intuitive toolset to analyze economic behavior using many-body theory, laying the groundwork for a new class of models in econophysics and interdisciplinary field analysis.</description>
