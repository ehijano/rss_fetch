      <title>Molecular relaxation by reverse diffusion with time step prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular relaxation, finding the equilibrium state of a non-equilibrium structure, is an essential component of computational chemistry to understand reactivity. Classical force field methods often rely on insufficient local energy minimization, while neural network force field models require large labeled datasets encompassing both equilibrium and non-equilibrium structures. As a remedy, we propose MoreRed, molecular relaxation by reverse diffusion, a conceptually novel and purely statistical approach where non-equilibrium structures are treated as noisy instances of their corresponding equilibrium states. To enable the denoising of arbitrarily noisy inputs via a generative diffusion model, we further introduce a novel diffusion time step predictor. Notably, MoreRed learns a simpler pseudo potential energy surface instead of the complex physical potential energy surface. It is trained on a significantly smaller, and thus computationally cheaper, dataset consisting of solely unlabeled equilibrium structures, avoiding the computation of non-equilibrium structures altogether. We compare MoreRed to classical force fields, equivariant neural network force fields trained on a large dataset of equilibrium and non-equilibrium data, as well as a semi-empirical tight-binding model. To assess this quantitatively, we evaluate the root-mean-square deviation between the found equilibrium structures and the reference equilibrium structures as well as their DFT energies.</description>

      <title>Kinetic network in Milestoning: Clustering, reduction, and transition path analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a reduction of Milestoning (ReM) algorithm to analyze the high-dimensional Milestoning kinetic network. The algorithm reduces the Milestoning network to low dimensions but preserves essential kinetic information, such as local residence time, exit time, and mean first passage time between any two states. This is achieved in three steps. First, nodes (milestones) in the high-dimensional Milestoning network are grouped into clusters based on the metastability identified by an auxiliary continuous-time Markov chain. Our clustering method is applicable not only to time-reversible networks but also to non-reversible networks generated from practical simulations with statistical fluctuations. Second, a reduced network is established via network transformation, containing only the core sets of clusters as nodes. Finally, transition pathways are analyzed in the reduced network based on the transition path theory. The algorithm is illustrated using a toy model and a solvated alanine dipeptide in two and four dihedral angles.</description>

      <title>Farthest Point Sampling in Property Designated Chemical Feature Space as a General Strategy for Enhancing the Machine Learning Model Performance for Small Scale Chemical Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning model development in chemistry and materials science often grapples with the challenge of small scale, unbalanced labelled datasets, a common limitation in scientific experiments. These dataset imbalances can precipitate overfit ting and diminish model generalization. Our study explores the efficacy of the farthest point sampling (FPS) strategy within target ed chemical feature spaces, demonstrating its capacity to generate well-distributed training datasets and consequently enhance model performance. We rigorously evaluated this strategy across various machine learning models, including artificial neural net works (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), and random forests (RF), using datasets encapsulating physicochemical properties like standard boiling points and enthalpy of vaporization. Our findings reveal that FPS-based models consistently surpass those trained via random sampling, exhibiting superior predictive accuracy and robustness, alongside a marked reduction in overfitting. This improvement is particularly pronounced in smaller training datasets, attributable to increased diversity within the training data's chemical feature space. Consequently, FPS emerges as a universally effective and adaptable approach in approaching high performance machine learning models by small and biased experimental datasets prevalent in chemistry and materials science.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Experimental and Theoretical Study on Doubly Differential Electron-Impact Ionization Cross Sections of Pyrimidine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To provide a comprehensive data set for track structure-based simulations of radiation damage in DNA, doubly differential electron-impact ionization cross sections of pyrimidine, a building block of the nucleobases cytosine and thymine, were measured for primary electron energies between 30 eV and 1 keV as a function of emission angle and secondary electron energy. The measurements were performed for secondary electron energies from 4 eV to about half of the primary electron energy and for emission angles between 25{\deg} and 135{\deg}. Based on the experimental doubly differential ionization cross sections, singly differential and total ionization cross sections of pyrimidine were determined and compared to calculations using the BEB model. In addition to the measurements, a theoretical approach for calculating triply and doubly differential ionization cross section was developed, which is based on the distorted wave Born approximation, a single center expansion of molecular orbitals and an averaging of the T-matrix over different molecular orientations. The calculated doubly differential ionization cross sections of pyrimidine show a qualitatively good agreement with the experimental results.</description>

      <title>Amino Acids Stabilizing Effect on Protein and Colloidal Dispersions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite being used for decades as stabilizers, amino acids (AAs) remain mysterious components of many medical and biological formulations. Hypotheses on their role vary ranging from hydrotropic to protein-specific effects (stabilization against misfolding). Here, we deduce that AAs possess a new and broad colloidal property by finding that stabilizing effect of the AAs is comparable on dispersion of various proteins, plasmid DNA, and non-biological nanoparticles. The interactions among colloidal particles in dispersion are carefully evaluated by the second osmotic virial coefficient (B_22) and the potential of mean force. We propose a theoretical framework that explains the stabilization as the effect of weakly interacting small molecules with patchy nanoscale colloids. We validate it through quantitative comparison with experimental data by comparing equilibrium dissociation constants for AA/proteins obtained either by fitting the B22 data with this theory or experimentally. We find excellent quantitative agreement (e.g. proline/lysozyme 1.18 and 2.28 M, respectively) and indeed that the interactions are very weak. The theory presented implies that (i) charged AAs will be effective only for proteins of opposite charge; (ii) short peptides composed of n AAs will be as or more effective than n separate AAs; (iii) any small molecule weakly interacting with nanoscale colloids that increases the solvation of the surface will have a stabilizing effect. The experimental evidences corroborate all three predictions. Much like the ionic strength of the solution is commonly reported, our results imply that the same should be done for the small molecules, as they also affect fundamentally colloidal properties. As an example, we show that AAs vary the cloud point of a lysozyme solution by as much as 4 K.</description>

      <title>Superior Polymeric Gas Separation Membrane Designed by Explainable Graph Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gas separation using polymer membranes promises to dramatically drive down the energy, carbon, and water intensity of traditional thermally driven separation, but developing the membrane materials is challenging. Here, we demonstrate a novel graph machine learning (ML) strategy to guide the experimental discovery of synthesizable polymer membranes with performances simultaneously exceeding the empirical upper bounds in multiple industrially important gas separation tasks. Two predicted candidates are synthesized and experimentally validated to perform beyond the upper bounds for multiple gas pairs (O2/N2, H2/CH4, and H2/N2). Notably, the O2/N2 separation selectivity is 1.6-6.7 times higher than existing polymer membranes. The molecular origin of the high performance is revealed by combining the inherent interpretability of our ML model, experimental characterization, and molecule-level simulation. Our study presents a unique explainable ML-experiment combination to tackle challenging energy material design problems in general, and the discovered polymers are beneficial for industrial gas separation.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Local Symmetry Fluctuations of Electron Density in Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal halide perovskites have emerged as an exciting class of materials for applications in solar energy harvesting, optical devices, catalysis, and other photophysical applications. Many of the exciting properties of halide perovskites are tied to their soft, dynamic, and anharmonic lattice. In particular, the precise coupling between anharmonic lattice dynamics and electronic fluctuations is not completely understood. To build an understanding of this coupling, we use ab initio molecular dynamics simulations supplemented by the calculation of maximally localized Wannier functions to carry out a dynamic group theory analysis of local electron density fluctuations and how these fluctuations are coupled to lattice fluctuations in the model inorganic halide perovskite CsSnBr3. We detail symmetry-dependent couplings between vibrational modes, including octahedral tilting. Importantly, we suggest that the large anharmonicity of some of the vibrational modes in CsSnBr3 result from electron rotation--nuclear translation coupling, in analogy to rotation--translation coupling effects in molecular plastic crystals. We also identify electronic fluctuations in the Cs cation that couple to distortions in the surrounding Sn-Br cubic coordination environment. We anticipate that our approach and resulting insights into electronic fluctuations will aid in further understanding the role of the fluctuating lattice in determining important physical properties of halide perovskites and beyond.</description>

      <title>A methodology of quantifying membrane permeability based on returning probability theory and molecular dynamics simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical approach to estimate the permeability coefficient of substrates (permeants) for crossing membranes from donor (D) phase to acceptor (A) phase by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. A fundamental aspect of our approach involves reformulating the returning probability (RP) theory, a rigorous bimolecular reaction theory, to describe permeation phenomena. This reformulation relies on the parallelism between permeation and bimolecular reaction processes. In the present method, the permeability coefficient is represented in terms of the thermodynamic and kinetic quantities for the reactive (R) phase that exists within the inner region of membranes. One can evaluate these quantities using multiple MD trajectories starting from phase R. We apply the RP theory to the permeation of ethanol and methylamine at different concentrations (infinitely dilute and 1 mol% conditions of permeants). Under the 1 mol% condition, the present method yields a larger permeability coefficient for ethanol ($0.12 \pm 0.01 ~\mathrm{cm~s^{-1}}$) than for methylamine ($0.069\pm 0.006~\mathrm{cm~s^{-1}}$), while the values of the permeability coefficient are satisfactorily close to those obtained from the brute-force MD simulations [$0.18\pm 0.03 ~\mathrm{cm~s^{-1}}$ and $0.052 \pm 0.005 ~\mathrm{cm~s^{-1}}$ for ethanol and methylamine, respectively]. Moreover, upon analyzing the thermodynamic and kinetic contributions to the permeability, we clarify that a higher concentration dependency of permeability for ethanol, as compared to methylamine, arises from the sensitive nature of ethanol's free-energy barrier within the inner region of the membrane against ethanol concentration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exciton-phonon coupling limits the homogeneous emission linewidth of nanocrystals. Hence, a full understanding of it is crucial. In this work, we statistically investigate exciton-phonon coupling by performing single-particle spectroscopy on Zn$_{1-x}$Cd$_{x}$Se/CdS dot-in-rod nanocrystals at cryogenic temperatures ($T\approx 10~\rm{K}$). In situ cation exchange enables us to analyze different band alignments and thereby different charge-carrier distributions. We find that the relative intensities of the longitudinal optical S- and Se-type phonon replicas correlate with the charge-carrier distribution. Our experimental findings are complemented with quantum mechanical calculations within the effective mass approximation that hint at the relevance of surface charges.</description>

      <title>MUBen: Benchmarking the Uncertainty of Molecular Representation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10060v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large molecular representation models pre-trained on massive unlabeled data have shown great success in predicting molecular properties. However, these models may tend to overfit the fine-tuning data, resulting in over-confident predictions on test data that fall outside of the training distribution. To address this issue, uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods can be used to improve the models' calibration of predictions. Although many UQ approaches exist, not all of them lead to improved performance. While some studies have included UQ to improve molecular pre-trained models, the process of selecting suitable backbone and UQ methods for reliable molecular uncertainty estimation remains underexplored. To address this gap, we present MUBen, which evaluates different UQ methods for state-of-the-art backbone molecular representation models to investigate their capabilities. By fine-tuning various backbones using different molecular descriptors as inputs with UQ methods from different categories, we assess the influence of architectural decisions and training strategies. Our study offers insights for selecting UQ for backbone models, which can facilitate research on uncertainty-critical applications in fields such as materials science and drug discovery.</description>

Abstract: We study the ultrafast time evolution of cyclobutanone excited to singlet n-&gt;Rydberg state through XMS-CASPT2 non-adiabatic surface-hopping simulations. These dynamics predict relaxation to ground-state with a timescale of 670 fs with minimal involvement of triplets. The major path of relaxation to ground-state occurs through a three-state degeneracy region and leads to variety of fragmented photoproducts. We model signals of the resulting time-resolved electron-diffraction spectroscopy which tracks the relaxation of the excited state and the formation of various photoproducts in the ground-state.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Transcorrelated Method enabling accurate Quantum Chemistry on near-term Quantum Hardware</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02007v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is emerging as a new computational paradigm with the potential to transform several research fields, including quantum chemistry. However, current hardware limitations (including limited coherence times, gate infidelities, and limited connectivity) hamper the straightforward implementation of most quantum algorithms and call for more noise-resilient solutions. In quantum chemistry, the limited number of available qubits and gate operations is particularly restrictive since, for each molecular orbital, one needs, in general, two qubits. In this study, we propose an explicitly correlated Ansatz based on the transcorrelated (TC) approach, which transfers -- without any approximation -- correlation from the wavefunction directly into the Hamiltonian, thus reducing the number of resources needed to achieve accurate results with noisy, near-term quantum devices. In particular, we show that the exact transcorrelated approach not only allows for more shallow circuits but also improves the convergence towards the so-called basis set limit, providing energies within chemical accuracy to experiment with smaller basis sets and, therefore, fewer qubits. We demonstrate our method by computing bond lengths, dissociation energies, and vibrational frequencies close to experimental results for the hydrogen dimer and lithium hydride using just 4 and 6 qubits, respectively. Conventional methods require at least ten times more qubits for the same accuracy.</description>

      <title>Nutation-Based Longitudinal Sensing Protocols for High-Field NMR With Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond enable nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of samples at the nano- and micron scales. However, at typical tesla-scale NMR magnetic field strengths, NV-NMR protocols become difficult to implement due to the challenge of driving fast NV pulse sequences sensitive to nuclear Larmor frequencies above a few megahertz. We perform simulations and theoretical analysis of the experimental viability of NV-NMR at tesla-scale magnetic fields using a new measurement protocol called DRACAERIS (Double Rewound ACquisition Amplitude Encoded Radio Induced Signal). DRACAERIS detects the NMR sample's longitudinal magnetization at a much lower driven Rabi frequency, more suitable technically for NV detection. We discuss how pulse errors, finite pulse lengths, and nuclear spin-spin couplings affect the resulting NMR spectra. We find that DRACAERIS is less susceptible to pulse imperfections and off-resonance effects than previous protocols for longitudinal magnetization detection. We also identify reasonable parameters for experimental implementation.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Quantum Computing for Quantum Chemistry: Reducing Circuit Complexity with Transcorrelated and Adaptive Ansatz Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The near-term utility of quantum computers is hindered by hardware constraints in the form of noise. One path to achieving noise resilience in hybrid quantum algorithms is to decrease the required circuit depth -- the number of applied gates -- to solve a given problem. This work demonstrates how to reduce circuit depth by combining the transcorrelated (TC) approach with adaptive quantum ans\"atze and their implementations in the context of variational quantum imaginary time evolution (AVQITE). The combined TC-AVQITE method is used to calculate ground state energies across the potential energy surfaces of H$_4$, LiH, and H$_2$O. In particular, H$_4$ is a notoriously difficult case where unitary coupled cluster theory, including singles and doubles excitations, fails to provide accurate results. Adding TC yields energies close to the complete basis set (CBS) limit while reducing the number of necessary operators -- and thus circuit depth -- in the adaptive ans\"atze. The reduced circuit depth furthermore makes our algorithm more noise-resilient and accelerates convergence. Our study demonstrates that combining the TC method with adaptive ans\"atze yields compact, noise-resilient, and easy-to-optimize quantum circuits that yield accurate quantum chemistry results close to the CBS limit.</description>

Abstract: Isomorphism of the two-state system is heuristic in understanding the dynamical or statistical behavior of the simplest yet most quantum system that has no classical counterpart. We use the constraint phase space developed in J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 145, 204105; 2019, 151, 024105 and J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2021, 12, 2496-2501, non-covariant phase space functions, time-dependent weight functions, and time-dependent normalization factors to construct a novel class of phase space representations of the exact population dynamics of the two-state quantum system. The equations of motion of the trajectory on constraint phase space are isomorphic to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. The contribution of each trajectory to the integral expression for the population dynamics is always positive semi-definite. We also prove that the triangle window function approach, albeit proposed as a heuristic empirical model in J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 145, 144108, is related to a special case of the novel class and leads to an isomorphic representation of the exact population dynamics of the two-state quantum system.</description>

      <title>COBRAPRO: A MATLAB toolbox for Physics-based Battery Modeling and Co-simulation Parameter Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: COBRAPRO is a new open-source physics-based battery modeling software with the capability to conduct closed-loop parameter optimization using experimental data. Physics-based battery models require systematic parameter calibration to accurately predict battery behavior across different usage scenarios. While parameter calibration is essential to predict the dynamic behavior of batteries, many existing open-source DFN modeling tools lack integrated parameter identification routines. COBRAPRO addresses this gap by featuring an embedded parameter optimization framework that optimizes the model parameters by minimizing the error between the simulated and experimentally observed current-voltage data. With COBRAPRO, users can non-invasively identify unknown battery model parameters for any given battery chemistry.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Open Quantum Dynamics via Non-Markovian Quantum State Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of non-Markovian open quantum dynamics is essential but challenging for standard quantum computers due to their non-Hermitian nature, leading to non-unitary evolution, and the limitations of available quantum resources. Here we introduce a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm designed for simulating dissipative dynamics in system with non-Markovian environment. Our approach includes formulating a non-Markovian Stochastic Schr\"odinger equation with complex frequency modes (cNMSSE) where the non-Markovianity is characterized by the mode excitation. Following this, we utilize variational quantum simulation to capture the non-unitary evolution within the cNMSSE framework, leading to a substantial reduction in qubit requirements. To demonstrate our approach, we investigated the spin-boson model and dynamic quantum phase transitions (DQPT) within transverse field Ising model (TFIM). Significantly, our findings reveal the enhanced DQPT in TFIM due to non-Markovian behavior.</description>
