      <title>The McCormick martingale optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15552v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Martingale optimal transport (MOT) often yields broad price bounds for options, constraining their practical applicability. In this study, we extend MOT by incorporating causality constraints among assets, inspired by the nonanticipativity condition of stochastic processes. This, however, introduces a computationally challenging bilinear program. To tackle this issue, we propose McCormick relaxations to ease the bicausal formulation and refer to it as McCormick MOT. The primal attainment and strong duality of McCormick MOT are established under standard assumptions. Empirically, we apply McCormick MOT to basket and digital options. With natural bounds on probability masses, the average price reduction for basket options is approximately 1.08% to 3.90%. When tighter probability bounds are available, the reduction increases to 12.26%, compared to the classic MOT, which also incorporates tighter bounds. For most dates considered, there are basket options with suitable payoffs, where the price reduction exceeds 10.00%. For digital options, McCormick MOT results in an average price reduction of over 20.00%, with the best case exceeding 99.00%.</description>

      <title>The additive Bachelier model with an application to the oil option market in the Covid period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09760v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In April 2020, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange temporarily switched the pricing formula for West Texas Intermediate oil market options from the Black model to the Bachelier model. In this context, we introduce an additive Bachelier model that provides a simple closed-form solution and a good description of the implied volatility surface. This new additive model exhibits several notable mathematical and financial properties. It ensures the no-arbitrage condition, a critical requirement in highly volatile markets, while also enabling a parsimonious synthesis of the volatility surface. The model features only three parameters, each with a clear financial interpretation: the volatility term structure, the vol-of-vol, and a parameter for modelling skew. Model calibration can follow a cascade procedure: first, it accurately replicates the term structures of forwards and At-The-Money volatilities observed in the market; second, it fits the smile of the volatility surface. The proposed model also supports efficient pricing of path-dependent exotic options via Monte Carlo simulation, using a straightforward and computationally efficient approach. Overall, this model provides a robust and parsimonious description of the oil option market during the exceptionally volatile first period of the Covid-19 pandemic.</description>
