      <title>Beyond Technological Usability: Exploratory Factor Analysis of the Comprehensive Assessment of Usability for Learning Technologies (CAUSLT) Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditionally rooted in the domain of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), usability has been primarily associated with the technological performance of a system's user interface. However, as learning technologies continue to advance, a pressing need exists to evaluate these tools from a broader perspective, encompassing not just technological but also pedagogical and sociocultural dimensions. The current paper delves into the multifaceted nature of usability in the context of Learning Design and Technology (LDT). We identified prevailing gaps in current usability research practices within LDT, notably the over-reliance on HCI-derived instruments that may not holistically capture the unique usability demands of learning technologies. To address these challenges, we embarked on the development and analysis of the Comprehensive Assessment of Usability Scale for Learning Technologies (CAUSLT). A total of 155 responses were collected and analyzed. Utilizing exploratory factor analysis, this study aimed to explore core constructs for the development of CAUSLT. Our findings underscore the importance and the critical need for a comprehensive usability evaluation framework tailored for learning technologies, setting the stage for more effective and user-centric educational tools.</description>

      <title>On Efficient Topology Management in Service-Oriented 6G Networks: An Edge Video Distribution Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An efficient topology management in future 6G networks is one of the fundamental challenges for a dynamic network creation based on location services, whereby each autonomous network entity, i.e., a sub-network, can be created for a specific application scenario. In this paper, we study the performance of a novel topology changes management system in a sample 6G network being dynamically organized in autonomous sub-networks. We propose and analyze an algorithm for intelligent prediction of topology changes and provide a comparative analysis with topology monitoring based approach. To this end, we present an industrially relevant case study on edge video distribution, as it is envisioned to be implemented in line with the 3GPP and ETSI MEC (Multi-access Edge Computing) standards. For changes prediction, we implement and analyze a novel topology change prediction algorithm, which can automatically optimize, train and, finally, select the best of different machine learning models available, based on the specific scenario under study. For link change scenario, the results show that three selected ML models exhibit high accuracy in detecting changes in link delay and bandwidth using measured throughput and RTT. ANN demonstrates the best performance in identifying cases with no changes, slightly outperforming random forest and XGBoost. For user mobility scenario, XGBoost is more efficient in learning patterns for topology change prediction while delivering much faster results compared to the more computationally demanding deep learning models, such as LSTM and CNN. In terms of cost efficiency, our ML-based approach represents a significantly cost-effective alternative to traditional monitoring approaches.</description>

      <title>RWKV-Lite: Deeply Compressed RWKV for Resource-Constrained Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10856v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To deploy LLMs on resource-contained platforms such as mobile robots and smartphones, non-transformers LLMs have achieved major breakthroughs. Recently, a novel RNN-based LLM family, Repentance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) has shown strong computational efficiency; nevertheless, RWKV models still have high parameter counts which limited their deployment. In this paper, we propose a suite of compression techniques, ranging from model architecture optimizations to post-training compression, tailored to the RWKV architecture. Combined, our techniques reduce the memory footprint of RWKV models by 3.4x -- 5x with only negligible degradation in accuracy; compared to transformer LLMs with similar accuracy, our models require 4x less memory footprint.</description>
