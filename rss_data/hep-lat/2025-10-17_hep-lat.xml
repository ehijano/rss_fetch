      <title>Study of the $D_s \to \phi \ell \nu_\ell$ semileptonic decay with (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic lattice calculation of the $D_s \to \phi \ell \nu_\ell$ semileptonic decay using (2+1)-flavor Wilson-clover fermion configurations generated by the CLQCD collaboration. Seven gauge ensembles with different lattice spacings, from $0.052~\text{fm}$ to $0.105~\text{fm}$, and different pion masses, from about $210~\text{MeV}$ to $320~\text{MeV}$ are utilized, enabling us to take both the continuum limit and physical pion mass extrapolation. The ratios of form factors are obtained to be $r_V=1.614(19)$ and $r_2=0.741(31)$, with the precision improved by up to an order of magnitude compared to previous lattice studies. The branching fractions are given as $\mathcal{B}(D_s\to\phi e\nu_e)=2.493(66)_{\text{stat}}(31)_{|V_{cs}|}\times 10^{-2}$ and $\mathcal{B}(D_s\to\phi\mu\nu_\mu)=2.351(60)_{\text{stat}}(29)_{|V_{cs}|}\times 10^{-2}$. The corresponding ratio of the branching fractions between the lepton $\mu$ and $e$ is given by $\mathcal{R}_{\mu/e}=0.9432(13)$, which provides essential theoretical support for future high-precision experimental tests of the lepton flavor universality. The CKM matrix element $|V_{cs}|$ is also extracted to be $0.952(12)_{\text{stat}}(23)_{\text{PDG}}$ and $0.945(12)_{\text{stat}}(24)_{\text{PDG}}$ for the $\mu$ and $e$ channels, respectively.</description>

      <title>Chiral spin symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the chiral spin symmetry, which is a symmetry of the color charge and of the confining electric part of QCD. Observation of this symmetry in the vacuum upon truncation of the near-zero modes of the Dirac operator implies that the hadron mass in the light quark sector is not due to the quark condensate of the vacuum and that confinement and chiral symmetry breaking are not directly related. Observation of this symmetry above the chiral symmetry restoration crossover suggests that QCD is still in the confining regime with chirally symmetric quarks bound into the color-singlets by the confining electric field. This regime of QCD was called a stringy fluid. At a temperature T_d that is essentially above T_ch the chiral spin symmetry smoothly disappears suggesting that the confining electric field gets screened and one observes a very smooth crossover to the quark-gluon plasma. The three-regimes picture has been further substantiated by the analysis of the N_c scaling of the energy density, the pressure and the entropy density. In the hadron gas they scale as N_c^0, in the stringy fluid as N_c^1 and in the quark-gluon plasma as N_c^2. We have analyzed the fluctuations of conserved charges that scale as N_c^1 above T_ch thus indicating a transition from the hadron gas to the stringy fluid. When N_c gets sufficiently large the three-regimes picture transforms into the three-phases phase diagram. Finally we discuss a confining and chirally symmetric model in 3+1 dimensions. This model demonstrates the chiral symmetry restoration in the confining regime and a delocalization of the color-singlet quark-antiquark systems that become very large at T &gt; T_ch. Consequently the stringy fluid matter is a very dense highly collective system of the overlapping very large color-singlet quark-antiquark "mesons" with a very small mean free path.</description>

      <title>Study of the $\Lambda \to p \ell \bar{\nu}_\ell$ semileptonic decay in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09970v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD determination of the $\Lambda \to N$ vector and axial-vector form factors, which are essential inputs for studying the semileptonic decay $\Lambda \to p \ell \bar{\nu}_\ell$. This channel provides a clean, theoretically controlled avenue for extracting the CKM matrix element $|V_{us}|$ from the baryon sector. Our analysis uses a gauge ensemble with physical light, strange, and charm quark masses and yields the most precise determination to date of the full set of transition form factors -- including second-class contributions -- as well as the associated couplings, radii, and the ratio of muon-to-electron decay rates, an observable sensitive to possible non-standard scalar and tensor interactions. We compare our non-perturbative results with next-to-next-to-leading order expansions in the small parameter $\delta = (m_\Lambda - m_N)/m_\Lambda \approx 0.16$. We find that the common phenomenological approximation of neglecting the $q^2$-dependence of the form factors leads to a $\sim 4\%$ deviation in the decay rate. This underscores the critical importance of precise, fully non-perturbative form factor inputs for achieving the sub-percent precision targets of upcoming experimental programs.</description>

      <title>Color-magnetic correlations in SU(2) and SU(3) lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the two-point field-strength correlation $g^2 \langle G_{\mu\nu}^a(s)G^b_{\alpha\beta}(s') \rangle$ in the Landau gauge in SU(2) and SU(3) quenched lattice QCD, as well as the gluon propagator $g^2 \langle A_\mu^a (s)A_\nu^b(s') \rangle$. The Landau-gauge gluon propagator $g^2 \langle A_\mu^a (s)A_\mu^a(s') \rangle$ is well described by the Yukawa-type function $e^{-mr}/r$ with $r\equiv |s-s'|$ for $r=0.1-1.0~{\rm fm}$ in both SU(2) and SU(3) QCD. Next, motivated by color-magnetic instabilities in the QCD vacuum, we investigate the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation, $C_{\perp}(r) \equiv g^2\langle H_z^a(s)H_z^a(s + r \hat \perp)) \rangle$ ($\hat \perp$: unit vector on the $xy$-plane), and the parallel-type one, $C_{\parallel}(r) \equiv g^2 \langle H_z^a(s)H_z^a(s + r \hat \parallel) \rangle$ ($\hat \parallel$: unit vector on the $tz$-plane). These two quantities reproduce all the correlation of $g^2\langle G^a_{\mu\nu}(s)G^b_{\alpha\beta}(s')\rangle$, due to the Lorentz and global SU($N_c$) color symmetries in the Landau gauge. Curiously, the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation $C_{\perp}(r)$ is found to be always negative for arbitrary $r$, except for the same-point correlation. In contrast, the parallel-type color-magnetic correlation $C_{\parallel}(r)$ is always positive. In the infrared region of $r \gtrsim 0.4~{\rm fm}$, $C_{\perp}(r)$ and $C_{\parallel}(r)$ strongly cancel each other, which leads to a significant cancellation in the sum of the field-strength correlations as $\sum_{\mu, \nu} g^2\langle G^a_{\mu\nu}(s)G^a_{\mu\nu}(s')\rangle \propto C_{\perp}(|s-s'|)+ C_{\parallel}(|s-s'|) \simeq 0$. Finally, we decompose the field-strength correlation into quadratic, cubic and quartic terms of the gluon field $A_\mu$ in the Landau gauge.</description>

      <title>Probing Quarkonium Diffusion in a Magnetized Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the potential experimental relevance of magnetically affected heavy-quark diffusion, we consider here a five-dimensional nonlinear Einstein-Born-Infeld-dilaton model to not only holographically model the QCD thermodynamics in a magnetic background, but also to probe the charged inner structure of a heavy quarkonium. The dual model's gravitational equations of motion can be solved in analytical form via the potential reconstruction method. Using a variety of tools -- spectral functions, hydrodynamic expansions or hanging strings -- we study the anisotropic diffusion constants and heavy-quark number susceptibility, each time reporting closed form expressions.</description>
