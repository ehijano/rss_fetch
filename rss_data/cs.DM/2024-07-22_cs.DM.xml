      <title>Model-Agnostic Approximation of Constrained Forest Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constrained Forest Problems (CFPs) as introduced by Goemans and Williamson in 1995 capture a wide range of network design problems with edge subsets as solutions, such as Minimum Spanning Tree, Steiner Forest, and Point-to-Point Connection. While individual CFPs have been studied extensively in individual computational models, a unified approach to solving general CFPs in multiple computational models has been lacking. Against this background, we present the shell-decomposition algorithm, a model-agnostic meta-algorithm that efficiently computes a $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation to CFPs for a broad class of forest functions. To demonstrate the power and flexibility of this result, we instantiate our algorithm for 3 fundamental, NP-hard CFPs in 3 different computational models. For example, for constant $\epsilon$, we obtain the following $(2+\epsilon)$-approximations in the Congest model:
  1. For Steiner Forest specified via input components, where each node knows the identifier of one of $k$ disjoint subsets of $V$, we achieve a deterministic $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation in $O(\sqrt{n}+D+k)$ rounds, where $D$ is the hop diameter of the graph.
  2. For Steiner Forest specified via symmetric connection requests, where connection requests are issued to pairs of nodes, we leverage randomized equality testing to reduce the running time to $O(\sqrt{n}+D)$, succeeding with high probability.
  3. For Point-to-Point Connection, we provide a $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation in $O(\sqrt{n}+D)$ rounds.
  4. For Facility Placement and Connection, a relative of non-metric Facility Location, we obtain a $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation in $O(\sqrt{n}+D)$ rounds.
  We further show how to replace the $\sqrt{n}+D$ term by the complexity of solving Partwise Aggregation, achieving (near-)universal optimality in any setting in which a solution to Partwise Aggregation in near-shortcut-quality time is known.</description>

      <title>Interdiction of minimum spanning trees and other matroid bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the minimum spanning tree (MST) interdiction problem, we are given a graph $G=(V,E)$ with edge weights, and want to find some $X\subseteq E$ satisfying a knapsack constraint such that the MST weight in $(V,E\setminus X)$ is maximized. Since MSTs of $G$ are the minimum weight bases in the graphic matroid of $G$, this problem is a special case of matroid interdiction on a matroid $M=(E,\mathcal{I})$, in which the objective is instead to maximize the minimum weight of a basis of $M$ which is disjoint from $X$. By reduction from 0-1 knapsack, matroid interdiction is NP-complete, even for uniform matroids.
  We develop a new exact algorithm to solve the matroid interdiction problem. One of the key components of our algorithm is a dynamic programming upper bound which only requires that a simpler discrete derivative problem can be calculated/approximated for the given matroid. Our exact algorithm then uses this bound within a custom branch-and-bound algorithm. For different matroids, we show how this discrete derivative can be calculated/approximated. In particular, for partition matroids, this yields a pseudopolynomial time algorithm. For graphic matroids, an approximation can be obtained by solving a sequence of minimum cut problems, which we apply to the MST interdiction problem. The running time of our algorithm is asymptotically faster than the best known MST interdiction algorithm, up to polylog factors. Furthermore, our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art computational performance: we solved all available instances from the literature, and in many cases reduced the best running time from hours to seconds.</description>

      <title>Algebraic anti-unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abstraction is key to human and artificial intelligence as it allows one to see common structure in otherwise distinct objects or situations and as such it is a key element for generality in AI. Anti-unification (or generalization) is \textit{the} part of theoretical computer science and AI studying abstraction. It has been successfully applied to various AI-related problems, most importantly inductive logic programming. Up to this date, anti-unification is studied only from a syntactic perspective in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to initiate an algebraic (i.e. semantic) theory of anti-unification within general algebras. This is motivated by recent applications to similarity and analogical proportions.</description>

      <title>Ammann Bars for Octagonal Tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.13973v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ammann bars are formed by segments (decorations) on the tiles of a tiling such that forming straight lines with them while tiling forces non-periodicity. Only a few cases are known, starting with Robert Ammann's observations on Penrose tiles, but there is no general explanation or construction. In this article we propose a general method for cut and project tilings based on the notion of subperiods and we illustrate it with an aperiodic set of 36 decorated prototiles related to what we called Cyrenaic tilings.</description>

      <title>Phenotype control and elimination of variables in Boolean networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how elimination of variables can affect the asymptotic dynamics and phenotype control of Boolean networks. In particular, we look at the impact on minimal trap spaces, and identify a structural condition that guarantees their preservation. We examine the possible effects of variable elimination under three of the most popular approaches to control (attractor-based control, value propagation and control of minimal trap spaces), and under different update schemes (synchronous, asynchronous, generalized asynchronous). We provide some insights on the application of reduction, and an ample inventory of examples and counterexamples.</description>

      <title>On the normality of Boolean quartics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the BFA 2023 conference paper, A. Polujan, L. Mariot and S. Picek exhibited the first example of a non-normal but weakly normal bent function in dimension 8. In this note, we present numerical approaches based on the classification of Boolean spaces to explore in detail the normality of bent functions of 8 variables and we complete S. Dubuc s results for dimensions less or equal to 7. Based on our investigations, we show that all bent functions in 8 variables are normal or weakly normal. Finally, we conjecture that more generally all Boolean functions of degree at most 4 in 8 variables are normal or weakly normal.</description>

      <title>Dispersion on the Complete Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a synchronous process of particles moving on the vertices of a graph $G$, introduced by Cooper, McDowell, Radzik, Rivera and Shiraga (2018). Initially,~$M$ particles are placed on a vertex of $G$. At the beginning of each time step, for every vertex inhabited by at least two particles, each of these particles moves independently to a neighbour chosen uniformly at random. The process ends at the first step when no vertex is inhabited by more than one particle.
  Cooper et al. showed that when the underlying graph is the complete graph on~$n$ vertices, then there is a phase transition when the number of particles $M = n/2$. They showed that if $M&lt;(1-\varepsilon)n/2$ for some fixed $\varepsilon&gt;0$, then the process finishes in a logarithmic number of steps, while if $M&gt;(1+\varepsilon)n/2$, an exponential number of steps are required with high probability. Here we provide a thorough asymptotic analysis of the dispersion time around criticality, where $\varepsilon = o(1)$, and describe the transition from logarithmic to exponential time. As a consequence of our results we establish, for example, that the dispersion time is in probability and in expectation in $\Theta(n^{1/2})$ when $|\varepsilon| = O(n^{-1/2})$, and provide qualitative bounds for its tail behavior.</description>

      <title>Augmentations of Forman's Ricci Curvature and their Applications in Community Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of curvature on graphs has recently gained traction in the networks community, with the Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC) in particular being used for several tasks in network analysis, such as community detection. In this work, we choose a different approach and study augmentations of the discretization of the Ricci curvature proposed by Forman (AFRC). We empirically and theoretically investigate its relation to the ORC and the un-augmented Forman-Ricci curvature. In particular, we provide evidence that the AFRC frequently gives sufficient insight into the structure of a network to be used for community detection, and therefore provides a computationally cheaper alternative to previous ORC-based methods. Our novel AFRC-based community detection algorithm is competitive with an ORC-based approach.</description>

      <title>Average-Case Matrix Discrepancy: Asymptotics and Online Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the operator norm discrepancy of i.i.d. random matrices, initiating the matrix-valued analog of a long line of work on the $\ell^{\infty}$ norm discrepancy of i.i.d. random vectors. First, using repurposed results on vector discrepancy and new first moment method calculations, we give upper and lower bounds on the discrepancy of random matrices. We treat i.i.d. matrices drawn from the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) and low-rank Gaussian Wishart distributions. In both cases, for what turns out to be the "critical" number of $\Theta(n^2)$ matrices of dimension $n \times n$, we identify the discrepancy up to constant factors. Second, we give a new analysis of the matrix hyperbolic cosine algorithm of Zouzias (2011), a matrix version of an online vector discrepancy algorithm of Spencer (1977) studied for average-case inputs by Bansal and Spencer (2020), for the case of i.i.d. random matrix inputs. We both give a general analysis and extract concrete bounds on the discrepancy achieved by this algorithm for matrices with independent entries (including GOE matrices) and Gaussian Wishart matrices.</description>

      <title>Demystifying the RSA Algorithm: An Intuitive Introduction for Novices in Cybersecurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given the escalating importance of cybersecurity, it becomes increasingly beneficial for a diverse community to comprehend fundamental security mechanisms. Among these, the RSA algorithm stands out as a crucial component in public-key cryptosystems. However, understanding the RSA algorithm typically entails familiarity with number theory, modular arithmetic, and related concepts, which can often exceed the knowledge base of beginners entering the field of cybersecurity. In this study, we present an intuitively crafted, student-oriented introduction to the RSA algorithm. We assume that our readers possess only a basic background in mathematics and cybersecurity. Commencing with the three essential goals of public-key cryptosystems, we provide a step-by-step elucidation of how the RSA algorithm accomplishes these objectives. Additionally, we employ a toy example to further enhance practical understanding. Our assessment of student learning outcomes, conducted across two sections of the same course, reveals a discernible improvement in grades for the students.</description>

      <title>Treewidth is Polynomial in Maximum Degree on Weakly Sparse Graphs Excluding a Planar Induced Minor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A graph $G$ contains a graph $H$ as an induced minor if $H$ can be obtained from $G$ after vertex deletions and edge contractions. We show that for every $k$-vertex planar graph $H$, every graph $G$ excluding $H$ as an induced minor and $K_{t,t}$ as a subgraph has treewidth at most $\Delta(G)^{f(k,t)}$ where $\Delta(G)$ denotes the maximum degree of $G$. Without requiring the absence of a $K_{t,t}$ subgraph, Korhonen [JCTB '23] has shown the upper bound of $k^{O(1)} 2^{\Delta(G)^5}$ whose dependence in $\Delta(G)$ is exponential. Our result partially answers a question of Chudnovsky [Dagstuhl seminar '23] asking whether the treewidth of graphs with $\Delta(G)=O(\log{|V(G)|})$ excluding both a $k$-vertex planar graph as an induced minor and the biclique $K_{t,t}$ as a subgraph is in $O_{k,t}(\log |V(G)|)$. We confirm that the treewidth is in this case polylogarithmic in $|V(G)|$.</description>

Abstract: This report presents algorithms for generating small random samples without replacement. It considers two cases. It presents an algorithm for sampling a pair of distinct integers, and an algorithm for sampling a triple of distinct integers. The worst case runtime of both algorithms is constant, while the worst case runtime of common algorithms for the general case of sampling $k$ elements from a set of $n$ are linear in $n$. Java implementations of both algorithms are included in the open source library $\rho\mu$.</description>

      <title>Graceful coloring is computationally hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a (proper) vertex coloring $f$ of a graph $G$, say $f\colon V(G)\to \mathbb{N}$, the difference edge labelling induced by $f$ is a function $h\colon E(G)\to \mathbb{N}$ defined as $h(uv)=|f(u)-f(v)|$ for every edge $uv$ of $G$. A graceful coloring of $G$ is a vertex coloring $f$ of $G$ such that the difference edge labelling $h$ induced by $f$ is a (proper) edge coloring of $G$. A graceful coloring with range $\{1,2,\dots,k\}$ is called a graceful $k$-coloring. The least integer $k$ such that $G$ admits a graceful $k$-coloring is called the graceful chromatic number of $G$, denoted by $\chi_g(G)$.
  We prove that $\chi(G^2)\leq \chi_g(G)\leq a(\chi(G^2))$ for every graph $G$, where $a(n)$ denotes the $n$th term of the integer sequence A065825 in OEIS. We also prove that graceful coloring problem is NP-hard for planar bipartite graphs, regular graphs and 2-degenerate graphs. In particular, we show that for each $k\geq 5$, it is NP-complete to check whether a planar bipartite graph of maximum degree $k-2$ is graceful $k$-colorable. The complexity of checking whether a planar graph is graceful 4-colorable remains open.</description>
