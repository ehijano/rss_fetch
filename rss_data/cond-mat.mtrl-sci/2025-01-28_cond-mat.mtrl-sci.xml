      <title>A Micromechanical Model for Light-interactive Molecular Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular crystals respond to a light stimulus by bending, twisting, rolling, jumping, or other kinematic behaviors. These behaviors are known to be affected by, among others, the intensity of the incident light, the aspect ratios of crystal geometries, and the volume changes accompanying phase transformation. While these factors, individually, explain the increase in internal energy of the system and its subsequent minimization through macroscopic deformation, they do not fully explain the diversity of deformations observed in molecular crystals. Here, we propose a micromechanical model based on the Cauchy-Born rule and photoreaction theory to predict the macroscopic response in molecular crystals. By accounting for lattice geometry changes and microstructural patterns that emerge during phase transformation, we predict a range of deformations in a representative molecular crystal (salicylideneamine). Doing so, we find that the interplay between photoexcited states and the energy minimization pathways, across a multi-well energy landscape, is crucial to the bending and twisting deformations. We use our model to analyze the role of particle geometries and the intensity of incident light on macroscopic deformation, and identify geometric regimes for shearing and twisting deformations in salicylideneamine crystals. Our micromechanical model is general and can be adapted to predict photomechanical deformation in other molecular crystals undergoing a solid-to-solid phase change and has potential as a computational design tool to engineer reversible and controllable actuation in molecular crystals.</description>

      <title>Towards perfect quantum insulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric fields, applied to insulators, cause transitions between valence and conduction bands, giving rise to current. Adjustments of the Hamiltonian can perfect the quality of the insulator, shutting down transitions whilst fully preserving the many-particle state, but they are challenging to implement. Instead, adjusted Hamiltonians having desirable features are addressed variationally, via the analysis of a suitable figure of merit. They suppress current-enabling transitions whilst tending to preserve the many-particle state, and hence they yield optimal insulation. Emerging naturally from this approach are two established concepts: transitionless quantum driving [M. V. Berry, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 42, 365303 (2009)] and (a modified) localization tensor [R. Resta and S. Sorella, Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 370-373 (1999)]. The variational approach is illustrated via application to a tight-binding model. In this setting, the optimally adjusted Hamiltonian has a powerful impact on transition suppression and localization-tensor reduction, suggesting strong enhancement of insulation. These features are expected to be more general than the model that displays them.</description>

      <title>Tuning Catalytic Efficiency: Thermodynamic Optimization of Zr-Doped \ce{Ti3C2} and \ce{Ti3CN} MXenes for HER Catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen production via the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) is critical for sustainable energy solutions, yet the reliance on expensive platinum (Pt) catalysts limits scalability. Zirconium-doped (\ce{Zr}-doped) MXenes, such as \ce{Ti3C2} and \ce{Ti3CN}, emerge as transformative alternatives, combining abundance, tunable electronic properties, and high catalytic potential. Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT), we show that \ce{Zr} doping at 3\% and 7\% significantly enhances HER activity by reducing the work function to the optimal range of 3.5-4.5~eV and achieving near-zero Gibbs free energy (\dgh) values of 0.18-0.16~eV, conditions ideal for efficient hydrogen adsorption and desorption. Bader charge analysis reveals substantial charge redistribution with enhanced electron accumulation at \ce{Zr} and \ce{N} sites, further driving catalytic performance. This synergy between optimized electronic structure and catalytic properties establishes \ce{Zr}-doped MXenes as cost-effective, high-performance alternatives to noble metals for HER. By combining exceptional catalytic efficiency with scalability, our work positions \ce{Zr}-doped MXenes as a breakthrough for green hydrogen production, offering a robust pathway toward renewable energy technologies and advancing the design of next-generation non-precious metal catalysts.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Distance Relations in Casimir Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Casimir-Lifshitz force arises from thermal and quantum mechanical fluctuations between classical bodies and becomes significant below the micron scale. We explore temperature-distance relations based on the concepts of Wick and Bohr arising from energy-time uncertainty relations. We show that temperature-distance relations similar to those arising from the uncertainty principle are found in various Casimir interactions, with an exact relation occurring in the low-temperature regime when the zero point energy contribution cancels the thermal radiation pressure contribution between two plates.</description>

      <title>Accurate THz Measurements of Permittivity and Permeability of BiFeO3 Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrodynamic properties of BiFeO3 films in the THz region are investigated via time domain spectroscopy. Combining the use of transmission ($\tilde{T}$) and reflection ($\tilde{R}$) measurements under normal incidence, the refractive index and impedance of the samples under test are evaluated using a retrieval method. From $\tilde{T}$(($\tilde{R}$)) data two complex functions describing the refractive index $\tilde{n}_T$ ($\tilde{n}_R$) and impedance $\tilde{z}_T$ ($\tilde{z}_R$) are extracted from the independent minimization of the error functions given by the difference between the theoretical model and measurements. Knowledge of the pairs ($\tilde{n}_T, \tilde{n}_R$) and ($\tilde{z}_T, \tilde{z}_R$) enables to calculate with a high accuracy both complex permittivity $\tilde{\varepsilon}$ and permeability $\tilde{\mu}$ of the sample. Signatures of magnetoelectric effects and phononic resonances are observed in the permittivity and permeability functions and discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Unravelling The potential of Hybrid Borocarbonitride Biphenylene 2D Network for Thermoelectric Applications: A First Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate a novel hybrid borocarbonitrides (bpn-BCN) 2D material inspired by recent advances in carbon biphenylene synthesis, using first-principles calculations and semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory. Our analysis confirms the structural stability of bpn-BCN through formation energy, elastic coefficients, phonon dispersion, and molecular dynamics simulations at 300 K and 800 K. The material exhibits an indirect band gap of 0.19 eV (PBE) between the X and Y points and a direct band gap of 0.58 eV (HSE) at the X point. Thermoelectric properties reveal a high Seebeck coefficient, peaking at for n-type carriers at 200K along the x-axis, while n-type has a maximum of The electrical conductivity is for hole carriers, surpassing that of conventional 2D materials. The consequences of the high Seebeck coefficient and conductivity reflect a high-power factor with a peak value of at 1000K for p-type carriers along the y-axis whereas, for n-type. Moreover, the highest observed values were 0.78 (0.72) along the x (y) direction at 750 K for p-type and 0.57 (0.53) at 750 K along the x (y) axis for n-type. Our findings suggest that the bpn-BCN 2D network holds significant potential for thermoelectric applications due to its exceptional performance.</description>

      <title>Iron-Arsenide monolayer as an anode materials for Lithium-ion batteries: A first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This theoretical investigation delves into the structural, electronic, and electrochemical properties of two hexagonal iron-arsenide monolayers, 1T-FeAs and 1H-FeAs, focusing on their potential as anode materials for Lithium-ion batteries. Previous studies have highlighted the ferromagnetic nature of 1T-FeAs at room temperature.Our calculations reveal that both phases exhibit metallic behaviour with spin-polarized electronic band structures. Electrochemical studies show that the 1T-FeAs monolayer has better ionic conductivity for Li ions than the 1H-FeAs phase, attributed to a lower activation barrier of 0.38 eV. This characteristic suggests a faster charge/discharge rate. Both FeAs phases exhibit comparable theoretical capacities 374 mAh/g, outperforming commercial graphite anodes. The average open-circuit voltage for maximum Li atom adsorption is 0.61 V for 1H-FeAs and 0.44 V for 1T-FeAs. The volume expansion over the maximum adsorption of Li atoms on both phases is also remarkably less than the commercially used anode material such as graphite. Further, the adsorption of Li atoms onto 1H-FeAs induces a remarkable transition from ferromagnetism to anti-ferromagnetism, with minimal impact on the electronic band structure. In contrast, the original state of 1T-FeAs remains unaffected by Li adsorption. To summarize, the potential of both 1T-FeAs and 1H-FeAs monolayers as promising anode materials for Lithium-ion batteries, offering valuable insights into their electrochemical performance and phase transition behaviour upon Li adsorption.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study of {\delta}-5 boron monolayer as an anode material for Li and non-Li ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the electrochemical performance of the delta-5 boron monolayer as an anode material for alkali metal (AM) and alkali earth metal (AEM) ion batteries using density functional theory simulations. The electronic properties, adsorption, diffusion rate, and storage behavior of various metal atoms (M) in the {\delta}-5 boron monolayer are explored. Our study shows that the delta-5 boron monolayer possesses high electrical conductivity and a low activation barrier for electron and metal ion transit (0.46-1.72 eV), indicating a fast charge/discharge rate. Furthermore, the theoretical capacities of the {\delta}-5 boron monolayer for Li, Na, and K are found to be greater than those of commercial graphite. The average open-circuit voltage for AM and AEM is reasonably low and in the range of 0.14-0.88 V. Our results show that {\delta}-5 boron monolayer could be a promising anode material in lithium-ion and non-lithium ion rechargeable batteries.</description>

      <title>Tailoring magnetic properties of CoFeB films via tungsten buffer and capping layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the interface between W and CoFeB-based buffer or capping layers at an appropriate temperature is essential for modifying the strength of magnetic anisotropy. In this work, we systematically explore the impact of W buffer and capping layers on the structural, topological, and magnetic anisotropy properties of W (5 nm)/CoFeB(10 nm) and CoFeB(10 nm)/W(3 nm) bilayers sputtered at room temperature (RT) and annealed at an optimal annealing temperature (TA) of 400 C. Our findings demonstrate that the bilayer films uniaxial magnetic anisotropy (UMA) with out-of-plane coercivity (Hcp) is highly influenced by the W buffer, capping layers, and TA. Specifically, the Hcp of the CoFeB layer with the buffer and capping layers annealed at 400 C samples exceed several times the coercivity of those unannealed. CoFeB buffered with W and annealed at 400 C shows larger Hcp, two-fold UMA, and higher in-plane UMA energy density (Keff) than the CoFeB/W bilayers, which can be attributed to the W buffer layer inducing the crystallization of CoFeB during annealing. The W buffer, capping layers, and the TA for W and CoFeB-based bilayer samples significantly alter the surface morphology, grain sizes, and surface roughness. The XRD analysis reveals nano-crystallites embedded in the larger grains of the 400 C annealed samples. Hence, this work offers a promising approach to achieving high thermal stability of UMA in W and CoFeB-based spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Resolving Contradictory Estimates of Band Gaps of Bulk PdSe$_2$: A Wannier-Localized Optimally-Tuned Screened Range-Separated Hybrid Density Functional Theory Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Palladium diselenide (PdSe$_2$) -- a layered van der Waals material -- is attracting significant attention for optoelectronics due to the wide tunability of its band gap from the infrared through the visible range as a function of the number of layers. However, there continues to be disagreement over the precise nature and value of the optical band gap of bulk PdSe$_2$, owing to the rather small value of this gap that complicates experimental measurements and their interpretation. Here, we design and employ a Wannier-localized optimally-tuned screened range-separated hybrid (WOT-SRSH) functional to investigate the electronic bandstructures and optical absorption spectra of bulk and monolayer PdSe$_2$. In particular, we account carefully for the finite exciton center-of-mass momentum within a time-dependent WOT-SRSH framework to calculate the \emph{indirect} optical gap and absorption onset accurately. Our results agree well with the best available photoconductivity measurements, as well as with state-of-the-art many-body perturbation theory calculations, confirming that bulk PdSe$_2$ has an optical gap in the mid-infrared (upper-bound of 0.44 eV). More generally, this work further bolsters the utility of the WOT-SRSH approach for predictive modeling of layered semiconductors.</description>

      <title>A Panoramic View of MXenes via a New Design Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides and nitrides, known as MXenes, possess unique physical and chemical properties, enabling diverse applications in fields ranging from energy storage to communication, catalysis, sensing, healthcare, and beyond. The transition metal and nonmetallic atoms in MXenes can exhibit distinct coordination environments, potentially leading to a wide variety of 2D phases. Despite extensive research and significant advancements, a fundamental understanding of MXenes' phase diversity and its relationship with their hierarchical precursors, including intermediate MAX phases and parent bulk phases, remains limited. Using high-throughput modeling based on first-principles density functional theory, we unveil a wide range of MXenes and comprehensively evaluate their relative stabilities across a large chemical space. The key lies in considering both octahedral and trigonal prismatic coordination environments characteristic of various bulk phases. Through this comprehensive structural library of MXenes, we uncover a close alignment between the phase stability of MXenes and that of their hierarchical 3D counterparts. Building on this, we demonstrate a new design strategy where the atomic coordination environments in parent bulk phases can serve as reliable predictors for the design of MXenes, reducing reliance on intermediate MAX phases. Our study significantly expands the landscape of MXenes, at least doubling the number of possible structures.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Superconducting and Topological Properties in Mg-Li Electrides at High Pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrides as a unique class of emerging materials exhibit fascinating properties and hold important significance for understanding the matter under extreme conditions, which is characterized by valence electrons localized into the interstitial space as quasi-atoms (ISQs). In this work, using crystal structure prediction and first-principles calculations, we identified seven stable phases of Mg-Li that are electride with novel electronic properties under high pressure. Among them, MgLi10 is a semiconductor with a band gap of 0.22 eV; and Pm-3m MgLi is superconductor with a superconducting transition temperature of 22.8 K. The important role played by the localization degree of ISQ in the superconducting transition temperature of these electrides is revealed by systematic comparison of Mg-Li with other Li-rich electride superconductors. Furthermore, we proved that Pm-3m MgLi and Pnma MgLi also have distinct topological behavior with metallic surface states and the non-zero $Z_2$ invariant. The simultaneous coexistence of superconductivity, electronic band topology and electride property in the same structure of Pm-3m MgLi and Pnma MgLi demonstrates the feasibility of realizing multi-quantum phases in a single material, which will stimulate further research in these interdisciplinary fields.</description>

      <title>Pressure induced Structure Change and Anomalies in Thermodynamic Quantities and Transport Properties in Liquid Lithium Hydride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understand the nature of liquid structure and its evolution under different conditions is a major challenge in condensed physics and materials science. Here, we report a pressure-induced structure change spanning a wide pressure range in liquid-state lithium hydride (LiH) by first-principles molecular dynamic simulations. This behavior can be described as a continuous crossover from low pressure liquid with Li$^+$-H$^-$ duality symmetry to high pressure one with broken of duality symmetry. The thermodynamic quantities such as heat capacity and ionic transport properties such as diffusivity are also saliently impacted. It is important to stress that such behavior is firstly predicted for this category of materials, which is ubiquitous in universe as well as in industry applications. Lastly, a comprehensive high-pressure high-temperature phase diagram of LiH is constructed, which embodies rich physics in this previously-thought-simple ionic compound.</description>

      <title>First-principle based Floquet engineering of solids in the velocity gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a practical and accurate strategy to capture light-matter interactions using the Floquet formalism in the velocity gauge in combination with realistic first-principle models of solids. The velocity gauge, defined by the linear coupling to the vector potential, is a standard method to capture the light-matter interaction in solids. However, its use with first-principle models has been limited by the challenging fact that it requires a large number of bands for convergence and its incompatibility with non-local pseudopotential plane wave methods. To improve its convergence properties, we explicitly take into account the truncation of Hilbert space in the construction of the Floquet Hamiltonian in the velocity gauge. To avoid the incompatibility with the pseudopotentials, we base our computations on generalized tight-binding Hamiltonians derived from first-principles through maximally-localized Wannier functions. We exemplify the approach by computing the optical absorption spectra of laser-dressed trans-polyacetylene chain using realistic electronic structure. We show that, by proceeding in this way, Floquet consideration involving the truncated Hilbert spaces reproduces the full basis calculations with only a few bands and with significantly reduced computation time. The strategy has been implemented in FloqticS, a general code for the Floquet engineering of the optical properties of materials. Overall, this work introduces a useful theoretical tool to realize Floquet engineering of realistic solids in the velocity gauge.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Mechanical Strain on Magnetic and Structural Properties of 2D Materials: A Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inherent flexibility of two dimensional materials allows for efficient manipulation of their physical properties through strain application, which is essential for the development of advanced nanoscale devices. This study aimed to understand the impact of mechanical strain on the magnetic properties of two dimensional materials using Monte Carlo simulations. The effects of several strain states on the magnetic properties were investigated using the Lennard Jones potential and bond length-dependent exchange interactions. The key parameters analyzed include the Lindemann coefficient, radial distribution function, and magnetization in relation to temperature and magnetic field. The results indicate that applying biaxial tensile strain generally reduces the critical temperature. In contrast, the biaxial compressive strain increased Tc within the elastic range, but decreased at higher strain levels. Both compressive and tensile strains significantly influence the ferromagnetic properties and structural ordering, as evidenced by magnetization hysteresis. Notably, pure shear strain did not induce disorder, leaving the magnetization unaffected. In addition, our findings suggest the potential of domain-formation mechanisms. This study provides comprehensive insights into the influence of mechanical strain on the magnetic behavior and structural integrity of 2D materials, offering valuable guidance for future research and advanced material design applications.</description>

      <title>Floquet optical selection rules in black phosphorus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical selection rules endorsed by symmetry are crucial for understanding the optical properties of quantum materials and the associated ultrafast spectral phenomena. Herein, we introduce momentum-resolved Floquet optical selection rules using the group theory to elucidate the pump-probe photoemission spectral distributions of monolayer black phosphorus (BP), which are governed by the symmetries of both the material and the lasers. Using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), we further investigate the dynamical evolution of Floquet(-Volkov) states in the photoemission spectra of monolayer BP, revealing their spectral weights at specific momenta for each sideband. These observations are comprehensively explained by the proposed Floquet optical selection rules. Our framework not only clarifies experimental photoemission spectra but also uncovers novel characteristics under different pump-probe configurations. Our results are expected to deepen the understanding of light-induced ultrafast spectra in BP and can be further extended to other Floquet systems.</description>

      <title>Quasi-aperiodic grain boundary phases in {\Sigma}5 tilt grain boundaries in refractory metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report new quasi-aperiodic, ground-state structures and phase transitions in $\Sigma5$ tilt grain boundaries (GBs) in body-centered cubic (BCC) refractory metals Nb, Ta, Mo, and W. $\Sigma5$ tilt GBs have been extensively investigated over the past several decades, with their ground-state structure -- composed of kite-shaped structural units -- previously thought to be well understood. By performing a rigorous GB structure search that optimizes the number of atoms in the boundary core, we predict new quasi-aperiodic "split kite" phases analogous to those previously found in GBs in face-centered cubic metals. Our results suggest that complex aperiodic phases of GBs appear to be a general phenomenon. Density functional theory calculations yield similar GB energies and structures for kite and split kite phases in all BCC metals studied. Phase-contrast image simulations of split kites show better agreement with experimental observations, offering an alternative explanation for previous microscopy results and motivating future atomically resolved imaging of the GB structure.</description>

      <title>An ab initio dataset of size-dependent effective thermal conductivity for advanced technology transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the size of transistors shrinks and power density increases, thermal simulation has become an indispensable part of the device design procedure. However, existing works for advanced technology transistors use simplified empirical models to calculate effective thermal conductivity in the simulations. In this work, we present a dataset of size-dependent effective thermal conductivity with electron and phonon properties extracted from ab initio computations. Absolute in-plane and cross-plane thermal conductivity data of eight semiconducting materials (Si, Ge, GaN, AlN, 4H-SiC, GaAs, InAs, BAs) and four metallic materials (Al, W, TiN, Ti) with the characteristic length ranging from 5 to 50 nanometers have been provided. Besides the absolute value, normalized effective thermal conductivity is also given, in case it needs to be used with updated bulk thermal conductivity in the future. The dataset presented in this paper are openly available at https://doi.org/10.57760/sciencedb.j00113.00154.</description>

      <title>Magnon-mediated perpendicular magnetization switching by topological crystalline insulator SnTe with high spin Hall conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnons possess the ability to transport spin angular momentum in insulating magnetic materials, a characteristic that sets them apart from traditional electronics where power consumption arises from the movement of electrons. However, the practical application of magnon devices demands room temperature operation and low switching power of perpendicular magnetization. Here we demonstrate the low-power manipulation of perpendicular magnetization via magnon torques in SnTe/NiO/CoFeB devices at room temperature. Topological crystalline insulator SnTe exhibits a high spin Hall conductivity of $\sigma_s \approx 6.1\times 10^4 (\hbar/2e)\cdot (\Omega \cdot m)^{-1}$, which facilitates the generation of magnon currents in an antiferromagnetic insulator NiO. The magnon currents traverse the 20-nm-thick NiO layer and subsequently exert magnon torques on the adjacent ferromagnetic layer, leading to magnetization switching. Notably, we achieve a 22-fold reduction in power consumption in SnTe/NiO/CoFeB heterostructures compared to Bi2Te3/NiO/CoFeB control samples. Our findings establish the low-power perpendicular magnetization manipulation through magnon torques, significantly expanding the range of topological materials with practical applications.</description>

      <title>Reliable Density Functional Theory Predictions of Bandgaps for Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider methods for optimizing the bandgap calculation of 3D materials, considering 340 sample materials. Examined are the effects of the choice of the pseudopotential to describe core electrons, the plane-wave basis set cutoff energy, and the Brillouin zone integration. Cost-saving calculations in which the structure is optimized using reduced-quality Brillouin zone integrations and cutoff energies were found to lead to experimentally significant errors exceeding 0.1 eV in 18% of cases using the PBE functional and 21% of cases using PBE0. Such cost-savings approaches are therefore not recommended for general applications. Also, the current practice of using unoptimized grids to perform the Brillouin-zone integrations in bandgap calculations is found to be unreliable for 16% of materials using PBE and for 23% using PBE0. A k-space optimization scheme is introduced that interpolates extensive PBE results to determine a generally useful approach that when used in PBE0 calculations is found to be inadequate for only 1.6% of the materials studied.</description>

      <title>CrySPAI: A new Crystal Structure Prediction Software Based on Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal structure predictions based on the combination of first-principles calculations and machine learning have achieved significant success in materials science. However, most of these approaches are limited to predicting specific systems, which hinders their application to unknown or unexplored domains. In this paper, we present CrySPAI, a crystal structure prediction package developed using artificial intelligence (AI) to predict energetically stable crystal structures of inorganic materials given their chemical compositions. The software consists of three key modules, an evolutionary optimization algorithm (EOA) that searches for all possible crystal structure configurations, density functional theory (DFT) that provides the accurate energy values for these structures, and a deep neural network (DNN) that learns the relationship between crystal structures and their corresponding energies. To optimize the process across these modules, a distributed framework is implemented to parallelize tasks, and an automated workflow has been integrated into CrySPAI for seamless execution. This paper reports the development and implementation of AI AI-based CrySPAI Crystal Prediction Software tool and its unique features.</description>

      <title>Probing Glass Formation in Perylene Derivatives via Atomic Scale Simulations and Bayesian Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the structural dynamics of chromophores are of interest for a range of applications, it is experimentally very challenging to resolve the underlying microscopic mechanisms. Glassy dynamics are also challenging for atomistic simulations due to the underlying dramatic slowdown over many orders of magnitude. Here, we address this issue by combining atomic scale simulations with autocorrelation function analysis and Bayesian regression, and apply this approach to a set of perylene derivatives as prototypical chromophores. The predicted glass transition temperatures and kinetic fragilities are in semi-quantitative agreement with experimental data. By analyzing the underlying dynamics via the normal vector autocorrelation function, we are able to connect the beta and alpha-relaxation processes in these materials to caged (or librational) dynamics and cooperative rotations of the molecules, respectively. The workflow presented in this work serves as a stepping stone toward understanding glassy dynamics in many-component mixtures of perylene derivatives and is readily extendable to other systems of chromophores.</description>

      <title>Spin fluctuations steer electronic behavior and altermagnetism in the FeSb$_{3}$ skutterudite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skutterudites are promising materials for thermoelectric and spintronics applications. Here we explore spin fluctuations in the FeSb$_{3}$ skutterudite and their effect on its electronic structure using Hubbard-corrected density-functional theory calculations. We identify multiple magnetic and charge-disproportionated configurations, with an antiferromagnetic metallic ground state. Paramagnetic fluctuations modeled through a special quasirandom spin structure open a 61 meV gap, consistent with experiments. This state features non-degenerate spin channels and band-avoided crossings, hinting at a potential altermagnetic transition with topological features. Mapping the electronic structure to a Heisenberg Hamiltonian fails to explain the low N\'eel temperature ($\lesssim$10 K), highlighting the role of magnetic exchange frustration and the need for more in-depth experimental investigations.</description>

      <title>Band gap renormalization, carrier mobility and transport in Mg2Si and Ca2Si: Ab-initio scattering and Boltzmann transport equation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform first-principles electron-phonon interaction (EPI) calculations based on many-body perturbation theory to study the temperature-dependent band-gap and charge-carrier transport properties for Mg$_{2}$Si and Ca$_{2}$Si using the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) under different relaxation-time approximations (RTAs). For a PBE band gap of 0.21 (0.56) eV in Mg$_{2}$Si (Ca$_{2}$Si), a zero-point renormalization correction of 29-33 (37-51) meV is obtained using various approaches, while the gap at 300 K is 0.15-0.154 (0.46-0.5) eV. The electron mobility ($\mu_{e}$), with a detailed convergence study at 300 K, is evaluated using linearized (self-energy and momentum RTA, or SERTA and MRTA) and iterative BTE (IBTE) solutions. At 300 K, the $\mu_{e}$ values are 351 (100), 573 (197), and 524 (163) cm$^{2}V^{-1}s^{-1}$ from SERTA, MRTA, and IBTE, respectively, for Mg$_{2}$Si (Ca$_{2}$Si). SERTA (MRTA) provides results in better agreement with IBTE at higher (lower) temperatures, while SERTA-derived $\mu_{e}$ closely matches experimental $\mu_{e}$ values for Mg$_{2}$Si. Thermoelectric (TE) transport coefficients significantly influenced by the choice of RTA, with SERTA and MRTA yielding improved agreement with experimental results compared to constant RTA (CRTA) for Mg$_{2}$Si over an electron concentration range of $10^{17}$ to $10^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$. The lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{ph}$) at 300 K due to phonon-phonon interactions is estimated to be 22.7 (7.2) W m$^{-1}K^{-1}$ for Mg$_{2}$Si (Ca$_{2}$Si). The highest calculated figure of merit (zT) under CRTA is 0.35 (0.38), which decreases to 0.08 (0.085) when EPI is included using MRTA. This study clearly identifies the critical role of EPI in accurate transport predictions of TE silicides. Finally, we explore strategies to enhance zT by reducing $\kappa_{ph}$ through nanostructuring and mass-difference scattering.</description>

      <title>Single-shot capable surface acoustic wave dispersion measurement of a layered plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Established techniques for characterizing a layer on a substrate system via surface acoustic wave (SAW) dispersion measurement are often slow due to the need for scanning excitation or detection positions. We present a method for determining discrete points on the SAW mode at equidistant wavenumbers that requires only a single measurement, overcoming these speed limitations. A pulsed laser, shaped into an array of equidistant lines, generates elastic waves on the sample surface. A vibrometer detects the resulting surface displacement next to the line array. The periodic excitation arrangement results in constructive interference of the SAW at wavelengths corresponding to integer fractions of the line spacing. This leads to distinct peaks in the response spectrum, whose higher orders we term spatial harmonics of the SAW. The known line spacing determines the wavelengths, allowing the peak frequencies to be mapped to discrete points on the SAW dispersion curve, effectively sampling the SAW at specific equidistant wavenumbers. By solving an inverse problem, a model can be fit to the experimental data to obtain properties of the layered system. We demonstrate this technique on copper-clad epoxy laminate and roll-cladded aluminum alloy plates and compare our results with dispersion relation scans and micrography. Additionally, we analyze the method's sensitivity to elastic parameters and layer thickness. This approach offers a viable alternative to established SAW scanning methods, particularly in scenarios where the trade-off of lower wavenumber sampling density is acceptable to achieve exceptionally fast measurements while avoiding moving parts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superstructure spots that appear in diffraction patterns of tilted perovskites are well documented and easily calculated using crystallographic software. Here, by considering a distortion mode as a perturbation of the prototype perovskite structure, we show how the structure factor equation yields Boolean conditions for the presence of first order superstructure reflexions. A subsequent article describes conditions for second order reflexions, which appear only in structures with mixed in-phase and anti-phase oxygen octahedral tilting. This approach may have some advantages for the analysis of electron diffraction patterns of perovskites.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous article (Beanland &amp; Sjokvist, 2024), we derived Boolean conditions for the appearance of superstructure reflexions in diffraction patterns from perovskites with tilted oxygen octahedra, using the structure factor equation. Assuming that the deviation from the untilted prototype perovskite structure was infinitesimally small, we expanded the structure factor as a Taylor series, truncated at the first term. This gave an elegant and simple method giving conditions on the presence or absence of superstructure reflexions. However, in real perovskite materials these distortions are sufficiently large for higher order terms to become significant, giving an additional set of superstructure reflexions. Here, we consider the second term in the expansion and show that it gives rise to second order reflexions with indices of the form half-even-even-odd. Boolean conditions for their presence are given.</description>

      <title>Circular dichroism in resonant inelastic x-ray scattering from birefringence in CuO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) has become a prominent technique to study quasiparticle excitations. With advances in polarization analysis capabilities at different facilities, RIXS offers exceptional potential for investigating symmetry-broken quasiparticles like chiral phonons and magnons. At optical wavelengths birefringence can severely affect polarization states in low-symmetry systems. Here we show its importance for soft x-ray resonances. Given the growing interest in Circular Dichroism (CD) in RIXS, it is important to evaluate how birefringence may affect the RIXS spectra of anisotropic systems. We investigate CuO, a well-known anisotropic material, using Cu $L_3$-edge RIXS and detect significant CD in both magnetic and orbital excitations in the collinear antiferromagnetic phase. We demonstrate that the CD can be modeled by a proper treatment of RIXS scattering amplitudes derived from single-ion calculations with birefringence. Recognizing these effects is crucial for unambiguous identification of subtle dichroic effects induced by symmetry-broken quasiparticles. Furthermore, the combined sensitivity of RIXS and birefringence to local symmetry presents an opportunity to study microscopic changes driven by external perturbations.</description>

      <title>A generative material transformer using Wyckoff representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials play a critical role in various technological applications. Identifying and enumerating stable compounds, those near the convex hull, is therefore essential. Despite recent progress, generative models either have a relatively low rate of stable compounds, are computationally expensive, or lack symmetry. In this work we present Matra-Genoa, an autoregressive transformer model built on invertible tokenized representations of symmetrized crystals, including free coordinates. This approach enables sampling from a hybrid action space. The model is trained across the periodic table and space groups and can be conditioned on specific properties. We demonstrate its ability to generate stable, novel, and unique crystal structures by conditioning on the distance to the convex hull. Resulting structures are 8 times more likely to be stable than baselines using PyXtal with charge compensation, while maintaining high computational efficiency. We also release a dataset of 3 million unique crystals generated by our method, including 4,000 compounds verified by density-functional theory to be within 0.001 eV/atom of the convex hull.</description>

      <title>Superlubric sliding ferroelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sliding ferroelectricity may emerge in many van der Waals bilayers/multilayers and the low switching barriers render ultrafast data writing with low energy cost. We note that such barriers are still much higher compared with structural superlubricity, and in this paper we propose a type of superlubric sliding ferroelectricity in homobilayers separated by a different layer that leads to unprecedented low switching barriers due to incommensurate interfaces. For example, the switching barrier of 3R bilayer MoS2 will be respectively reduced by around 2 or 1 order of magnitudes if they are separated by a graphene or BN monolayer, and the required voltage for switching can be about 1 order of magnitude lower. Such superlubric sliding ferroelectricity widely exists in various similar sandwich trilayer systems where the polarizations stem from symmetry breaking in across-layer stacking configurations, and with ultralow barriers of superlubric sliding, their performances for various applications are greatly enhanced compared with homobilayer sliding ferroelectrics.</description>

      <title>Effect of Anisotropic Peierls Barrier on the Evolution of Discrete Dislocation Networks in Ni</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over low and intermediate strain rates, plasticity in face centered cubic (FCC) metals is governed by the glide of dislocations, which manifest as complex networks that evolve with strain. Considering the elastic anisotropy of FCC metals, the characteristics of dislocation motion are also anisotropic (i.e., dislocation character angle-dependent), which is expected to notably influence the overall evolution of the dislocation network, and consequently, the plastic response of these materials. The aggregate influence of the anisotropy in the Peierls stress on the mechanical response of single crystal Ni was investigated in the present work using discrete dislocation dynamics simulations. Twenty initial dislocation networks, differing in their configuration and dislocation density, were deformed under uniaxial tension up to at least 0.9% strain, and the analysis of character-dependent dynamics showed a suppression of plasticity only for segments of nearly screw character. While the increased screw component of the Peierls stress raised the initial strain hardening rate, it also resulted in longer dislocation segments overall, contrary to the reasoning that longer pinned segments exhibit a lower resistance to motion and might give a weaker response. A non-linear superposition principle is demonstrated to predict the hardening reasonably well, considering the cumulative effects of forest and Peierls stress-related strengthening. Further analysis of the network topology revealed a tendency to maintain connectivity over the course of deformation for those networks simulated using an unequal Peierls stress. The general increases in hardening rate and network connectivity contrast with the localized reduction of dislocation motion, which occurred mainly for segments of nearly screw-type character.</description>

      <title>Transition Metal-Driven Variations in Structure, Magnetism, and Photocatalysis of Monoclinic M3Se4 (M = Fe, Co, Ni) Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition metal selenides (MxSey) have gained attention for their unique physical and chemical properties, especially those associated with the transition metal (M). Despite advancements in synthesis, fabricating these selenides is challenging due to their complex stoichiometry and high asymmetry. One such system is monoclinic iron selenide (Fe3Se4), which can be used in permanent-magnet technologies and serve as a model system for understanding magnetism. This study focuses on fabricating monoclinic M3Se4 (M = Fe, Co, or Ni) compounds via thermal decomposition, examining how solution chemistry influences their morphology and properties. With a Curie temperature of about 322 K, Fe3Se4 is ferrimagnetic, whereas Co3Se4 and Ni3Se4 are paramagnetic between 5 and 300 K. The latter two compounds also show higher catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution in water splitting, with maximum H2-evolution rates of 1.01, 5.16, and 6.83 mmol h-1g-1 for Fe3Se4, Co3Se4, and Ni3Se4, respectively.</description>

      <title>Synthesis, crystal structure, site occupancy and magnetic properties of aluminum substituted M-type Sr hexaferrite SrFe12-xAlxO19 nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synthesis of aluminum substituted strontium hexaferrite nanoparticles (SrFe12-xAlxO19 with x = 0-3), via three different preparation methods, is investigated. The synthesis methods are hydrothermal autoclave (AC) synthesis, a citrate sol-gel (SG) synthesis and a solid-salt matrix (SSM) sol-gel synthesis. Evaluation of macroscopic magnetic properties and of lattice parameters obtained by Rietveld analysis of powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data indicate that successful substitution of Al into the crystal structure is only achieved for the SG method. For the SG sample with x = 3, the coercivity was found to increase by 73% to 830 kA/m, while the saturation magnetization was reduced by 68% to 22.6 Am2/kg compared to the non-substituted x = 0 SG sample. The SSM and AC samples did not show any significant changes in their magnetic properties. To examine the nature of the Al insertion in detail, neutron powder diffraction (NPD) data were collected on the SSM and SG samples. Combined Rietveld refinements of the PXRD and NPD data confirm that effective substitution of the Al ions is only achieved for the SG sample and reveal that Al occupies mainly the (2a)Oh and (12k)Oh sites and to a lesser extent the (4e)BP, (4f)Oh and (4f)Td sites. Moreover, the relative degree of site occupation varies with increasing Al substitution. The intrinsic magnetization according to the refined atomic magnetic moments and Al site occupation fractions was extracted from the NPD data and compared with the measured macroscopic magnetization. A remarkable agreement exists between the two, confirming the robustness and accuracy of the Rietveld analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials leverage geometric design to achieve unconventional properties, such as high strength at low density, efficient wave guiding, and complex shape morphing. The ability to control shape changes builds on the complex relationship between geometry and nonlinear mechanics, and opens new possibilities for disruptive technologies across diverse fields, including wearable devices, medical technology, robotics, and beyond. In this review of shape-morphing metamaterials, we examine the current state of the field and propose a unified classification system for the mechanisms involved, as well as the design principles underlying them. Specifically, we explore two main categories of unit cells-those that exploit structural anisotropy or internal rotations-and two potential approaches to tessellating these cells: based on kinematic compatibility or geometric frustration. We conclude by discussing the available design tools and highlighting emerging challenges in the development of shape-morphing metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Predictive Modeling and Uncertainty Quantification of Fatigue Life in Metal Alloys using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning-based methods have demonstrated great potential for improved property prediction in material science. However, reliable estimation of the confidence intervals for the predicted values remains a challenge, due to the inherent complexities in material modeling. This study introduces a novel approach for uncertainty quantification in fatigue life prediction of metal materials based on integrating knowledge from physics-based fatigue life models and machine learning models. The proposed approach employs physics-based input features estimated using the Basquin fatigue model to augment the experimentally collected data of fatigue life. Furthermore, a physics-informed loss function that enforces boundary constraints for the estimated fatigue life of considered materials is introduced for the neural network models. Experimental validation on datasets comprising collected data from fatigue life tests for Titanium alloys and Carbon steel alloys demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The synergy between physics-based models and data-driven models enhances the consistency in predicted values and improves uncertainty interval estimates.</description>

      <title>Selective Hydrogen Molecule Dissociation on Ca2N Monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing efficient hydrogen storage and conversion technologies is essential for sustainable energy. This study investigates the catalytic potential of a dicalcium nitride (Ca2N) monolayer for hydrogen dissociation using density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. We find that atomic hydrogen preferentially adsorbs at Ca-centered hollow sites (labeled A sites), while molecular hydrogen adsorption is limited to bridge sites (labeled B sites). AIMD simulations reveal that H2 dissociation at B sites inhibits further adsorption, suggesting a mechanism of controlled H2 dissociation. The current findings emphasize the potential of pristine Ca2N as a catalyst for H2 dissociation-related processes and motivate future investigations of its activity in hydrogen evolution reactions.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Modulation of Electronic and Optical Properties in GaN Bilayers by Interlayer Sliding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a first-principles investigation of the electronic and optical properties of gallium nitride (GaN) bilayers, focusing on the influence of interlayer sliding and spacing. In contrast to the earlier studies on discrete stacking configurations, we explore the dynamic evolution of the properties during transitions between stable stacking arrangements. Using density functional theory calculations, we systematically analyze the impact of these structural variations on the electronic band structure and optical absorption spectra of GaN bilayers. The analysis includes both high-symmetry stacking configurations (AA', AB', and AC') and intermediate states generated by controlled in-plane atomic displacements, thereby providing a comprehensive understanding of the property changes associated with interlayer sliding. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the potential for tuning the electronic and optical response of two-dimensional GaN for applications in nanoscale photonic and electronic devices, where precise control over interlayer interactions and stacking is crucial.</description>

      <title>Charge density wave modulated third-order nonlinear Hall effect in 1$T$-VSe$_2$ nanosheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of a pronounced third-order nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) in 1$T$-phase VSe$_2$ nanosheets, synthesized using chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The nanosheets exhibit a charge density wave (CDW) transition at $\sim$77 K. Detailed angle-resolved and temperature-dependent measurements reveal a strong cubic relationship between the third-harmonic Hall voltage $V_{3\omega}^\perp$ and the bias current $I_\omega$, persisting up to room temperature. Notably, the third-order NLHE demonstrates a twofold angular dependence and significant enhancement below the CDW transition temperature, indicative of threefold symmetry breaking in the CDW phase. Scaling analysis suggests that the intrinsic contribution from the Berry connection polarizability tensor is substantially increased in the CDW phase, while extrinsic effects dominate at higher temperatures. Our findings highlight the critical role of CDW-induced symmetry breaking in modulating quantum geometric properties and nonlinear transport phenomena in VSe$_2$, paving the way for future explorations in low-dimensional quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Pyrochlore NaYbO2: A potential Quantum Spin Liquid Candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for quantum spin liquids (QSL) and chemical doping in such materials to explore superconductivity have continuously attracted intense interest. Here, we report the discovery of a potential QSL candidate, pyrochlore-lattice beta-NaYbO2. Colorless and transparent NaYbO2 single crystals, layered alpha-NaYbO2 (~250 um on edge) and octahedral beta-NaYbO2 (~50 um on edge), were grown for the first time. Synchrotron X-ray single crystal diffraction unambiguously determined that the newfound beta-NaYbO2 belongs to the three-dimensional pyrochlore structure characterized by the R-3m space group, corroborated by synchrotron X-ray and neutron powder diffraction and pair distribution function. Magnetic measurements revealed no long-range magnetic order or spin glass behavior down to 0.4 K with a low boundary spin frustration factor of 17.5, suggesting a potential QSL ground state. Under high magnetic fields, the potential QSL state was broken and spins order. Our findings reveal that NaYbO2 is a fertile playground for studying novel quantum states.</description>

Abstract: It is well known that the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) arises from the integration of the non-zero Berry curvature (BC), conventionally observed in the Dirac/Weyl and nodal-line semimetals. Moreover, nodal surface semimetals are expected to exhibit more significant BC under the prevalence of degenerate points near the Fermi level. In this work, we report the detection of a giant AHE in the Kagome magnet Fe$_3$Ge with a two-dimensional (2D) nodal surface (NS) at $k_{z}=\pi$ plane, exhibiting an anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of 1500 $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$ at 160 K, the highest among all reported Kagome topological materials. This finding suggests a new platform for searching large AHC materials and facilitates potential room-temperature applications in spintronic devices and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>On Virial Expansion in Hard Sphere Model</title>

Abstract: Virial expansion is a traditional approach in statistical mechanics that expresses thermodynamic quantities, such as pressure $p$, as power series of density or chemical potential. Its radius of convergence can serve as a potential indicator of phase transition. In this study, we investigate the virial expansion of the hard-sphere model, using the known dimensionless virial coefficients $\tilde{B}_k^{}~(k=1,2,\cdots)$ up to the $12$th order. We find that it is well fitted by $\tilde{B}_k^{}=1.28\times k^{1.90}$, corresponding to the analytic continuation of the virial expansion of the pressure as $\sim \mathrm{Li}_{-1.90}^{}(\eta)$, where $\eta$ is the packing fraction and $\mathrm{Li}_s^{}(x)$ is the polylogarithm function. This implies the absence of singular behavior in the physical parameter space $\eta\leq \eta_{\mathrm{max}}^{}\approx 0.74$ and no indication of phase transition in the virial expansion approach. In addition, we calculate the cluster-integral coefficients $\{b_l^{}\}_{l=1}^\infty$ and observe that their asymptotic behavior resembles the results obtained in the large dimension limit ($D\rightarrow \infty$), suggesting that $D=3$ might be already regarded as large dimension. However, the existence of phase transition in the hard-sphere model has been confirmed by numerous simulations, which clearly indicates that a naive extrapolation of the virial series can lead to unphysical results.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Sub-configurations Reveals Stable Spin-Orbit Torque Switching Polarity in Polycrystalline Mn3Sn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous studies have demonstrated the switching of octupole moment in Mn3Sn driven by spin-orbit torque (SOT). However, they have not accounted for the polycrystalline nature of the sample when explaining the switching mechanism. In this work, we use samples with various atomic orientations to capture this polycrystalline nature. We thoroughly investigate their SOT-induced spin dynamics and demonstrate that the polycrystalline structure leads to distinct outcomes. Our findings reveal that configuration II, where the Kagome plane is perpendicular to the spin polarization, exhibits robust switching with stable polarity, whereas the signals from various sub-configurations in configuration I cancel each other out. By comparing our findings with experimental results, we pinpoint the primary sources contributing to the measured AHE signals. Additionally, we establish a dynamic balance model that incorporates the unique properties of Mn3Sn to elucidate these observations. Our study highlights the essential role of the polycrystalline nature in understanding SOT switching. By clarifying the underlying physical mechanisms, our work resolves the longstanding puzzle regarding the robust SOT switching observed in Mn3Sn.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelastic coupling in the stretched diamond lattice of TbTaO$_4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic structure of diamond-like lattice has been studied extensively in terms of the magnetic frustration. Here we report the distortion of stretched diamond lattice of Tb$^{3+}$ (4$f^8$) in M-TbTaO$_4$ on application of a magnetic field. We have investigated the structural and magnetic properties of M phase terbium tantalate M-TbTaO$_4$ as a function of temperature and magnetic field using magnetometry and powder neutron diffraction. Sharp ${\lambda}$-shape transitions in $d(\chi T)/dT$, $dM/dH$ and specific heat data confirm the previously reported three-dimensional (3D) antiferromagnetic ordering at $T_N \approx 2.25$ K. On application of a magnetic field the N\'eel temperature is found to decrease and variable field neutron diffraction experiments below $T_N$ at 1.6 K show an increase in both the bond and angle distortion of the stretched diamond lattice with magnetic field, indicating a potential magneto-elastic coupling effect. By combining our magnetometry, heat capacity and neutron diffraction results we generate a magnetic phase diagram for M-TbTaO$_4$ as a function of temperature and field.</description>

      <title>Binary random packing fraction of hyperspheres with small or large size difference: a geometric approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The random packing fraction of binary particles in D-dimensional Euclidean space R^D is studied using a geometric approach. First, the binary packing fraction of assemblies with small size difference are studied, using the excluded volume model by Onsager for particles in three-dimensional space (D = 3). According to this model the packing increase by bidispersity is proportional to (1 - f)(u^D - 1)^2, with f as monosized packing fraction, u as size ratio and D as space dimension. The model predictions are compared with computational results for disks in two dimensions (D = 2) and hyperspheres in the large-dimension limit (D to infinity), yielding good agreement. Subsequently, the packing of hyperspheres with large size difference is modeled, employing the classic theory of Furnas. This theory, developed for three dimensions, starts from an infinite size ratio of larger and smaller particles (u to infinity). Here, the pertaining equations are applied to hyperspheres, and successfully compared with computational results for hyperspheres in the large-dimension limit. Furthermore, an asymptotic approximation of the binary packing fraction for large size ratio is derived, which shows that the first order variation of the Furnas packing fraction (u^-1 = 0) is proportional to (2 - f)u^-1. Finally, a scaled D-dimensional binary packing graph is presented, governing a simplified phase diagram that borders the binary random packing fraction of amorphous assemblies. To summarize, basic space-filling and geometric (a-thermal) theories on simple hard spheres appear to be a valuable tool for the study of hyperspheres packing and amorphization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Copper is one of the most extensively studied materials for energy conversion and catalytic systems, with a wide range of other applications from nanophotonics to biotechnology. However, existing synthesis methods are limited with many undesirable by-products and poorly defined morphologies. Here, we report a surfactant-free on-substrate wet synthesis approach that yields monocrystalline metallic Cu microflakes with (111) crystalline exposed surface. By systematically studying the growth mechanism, we achieve unprecedented sizes of more than 130 {\mu}m, which is two orders of magnitude larger than reported in most previous studies, along with higher aspect ratios of over 400. Furthermore, we show distinctly higher stability against oxidation provided by the halide adlayer. Overall, our facile synthesis approach delivers an exciting venue for the emerging fields of catalysis and nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Graphene-Assisted Chemical Stabilization of Liquid Metal Nano Droplets for Liquid Metal Based Energy Storage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy storage devices with liquid_metal electrodes have attracted interest in recent years due to their potential for mechanical resilience, self_healing, dendrite_free operation, and fast reaction kinetics. Gallium alloys like Eutectic Gallium Indium (EGaIn) are appealing due to their low melting point and high theoretical specific capacity. However, EGaIn electrodes are unstable in highly alkaline electrolytes due to Gallium oxide dissolution. In this letter, this bottleneck is addressed by introducing chemically stable films in which nanoscale droplets of EGaIn are coated with trace amounts of graphene oxide (GO). It is demonstrated that a GO to EGaIn weight ratio as low as 0.01 provides enough protection for a thin film formed by GO EGaIn nanocomposite against significantly acidic or alkaline environments (pH 1-14). It is shown that GO coating significantly enhances the surface stability in such environments, thus improving the energy storage capacity by over 10x. Microstructural analysis confirms GO EGaIn composite stability and enhanced electrochemical performance. Utilizing this, a thin film supercapacitor is fabricated. Results indicate that when coating the EGaIn with GO to EGaIn ratio of 0.001 the areal capacitance improves by 10 times, reaching 20.02 mF cm_2. This breakthrough paves the way for advanced liquid metal-based thin film electrodes, promising significant improvements in energy storage applications.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the phonon theory of liquid heat capacity: low-frequency shear modes and intramolecular vibrations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling the heat capacity of liquids present fundamental difficulties due to the strong intermolecular particle interactions and large diffusive-like displacements. Based on the experimental evidence that the microscopic dynamics of liquids closely resemble those of solids, a phonon theory of liquid thermodynamics has been developed. Despite its success, the phonon theory of liquids relies on the questionable assumption that low-frequency shear excitations are propagating in nature and follow a Debye density of states. Furthermore, the same framework does not capture the contribution of intramolecular vibrations, which play a significant role in molecular liquids. In this work, we revisit the phonon theory of liquid heat capacity, introducing alternative approaches to model low-frequency shear modes. In particular, we consider the recently proposed idea of treating such modes as pure kinetic and we propose a novel approach based on identifying those low-frequency excitations as overdamped liquid-like modes with linear in frequency density of states. Moreover, we complete the theory by incorporating the effects of intramolecular vibrations. By comparing the theoretical predictions from these different approaches with the available data for the heat capacity of several liquids, we present a comprehensive evaluation of the original model and the newly proposed extensions. Despite all approaches perform well at low-temperatures, our results indicate that modeling low-frequency modes as overdamped liquid-like excitations yields the most accurate agreement with the data in the whole temperature range. Conversely, we demonstrate that treating these excitations as purely gas-like leads to significant inaccuracies, particularly at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Quantum oscillations of holes in GaN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GaN has emerged to be a major semiconductor akin to silicon due to its revolutionary impacts in solid state lighting, critically enabled by p-type doping, and high-performance radio-frequency and power electronics. Suffering from inefficient hole doping and low hole mobility, quantum oscillations in p-type GaN have not been observed, hindering fundamental studies of valence bands and hole transport in GaN. Here, we present the first observation of quantum oscillations of holes in GaN. Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations in hole resistivity are observed in a quantum-confined two-dimensional hole gas at a GaN/AlN interface, where polarization-induced doping overcomes thermal freeze-out, and a sharp and clean interface boosts the hole mobility enough to unmask the quantum oscillations. These holes degenerately occupy the light and heavy hole bands of GaN and have record-high mobilities of ~1900 cm2/Vs and ~400 cm2/Vs at 3K, respectively. We use magnetic fields up to 72 T to resolve SdH oscillations of holes from both valence bands to extract their respective sheet densities, quantum scattering times, and the effective masses of light holes (0.5-0.7 m0) and heavy holes (1.9 m0). SdH oscillations of heavy and light holes in GaN constitute a direct metrology of valence bands and open new venues for quantum engineering in this technologically important semiconductor. Like strained silicon transistors, strain-engineering of the valence bands of GaN is predicted to dramatically improve hole mobilities by reducing the hole effective mass, a proposal that can now be explored experimentally, particularly in a fully fabricated transistor, using quantum oscillations. Furthermore, the findings of this work suggest a blueprint to create 2D hole gases and observe quantum oscillations of holes in related wide bandgap semiconductors such as SiC and ZnO in which such techniques are not yet possible.</description>

Abstract: Computational materials science increasingly benefits from data management, automation, and algorithm-based decision-making for the simulation of material properties and behavior. Experimental materials science also changes rapidly by incorporation of `machine learning' in materials discovery campaigns. The obvious benefits which include automation, reproducibility, data provenance, and reusability of managed data, however, is not widely available in the experimental domain. We present an implementation of a Active Learning loop with a direct interface to an experimental measurement device in pyiron, a framework designed for high-throughput simulations, as demonstrator how to combine experimental and simulated data in one framework. Apart from the acceleration provided by the active learning approach, additional acceleration of the experimental characterization is achieved by using prior knowledge from density functional theory simulations as well as composition-property predictions from literature mining using correlations in word embeddings. With data from all domains in the same framework, a heretofore untapped and much-needed potential for the acceleration of materials characterization and materials discovery campaigns becomes available.</description>

      <title>Discovering High-Strength Alloys via Physics-Transfer Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the strength of materials requires considering various length and time scales, striking a balance between accuracy and efficiency. Peierls stress measures material strength by evaluating dislocation resistance to plastic flow, reliant on elastic lattice responses and crystal slip energy landscape. Computational challenges due to the non-local and non-equilibrium nature of dislocations prohibit Peierls stress evaluation from state-of-the-art material databases. We propose a data-driven framework that leverages neural networks trained on force field simulations to understand crystal plasticity physics, predicting Peierls stress from material parameters derived via density functional theory computations, which are otherwise computationally intensive for direct dislocation modeling. This physics transfer approach successfully screen the strength of metallic alloys from a limited number of single-point calculations with chemical accuracy. Guided by these predictions, we fabricate high-strength binary alloys previously unexplored, utilizing high-throughput ion beam deposition techniques. The framework extends to problems facing the accuracy-performance dilemma in general by harnessing the hierarchy of physics of multiscale models in materials sciences.</description>

      <title>Theoretical lower limit of coercive field in ferroelectric hafnia</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The high coercive field ($\mathcal{E}_c$) of hafnia-based ferroelectrics presents a major obstacle to their applications. The ferroelectric switching mechanisms in hafnia that dictate $\mathcal{E}_c$, especially those related to domain nucleation in the Nucleation-Limited-Switching (NLS) model and domain wall motion in the Kolmogorov-Avrami-Ishibas (KAI) model, have remained elusive. We develop a deep-learning-assisted multiscale approach, incorporating atomistic insights into the critical nucleus, to predict both NLS- and KAI-type coercive fields. The theoretical NLS-type $\mathcal{E}_c$ values agree with previous experimental results as well as our own measurements and also exhibit the correct thickness scaling for films between 3 and 20 nm. Combined theoretical and experimental investigations reveal that the giant $\mathcal{E}_c$ in hafnia-based ferroelectrics arises from the ultra-thin geometry, which confines switching to the NLS mechanism. We predict that the theoretical lower limit for KAI-type $\mathcal{E}_c$ is 0.1 MV/cm arsing from mobile domain walls. The activation of KAI-type switching to achieve lower $\mathcal{E}_c$ is supported by our experimental demonstration of a low coercive field of 1 MV/cm in a 60 nm ferroelectric (HfO$_2$)$_n$/(ZrO$_2$)$_n$ ($n=3$ unit cells) superlattices. These findings establish a comprehensive framework for understanding ferroelectric switching in hafnia and highlight the potential of geometry and domain-wall engineering to achieve low-$\mathcal{E}_c$ devices.</description>

Abstract: We present a combined experimental and theoretical study on the quasi-one-dimensional organic conductor (TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$, and elucidate the variation of its physical properties under pressure. We fully resolve the crystal structure by single crystal x-ray diffraction measurements using a diamond anvil cell up to 8 GPa, and based on the structural data, we perform first-principles density-functional theory calculations and derive the $ab$ $initio$ extended Hubbard-type Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we compare the behavior of the resistivity measured up to 3 GPa using a BeCu clamp-type cell and the ground state properties of the obtained model numerically calculated by the many-variable variational Monte Carlo method. Our main findings are as follows: i) The crystal was rapidly compressed up to about 3 GPa where the volume drops to 80% and gradually varies down to 70% at 8 GPa. The transfer integrals increase following such behavior whereas the screened Coulomb interactions decrease, resulting in a drastic reduction of correlation effect. ii) The degree of dimerization in the intrachain transfer integrals, as the result of the decrease in structural dimerization together with the change in the intermolecular configuration, almost disappears above 4 GPa; the interchain transfer integrals also show characteristic variations under pressure. iii) The results of identifying the characteristic temperatures in the resistivity and the charge and spin orderings in the calculations show an overall agreement: The charge ordering sensitively becomes unstable above 1 GPa, while the spin ordering survives up to higher pressures. These results shed light on the similarities and differences between applying external pressure and substituting the chemical species (chemical pressure).</description>

Abstract: Predicting quantum operator matrices such as Hamiltonian, overlap, and density matrices in the density functional theory (DFT) framework is crucial for material science. Current methods often focus on individual operators and struggle with efficiency and scalability for large systems. Here we introduce a novel deep learning model, SLEM (strictly localized equivariant message-passing) for predicting multiple quantum operators, that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while dramatically improving computational efficiency. SLEM's key innovation is its strict locality-based design for equivariant representations of quantum tensors while preserving physical symmetries. This enables complex many-body dependency without expanding the effective receptive field, leading to superior data efficiency and transferability. Using an innovative SO(2) convolution and invariant overlap parameterization, SLEM reduces the computational complexity of high-order tensor products and is therefore capable of handling systems requiring the $f$ and $g$ orbitals in their basis sets. We demonstrate SLEM's capabilities across diverse 2D and 3D materials, achieving high accuracy even with limited training data. SLEM's design facilitates efficient parallelization, potentially extending DFT simulations to systems with device-level sizes, opening new possibilities for large-scale quantum simulations and high-throughput materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Modeling Extensive Defects in Metals through Classical Potential-Guided Sampling and Automated Configuration Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extended defects such as dislocation networks and general grain boundaries are ubiquitous in metals, and accurately modeling these extensive defects is crucial for understanding their deformation mechanisms. Existing machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) often fall short in adequately describing these defects, as their significant characteristic sizes exceed the computational limits of first-principles calculations. In this study, we address these challenges by establishing a comprehensive defect genome through empirical interatomic potential-guided sampling. To further enable accurate first-principles calculations on this defect genome, we have developed an automated configuration reconstruction technique. This method transforms defect atomic clusters into periodic configurations through precise atom insertion, utilizing Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations. These strategies enable the development of highly accurate and transferable MLIPs for modeling extensive defects in metals. Using body-centered cubic tungsten as a model system, we develop an MLIP that reveals unique plastic mechanisms in simulations of nanoindentation. This framework not only improves the modeling accuracy of extensive defects in crystalline materials but also establishes a robust foundation for further advancement of MLIP development through the strategic use of defect genomes.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Kikuchi Diffraction Geometries in Scanning Electron Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in scanning electron microscope (SEM) based Kikuchi diffraction have demonstrated the important potential for reflection and transmission methods, like transmission Kikuchi diffraction (TKD) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). Furthermore, with the advent of compact direct electron detectors (DED) it has been possible to place the detector in a variety of configurations within the SEM chamber. This motivates the present work where we explore the similarities and differences of the different geometries that include on-axis TKD &amp; off-axis TKD using electron transparent samples, as well as more conventional EBSD. Furthermore, we compare these with the newest method called "reflection Kikuchi diffraction" RKD where the sample is placed flat in the chamber and the detector is placed below the pole piece. Through remapping collected diffraction patterns, all these methods can be used to generate an experimental "diffraction sphere" that can be used to explore diffraction from any scattering vector from the unit cell, as well as the ability to perform band profile analysis. This diffraction sphere approach enables us to further probe specific differences between the methods, including for example thickness effects in TKD that can result in the generation of diffraction spots, as well as electron scattering path length effects that result in excess and deficiency variations, as well as inversion of bands in experimental patterns.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structure, mass fluctuation, and Localized Bond Properties of two-dimensional double-layer transition metal chalcogenide MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) Calculated Based on Density Functional Theory and BBC model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00792v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study systematically investigates the electronic structure and bonding properties of two-dimensional bilayer transition metal chalcogenides MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) using density functional theory calculations. Through the analysis of band gaps, deformation bond energies, and non-Hermitian bonding characteristics of various MX$_2$ compounds, the electronic properties and chemical bonding features are comprehensively examined. The findings demonstrate that charge transfer plays a critical role in electron mass fluctuation, with the incorporation of topological geometric analysis confirming the influence of mass changes on atomic bonding and electronic states. Furthermore, Heterojunctions between distinct atomic layers are shown to effectively modulate the band gap of two-dimensional bilayer transition metal chalcogenides. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for advancing the application of these materials.</description>

      <title>Native antisite defects in h-BN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an excellent host for solid-state single phonon emitters. Experimental observed emission ranges from infrared to ultraviolet. The emission centers are generally attributed to either intrinsic or extrinsic point defects embedded into hBN. Nevertheless, the microscopic structure of most of these defect emitters is uncertain. Here, through density-functional theory calculations we studied the native antisite defects in hBN. We find that the neutral boron antisite might be a nonmagnetic single photon source with zero-phonon-line (ZPL) at 1.58 eV and such a lineshape that is often observed in experiments. Furthermore, the positively charged nitrogen antisite might be associated with a dim color center recently observed as a blue emitter with ZPL at 2.63 eV. These simple single substitution defects indicate the existence of out-of-plane phonon mode which significantly affects the optical properties. Our results could provide useful information for identification of quantum emitters in hBN.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity of the post-spinel transition and its expression in slabs and plumes worldwide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.08975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At the interface of Earth's upper and lower mantle, the post-spinel transition boundary controls the dynamics and morphologies of downwelling slabs and upwelling plumes, and its Clapeyron slope is hence one of the most important constraints on mantle convection. In this study, we reported a new in situ experimental dataset on phase stability in Mg$_{2}$SiO$_{4}$ at mantle transition zone pressures from laser-heated diamond anvil cell experiments, along with a compilation of corrected in situ experimental datasets from the literature. We presented a machine learning framework for high-pressure phase diagram determination and focused on its application to constrain the location and Clapeyron slope of the post-spinel transition: ringwoodite $\leftrightarrow$ bridgmanite + periclase. We found that the post-spinel boundary is nonlinear and its Clapeyron slope varies locally from $-2.3_{-1.4}^{+0.6}$ MPa/K at 1900 K, to $-1.0_{-1.7}^{+1.3}$ MPa/K at 1700 K, and to $0.0_{-2.0}^{+1.7}$ MPa/K at 1500 K. We applied the temperature-dependent post-spinel Clapeyron slope to estimate its lateral variation across the "660-km" seismic discontinuity in subducting slabs and hotspot-associated plumes worldwide, as well as the ambient mantle. We found that, in the present-day mantle, the average post spinel Clapeyron slope in the plumes is three times more negative than that in slabs, and we then discussed the effects of a nonlinear post-spinel transition on the dynamics of Earth's mantle.</description>

      <title>Ab initio quantum many-body description of superconducting trends in the cuprates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16561v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a systematic ab initio quantum many-body approach that goes beyond low-energy models, we directly compute the superconducting pairing order and estimate the pairing gap of several doped cuprate materials and structures within a purely electronic picture. We find that we can correctly capture two well-known trends: the pressure effect, where the pairing order and gap increase with intra-layer pressure, and the layer effect, where the pairing order and gap vary with the number of copper-oxygen layers. From these calculations, we observe that the strength of superexchange and the covalency at optimal doping are the best descriptors for these trends. Our microscopic analysis further identifies that strong short-range spin fluctuations and multi-orbital charge fluctuations drive the development of the pairing order. Our work illustrates the possibility of a material-specific ab initio understanding of unconventional high-temperature superconducting materials.</description>

      <title>Lowering the Exponential Wall: Accelerating High-Entropy Alloy Catalysts Screening using Local Surface Energy Descriptors from Neural Network Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08413v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational screening is indispensable for the efficient design of high-entropy alloys (HEAs), which hold considerable potential for catalytic applications. However, the chemical space of HEAs is exponentially vast with respect to the number of constituent elements, making even machine learning-based screening calculations time-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a rapid method for predicting HEA properties using data from monometallic systems (or few-component alloys). Central to our approach is the newly introduced local surface energy (LSE) descriptor, which captures local surface reactivity at atomic resolution. We established a correlation between LSE and adsorption energies using monometallic systems. Using this correlation in a linear regression model, we successfully estimated molecular adsorption energies on HEAs with significantly higher accuracy than a conventional descriptor (i.e., generalized coordination numbers). Furthermore, we developed high-precision models by employing both classical and quantum machine learning. Our method enabled CO adsorption-energy calculations for 1000 quinary nanoparticles, comprising 201 atoms each, within a few days, considerably faster than density functional theory, which would require hundreds of years or neural network potentials, which would have taken hundreds of days. The proposed approach accelerates the exploration of the vast HEA chemical space, facilitating the design of novel catalysts.</description>

      <title>Prediction of NMR Parameters and geometry in 133Cs-containing compounds using Density Functional Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The need to immobilize low-level nuclear waste, in particular 137Cs-bearing waste, has led to a growing interest in geopolymer-based waste matrices, in addition to optimization attempts of cement matrix compositions for this specific application. Although the overall phase composition and structure of these matrices are well characterized, the binding sites of Cs in these materials have not been clearly identified. Recent studies have suggested that combining the sensitivity of solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (SSNMR) to the local atomic structure with other structural techniques provides insights into the mode of Cs binding and release. Density Functional Theory (DFT) can provide the connection between spectroscopic parameters and geometric properties. However, the reliability of DFT results strongly relies on the choice of a suitable exchange-correlation functional, which for 133Cs, the NMR surrogate for such studies, is not well-established. In this work we benchmark various functionals against their performance in predicting the geometry of various simple Cs compounds, their NMR quadrupolar coupling constants, and their chemical shift values, while prioritizing the ability to incorporate dispersion interactions and maintaining low computational cost. We examined Cs salts, Cs oxides, perovskites, caged materials, a borate glass and a cesium fluoroscandate. While no single functional performs equally well for all parameters, the results show rev-vdW-DF2 and PBEsol+D3 to be leading candidates for these systems, in particular with respect to geometry and chemical shifts, which are of high importance for Cs-immobilization matrices.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput Discovery of Kagome Materials in Transition Metal Oxide Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08501v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kagome materials are known for hosting exotic quantum states, including quantum spin liquids, charge density waves, and unconventional superconductivity. The search for kagome monolayers is driven by their ability to exhibit neat and well-defined kagome bands near the Fermi level, which are more easily realized in the absence of interlayer interactions. However, this absence also destabilizes the monolayer forms of many bulk kagome materials, posing significant challenges to their discovery. In this work, we propose a strategy to address this challenge by utilizing oxygen vacancies in transition metal oxides within a "1+3" design framework. Through high-throughput computational screening of 349 candidate materials, we identified 12 thermodynamically stable kagome monolayers with diverse electronic and magnetic properties. These materials were classified into three categories based on their lattice geometry, symmetry, band gaps, and magnetic configurations. Detailed analysis of three representative monolayers revealed kagome band features near their Fermi levels, with orbital contributions varying between oxygen 2p and transition metal d states. This study demonstrates the feasibility of the "1+3" strategy, offering a promising approach to uncovering low-dimensional kagome materials and advancing the exploration of their quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Theory of Valley Splitting in Si/SiGe Spin-Qubits: Interplay of Strain, Resonances and Random Alloy Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron spin-qubits in silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterostructures are a major candidate for the realization of scalable quantum computers. A critical challenge in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells (QWs) is the existence of two nearly degenerate valley states at the conduction band minimum that can lead to leakage of quantum information. To address this issue, various strategies have been explored to enhance the valley splitting (i.e., the energy gap between the two low-energy conduction band minima), such as sharp interfaces, oscillating germanium concentrations in the QW (known as wiggle well) and shear strain engineering. In this work, we develop a comprehensive envelope-function theory augmented by empirical nonlocal pseudopotential theory to incorporate the effects of alloy disorder, strain, and non-trivial resonances arising from interaction between valley states across different Brillouin zones. We apply our model to analyze common epitaxial profiles studied in the literature with a focus on wiggle well type structures and compare our results with previous work. Our framework provides an efficient tool for quantifying the interplay of these effects on the valley splitting, enabling complex epitaxial profile optimization in future work.</description>
