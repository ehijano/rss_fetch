      <title>On the extremal spectral properties of random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study some statistical properties of the extreme eigenstates of the randomly-weighted adjacency matrices of random graphs. We focus on two random graph models: Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) graphs and random geometric graphs (RGGs). Indeed, the adjacency matrices of both graph models are diluted versions of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) of random matrix theory (RMT), such that a transition from the Poisson Ensemble (PE) and the GOE is observed by increasing the graph average degree $\langle k \rangle$. First, we write down expressions for the spectral density in terms of $\langle k \rangle$ for the regimes below and above the percolation threshold. Then, we show that the distributions of both, the largest $\lambda_1$ and second-largest $\lambda_2$ eigenvalues approach the Tracy-Widom distribution of type 1 for $\langle k \rangle \gg 1$, while $\langle \lambda_1 \rangle = \sqrt{2\langle k \rangle}$. Additionally, we demonstrate that the distributions of the normalized distance between $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$, the distribution of the ratio between higher consecutive eigenvalues spacings, as well as the distributions of the inverse participation ratios of the extreme eigenstates display a clear PE--to--GOE transition as a function of $\langle k \rangle$, so any of these distributions can be effectively used to probe the delocalization transition of the graph models without the need of the full spectrum.</description>

      <title>Finding Some Impossibility of Flat-Folding of Given Origami Crease Pattern by Graphical Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat-foldability problem of origami is the problem to determine whether a given crease pattern drawn on a piece of paper is possible to fold without any penetration or intrusion of a polygon into any connections among them. It is known from the results of Bern and Hayes and following studies that determining whether an origami diagram which constitute of polygons in general shapes can be flat-folded is an NP-hard problem. In this manuscript, on determining the flat foldability of unsigned crease patterns that satisfy the necessary conditions imposed by the Kawasaki-Justin theorem for all interior vertices, we introduce a graph representation based on an arrangement of polygons whose contours are consist of creases, allowing overlapping of the polygons. On the graphical representation, a method is proposed to efficiently detect the conditions for flat-folding inability by using the properties of the cycle basis. We also demonstrate the above method using an example of a fold that is already known to be impossible to flat-fold.</description>

      <title>Backsolution: A Framework for Solving Inverse Problems via Automatic Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple yet powerful framework for solving inverse problems by leveraging automatic differentiation. Our method is broadly applicable whenever a smooth cost function can be defined near the true solution, and a numerical simulator is available. As a concrete example, we demonstrate that our method can accurately reconstruct the spatial profiles in a conductor from magnetotransport measurements. Even if the given data are insufficient to uniquely determine the profiles, the same framework enables effective reverse modeling. This method is general, flexible, and readily adaptable to a broad class of inverse problems across condensed matter physics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Viscosity, breakdown of Stokes-Einstein relation and dynamical heterogeneity in supercooled liquid Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 from simulations with a neural network potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase change materials are exploited in non-volatile electronic memories and photonic devices that rely on a fast and reversible transformation between the amorphous and crystalline phase upon heating. The recrystallization of the amorphous phase at the operation conditions of the memories occurs in the supercooled liquid phase above the glass transition temperature $T_g$. The dynamics of the supercooled liquid is thus of great relevance for the operation of the devices and, close to $T_g$, also for the structural relaxations of the glass that affect the performances of the memories. Information on the atomic dynamics is provided by the diffusion coefficient ($D$) and by the viscosity ($\eta$) which are, however, both difficult to be measured experimentally at the operation conditions of the devices due to the fast crystallization. In this work, we leverage a machine learning interatomic potential for the flagship phase change compound compound Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ to compute $\eta$, $D$ and the $\alpha$-relaxation time in a wide temperature range from 1200 K to about 100 K above $T_g$. Large scale molecular dynamics simulations allowed quantifying the fragility of the liquid and the occurrence of a breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation between $\eta$ and $D$ in the supercooled phase. Isoconfigurational analysis provided a visualization of the emergence of dynamical heterogeneities responsible for the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation. The analysis revealed that the regions of most mobile atoms are related to the presence of Ge atoms with particular local environments.</description>

      <title>Noise tolerance via reinforcement: Learning a reinforced quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of quantum simulations heavily depends on the efficiency of noise mitigation techniques and error correction algorithms. Reinforcement has emerged as a powerful strategy to enhance the performance of learning and optimization algorithms. In this study, we demonstrate that reinforced quantum dynamics can exhibit significant robustness against interactions with a noisy environment. We study a quantum annealing process where, through reinforcement, the system is encouraged to maintain its current state or follow a noise-free evolution. A learning algorithm is employed to find a concise approximation of this reinforced dynamics, reducing the total evolution time and, consequently, the system's exposure to noisy interactions. This approach also avoids the complexities associated with implementing quantum feedback in such algorithms. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated through numerical simulations of reinforced quantum annealing with one- and two-qubit systems under Pauli noise.</description>

      <title>On the existence of consistent adversarial attacks in high-dimensional linear classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What fundamentally distinguishes an adversarial attack from a misclassification due to limited model expressivity or finite data? In this work, we investigate this question in the setting of high-dimensional binary classification, where statistical effects due to limited data availability play a central role. We introduce a new error metric that precisely capture this distinction, quantifying model vulnerability to consistent adversarial attacks -- perturbations that preserve the ground-truth labels. Our main technical contribution is an exact and rigorous asymptotic characterization of these metrics in both well-specified models and latent space models, revealing different vulnerability patterns compared to standard robust error measures. The theoretical results demonstrate that as models become more overparameterized, their vulnerability to label-preserving perturbations grows, offering theoretical insight into the mechanisms underlying model sensitivity to adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>Structure-Dynamics Correlation and Its Link to Fragility and Dynamic Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the connection between structure, dynamics, and fragility (the rate at which relaxation times grow with decreasing temperature) is central to unraveling the glass transition. Fragility is often linked to dynamic heterogeneity, and thus it is commonly assumed that if structure influences dynamics, more fragile systems should exhibit stronger structure--dynamics correlations. In this study, we test the generality of this assumption using three model systems: Lennard-Jones (LJ) and Weeks--Chandler--Andersen, where fragility is tuned via density, and a modified LJ (q, p) system, where potential softness is changed to vary fragility. We employ a structural order parameter derived from the mean--field caging potential and analyze energy barriers at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. While the macroscopic slope of the energy barrier, suitably defined, correlates with fragility, no consistent correlation is found for the microscopic energy barriers. Instead, the latter shows a strong correlation with an independently computed structure--dynamics measure obtained from isoconfigurational ensemble. Surprisingly, the two systems with the highest structure--dynamics correlation, LJ at rho = 1.1 and the (8, 5) model, are respectively the least and most fragile within their classes. These systems exhibit broad mobility distributions, bimodal displacement profiles, and high non-Gaussian parameters, all indicative of dynamic heterogeneity. However, their dynamic susceptibilities remain low, suggesting a decoupling between spatial correlation and temporal heterogeneity. Both systems lie in the enthalpy-dominated regime and are near the spinodal, suggesting mechanical instability as a source of heterogeneity. These findings challenge the conventional linkage among fragility, heterogeneity, and structure--dynamics correlation.</description>

      <title>Noise resilience of deterministic analog combinatorial optimization solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several continuous dynamical systems have recently been proposed as special-purpose analog computers designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems such as $k$-SAT or the Ising problem. While combinatorial optimization problems are known to be NP-hard, and thus scale, in the worst case, exponentially with the problem size, these analog solvers promise substantial speed-up and scaling advantages in finding the solution. The underlying algorithms, which can be cast in the form of differential equations, generically involve highly chaotic dynamics and thus assume that the system variables can be processed with, in principle, arbitrary precision. However, both actual physical systems as well as finite digital machines, which are used to virtually emulate the dynamics, can process the evolution only with finite precision, be it because of intrinsic noise or because of limited precision in number representation. We investigate the impact of such noise on the solution-finding capability. To this end, we focus on two representative analog solvers, designed to address the Ising problem and the $k$-SAT problem, respectively. Our numerical analysis reveals that the ability of these algorithms to find solutions exhibits a threshold behavior under the addition of noise, where the solution-finding capability remains mostly uncompromised below a noise threshold, while it rapidly deteriorates above the threshold. As we show, these noise tolerance thresholds decrease with the problem size, following an approximate algebraic scaling. This allows us to infer principal limits on the problem sizes that can be efficiently tackled with these solvers under given noise levels.</description>

Abstract: This work presents an approach to the inverse design of scattering systems by modifying the transmission matrix using reinforcement learning. We utilize Proximal Policy Optimization to navigate the highly non-convex landscape of the object function to achieve three types of transmission matrices: (1) Fixed-ratio power conversion and zero-transmission mode in rank-1 matrices, (2) exceptional points with degenerate eigenvalues and unidirectional mode conversion, and (3) uniform channel participation is enforced when transmission eigenvalues are degenerate.</description>

      <title>Hopfield Networks as Models of Emergent Function in Biology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hopfield models, originally developed to study memory retrieval in neural networks, have become versatile tools for modeling diverse biological systems in which function emerges from collective dynamics. In this review, we provide a pedagogical introduction to both classical and modern Hopfield networks from a biophysical perspective. After presenting the underlying mathematics, we build physical intuition through three complementary interpretations of Hopfield dynamics: as noise discrimination, as a geometric construction defining a natural coordinate system in pattern space, and as gradient-like descent on an energy landscape. We then survey recent applications of Hopfield networks a variety of biological setting including cellular differentiation and epigenetic memory, molecular self-assembly, and spatial neural representations.</description>

Abstract: Coupled evolution equations for the amplitudes of heterogeneous states (memories) stored in the connectivity of distributed systems with distance-constrained non-local interactions are derived. The resulting system of coupled amplitude equations describes the spatio-temporal dynamics of the pattern amplitudes. It is shown that these types of distributed systems perform pattern completion and selection, and that the distance restricted connections afford spatio-temporal memory pattern dynamics taking the form of patterning fronts.</description>

      <title>Localization with non-Hermitian off-diagonal disorder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13744v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss a non-Hermitian system described via a one-dimensional single-particle tight-binding model, where the non-Hermiticity is governed by random nearest-neighbour tunnellings, such that the left-to-right and right-to-left hopping strengths are unequal. A physical situation of completely real eigenspectrum arises owing to the Hamiltonian's tridiagonal matrix structure under a simple sign conservation of the product of the conjugate nearest-neighbour tunnelling terms. The off-diagonal disorder leads the non-Hermitian system to a delocalization-localization crossover in finite systems. The emergent nature of the crossover is recognized through a finite-size spectral analysis. The system enters into a localized phase for infinitesimal disorder strength in the thermodynamic limit. We perform a careful scaling analysis of localization length, inverse participation ratio (IPR), and energy splitting and report the corresponding scaling exponents. Noticeably, in contrast to the diagonal disorder, the density of states (DOS) has a singularity at E=0 in the presence of the off-diagonal disorder and the corresponding wavefunction remains delocalized for any given disorder strength.</description>

      <title>Limitations of tensor network approaches for optimization and sampling: A comparison to quantum and classical Ising machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16431v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimization problems pose challenges across various fields. In recent years, quantum annealers have emerged as a promising platform for tackling such challenges. To provide a new perspective, we develop a heuristic tensor network (TN) based algorithm to reveal the low-energy spectrum of Ising spin-glass systems with interaction graphs relevant to present-day quantum annealers. Our deterministic approach combines a branch-and-bound search strategy with an approximate calculation of marginals via TN contractions. Its application to quasi-two-dimensional lattices with large unit cells of up to 24 spins, realized in current quantum annealing processors, requires a dedicated approach that utilizes sparse structures in the TN representation and GPU hardware acceleration. We benchmark our approach on random problems defined on Pegasus and Zephyr graphs with up to a few thousand spins, comparing it against the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer and Simulated Bifurcation algorithm. Apart from the quality of the best solutions, we compare the diversity of low-energy states sampled by all the solvers. For the biggest considered i.i.d. problems with over 5000 spins, the state-of-the-art TN approach leads to solutions that are $0.1\%$ to $1\%$ worse than the best solutions obtained by Ising machines while being two orders of magnitude slower. We attribute those results to approximate contraction failures. For embedded tile planting instances, our approach gets to approximately $0.1\%$ from the planted ground state, a factor of $3$ better than the Ising solvers. While all three methods can output diverse low-energy solutions, e.g., differing by at least a quarter of spins with energy error below $1\%$, our deterministic branch-and-bound approach finds sets of a few such states at most. On the other hand, both Ising machines prove capable of sampling sets of thousands of such solutions.</description>

      <title>On the performance of machine-learning-assisted Monte Carlo in sampling from simple statistical physics models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22598v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a rise in the application of machine learning techniques to aid the simulation of hard-to-sample systems that cannot be studied using traditional methods. Despite the introduction of many different architectures and procedures, a wide theoretical understanding is still lacking, with the risk of suboptimal implementations. As a first step to address this gap, we provide here a complete analytic study of the widely-used Sequential Tempering procedure applied to a shallow MADE architecture for the Curie-Weiss model. The contribution of this work is twofold: firstly, we give a description of the optimal weights and of the training under Gradient Descent optimization. Secondly, we compare what happens in Sequential Tempering with and without the addition of local Metropolis Monte Carlo steps. We are thus able to give theoretical predictions on the best procedure to apply in this case. This work establishes a clear theoretical basis for the integration of machine learning techniques into Monte Carlo sampling and optimization.</description>

Abstract: Associative memory models such as the Hopfield network and its dense generalizations with higher-order interactions exhibit a "blackout catastrophe"--a discontinuous transition where stable memory states abruptly vanish when the number of stored patterns exceeds a critical capacity. This transition is often interpreted as rendering networks unusable beyond capacity limits. We argue that this interpretation is largely an artifact of the equilibrium perspective. We derive dynamical mean-field equations using a bipartite cavity approach for graded-activity dense associative memory models, with the Hopfield model as a special case, and solve them using a numerical scheme. We show that patterns can be transiently retrieved with high accuracy above capacity despite the absence of stable attractors. This occurs because slow regions persist in the above-capacity energy landscape near stored patterns as lingering traces of the stable basins that existed below capacity. The same transient-retrieval effect occurs in below-capacity networks initialized outside basins of attraction. "Transient-recovery curves" provide a concise visual summary of these effects, revealing graceful, non-catastrophic changes in retrieval behavior above capacity and allowing us to compare the behavior across interaction orders. This dynamical perspective reveals rich energy landscape structure obscured by equilibrium analysis and suggests biological neural circuits may exploit transient dynamics for memory retrieval. Furthermore, our approach suggests ways of understanding computational properties of neural circuits without reference to fixed points, advances the technical repertoire of numerical mean-field solution methods for recurrent neural networks, and yields new theoretical results on generalizations of the Hopfield model.</description>

      <title>Engineering many-body quantum Hamiltonians with non-ergodic properties using quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.08587v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a computational framework to identify Hamiltonians of interacting quantum many-body systems that host non-ergodic excited states. We combine quantum Monte Carlo simulations with the recently proposed eigenstate-to-Hamiltonian construction, which maps the ground state of a specified parent Hamiltonian to a single non-ergodic excited state of a new derived Hamiltonian. This engineered Hamiltonian contains non-trivial, systematically-obtained, and emergent features that are responsible for its non-ergodic properties. We demonstrate this approach by applying it to quantum many-body scar states where we discover a previously unreported family of Hamiltonians with spatially oscillating spin exchange couplings that host scar-like properties, including revivals in the quantum dynamics, and towers in the inverse participation ratio; and to many-body localization, where we find a two-dimensional Hamiltonian with correlated disorder that exhibits non-ergodic scaling of the participation entropy and inverse participation ratios of order unity. The method can be applied to other known ground states to discover new quantum many-body systems with non-ergodic excited states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A variety of local index formulas is constructed for quantum Hamiltonians with periodic boundary conditions. All dimensions of physical space as well as many symmetry constraints are covered, notably one-dimensional systems in Class DIII as well as two- and three-dimensional systems in Class AII. The constructions are based on several periodic variations of the spectral localizer and are rooted in the existence of underlying fuzzy tori. For these latter, a general invariant theory is developed.</description>

      <title>Feature learning in finite-width Bayesian deep linear networks with multiple outputs and convolutional layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03260v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep linear networks have been extensively studied, as they provide simplified models of deep learning. However, little is known in the case of finite-width architectures with multiple outputs and convolutional layers. In this manuscript, we provide rigorous results for the statistics of functions implemented by the aforementioned class of networks, thus moving closer to a complete characterization of feature learning in the Bayesian setting. Our results include: (i) an exact and elementary non-asymptotic integral representation for the joint prior distribution over the outputs, given in terms of a mixture of Gaussians; (ii) an analytical formula for the posterior distribution in the case of squared error loss function (Gaussian likelihood); (iii) a quantitative description of the feature learning infinite-width regime, using large deviation theory. From a physical perspective, deep architectures with multiple outputs or convolutional layers represent different manifestations of kernel shape renormalization, and our work provides a dictionary that translates this physics intuition and terminology into rigorous Bayesian statistics.</description>

      <title>Deep Linear Network Training Dynamics from Random Initialization: Data, Width, Depth, and Hyperparameter Transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02531v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically characterize gradient descent dynamics in deep linear networks trained at large width from random initialization and on large quantities of random data. Our theory captures the ``wider is better" effect of mean-field/maximum-update parameterized networks as well as hyperparameter transfer effects, which can be contrasted with the neural-tangent parameterization where optimal learning rates shift with model width. We provide asymptotic descriptions of both non-residual and residual neural networks, the latter of which enables an infinite depth limit when branches are scaled as $1/\sqrt{\text{depth}}$. We also compare training with one-pass stochastic gradient descent to the dynamics when training data are repeated at each iteration. Lastly, we show that this model recovers the accelerated power law training dynamics for power law structured data in the rich regime observed in recent works.</description>

      <title>Leveraging recurrence in neural network wavefunctions for large-scale simulations of Heisenberg antiferromagnets: the square lattice</title>

Abstract: Machine-learning-based variational Monte Carlo simulations are a promising approach for targeting quantum many-body ground states, especially in two dimensions and in cases where the ground state is known to have a non-trivial sign structure. While many state-of-the-art variational energies have been reached with these methods for finite-size systems, little work has been done to use these results to extract information about the target state in the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we employ recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as a variational ans\"{a}tze, and leverage their recurrent nature to simulate the ground states of progressively larger systems through iterative retraining. This transfer learning technique allows us to simulate spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems on lattices with more than 1,000 spins without beginning optimization from scratch for each system size, thus reducing the demands for computational resources. In this study, we focus on the square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, where it is possible to carefully benchmark our results. We show that we are able to systematically improve the accuracy of the results from our simulations by increasing the training time, and obtain results for finite-sized lattices that are in good agreement with the literature values. Furthermore, we use these results to extract accurate estimates of the ground-state properties in the thermodynamic limit. This work demonstrates that RNN wavefunctions can be used to accurately study quantum many-body physics in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Leveraging recurrence in neural network wavefunctions for large-scale simulations of Heisenberg antiferromagnets: the triangular lattice</title>

Abstract: Variational Monte Carlo simulations have been crucial for understanding quantum many-body systems, especially when the Hamiltonian is frustrated and the ground-state wavefunction has a non-trivial sign structure. In this paper, we use recurrent neural network (RNN) wavefunction ans\"{a}tze to study the triangular-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (TLAHM) for lattice sizes up to $30\times30$. In a recent study [M. S. Moss et al. arXiv:2502.17144], the authors demonstrated how RNN wavefunctions can be iteratively retrained in order to obtain variational results for multiple lattice sizes with a reasonable amount of compute. That study, which looked at the sign-free, square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, showed favorable scaling properties, allowing accurate finite-size extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, our present results illustrate in detail the relative difficulty in simulating the sign-problematic TLAHM. We find that the accuracy of our simulations can be significantly improved by transforming the Hamiltonian with a judicious choice of basis rotation. We also show that a similar benefit can be achieved by using variational neural annealing, an alternative optimization technique that minimizes a pseudo free energy. Ultimately, we are able to obtain estimates of the ground-state properties of the TLAHM in the thermodynamic limit that are in close agreement with values in the literature, showing that RNN wavefunctions provide a powerful toolbox for performing finite-size scaling studies for frustrated quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Crossover between Solid-like and Liquid-like Behavior in Supercooled Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In supercooled liquids, at a temperature between the glass transition temperature Tg and the melting point Tm, thermodynamic properties remain continuous, while dynamic behavior exhibits anomalies. The origin of such thermodynamics-dynamic decoupling has long been a puzzle in the field of glass researches. In this study, we show that the ratio of the alpha-relaxation time associated with the relative and center-of-mass coordinate of nearest-neighbor atomic pairs can effectively characterize the dynamic features of supercooled liquids. With this approach, supercooled liquids can be categorized into two distinct 'states' based on their dynamics: solid-like and liquid-like behaviors. We further propose four possible paths from the liquid to the final glass state, each exhibiting unique thermodynamic and dynamic behaviors. Two of these paths predict a characteristic temperature Tx between Tm and Tg, where a crossover between solid-like and liquid-like behaviors occurs in supercooled liquids. The molecular dynamics simulations of several supercooled liquids reveal that the actual path followed by all these systems undergo the crossover between solid-like and liquid-like behaviors. Tx is found to reside in a similar temperature range as the critical temperature Tc in the mode-coupling theory and the breakdown temperature Tb of the Stokes-Einstein relation. This crossover provides a new microscopic perspective for explaining macroscopic dynamic anomalies, and the absence of a typical thermodynamic phase transition at Tg.</description>

      <title>Exploring light-induced phases of 2D materials in a modulated 1D quasicrystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Illuminating integer quantum Hall matter with polarized light can drive quantum phase transitions. Technical limitations on laser intensity and material purity make such experiments challenging in the solid state. However, the Harper-Hofstadter mapping which relates a two-dimensional integer quantum Hall system to a 1D quasicrystal enables the same polarization-dependent light-induced phase transitions to be observed using a quantum gas in a driven quasiperiodic optical lattice. We report experimental results from such a 1D quantum simulator of 2D integer quantum Hall matter driven by light of variable polarization. We observe an interlaced phase diagram of localization-delocalization phase transitions as a function of drive polarization and amplitude. Elliptically polarized driving can stabilize an extended critical phase featuring multifractal wavefunctions; we observe signatures of this phenomenon in subdiffusive transport. In this regime, increasing the strength of the quasiperiodic potential can enhance rather than suppress transport. These experiments demonstrate a simple method for synthesizing exotic multifractal states and exploring light-induced quantum phases across different dimensionalities.</description>
