      <title>The Galactic White Dwarf Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ESA Gaia mission has revolutionized our understanding of the white dwarf population, delivering an unprecedented census of these nearby remnants and revealing previously unseen structures in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. However, while Gaia has expanded the scope of white dwarf astrophysics, it has also exposed new questions related to atmospheric composition, spectral evolution, crystallization, magnetism, and merger-driven pathways. Many of these open problems are encoded in the detailed morphology of the Gaia HR diagram, where precise spectroscopic characterization is essential for interpreting the underlying physical processes. Spectroscopic characterization, obtainable with current and future ESO facilities, can provide the effective temperatures and surface gravities that are required to derive accurate white dwarf masses, cooling ages, and luminosities. These fundamental parameters not only enable studies of spectral evolution, interior physics, and the origin of magnetic and high-mass white dwarfs, but also guarantee the construction of robust mass distributions and luminosity functions, essential for constraining the initial-to-final mass relation, probing the initial mass function, and reconstructing the star formation history of the local Galaxy, among other applications. Looking toward the 2040s, future multi-fiber spectrographs operating in survey mode on 10--15 meter class telescopes will be able to collect a complete spectroscopic sample of white dwarf, enabling the detailed characterization of their population. Achieving spectroscopic completeness for the nearby Galactic population and securing high signal-to-noise, moderate-to-high resolution spectra across the HR diagram with ESO instrumentation will be critical steps toward resolving these longstanding questions in white dwarf astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Serendipitous and targeted mm/sub-mm transient searches with wide-FOV telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The millimeter/sub-millimeter (mm/sub-mm) sky remains a rich but under-explored frontier for transient and variable phenomena. A wide-field, high-sensitivity instrument with a large aperture and degree-scale field of view would open this regime, enabling both systematic survey monitoring and rapid-response follow-up. Key science opportunities include Galactic Plane monitoring and surveys to discover and characterize time-variable emission from young stellar objects, magnetically active and flaring stars, compact binaries, and explosive events, as well as prompt responses to multi-messenger alerts with large localization regions (e.g., gravitational-wave triggers). Multi-band capability, rapid slewing, and high sensitivity are essential to probe energetic processes such as jet launching, relativistic shocks and accretion flows in unprecedented detail. While long-term monitoring is well established at radio and optical/infrared wavelengths, mm/sub-mm observations uniquely bridge the spectral gap between these regimes, directly probing obscured environments that are inaccessible elsewhere. Large-scale monitoring programs will yield legacy datasets crucial for population studies through the 2040s and beyond.</description>

      <title>White Dwarfs in Wide Binary Systems as Reliable Age Calibrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deriving precise stellar ages is a challenging task. Consequently, age-dependent relations - such as the age-metallicity and age-velocity dispersion relations of the Milky Way, or the age-rotation-activity relation of low-mass stars - are subject to potentially large uncertainties, despite the well-defined trends observed at the population level. White dwarfs, the most common stellar remnants, follow a relatively simple and well-understood cooling process. When found in wide binary systems with main-sequence companions, they can therefore provide the much-needed precise age estimates. The total age of such systems depends not only on the white dwarf cooling time but also on the lifetime of the main-sequence progenitor. Estimating this lifetime requires knowledge of the progenitor mass, which is typically inferred by adopting an initial-to-final mass relation. However, the observational constraints on this relation are still poorly defined, introducing a source of uncertainty in white dwarf age determinations. To mitigate this issue, we focus on a large sample of massive white dwarfs (&gt;~0.7 Msun), for which the main-sequence progenitor lifetime is negligible. These white dwarfs are intrinsically faint and therefore require specialized facilities for adequate follow-up observations. In this white paper, we outline the instrumentation requirements needed to observe the forthcoming population of massive white dwarfs in our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>The Emergence of Prebiotic Chemistry in the ISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrary to popular belief, the interstellar medium (ISM) is not empty; it is filled with atoms, dust particles, and molecules. Some of these molecules may have been the very building blocks of life that, delivered to Earth via comets and meteorites, could have given rise to Life itself. A large-area single-dish telescope with superb sensitivity, field-of-view and multi-band instruments will allow us to explore the limits of chemical complexity in the interstellar medium, across our Galaxy and in external galaxies, determining whether amino acids, sugars, or RNA/DNA nucleobases can form in space.</description>

      <title>The Future of Evolved Planetary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the formation, evolution, and chemical diversity of exoplanets are now central areas of astrophysics research. White dwarfs provide a uniquely sensitive laboratory for studying the end stages of planetary-system evolution and for probing the bulk composition of both rocky and volatile-rich exoplanetary material. In the 2030s new facilities will transform our ability to carry out \textit{``industrial-scale''} astrophysics, leading to fundamental results and new challenges for the next decade. By combining the volume of data surveyed by the ESA {\em Gaia} mission and Vera C. Rubin Observatory with the next-generation of spectroscopic facilities, the European Southern Observatory (ESO) community will be in a position to obtain an unbiased census of evolved planetary systems, constrain the composition of thousands of disrupted planetesimals, and connect these signatures to Galactic populations and stellar birth environments. Thus, it is now the time for assessing those challenges and preparing for the future. This white paper outlines key science opportunities arising in the next decade and the technological requirements of future ESO facilities in enabling transformative discoveries in the 2040s. These future facilities will have to combine a number of features that are crucial for studying evolved planetary systems at white dwarfs, such as broad optical to near-infrared coverage, a high sensitivity at blue wavelengths, multi-resolution capability, massive multi-plexing, and time-domain reactivity.</description>

      <title>Sub-millimeter wavelength protostellar accretion rate monitoring with AtLAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How a star forms is a fundamental question in astrophysics. In the earliest stages of protostellar evolution high extinction prevents a direct study of the accretion processes and their temporal evolution. Monitoring the variations of the accretion luminosity in a large protostar sample over decades is needed to reveal how protostars accrete -- in major bursts or in a quasi-steady fashion. We here argue that a large ground based sub-millimeter single-dish facility with a wide FoV is required to fulfill this task.</description>

      <title>Why the Northern Hemisphere Needs a 30-40m Telescope and the Science at Stake: Shaping Galaxies and Their Stars with Stellar Population Gradients, IMF Variations and Environmental Drivers in Cluster Early-Type Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This white paper highlights how stellar population gradients, chemical abundance patterns, stellar initial mass function (IMF) variations, and structural signatures in early-type galaxies (ETGs), measured at faint and large galactocentric radii, out to $\sim4R_e$, provide powerful diagnostics of their formation and evolutionary histories. These observables encode the combined effects of early dissipative star formation, subsequent accretion and mergers, and internal feedback processes. Achieving such measurements requires high-signal-to-noise, spatially resolved U-band--optical--near-IR spectroscopy at large radii, with enough spatial resolution to study the variation of these properties on $\sim$kpc scales. These capabilities can only be delivered by a 30\,m-class telescope. Disentangling these internal processes from environmental influences further demands observations of galaxies across clusters spanning a wide range of evolutionary stages and local environments. The nearby Virgo, Perseus, and Coma clusters, without any comparable nearby counterparts in the Southern Hemisphere, offer ideal laboratories for this work. Such observations will place stringent constraints on the formation mechanism of ETGs, connecting local cluster ETGs to their high-redshift progenitors. This white paper outlines several key science cases enabled by such a facility: (1) mapping stellar population gradients across environments; (2) tracing IMF variations as a function of evolutionary stage and environment; (3) reconstructing the three-dimensional structure of galaxies through deep integral-field spectroscopy and imaging; and (4) identifying and studying compact and relic systems as progenitors of present-day ETGs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full sky coverage with 30-40 meter-class telescopes is essential to answer fundamental questions in Astrophysics, Cosmology, and Physics, such as the composition of the Universe and the formation of the first stars and supermassive black holes. An ELT/TMT-like telescope in the Northern Hemisphere is a fundamental and necessary facility to provide multiplexing of observing power, diversity of instrumentation, rapid response, and statistical power required to address the questions and the problems, current and future, unveiled by full sky observatories such as JWST, Euclid, or Roman space telescopes. The Northern ELT/TMT will expedite the study of unique, extreme, rare, transient, and/or high-energy events which will give the most information about fundamental Physics problems in the era of multi-messenger and time-domain Astronomy.</description>

      <title>Why the Northern Hemisphere Needs a 30-40 m Telescope and the Science at Stake. How do Planetary Systems Form?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection and characterization of protoplanets in protoplanetary disks around young stars is emerging as a transformative field that will redefine our understanding of how planetary systems form. While current facilities have revealed the diversity of mature exoplanets and the complex structures of disks, we still lack the crucial observational link between them: a statistically meaningful census of planets caught in the act of formation. This white paper argues that such a breakthrough requires access to the nearest and most informative star-forming regions, roughly half of which are poorly accessible or entirely unreachable from Cerro Armazones. Although the ELT alone will strongly impact our knowledge of planet formation, its location prevents Europe from fully exploiting the necessary parameter space. A 30-40 m telescope in the northern hemisphere is therefore essential for obtaining diffraction-limited imaging of protoplanets and disks across the entire sky, enabling robust demographics, exploiting synergies with ngVLA, Gaia, and other facilities covering the north, and ensuring that Europe remains at the forefront of the planet-formation revolution in the coming decades.</description>

      <title>Why the Northern Hemisphere Needs a 30-40m Telescope and the Science at Stake: Ultra-Low-Mass Dwarf Galaxies Across the Boreal Cosmic Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxies dominate the galaxy population in the nearby Universe and occupy the regime where feedback, reionization, and environment exert their strongest influence on galaxy formation. Despite their importance, detailed spectroscopic constraints on the faintest dwarfs are currently limited to a handful of systems in the Local Volume, leaving the role of large-scale environment essentially unexplored at ultra-low stellar masses. A northern 30-40m class telescope equipped with a multiplexed optical integral-field spectrograph will enable a systematic, spatially resolved spectroscopic census of dwarf galaxies with $M_\star \sim 10^{5}-10^{7} M_\odot$ across a wide range of environments. A deep survey of the Coma Cluster, combined with targeted observations of dwarfs in clusters, groups, filaments, and low-density regions, will map star formation histories, chemical enrichment, and internal kinematics at unprecedented depth. This program will directly test models of dark-matter physics, early-Universe feedback, and environmental quenching in the lowest-mass galaxies, establishing dwarf galaxies as precision probes of both galaxy formation and fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Why the Northern Hemisphere Needs a 30-40 m Telescope and the Science at Stake: A Low Surface Brightness Science Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Extragalactic Low Surface Brightness (LSB, $\mu_V\gtrsim 27$ mag/arcsec$^2$) Universe represents a crucial, yet largely unseen, frontier in modern astrophysics. This faint realm holds the keys to completing our understanding of galaxy evolution, hierarchical assembly, and even the fundamental nature of dark matter. Our current theoretical models are inherently incomplete, largely mirroring the properties of the brightest, most easily observed objects. To overcome this critical bias and unlock the secrets of this realm, a transformative leap in observational capability is required. A 30 to 40m class telescope, leveraging unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution, especially with adaptive optics, is the essential tool to fundamentally probe these faint, low-density stellar regimes. This white paper details the transformative LSB science that such a facility, strategically positioned in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) to access crucial nearby structures and rich environments, can achieve.</description>

      <title>Why the Northern Hemisphere Needs a 30-40m Telescope and the Science at Stake: from Interstellar Visitors to Planetary Defence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small Solar system Objects (SSOs) preserve the physical, chemical, and dynamical signatures of the Sun's protoplanetary disk. Upcoming surveys will discover vast numbers of new objects, yet their scientific value will depend on follow-up observations requiring far greater sensitivity and resolution than those currently available. A 30-m class telescope like the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) will be transformative, but its Southern location will leave significant regions of the sky poorly covered or even non accessible. A Northern 30-40m telescope is therefore essential to achieve full-sky coverage and fully exploit the small body discoveries of the 2030-2050 era, in particular for targets of opportunity or unexpected discoveries, like those of interstellar objects and potentially hazardous asteroids, as well as for distant trans-Neptunian objects and space mission targets.</description>

      <title>Why the Northern Hemisphere Needs a 30-40 m Telescope and the Science at Stake: Mapping formation pathways of nuclear star clusters across galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are dense, compact stellar systems only a few parsecs across, located at galaxy centers. Their small sizes make them difficult to resolve spatially. NSCs often coexist with massive black holes, and both trace the dynamical state and evolution of their host galaxies. Dense stellar environments such as NSCs are also ideal sites for forming intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). To date, spatially resolved NSC properties, crucial for reconstructing dynamical and star-formation histories, have only been obtained for galaxies within 5 Mpc, using the highest-resolution instruments on the current class of very large telescopes. This severely limits spectroscopic studies, and a systematic, unbiased survey has never been accomplished. Because the vast majority of known NSCs are located in the Northern Hemisphere, only a 30-m-class telescope in the North can provide the statistical power needed to study their physical properties and measure the mass of coexisting central black holes. We propose leveraging the capabilities of a 30-m-class Northern telescope to obtain the first comprehensive, spatially resolved survey of NSCs, finally allowing us to unveil their formation pathways and their yet unknown connection with central massive black holes.</description>

      <title>Science Enabled by a 30-Meter-Class Telescope in the Northern Hemisphere: Massive Stars at Low Metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars are at the core of our observations of the Universe up to the reionization epoch, both through their intense ionizing fluxes and through the energetic end products that release fresh elements into the interstellar medium. Our interpretation of very high redshift galaxies and transient phenomena depends on knowledge derived from massive star populations in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, with characteristics that only remotely resemble the conditions in the early Universe. However, the models supporting these interpretations have been tested in a narrow range of environments and carry significant uncertainties when extrapolated. Advancing in our understanding of the Universe beyond the Local Volume therefore requires extending massive star studies to conditions representative of the early Universe. The next generation of telescopes has the potential to accomplish this goal.</description>

      <title>Why the Northern Hemisphere Needs a 30-40 m Telescope and the Science at Stake: Resolved Stellar Populations Studies in M31 and its Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 30 m class optical/near-IR telescope in the Northern Hemisphere, equipped for diffraction-limited imaging and high-resolution, multi-object spectroscopy of faint stars, would enable a transformational investigation of the formation and evolution of M31 and its satellite system - on par with what Gaia, the HST, and other major photometric and spectroscopic facilities have achieved for the Milky Way (MW) and its satellites. The unprecedented detail obtained for our home system has reshaped our understanding of the assembly of the MW disk, halo, and bulge, and that of its satellites, which now serve as a benchmark for galaxy formation and evolution models. Extending this level of insight to the M31 system - that of the nearest massive spiral and the only one for which such a comprehensive, resolved stellar population study is feasible - will allow us to address a fundamental question: how representative is the MW and its satellite system within the broader context of galaxy evolution?</description>

      <title>Why the Northern Hemisphere Needs a 30-40 m Telescope and the Science at Stake: Galactic Archaeology from the Northern Sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By the 2040s--50s, facilities such as \emph{Gaia}, WEAVE, 4MOST, Rubin, \emph{Euclid}, \emph{Roman}, and the ESO ELT will have transformed our global view of the Milky Way. Yet key questions will remain incompletely resolved: a detailed reconstruction of the Galaxy's assembly from its earliest building blocks, and robust tests of dark matter granularity using the fine structure of the stellar halo and outer disk -- particularly in the Galactic anticenter. Addressing these questions requires high-resolution spectroscopy of faint main-sequence stars (typically 1--2 mag below the turnoff) and turnoff stars ($r \sim 21$--23) in low-surface-brightness structures: halo streams and shells, ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, the warped and flared outer disk, and anticenter substructures. We argue that addressing this science case requires a 30\,m-class telescope in the northern hemisphere, equipped with wide-field, highly multiplexed, high-resolution spectroscopic capabilities. Such a facility would enable (i) a Northern Halo Deep Survey of $\sim 10^{5}$--$10^{6}$ faint main-sequence and turnoff stars out to $\sim 150$--200\,kpc, (ii) chemodynamical mapping of dozens of streams to measure perturbations from dark matter subhalos, and (iii) tomographic studies of the anticenter and outer disk to disentangle perturbed disk material from accreted debris. A northern 30\,m telescope would provide the essential complement to ESO's southern ELT, enabling genuinely all-sky Milky Way archaeology and delivering stringent constraints on the small-scale structure of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Why the Northern Hemisphere Needs a 30-40 m Telescope and the Science at Stake: Northern Local Star-forming Dwarf Galaxies. Analogues of the First Galaxies and Probes of the Cosmic Metallicity Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star-forming dwarf galaxies in the local Universe, especially extremely metal-poor ones, can be considered analogous to early galaxies of the Epoch of Reionization (z &gt;= 6). Currently available telescopes cannot adequately detect and measure heavy element recombination lines and certain faint collisionally excited lines, which are essential for exploring the effects and biases that potential inhomogeneities in electron temperature and density of the ionized gas may have on determining the chemical composition of these galaxies. On the other hand, the origin of very high-ionization lines (e.g. He II, [Ne V], C IV]) measured in the spectra of an important fraction of these objects remains unknown and a challenge to current stellar models, suggesting the presence of Population III-like stars and/or the existence of non-conventional ionizing sources. Obtaining very deep spectra for a selected sample of local star-forming dwarf galaxies would provide unprecedented constraints on their nature, ionization and true chemical abundances, and could change the metallicity scale we assume to understand the chemical evolution of galaxies over cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Why the Northern Hemisphere Needs a 30-40 m Telescope and the Science at Stake: Key Targets of Opportunity on Gas and Ice Giants and their satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) will transform our knowledge of the outer planets and their satellite systems; however the visibility of unique targets of opportunity with high scientific value will be reduced for northern objects. Uranus' declination favors observations from the Northern Hemisphere until 2055, and Neptune will be favored from the Northern Hemisphere from 2027 for the next 90 years. Jupiter and Saturn experience cycles of better observability from either hemisphere on cycles of 10 and 30 years. These planets and their satellite systems often offer unique opportunities for discovery through time-critical observations. We argue that a 30-m class size telescope in the Northern Hemisphere with complementary scientific instrumentation to that on the ELT will secure the possibility of observing high-impact unpredictable phenomena in these systems.</description>

      <title>Why the northern hemisphere needs a 30-40 m telescope and the science at stake: Massive stars in spiral galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document discusses the three main lines expected to dominate massive-star research in the 2040s, namely: (1) The role of metallicity in stellar evolution, especially in determining the end products such as gravitational-wave progenitors. (2) The initial mass function from the most massive stars to substellar objects. (3) The role of the environment in the different modes of star formation from compact star clusters to born-this-way associations and from massive clusters to small stellar groups. More specifically, we present the contributions to such science that would be enabled by a 30~m type telescope in the northern hemisphere studying spiral galaxies. Those can be grouped in three: our own Galaxy, the Milky Way; the other two spiral galaxies in the Local Group, M31 and M33; and other galaxies within 25 Mpc, such as M101, M51, and NGC~6946. This work is based on the fact that, as of today, no construction of a 30~m telescope has yet started in the northern hemisphere, so even in the best case scenario of such a hypothetical telescope, its full operation would not start until the late 2030s or early 2040s. It makes no assumptions about its location but supposes an instrumentation development similar to that of ELT.</description>

      <title>White Dwarf Binaries: Probes of Future Astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarf binaries are fundamental astrophysical probes. They represent ideal laboratories to test the models of binary evolution, which also apply to the sources of gravitational waves, whose detection led to the award of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. Moreover, their final fate is intimately linked to Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), i.e. the thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf following the interaction with a companion star, which have become the fundamental yardsticks on cosmological distance scales and led to the discovery of dark energy and the award of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. Finally, white dwarf binaries play a crucial role in influencing star formation and chemical evolution of the Galaxy by injecting energy into, and enriching, the interstellar medium with material ejected during nova eruptions and SN Ia explosions. In the next decade, the advent of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) at the Vera Rubin Observatory will lead to the discovery of hundreds of thousands of white dwarf binaries. Nonetheless, the intrinsic faintness of the majority of these systems will prevent their spectroscopic characterisation with the instruments available in the 2030s. Hence ESO's Expanding Horizons call is timely for planning a future transformative facility, capable of delivering phase-resolved spectroscopic observations of faint white dwarf binaries, which are key to advancing our understanding of stellar and Galactic evolution and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Dynamical binary interactions in the 2040s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical binary interactions such as common envelope (CE) evolution or stellar mergers are a critical phase in the formation of a wide variety of binary phenomena, ranging from blue stragglers to type I supernovae (of all flavours, a, b and c), $\gamma$-ray bursts to bipolar planetary nebulae, Thorne-Zytkow objects to X-ray binaries. In 2040s, the urgency of resolving long-standing questions regarding the physics behind the dynamical interaction stages and the absolute and relative frequencies of binary evolutionary pathways will only increase owing to rapidly expanding population statistics of gravitational wave events. Here, we argue that multi-wavelength observations (spectroscopy and photometry), linear spectropolarimetry, and interferometry of a large number of Luminous Red Novae, a particular class of transients associated with dynamical binary interactions, will provide unprecedented details about the underlying interaction physics. A breakthrough will be achieved by a tenfold or larger increase in identifications of transient-type events from interacting binaries and their follow-up with instrumentation that provides at least 10 times better angular resolution, 100 times better spectral resolution, and $\sim$100 times higher sensitivity than 2030s facilities.</description>

      <title>Finding New Debris Discs at Sub-millimetre Wavelengths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Debris discs reveal the architectures and dynamical histories of planetary systems. Sub-millimetre observations trace large dust grains within debris discs, revealing their bulk properties. Debris discs have so far only been detected around ~20% of stars, representing the bright end of the population. A new facility is required to reach fainter discs, overcoming the confusion limit, with multiwavelength capabilities for characterisation, sensitivity to large-scale emission for nearby targets and a large field of view for surveying distant populations. All of this is made possible with the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimetre Telescope (AtLAST).</description>

      <title>Characterisation of the Bedretto Underground Site for Fundamental Physics Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underground laboratories provide the ultra-low background and low-vibration environments essential for rare-event searches, gravitational-wave detection, and quantum-sensing technologies. We report a comprehensive environmental characterisation of the Bedretto tunnel in Ticino, Switzerland, a site offering horizontal access, excellent infrastructure, and the potential to be be Europe's second-deepest and quietest underground laboratory. At the prospective physics site, located beneath an overburden exceeding 1400 m, we measure the cosmic-muon, gamma-ray, and neutron fluxes, as well as the radon concentration, magnetic-field spectrum, and seismic backgrounds. The muon flux is suppressed by six orders of magnitude relative to the surface, consistent with an effective depth of about 4000 metre water equivalent, gamma-ray and neutron measurements reflect the local geology and guide shielding requirements for future particle and nuclear physics experiments. Magnetic and seismic noise levels are found to be exceptionally low, meeting or exceeding the criteria for next-generation atom-interferometric gravitational-wave detectors. These results establish the site as a highly competitive, accessible deep-underground location for fundamental-physics experiments.</description>

      <title>Exploiting tidal asteroseismology in binary populations from combined space photometry and time-resolved high-resolution spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-based photometry has substantially increased the number of pulsating stars found in binary systems by more than four orders of magnitude. Combined with high-resolution spectroscopy, high-precision photometry offers model-independent constraints on stellar parameters and internal processes. The advent of space-based photometric surveys has given us access to populations of tidally perturbed pulsators, which offer a unique and demanding set of constraints on tidal physics and stellar interiors. However, we lack the ability to undertake multi-epoch, high-resolution spectroscopy at large scale. The ability to obtain phase-resolved, high-resolution spectra would allow us to place precise, model-independent constraints on the stellar properties of pulsators in binary systems that will truly test our close binary asteroseismic modelling techniques, leading to much-needed constraints on fundamental stellar and binary physics. The need to properly cover the large parameter-space of binary stars demands a large-scale, population-level analysis in order to understand the complex landscape of binary stellar evolution. To enable this population-level analysis, we need a dedicated multi-fibre spectrograph (30--200 fibres) with high spectral resolution ($R\geq 50000$), high signal-to-noise ratio ($\mathrm{S/N\geq 300}$), and a limiting magnitude of approximately 15. Such a spectrograph would be capable of efficiently resolving the pulsation variability on the order of minutes and orbit motion on the order of days to years for many targets.</description>

      <title>Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients in the 2040s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients (LFBOTs) are a class of extragalactic transient of uncertain origin. Several hypotheses have been put forward which could feasibly be consistent with the sample number of events discovered thus far, including tidal disruption events around intermediate mass black holes, failed supernovae and mergers of stars with black holes. Whatever their origin, it is clear that better understanding LFBOTs will provide unique insight into the black hole formation/growth, central engine physics and transient-host galaxy interactions - themes which are expected to drive research in transient astronomy over the coming decades. The vast majority of LFBOTs are missed by current photometric surveys, or not efficiently selected for detailed follow-up. This white paper outlines the observing capabilities required on a 2040 timescale to maximise the discovery potential from these enigmatic events.</description>

      <title>Skykatana: a scalable framework to construct sky masks for the Vera Rubin Observatory and large astronomical surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern wide-field surveys require robust spatial masks to excise bright-star halos, bleed trails, poor-quality regions, and user-defined geometry at scale. We present Skykatana, an open source pipeline that builds and combines boolean HEALPix/HEALSparse maps into science-ready masks and engineered for low-memory operation. Skykatana can efficiently construct, visualize multi-order coverage maps and generate random points in high-resolution masks over half of the celestial sphere with very limited resources and leveraging the hierarchical partition of data the HATS/LSDB framework. We demonstrate two end-to-end applications: (1) a Subaru HSC-WISE composite mask; and (2) Rubin star masks generated on demand in the Rubin Science Platform by querying HATS/LSDB Gaia data and assigning radii from empirical fits to Rubin DP1 data. We release full bright-star masks for various regions of the Rubin footprint and describe performance and scaling. The code, documentation, and examples are publicly available at https://github.com/samotracio/skykatana, and the LSST masks can be obtained from https://osf.io/r5vw6</description>

      <title>Development of a Custom kV-amplitude, pressure-tolerant Radio-Frequency transmitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current experiments seeking first-ever observation of Ultra-High Energy Neutrinos (UHEN) typically utilize radio frequency (RF) receiver antennas deployed in cold, radio-transparent polar ice, to measure the coherent RF signals resulting from neutrino interactions with ice molecules. Accurate calibration of the receiver response, sampling the full range of possible neutrino geometries, is necessary to estimate the energy and incoming direction of the incident neutrino. Herein, we detail the design and performance of a custom radio-frequency calibration transmitter, consisting of a battery-powered, kiloVolt-scale signal generator (`IDL' pulser) driving an antenna (South Pole UNiversity of Kansas antenna, or `SPUNK') capable of operating at pressures of 200 atmospheres. Performance was validated by lowering the transmitter into a borehole at the South Pole to a depth of 1740 m, yielding high Signal-to-Noise ratio signals at a distance of 5 km from the source.</description>

      <title>AMKID -- a large KID-based camera at the APEX telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal emission at sub-millimeter wavelengths carries unique information in many astronomical applications ranging from disks and planet formation around young stars, to galaxy evolution studies at cosmological distances. Advancing on the mapping speed to detect this faint emission in ground-based astronomy has been a technical challenge for decades. The APEX Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector (AMKID) camera was designed to accomplish this task. The instrument is a wide field-of-view camera based on kinetic inductance detectors. It is installed on the 12~meter APEX telescope in Chile at 5.100~meters above see level. The instrument operates dual color, covering simultaneously the 350~GHz and 850~GHz atmospheric windows. It has a large field-of-view of 15.3'x15.3', and an unprecedented number of pixels: 13.952~detectors in the high frequency band and 3.520~detectors in the low frequency band. Here we present a complete description of the instrument design and construction together with results of the successful low frequency array (LFA) commissioning campaign executed during the last year. The LFA performance is in good agreement with design parameters, with detector sensitivity of 2.2~mK$\sqrt{s}$ and diffraction limited beam sizes of 17.0''. On-sky measurements demonstrate a sensitivity of 70-90~mJy$\sqrt{s}$ per detector when operating under good atmospheric conditions (PWV below 1.0mm). With this performance the LFA regularly achieve a mapping sensitivity of 25~mJy when mapping a square degree in an hour.
  AMKID on APEX with its dual color observing capabilities, high sensitivity, large field-of-view and high angular resolution holds the promise to open a new range of science with the APEX telescope.</description>

      <title>The use of astronomical data for satellite tracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study explored the usage of astronomical observations for the identification and tracking of artificial satellites. Spacecraft streaks on astronomical images are a growing issue for the astronomical community. The increasing number of satellites in the future will only worsen the situation for ground-based optical and radio observations of cosmic objects. In addition, the spacecraft passages often lead to the discarding of the obtained data. In this analysis, we propose an estimation of the usefulness of dedicated astronomical observation for spacecraft monitoring, identification, and deduction of orbital parameters. We use astronomical data from the Astronomical Observatory Meshtitsa (Bulgaria) and the https://www.tycho-tracker.com/ software for the streak analysis. The results are compared with well-known satellite databases, such as https://celestrak.org/. The findings are discussed in the framework of space weather research.</description>

      <title>Expanding stellar horizons with polarized light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polarization of light is a critically under-utilized, rich source of information in astronomy. For stars in particular, surface magnetism polarization that can be detected and measured with spectro-polarimetry. Many questions about these surface fields remain unanswered due to a lack of dedicated instruments capable of probing weak and strong surface magnetic fields for the entire mass range of stars, from M-dwarfs (and even substellar objects) to massive O-type stars at different evolutionary stages and metallicities. These questions range from the origin of these fields to their true incidence rate throughout the stellar population and the dependence on metallicity. Magnetic fields, although currently often excluded from stellar evolution models, play an important role in stellar evolution. Connecting the surface fields to internal fields through asteroseismology will instigate a new era of understanding stellar evolution and the transport of angular momentum and chemical elements throughout stellar interiors, also impacting our understanding of star-planet interactions and stellar remnants. Polarimetry is also an under-utilized tool to observationally constrain the mode identification of nonradial oscillations, which lies at the basis of accurate asteroseismic parameter estimation at percentage-level for stellar radii, masses, ages, internal rotation, and magnetic field strengths. Combining strong constraints on mode identification and surface magnetic properties through the acquisition of time-resolved, high-resolution and high-signal-to-noise (S/N) spectro-polarimetry and spectroscopy promises to bring leaps forward in our understanding of stellar structure, particularly when combined with long-term space photometric data from past, current, and future missions.</description>

      <title>A Characterization of JWST MIRI Detector Persistence and Implications for High-Contrast Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The JWST MIRI detector exhibits a flux deficit persistence, but its timescales and impacts remain largely uncharacterized, particularly at the longest imaging wavelengths. In this study, we analyze full-field MIRI imager observations at 21 $\mu$m (F2100W) to quantify detector persistence following a saturation event by a bright (K = 5.65 mag) nearby (8.12 $\pm$ 0.04 pc) mid M-dwarf star, IRAS 21500+5903. Unlike typical persistence that appears as excess flux, this effect presents as a flux deficit in pixels previously illuminated by the saturating or near saturating source. We measure persistence at two post-saturation epochs: shortly after saturation (11.6 minutes) and an hour later (1.39 hours). Immediately after the saturation event, we detect a persistence level of $1.69 \pm 0.10$%. By fitting a Bayesian exponential decay model to the two epochs, we estimate that persistence decreases to one-tenth of its initial value after $5.16^{+1.49}_{-0.94}$ hours. We examine the implications of persistence for MIRI high-contrast imaging using the imager (not coronagraphy). Specifically, we discuss how MIRI detector persistence can produce false-positive exoplanet signals in direct imaging surveys, as well as degrade PSF subtraction, particularly at small inner working angles. We also outline mitigation strategies to avoid these impacts in future observations.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Alerts for the Time-Domain Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-domain astronomy is entering an era of unprecedented discovery driven by wide-field, high-cadence surveys such as LSST, Roman, Euclid, SKA, and PLATO. While some of these facilities will generate enormous photometric alert streams, the physical interpretation of variability and transients often requires spectroscopy, which encodes changes in ionisation state, kinematics, and accretion that are inaccessible to photometry alone. A critical gap is therefore emerging: next-generation surveys may produce up to $\sim10^9$ alerts per year, whereas global spectroscopic follow-up is limited to only $\sim10^4$--$10^5$ transient spectra annually. We present the concept of spectroscopic alerts: real-time notifications triggered by significant spectral evolution, enabling spectroscopy to act as a discovery channel rather than solely as follow-up. We outline the key science cases enabled by this capability and describe the instrumental and operational requirements of a wide-field, highly multiplexed spectroscopic facility capable of delivering real-time spectral discovery for 2040s time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Dimensionality Reduction Methods for High-Dimensional ALMA Image Cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional astronomical data cubes provide a wealth of spectral and structural information that can be used to study astrophysical and chemical processes. The complexity and sheer size of these datasets pose significant challenges in their efficient analysis, visualization, and interpretation. In specific astronomical use cases, a number of dimensionality reduction techniques, including traditional linear (e.g. principal component analysis) and modern nonlinear methods (e.g. convolutional autoencoders) have been used to tackle this high-dimensional problem. In this study, we assess the strengths, weaknesses, and nuances of various methods in their ability to capture and preserve astronomically-relevant features at lower dimensions. We provide recommendations to guide users in identifying and incorporating these treatments to their data, and provide insights into the computational scalability of these methods for observatory level data processing. This benchmark study uses publicly available archival ALMA data from a diverse sampling of source morphologies and observing setups to assess the performance and trade-offs between computational cost, image reconstruction accuracy, and scalability. Finally, we discuss the generalizability of these techniques in regard to data segmentation and labeling algorithms and how they can be exploited for advanced data product generation and streamlined archival analysis as we prepare to enter the era of the ALMA Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade.</description>

      <title>Towards ALMA2040: An update from the European community and invitation to contribute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last 15 years, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has revolutionized astrophysics by providing unprecedented resolution and sensitivity in observing the cold universe, including the formation of stars, planets, and galaxies. With groundbreaking discoveries ranging from the first detailed images of protoplanetary disks to the kinematics of galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization, ALMA has showcased the vast discovery potential of the (sub-)mm wavelength regime. However, in another 15 years from now--in the 2040s--the science landscape will have changed dramatically as new major observational facilities will have started their operations or have come towards advanced maturity in their scientific outcome (e.g., JWST, Rubin Observatory, ELT, Euclid, Gaia, Plato, Ariel, Roman Space Telescope, SPHEREx, LiteBIRD, LISA, SKA and others). At the same time, ALMA's current Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade will have been in place for ~10 years, and ALMA itself will have been operational for 30 years. To fully exploit this era, the community needs a next-generation facility operating at (sub-)mm wavelengths with capabilities far beyond those possible within ALMA's current infrastructure.
  To this end, ALMA2040 is a community-driven initiative to define the key scientific questions of the 2040s and translate them into a technical vision for a next-generation transformational (sub-)millimeter facility. Our goal with this document is to summarize the current status of the effort, synthesize outcomes from the 2025 workshops, outline next steps toward a reference design concept, and invite broad participation from the global mm/sub-mm community to help shape this future facility.
  In the following we provide details on the process and scope. We invite everyone who wishes to join the effort and/or contribute to the dedicated White Papers planned for 2026.</description>

      <title>Searching potential astronomical sites in Ethiopia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to choose potential astronomical sites that can be candidates for a new astronomical optical observatory in Ethiopia, in addition to the Entoto Observatory and Lalibela sites. For our primary investigation, the six basic criteria, namely the altitude of the mountains, artificial light pollution, cloud coverage, humidity, wind speed, and wind direction, are taken into account. Consequently, using the multi-criteria statistical analysis (MCSA) techniques, 21 high-potential places are selected and presented for further investigation out of 367 mountains. Those selected mountains are mapped and presented to study the future of the astronomical seeing effect. This study may contribute to the protection of those potential astronomical sites and their dark skies and the development of astrotourism for the sustainable development of modern astronomy in Ethiopia and in the East African region.</description>

      <title>FrankenStat I: a New Approach to Pulsar Timing Array Data Combination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2023, after more than two decades of searching, pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations around the world announced evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background. It was quickly followed by work from the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA), demonstrating that the results of regional collaborations were consistent with each other. The combination of these datasets is still ongoing and represents a significant investment of time and expertise.
  In that IPTA comparison, authors of this letter combined the separate datasets in the standard PTA optimal detection statistic for cross-correlations incoherently, that is, the data was combined without fitting a merged timing model across all PTA datasets, treating datasets of the same pulsar as independent, and neglecting the "same pulsar, different datasets" cross-correlations. This work refines that method by extending its core ideas beyond detection statistics and into a full, general data-combination method. We have demonstrated its efficacy and extreme efficiency on simulated data. This new method, \textit{FrankenStat}, is very similar in sensitivity and parameter-constraining power to traditional data combination methods while completing the full data combination in just a few minutes.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of 1D and 3D Exoplanet Atmosphere Model Grids: ScCHIMERA and the SPARC/MITgcm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inferring the properties of transiting exoplanet atmospheres relies on comparing models to spectroscopic observations. Atmosphere models, however, make a range of assumptions, from one-dimensional (1D, varying with altitude) radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) to three-dimensional (3D) general circulation models (GCMs). The goal of this investigation is to determine the causes of differences in dayside thermal emission spectra resulting from 3D-GCMs (using SPARC/MITgcm) and 1D-RCE models (using ScCHIMERA). We conduct a one-to-one comparison of 1D-RCE models and 3D-GCMs with the same outgoing bolometric thermal flux over a grid of equilibrium temperatures, gravities, metallicities, and rotation periods. Each 1D-RCE model assumes heat redistribution in the planet's atmosphere consistent with that in the corresponding 3D-GCM's photosphere. Comparing corresponding models, the dayside average pressure-temperature (PT) structures can be broken into four vertical regions, each influencing wavelength-dependent differences in their spectra. Furthermore, the dayside average 3D-GCM PTs for planets with Teq=1400 K exhibit a temperature inversion, whereas corresponding 1D-RCE models do not. We find that spectral differences between 1D-RCE models and 3D-GCMs with the same parameters decrease for hotter planets because the spectral shapes more closely resemble blackbodies. To a lesser extent, spectral differences increase for planets with longer rotation periods because of smaller day-night temperature contrasts in the photosphere. Finally, we compare spectral differences to realistic observational uncertainties from JWST with the NIRISS SOSS, NIRSpec G395H, and MIRI LRS instrument modes. We find that 1D-RCE models and 3D-GCMs with the same parameters can produce dayside spectral differences larger than JWST's uncertainty, potentially biasing data-model inferences.</description>

      <title>Future Space-based Gamma-ray Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments using millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are beginning to detect nHz gravitational waves (GWs). MSPs are bright GeV gamma-ray emitters, and all-sky monitoring of about 100 MSPs with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has enabled a gamma-ray Pulsar Timing Array. The GPTA provides a complementary view of nHz GWs because its MSP sample is different, and because the gamma-ray data are immune to plasma propagation effects, have minimal data gaps, and rely on homogeneous instrumentation. To assess GPTA performance for future gamma-ray observatories, we simulated the population of Galactic MSPs and developed a high-fidelity method to predict their gamma-ray spectra. This combination reproduces the properties of the LAT MSP sample, validating it for future population studies. We determined the expected signal from the simulated gamma-ray MSPs for instrument concepts with a wide range of capabilities. We found that the optimal GPTA energy range runs about 0.1 to 5 GeV, but we also examined Compton/MeV instruments. With the caveat that the MSP spectra models are extrapolated beyond observational constraints, we found low signal-to-background ratios, yielding few MSP detections. GeV-band concepts would detect 10$^3$ to 10$^4$ MSPs and achieve GW sensitivity on par with and surpassing the current generation of radio PTAs, reaching the GW self-noise regime. When considering two possible scenarios for the formation of MSPs in the Galactic bulge, the collective signal from which is a potential source of an excess GeV signal observed towards the Galactic center, we find that most of the concepts can both detect this bulge population and distinguish the production channel. In summary, the high discovery potential, strong GW performance, and tremendous synergy with radio PTAs all argue for the pursuit of next-generation gamma-ray pulsar timing.</description>

      <title>Probing the Firn Refractive Index Profile Using Antenna Response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Radio Neutrino Observatory-Greenland (RNO-G, at Summit Station) experiment comprises an extensive fat-dipole antenna array deployed into ice boreholes over an eventual area of approximately 35 ${\rm km}^2$. Since the RNO-G experimental sensitivity depends on the radio-frequency properties of the firn, which are known to vary laterally on sub-km distance scales and vertically on sub-meter distance scales, a technique for quickly extracting information on firn ice properties with depth ($n(z)$) during drilling and deployment is desirable. Given that a dipole's resonant wavelength is fixed by geometry, the resonant frequency $f_{res}$ (measured as an S-parameter reflection coefficient [`$S_{11}$'] minimum) scales inversely with the local refractive index, allowing a translation of a depth-dependent $S_{11}$(z) profile into $n(z)$. $S_{11}$(z) data were initially taken in August, 2024 using a dipole lowered into a newly-drilled $98\pm 1$-mm diameter, 350-m deep borehole at Summit Station, Greenland, approximately 1 km from the site of the original GISP-2 core; improved measurements were subsequently made in May, 2025. We conclude that $S_{11}$(z) data can be used to estimate \RIP, on 50 cm vertical scales, at the per-cent level of accuracy required by experiments such as RN0-G.</description>

      <title>A Unified Model and Optimization for Deep Space Radiation Shielding Based on Proton Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of deep space radiation shielding design, traditional high-Z metals are being progressively replaced by novel low-Z materials such as hydrogenated graphene foam, polyethylene-carbon nanotube composite fibers, and boron-rich hydrogen-containing metal-organic frameworks. This transition stems from the constraints of the "gram-scale weight reduction" bottleneck. However, the mechanisms behind these materials' outstanding "lightweight performance" remain at the purely phenomenological level. To address this issue, this paper innovatively proposes a ternary coupled semi-empirical model, with "proton density" (rho_p) as the core independent variable (equivalent to electron density), establishing correlations with full absorption threshold (Eth) and proton utilization rate (eta_p). To validate the model's practicality in complex system design, we embedded it into the NSGA-II genetic algorithm (POP=20, MAXGEN=10). Under constraints of 2-5 layer structures with total thickness &lt;=1 cm, the model's predicted optimal solutions showed an average design error of only 6.2%-8.2% compared to Geant4 heavy simulation dose results. This study provides the first quantitative physical explanation of the inherent trade-off between low-Z materials' "mass savings" and high-Z materials' "space savings." When rho_p&lt;1 mol cm^-3, materials demonstrate extremely high proton utilization rates (eta_p reaching 60-100 MeV cm^-2 mol^-1), achieving 35%-55% mass savings. Conversely, when rho_p&gt;1 mol cm^-3, although eta_p drops below 30 MeV cm^-2 mol^-1, its exceptionally high full absorption threshold (Eth) enables ultra-thin shielding technology. This work offers a robust, physically interpretable, and scalable design tool for multi-objective optimization of area density, thickness, and dose in deep space missions.</description>

Abstract: A Ground Level Enhancement event was observed by neutron detectors designed for the registration of extensive air showers at the Experimental Complex NEVOD. The potential for that was unlocked by a recent modernization of the experimental setup that included implementation of additional channels for measuring neutron flux variation. At 10:15 UT on November 11, 2025, a sudden and significant increase in the neutron flux was detected by two installations: PRISMA-36 and URAN arrays. For the first time, a GLE has been recorded using a set of neutron detectors oriented at the extensive air shower studies. We present the measured EC NEVOD data and the results of the preliminary analysis of the observed GLE.</description>

      <title>WIMP Dark Matter Search using a 3.1 Tonne-Year Exposure of the XENONnT Experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on a search for weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter (DM) via elastic DM-xenon-nucleus interactions in the XENONnT experiment. We combine datasets from the first and second science campaigns resulting in a total exposure of 3.1 tonne-years. In a blind analysis of nuclear recoil events with energies above $3.8\,\mathrm{keV_{NR}}$, we find no significant excess above background. We set new upper limits on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering cross section for WIMP masses above $10\,\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ with a minimum of $1.7\,\times\,10^{-47}\,\mathrm{cm^2}$ at $90\,\%$ confidence level for a WIMP mass of $30\,\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$. We achieve a best median sensitivity of $1.4\,\times\,10^{-47}\,\mathrm{cm^2}$ for a $41\,\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ WIMP. Compared to the result from the first XENONnT science dataset, we improve our sensitivity by a factor of up to 1.8.</description>

      <title>The Detection-vs-Retrieval Challenge: Titan as an Exoplanet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12144v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cassini's observations of Titan's atmosphere are exemplary benchmarks for exoplanet atmospheric studies owing to (1) their precision and (2) our independent knowledge of Titan. Leveraging these observations, we perform retrievals (i.e., analyses) of Titan's transmission spectrum to investigate the strengths/limitations of exoplanet atmospheric retrievals with a particular focus on the underlying assumptions regarding the molecular species included in the retrieval. We find that multiple hydrocarbons can be ``retrieved'' depending on the selection made ahead of a retrieval. More importantly, we find that the estimates of other parameters such as the abundance of key absorbers like methane can be biased by $\sim$0.5 dex (by a factor of $\sim$3) due to such choices. This shows that beyond the possible misidentification of a molecular feature (e.g., current debate surrounding dimethyl sulfide, DMS, in K2-18 b), the implicit molecular detections made pre-retrieval to avoid retrieving for hundreds of molecules at a time can bias a large range of parameters. We thus recommend sensitivity analysis to assess the dependencies of atmospheric inferences on such selections in tandem with complementary information (e.g., chemistry models) to support any pre-retrieval selection. Finally, we introduce an independent path to constrain the dominant atmospheric constituent, even when lacking observable absorption feature (e.g., H$_2$ and N$_2$) through the scale height.</description>

      <title>Learning to detect continuous gravitational waves: an open data-analysis competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report results of a public data-analysis challenge, hosted on the open data-science platform Kaggle, to detect simulated continuous gravitational-wave signals (CWs). These are weak signals from rapidly spinning neutron stars that remain undetected despite extensive searches. The competition dataset consisted of a population of CW signals using both simulated and real LIGO detector data matching the conditions of actual CW searches. The competition attracted more than 1,000 participants to develop realistic CW search algorithms. We describe the top 10 approaches and discuss their applicability as a pre-processing step compared to standard CW-search approaches. For the competition's dataset, we find that top approaches can reduce the computing cost by 1 to 3 orders of magnitude at a false-dismissal probability comparable to standard CW searches. Additionally, the competition drove the development of new GPU-accelerated detection pipelines, which facilitated their adoption in other areas of gravitational-wave data analysis. We release the associated dataset, which constitutes the first open standardized benchmark for CW detection, to enable reproducible method comparisons and to encourage further developments toward the first detection of these elusive signals.</description>

      <title>Searching for GEMS: The Occurrence of Giant Planets orbiting M-dwarfs within 100 pc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08773v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present results from a systematic search for transiting short-period Giant Exoplanets around M-dwarf Stars (GEMS; $P &lt; 10$ days, $R_p \gtrsim 8~R_\oplus$) within a distance-limited 100 pc sample of $149,316$ M-dwarfs using TESS-Gaia Light Curve (TGLC) data. We describe the development and application of the \textit{TESS-miner} package and associated vetting procedures used in this analysis. To assess detection completeness, we conducted $\sim$72 million injection-recovery tests across $\sim$26,000 stars with an average of $\sim$3 sectors of data per star, subdivided into early-type (M0--M2.5), mid-type (M2.5--M4), and late-type (M4 or later) M-dwarfs. Our pipeline demonstrates high sensitivity across all subtypes within the injection bounds.
  We estimate the occurrence rates of short-period GEMS as a function of stellar mass, and combine our measured rates with those derived for FGK stars, fitting an exponential trend with stellar mass, consistent with core-accretion theory predictions. We find GEMS occurrence rates of $0.118\% \pm 0.068\%$ for early-type M-dwarfs, $0.153\% \pm 0.069\%$ for mid-type, and $0.036\% \pm 0.024\%$ for late-type M-dwarfs, with a mean rate of $0.068\%\pm0.024\%$ across the full sample. While our search spanned $1.0~\mathrm{days} &lt; P &lt; 10.0$ days, these rates were calculated using planets orbiting with $1.0~\mathrm{days} &lt; P &lt; 5.0$ days. This work establishes the basis for future occurrence rate studies of transiting GEMS.</description>
