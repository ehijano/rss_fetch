      <title>Next-generation soliton frequency combs in photonic-crystal and nanocomposite microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microresonator frequency combs offer tremendous opportunity to advance applications in fundamental research and technology by linking the optical and microwave frequency domains. Kerr-nonlinear microresonators further enable the generation of portable, integrated optical frequency combs, which are called microcombs. However, the dispersion engineering usually suffers from the small, geometric parameter space, and achieving soliton microcombs is challenging and usually requires complicated experimental techniques and setups. In recent years, the invention of photonic-crystal resonators (PhCRs) provides access to solitons in a convenient and stable way while its mechanism has not been fully understood. In this article, we highlight the perspectives of generating solitons for various applications in PhCRs and give a thorough understanding of the dynamics of soliton formation. We also propose a nanocomposite waveguide structure for the optimization of group velocity dispersion (GVD), lifting the limitation on geometric parameter space. We apply it to the design of the pump-harmonic microcomb, a new concept for f-2f self-referencing in microcombs. Inspired by the pulse-driven microresonator, we provide a scheme of two-microresonator network, retaining the convenience of using a continuous wave laser for microcomb generation. Our work depicts a blueprint of achieving the next generation soliton frequency combs in PhCR and nanocomposite microresonators and highlights their great prospects in optical metrology, precision measurement and optical data transmission.</description>

      <title>AI-Augmented Photon-Trapping Spectrometer-on-a-Chip on Silicon Platform with Extended Near-Infrared Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a compact, noise-resilient reconstructive spectrometer-on-a-chip that achieves high-resolution hyperspectral imaging across an extended near-infrared (NIR) range up to 1100nm. The device integrates monolithically fabricated silicon photodiodes enhanced with photon-trapping surface textures (PTST), enabling improved responsivity in the low-absorption NIR regime. Leveraging a fully connected neural network, we demonstrate accurate spectral reconstruction from only 16 uniquely engineered detectors, achieving &lt;0.05 RMSE and 8nm resolution over a wide spectral range of 640nm to 1100nm. Our system outperforms conventional spectrometers, maintaining signal-to-noise ratio above 30dB even with 40dB of added detector noise; extending functionality to longer wavelengths up to 1100nm, while the traditional spectrometers fail to perform beyond 950nm due to poor detector efficiency and noise performance. With a footprint of 0.4mm2, dynamic range of 50dB, ultrafast time response (57ps), and high photodiode gain (&gt;7000), this AI-augmented silicon spectrometer is well-suited for portable, real-time, and low-light applications in biomedical imaging, environmental monitoring, and remote sensing. The results establish a pathway toward fully integrated, high-performance hyperspectral sensing in a CMOS-compatible platform.</description>

      <title>A fully-programmable integrated photonic processor for both domain-specific and general-purpose computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A variety of complicated computational scenarios have made unprecedented demands on the computing power and energy efficiency of electronic computing systems, including solving intractable nondeterministic polynomial-time (NP)-complete problems and dealing with large-scale artificial intelligence models. Optical computing emerges as a promising paradigm to meet these challenges, whereas current optical computing architectures have limited versatility. Their applications are usually either constrained to a specialized domain or restricted to general-purpose matrix computation. Here, we implement a fully-programmable integrated photonic processor that can be configured to tackle both specific computational problems and general-purpose matrix computation. We achieve complete end-to-end control of the photonic processor by utilizing a self-developed integrated programmable optoelectronic computing platform. For domain-specific computing, our photonic processor can efficiently solve two kinds of NP-complete problems: subset sum problem (far more than 2^N different instances) and exact cover problem. For general-purpose computation, we experimentally demonstrate high-precision optical dot product and further realize accurate image edge detection and MNIST handwritten image classification task with an accuracy of 97%. Our work enhances the versatility and capability of optical computing architecture, paving the way for its practical application in future high-performance and complex computing scenarios.</description>

      <title>Strongly resonant polarization dynamics of pulse trains in a spin-flip model for an excitable microlaser with delayed self-feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental observations concerning the polarization dynamics in an excitable microlaser with saturable absorber coupled to an external feedback mirror reported in [Ruschel et al. (2025) Opt. Lett. 50 (8) 2618], we propose here an in-depth theoretical investigation of the locked dynamics of regenerative vectorial pulse trains that this system produces. We perform a numerical bifurcation analysis of self-sustained pulse trains of a corresponding spin-flip model with delayed feedback. Its focus is on strongly resonant regimes, where the modulation of the peak intensities of polarized regenerative pulse trains locks to 2, 3 and 4 times the pulse regeneration time. Specifically, we identify points of strongly resonant rotation numbers on curves of torus bifurcations in the parameter plane of the amplitude and phase anisotropy parameters, and continue emerging curves of fold and period-doubling bifurcations to identify locking regions. In this way, we clarify where pulse trains show strongly resonant polarization dynamics and highlight that even weak polarization coupling in delay-coupled microlasers creates considerable dynamical richness. These results may have impact on the design of future coupled microlasers systems for neuroinspired on-chip computing, where the polarization of an excitable pulse can be used to encode or process information.</description>

      <title>Controlling the Flow of Information in Optical Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical metrology has progressed beyond the Abbe-Rayleigh limit, unlocking (sub)atomic precision by leveraging nonlinear phenomena, statistical accumulation, and AI-estimators trained on measurand variations. Here, we reveal that Fisher information, which defines the fundamental precision limit, can be viewed as a physical entity that propagates through space, and we derive the wave equation for sensitivity fields defining the flow of Fisher information, which can resonate, diffract, and interfere. We uncover how material composition, geometry, and environmental design can dictate where information is generated and how it travels, in the same way as antennas and metasurfaces are used to sculpt electromagnetic energy. Plasmonic and dielectric resonances can enhance information flow, while gratings and near-field structures can reshape information radiation patterns. This perspective reframes metrology as a discipline in which resolution can be purposely engineered by tailoring the sources and flow of information to serve applications in atomic-scale diagnostics and fabrication.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Minnaert Resonances in High-contrast acoustic Structures and Applications to Invisibility Cloaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel quasi-Minnaert resonance phenomenon in acoustic wave propagation through high-contrast medium in both two and three dimensions, occurring in the sub-wavelength regime. These media are characterized by physical properties significantly distinct from those of a homogeneous background. The quasi-Minnaert resonance is defined by two primary features: boundary localization, where the $L^2$-norms of the internal total field and the external scattered field exhibit pronounced concentration near the boundary, and surface resonance, marked by highly oscillatory behavior of the fields near the boundary. In contrast to classical Minnaert resonances, which are associated with a discrete spectral spectrum tied to physical parameters, quasi-Minnaert resonances exhibit analogous physical phenomena but with a continuous spectral spectrum. Using layer potential theory and rigorous asymptotic analysis, we demonstrate that the coupling between a high-contrast material structure, particularly with radial geometries, and a carefully designed incident wave is critical for inducing quasi-Minnaert resonances. Extensive numerical experiments, involving radial geometries (e.g., unit disks and spheres) and general-shaped geometries (e.g., hearts, Cassini ovals, and clovers in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and spheres in $\mathbb{R}^3$), validate the occurrence of these resonances. Furthermore, we numerically demonstrate that quasi-Minnaert resonances induce an invisibility cloaking effect in the high-contrast medium. These findings have significant implications for mathematical material science and the development of acoustic cloaking technologies.</description>

      <title>Research on the Preparation and Luminescent Properties of Ca0.87-xSrxAl2Si2O8:0.13Eu2+ Broad Band Blue Phosphor for White Light LEDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White light emitting diodes (LEDs) have become the most widely used lighting devices due to their high luminous efficiency, environmental friendliness, long lifespan, and energy-saving advantages. Currently, the production of white light LEDs faces challenges such as a lack of cyan light emission, which results in a low color rendering index (Ra), as well as issues related to poor thermal stability of the luminescent materials and difficulties in synthesis. This paper employs a high-temperature solid-state method and cation substitution strategy to prepare a broadband blue phosphor Ca0.87-xSrxAl2Si2O8: 0.13Eu2+ (x=0-0.87) with a feldspar structure. By varying the concentration of x, phase transitions are achieved, leading to the formation of two luminescent centers. The luminescence intensity of Ca0.87Al2Si2O8:0.13Eu2+ is enhanced by 2 times, and the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) increases by 24.8%. The internal quantum efficiency of Ca0.27Sr0.60Al2Si2O8:0.13Eu2+ reaches as high as 84.1%. The strongest emission peak is observed when the concentration of Sr2+ reaches 0.6 mol, with a full width at half maximum of 91 nm. The experimental value of the optical band gap of the matrix is 5.74 eV, indicating that the luminescence intensity of the sample Ca0.27Sr0.60Al2Si2O8:0.13Eu2+ at 150{\deg}C is 92.2% of that at room temperature. Ca0.27Sr0.60Al2Si2O8:0.13Eu2+ and commercial red phosphor (Ca,Sr)AlSiN3:Eu2+, as well as commercial green phosphor (Sr,Ba)2SiO4:Eu2+, have been successfully packaged into white light LED devices using a 365nm near-ultraviolet chip. The color rendering index (Ra) of this white light LED device is 94.3, with a color coordinate of (0.4094, 0.4167) and a correlated color temperature (CCT) of 3611.4K.</description>

      <title>Mueller Matrix Polarimetry of Fiber Bragg Grating Strain and Torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a polarimetric dual-comb spectroscopy technique for simultaneous strain and torsion sensing using a single-cavity mode-locked fiber laser and fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors. Dual-comb generation in a single-cavity fiber laser was achieved by utilizing a piece of high-birefringence fiber and adjusting the in-cavity polarization controller. Fast Fourier Transform analysis was applied to the time-domain Stokes parameters, enabling the detection of FBG spectral shifts induced by strain and torsion. To further enhance discrimination between strain and torsion, we applied a novel approach to extract Mueller matrix elements without using complex adjustable polarization components. We explored the analysis of polarimetric purity of the FBG's Mueller matrix in terms of polarizance, diattenuation, and structural polarization response as a function of FBG strain and torsion. The obtained results enabled the measurement of strain and torsion based on a single FBG, which paves the way for the development of cost-effective shape sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved spectroscopy of noise-driven collective states of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a collective liquid state of light in a fast-gain laser. Controlled temporal noise on the cavity modulation creates a fluctuating linear potential along the synthetic frequency lattice of the cavity modes. We identify three regimes of lattice occupation as noise increases: an extended distribution, a Gaussian envelope, and exponential localization. Time-resolved spectroscopy on single realizations of noise reveals distinct dynamics in the latter two: transport persists in the Gaussian regime, modulated by the fluctuating potential, but is fully suppressed at all times in the localized regime. Averaging over many noise realizations shows that noise reduces the transport speed and confirms ergodicity of the system.</description>

      <title>Extracting Membrane-like hexagonal Boron Nitride hosting single Defect Centers for Resonator Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of membranes into optical resonators plays a key role in a variety of applications, including optomechanics. If such membranes host atom-like systems, ideally with access to spin states, new roads in quantum photonics and also in optomechanics can be taken. Layered, two-dimensional materials have emerged as candidates for membranes hosting atom-like quantum emitters. Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is among the most promising two-dimensional platforms showing good mechanical properties combined with the ability to host various kinds of optical active (spin-) defects. However, the determinisitc creation of optically active defect centers in hBN membranes is an outstanding challenge. Commercially available flakes of hBN host defect centers with promising optical properties, but the integration into optical resonators suffers from scattering losses due to the flakes topography and suitable transfer, handling and manipulation techniques need to be established. Here, we develope a toolset of nano-scaled manipulation techniques to extract membrane-like structures of commercially-available hBN containing spectrally narrow single photon emitters. We demonstrate the transfer and integration into photonic devices, by coupling a single photon emitter in membran-like hBN to the mode of an open Fabry-Perot fiber cavity (FPFC) and observe cavity induced spectral enhancement by a factor of up to 100 at room temperature. Overcoming hBN-induced scattering for extracted hBN membranes, which host single photon emitters, paves the way for future applications such as its use as an optomechanical system.</description>

      <title>Generalized Brillouin Zone Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Generalized Brillouin Zone (GBZ) encodes how lattice momentum is complex-deformed due to non-Hermitian skin accumulation, and has proved essential in restoring bulk-boundary correspondences. However, we find that generically, the GBZ is neither unique nor well-defined if more than one skin localization direction or strength exists, even in systems with no asymmetric hoppings. Instead, open boundary condition (OBC) eigenstates become complicated superpositions of multiple competing skin modes from "fragments" of all possible GBZs solutions. We develop a formalism that computes the fragmented GBZ in a scalable manner, with fragmentation extent quantified through our newly-defined composition IPR and spectral relative entropy. GBZ fragmentation is revealed to fundamentally challenge the notion of discontinuous phase transitions, since topological winding contributions from different GBZ fragments can "melt away" at different rates. Phenomenologically, GBZ fragmentation also leads to edge localization in all observables in energetically weighted ensembles such as thermal ensembles. This contrasts with conventional GBZs where the skin localization completely cancels in biorthogonal expectations. Occurring universally in multi-mode non-Hermitian media, as we concretely demonstrate with photonic crystal simulations, GBZ fragmentation points towards a new paradigm that is essential for understanding the band structure and the topological and dynamical properties of diverse generic non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Numerical Simulation of Lead-Free Absorbers in 2D Dion-Jacobson Phase Perovskite Solar Cells Using SCAPS-1D: Towards 41% Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of photovoltaic science, there has been an increasing focus on the development of environment-friendly and structurally advanced perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this context, this study investigates an architectural configuration employing 2D Dion-Jacobson phase perovskites as both electron and hole transport layers within a 2D/absorber/2D structure. The primary objective is to identify optimal absorber materials and enhance the overall efficiency of the device. While the reduction of lead content remains a significant challenge in PSC development, the present work focuses on the evaluation of seven lead-free absorber materials: MASnBr3, Sr3PI3/Sr3SbI3, p-CuBi2O4, p-Si, CH3NH3SnI3, Sb2Se3, and CZTSSe. These materials were assessed in the context of an FTO/PeDAMA8Pb6I19/IDL1/absorber/IDL2/PeDAMA2Pb3I10/C architecture utilizing SCAPS-1D simulation software. The study includes a comprehensive analysis of band alignment, pre-optimization screening, and performance optimization through the adjustment of absorber thickness, doping levels, and defect densities. Additionally, the temperature sensitivity and the substitution of the FTO layer with ITO, IZO, and MZO were also investigated. The simulation results indicated that Sb2Se3 and CZTSSe achieved the highest efficiencies of 41.00% and 41.19%, respectively. Furthermore, MZO was identified as a strong candidate for replacing FTO, maintaining consistent performance across all absorber types analyzed. Overall, this study provides a comparative framework for the material selection within layered PSC architectures and significantly contributes to the advancement of stable, efficient, and lead-free photovoltaic technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Limited Spatial Resolution of NV-Diamond Magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optically addressable ensembles of solid-state defects, such as nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers, are a leading modality for imaging-based magnetometry, thermometry and strain sensing. However, monitoring the fluorescence of individual defects within a sub-diffraction ensemble remains an outstanding challenge that currently limits access to atomic-scale features and dynamics. For compact clusters of NVs, imaging-based atomic sensing may be formulated as a low-dimensional multiparameter estimation task in which one seeks to localize each defect and quantify the field strength in its immediate vicinity. In this work, we employ optical spatial mode demultiplexing (SPADE) to enhance localization and brightness estimation accuracy at sub-diffraction scales. Specifically, we develop a two-stage sensing protocol that augments direct imaging by projecting the incoming optical field onto point spread function (PSF)-adapted spatial modes and Yuen-Kennedy-Lax (YKL) spatial modes, enabling efficient extraction of emitter positions and brightnesses. We numerically evaluate the statistical performance of our protocol for sub-diffraction optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and Rabi sensing experiments. Compared to conventional focal plane intensity measurements, our protocol improves emitter localization accuracy by $6\times$ and brightness estimation accuracy by $2\times$ for tightly confined ensembles, residing well below the diffraction limit.</description>

      <title>Circularly polarized light scattering imaging of a cancerous layer creeping under a healthy layer for the diagnosis of early-stage cervical cancer</title>

Abstract: Cancerous tissues beneath healthy tissues were experimentally identified by using circularly polarized light scattering. This method enabled the changes in the size of the cell nuclei within the penetration depth in tissue to be investigated. Artificial unexposed cancerous tissues were prepared that consisted of healthy/cancerous/healthy layers with various thicknesses of the topmost healthy layer and the cancerous layer. A polarization imaging camera with a quarter-wave plate was used to create distribution images of the circular polarization of the scattered light, which indicated the presence and depth of cancerous tissues that had crept under the epithelium. These findings will lead to the development of a non-invasive optical diagnostic method for early-stage cervical cancer.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear-linear duality for multipath quantum interference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum optics, the postselection amplitude of a nondegenerate parametric down-conversion (PDC) process is linked to a beamsplitter (BS) via partial time reversal, up to a normalization coefficient which is related to the parametric gain [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 117, 33107 (2020)]. A special example where the gain is low is reminiscent of Klyshko's advanced-wave picture in quantum imaging. Here, we propose and prove a generalized duality for multiple spatial paths connecting a quantum nonlinear interference setup consisting of nondegenerate PDCs and linear optical systems to a linear one, where the PDCs are directly replaced by hypothetical wavelength-shifting BSs. This replacement preserves the geometry of the original setup, and cascaded PDCs become optical cavities whose calculation involves the Redheffer star product. Additional terms in the normalization coefficient are related to the contribution of looping photons inside the cavities. Then, we discuss the case of coherent state input and postselection for $Q$-function calculation. This theorem will be helpful in the development of quantum photonic devices beyond the low-gain limit.</description>

      <title>Microscopic magnetic field imaging with hot atoms via single-pixel imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, sensors based on hot atomic vapor cells have emerged as a compact and highly sensitive means of measuring magnetic fields. Such sensors have been deployed in the field for the measurement of, e.g. biological systems, representing a promising practical application of quantum technologies. However, it remains challenging to obtain high-resolution magnetic field images from these sensors, and in most cases the spatial resolution of the system is limited by the sensor size. Here, we demonstrate the combination of single-pixel imaging (SPI) techniques with an atom vapor. Faraday magnetometer to achieve microscopic magnetic field imaging. We demonstrate magnetic field imaging with a spatial resolution of $\approx~62.5\mu m$, limited only by the resolution of our DMD projection system and the absence of magnetic shielding in our experimental setup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15671v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mode-locking mechanisms are key resources in nonlinear optical phenomena, such as micro-ring solitonic states, and have transformed metrology, precision spectroscopy, and optical communication. However, despite significant efforts, mode-locking has not been demonstrated in the independently tunable multi-timescale regime. Here, we vastly expand the nonlinear mode-locking toolbox into multi-timescale synchronization on a chip. We use topological photonics to engineer a 2D lattice of hundreds of coupled silicon nitride ring resonators capable of hosting nested mode-locked states with a fast (near 1 THz) single-ring and a slow (near 3 GHz) topological super-ring timescales. We demonstrate signatures of multi-timescale mode-locking including quadratic distribution of the pump noise with the two-time azimuthal mode dimensions, as expected by mode-locking theory. Our observations are further corroborated by direct signatures of the near-transform-limit repetition beats and the formation of the temporal pattern on the slow timescale. Moreover, we show that these exotic properties of edge-confined mode-locked states are in sharp contrast to bulk and single-ring counterparts and establish a clear pathway for their identification. Our unprecedented demonstration of mode-locking in topological combs unlocks the implementation of lattice-scale synchronization and independently tunable multi-timescale mode-locking phenomena, also the exploration of the fundamental nonlinearity-topology interplay on a chip.</description>

      <title>Phase mask fabrication for multi-plane light conversion using grayscale lithography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct writing laser (DWL) grayscale lithography is introduced as a novel fabrication technique for multi-plane light conversion (MPLC) phase masks, enabling direct transfer of precise depth profiles onto substrates via reactive ion etching and subsequent reflective coating. An MPLC system employing these masks achieves 92% fidelity in converting a Gaussian (TEM (0,0)) input to a Laguerre-Gaussian (LG(0,0)) mode. The fabricated masks exhibit sub-10 nm vertical resolution, surface roughness below 3 nm, and an R-squared value of 0.976. This method provides a scalable alternative to conventional multi-step lithographic fabrication for advanced photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Universal optical polarizability for plasmonic nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02384v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an analytical model for calculation of optical spectra for metal nanostructures of arbitrary shape supporting localized surface plasmons (LSPs). For plasmonic systems with characteristic size below the diffraction limit, we obtain an explicit expression for optical polarizability that describes the lineshape of optical spectra solely in terms of the metal dielectric function and LSP frequency. The amplitude of the LSP spectral band is determined by the effective system volume that, for long-wavelength LSPs, can significantly exceed the physical volume of metal nanostructure. Within the quasistatic approach, we derive the exact LSP Green's function and establish general spectral properties of LSPs, including the distribution and oscillator strength of the LSP states. These results can be used to model or interpret the experimental spectra of plasmonic nanostructures and to tune their optical properties for various applications.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Mechanical Wigner Negativity via Nonlinear Cavity Quantum Optomechanics in the Unresolved-Sideband Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Gaussian quantum states of mechanical motion exhibiting Wigner negativity offer promising capabilities for quantum technologies and tests of fundamental physics. Within the field of cavity quantum optomechanics, deterministic preparation of nonclassical mechanical states with such Wigner negativity is a highly sought goal but is challenging as the intracavity interaction Hamiltonian is linear in mechanical position. Here, we show that, despite this form of interaction, by utilizing the nonlinearity of the cavity response with mechanical position, mechanical Wigner negativity can be prepared deterministically in the unresolved-sideband regime, without additional nonlinearities, nonclassical drives, or conditional measurements. In particular, we find that Wigner negativity can be prepared with an optical pulse, even without single-photon strong coupling, and the negativity persists in the steady state of a continuously driven system. Our results deepen our understanding of cavity-enhanced radiation pressure and establish a pathway for deterministic preparation of nonclassical mechanical states in the unresolved sideband regime.</description>

      <title>Single attosecond XUV pulse source via light-wave controlled relativistic laser-plasma interaction: Thomson Back Scattering Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reflecting light off a mirror moving near light speed offers a powerful method for generating bright, ultrashort pulses in the extreme ultraviolet range. Several investigations show that dense relativistic electron mirrors can be created by striking a nanometre-scale foil with a high-intensity, sharp-front laser pulse, forming a single relativistic electron sheet (RES). This RES coherently reflects and upshifts a counter-propagating laser beam from the infrared to the extreme ultraviolet with efficiency exceeding incoherent scattering by over several orders of magnitude. Here we demonstrate that optimizing the drive laser waveform can reliably produce a single RES, leading to generation of isolated \emph{attosecond} pulses enhancing both intensity and temporal compression of the back reflected light in a controlled manner. Simulations reveal that tuning parameters like timing delay enables control over the amplitude, duration, and bandwidth of the resulting attosecond Thomson backscattering pulse. Together, these advances meet key experimental challenges and pave the way for compact, tunable sources of isolated attosecond pulses for probing ultrafast phenomena.</description>
