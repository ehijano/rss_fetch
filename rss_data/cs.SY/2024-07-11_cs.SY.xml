      <title>Concurrent Geometry, Control, and Layout Optimization of Wave Energy Converter Farms in Probabilistic Irregular Waves using Surrogate Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A promising direction towards improving the performance of wave energy converter (WEC) farms is to leverage a system-level integrated approach known as control co-design (CCD). A WEC farm CCD problem may entail decision variables associated with the geometric attributes, control parameters, and layout of the farm. However, solving the resulting optimization problem, which requires the estimation of hydrodynamic coefficients through numerical methods such as multiple scattering (MS), is computationally prohibitive. To mitigate this computational bottleneck, we construct data-driven surrogate models (SMs) using artificial neural networks in combination with concepts from many-body expansion. The resulting SMs, developed using an active learning strategy known as query by committee, are validated through a variety of methods to ensure acceptable performance in estimating the hydrodynamic coefficients, (energy-related) objective function, and decision variables. To rectify inherent errors in SMs, a hybrid optimization strategy is devised. It involves solving an optimization problem with a genetic algorithm and SMs to generate a starting point that will be used with a gradient-based optimizer and MS. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by solving a series of optimization problems with increasing levels of integration. For a layout optimization study, the framework offers a 91-fold increase in computational efficiency compared to MS. Previously unexplored investigations of much further complexity are also performed, leading to a concurrent geometry, control, and layout optimization of WEC devices in probabilistic irregular waves. The scalability of the method is evaluated by increasing the farm size to include 25 devices. The results indicate promising directions toward a practical framework for integrated WEC farm design with more tractable computational demands.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Backstepping and Non-singular Sliding Mode Control for Quadrotor UAVs with Unknown Time-varying Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel quaternion-based nonsingular control system for underactuated vertical-take-off and landing (VTOL) Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Position and attitude tracking is challenging regarding singularity and accuracy. Quaternion-based Adaptive Backstepping Control (QABC) is developed to tackle the underactuated issues of UAV control systems in a cascaded way. Leveraging the virtual control (auxiliary control) developed in the QABC, desired attitude components and required thrust are produced. Afterwards, we propose Quaternion-based Sliding Mode Control (QASMC) to enhance the stability and mitigate chattering issues. The sliding surface is modified to avoid singularity compared to conventional SMC. To improve the robustness of controllers, the control parameters are updated using adaptation laws. Furthermore, the asymptotic stability of translational and rotational dynamics is guaranteed by utilizing Lyapunov stability and Barbalet Lemma. Finally, the comprehensive comparison results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed controllers in the presence of unknown time-varying parameter uncertainties and significant initial errors.

      <title>Accelerating Mobile Edge Generation (MEG) by Constrained Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel accelerated mobile edge generation (MEG) framework is proposed for generating high-resolution images on mobile devices. Exploiting a large-scale latent diffusion model (LDM) distributed across edge server (ES) and user equipment (UE), cost-efficient artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) is achieved by transmitting low-dimensional features between ES and UE. To reduce overheads of both distributed computations and transmissions, a dynamic diffusion and feature merging scheme is conceived. By jointly optimizing the denoising steps and feature merging ratio, the image generation quality is maximized subject to latency and energy consumption constraints. To address this problem and tailor LDM sub-models, a low-complexity MEG acceleration protocol is developed. Particularly, a backbone meta-architecture is trained via offline distillation. Then, dynamic diffusion and feature merging are determined in online channel environment, which can be viewed as a constrained Markov Decision Process (MDP). A constrained variational policy optimization (CVPO) based MEG algorithm is further proposed for constraint-guaranteed learning, namely MEG-CVPO. Numerical results verify that: 1) The proposed framework can generate 1024$\times$1024 high-quality images over noisy channels while reducing over $40\%$ latency compared to conventional generation schemes. 2) The developed MEG-CVPO effectively mitigates constraint violations, thus flexibly controlling the trade-off between image distortion and generation costs.</description>

      <title>Optimal Sensor and Actuator Selection for Factored Markov Decision Processes: Complexity, Approximability and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Factored Markov Decision Processes (fMDPs) are a class of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) in which the states (and actions) can be factored into a set of state (and action) variables. The state space, action space and reward function of a fMDP can be encoded compactly using a factored representation. In this paper, we consider the setting where we have a set of potential sensors to select for the fMDP (at design-time), where each sensor measures a certain state variable and has a selection cost. We formulate the problem of selecting an optimal set of sensors for fMDPs (subject to certain budget constraints) to maximize the expected infinite-horizon discounted return provided by the optimal control policy. We show the fundamental result that it is NP-hard to approximate this optimization problem to within any non-trivial factor. We then study the dual problem of budgeted actuator selection (at design-time) to maximize the expected return under the optimal policy. Again, we show that it is NP-hard to approximate this optimization problem to within any non-trivial factor. Furthermore, with explicit examples, we show the failure of greedy algorithms for both the sensor and actuator selection problems and provide insights into the factors that cause these problems to be challenging. Despite the inapproximability results, through extensive simulations, we show that the greedy algorithm may provide near-optimal performance for actuator and sensor selection in many real-world and randomly generated fMDP instances.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Assisted Design of mmWave Wireless Transceiver Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As fifth-generation (5G) and upcoming sixth-generation (6G) communications exhibit tremendous demands in providing high data throughput with a relatively low latency, millimeter-wave (mmWave) technologies manifest themselves as the key enabling components to achieve the envisioned performance and tasks. In this context, mmWave integrated circuits (IC) have attracted significant research interests over the past few decades, ranging from individual block design to complex system design. However, the highly nonlinear properties and intricate trade-offs involved render the design of analog or RF circuits a complicated process. The rapid evolution of fabrication technology also results in an increasingly long time allocated in the design process due to more stringent requirements. In this thesis, 28-GHz transceiver circuits are first investigated with detailed schematics and associated performance metrics. In this case, two target systems comprising heterogeneous individual blocks are selected and demonstrated on both the transmitter and receiver sides. Subsequently, some conventional and large-scale machine learning (ML) approaches are integrated into the design pipeline of the chosen systems to predict circuit parameters based on desired specifications, thereby circumventing the typical time-consuming iterations found in traditional methods. Finally, some potential research directions are discussed from the perspectives of circuit design and ML algorithms.</description>

      <title>Precision Agriculture: Ultra-Compact Sensor and Reconfigurable Antenna for Joint Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a joint sensing and communication system is presented for smart agriculture. The system integrates an Ultra-compact Soil Moisture Sensor (UCSMS) for precise sensing, along with a Pattern Reconfigurable Antenna (PRA) for efficient transmission of information to the base station. A multiturn complementary spiral resonator (MCSR) is etched onto the ground plane of a microstrip transmission line to achieve miniaturization. The UCSMS operates at 180 MHz with a 3-turn complementary spiral resonator (3-CSR), at 102 MHz with a 4- turn complementary spiral resonator (4-CSR), and at 86 MHz with a 5-turn complementary spiral resonator (5-CSR). Due to its low resonance frequency, the proposed UCSMS is insensitive to variations in the Volume Under Test (VUT) of soil. A probe-fed circular patch antenna is designed in the Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) band (2.45 GHz) with a maximum measured gain of 5.63 dBi. Additionally, four varactor diodes are integrated across the slots on the bottom side of the substrate to achieve pattern reconfiguration. Six different radiation patterns have been achieved by using different bias conditions of the diodes. In standby mode, PRA can serve as a means for Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) or Energy Harvesting (EH) to store power in a battery. This stored power can then be utilized to bias the varactor diodes. The combination of UCSMS and PRA enables the realization of a joint sensing and communication system. The proposed system's planar and simple geometry, along with its high sensitivity of 2.05 %, makes it suitable for smart agriculture applications. Moreover, the sensor is adaptive and capable of measuring the permittivity of various Material Under Test (MUT) within the range of 1 to 23.</description>

      <title>Electrical Impedance Tomography Based Closed-loop Tumor Treating Fields in Dynamic Lung Tumors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) is a non-invasive anticancer modality that utilizes alternating electric fields to disrupt cancer cell division and growth. While generally well-tolerated with minimal side effects, traditional TTFields therapy for lung tumors faces challenges due to the influence of respiratory motion. We design a novel closed-loop TTFields strategy for lung tumors by incorporating electrical impedance tomography (EIT) for real-time respiratory phase monitoring and dynamic parameter adjustments. Furthermore, we conduct theoretical analysis to evaluate the performance of the proposed method using the lung motion model. Compared to conventional TTFields settings, we observed that variations in the electrical conductivity of lung during different respiratory phases led to a decrease in the average electric field intensity within lung tumors, transitioning from end-expiratory (1.08 V/cm) to end-inspiratory (0.87 V/cm) phases. Utilizing our proposed closed-Loop TTFields approach at the same dose setting (2400 mA, consistent with the traditional TTFields setting), we can achieve a higher and consistent average electric field strength at the tumor site (1.30 V/cm) across different respiratory stages. Our proposed closed-loop TTFields method has the potential to improved lung tumor therapy by mitigating the impact of respiratory motion.</description>

      <title>Real-time system optimal traffic routing under uncertainties -- Can physics models boost reinforcement learning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: System optimal traffic routing can mitigate congestion by assigning routes for a portion of vehicles so that the total travel time of all vehicles in the transportation system can be reduced. However, achieving real-time optimal routing poses challenges due to uncertain demands and unknown system dynamics, particularly in expansive transportation networks. While physics model-based methods are sensitive to uncertainties and model mismatches, model-free reinforcement learning struggles with learning inefficiencies and interpretability issues. Our paper presents TransRL, a novel algorithm that integrates reinforcement learning with physics models for enhanced performance, reliability, and interpretability. TransRL begins by establishing a deterministic policy grounded in physics models, from which it learns from and is guided by a differentiable and stochastic teacher policy. During training, TransRL aims to maximize cumulative rewards while minimizing the Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence between the current policy and the teacher policy. This approach enables TransRL to simultaneously leverage interactions with the environment and insights from physics models. We conduct experiments on three transportation networks with up to hundreds of links. The results demonstrate TransRL's superiority over traffic model-based methods for being adaptive and learning from the actual network data. By leveraging the information from physics models, TransRL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and soft actor critic (SAC). Moreover, TransRL's actions exhibit higher reliability and interpretability compared to baseline reinforcement learning approaches like PPO and SAC.</description>

      <title>Invisible Optical Adversarial Stripes on Traffic Sign against Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Camera-based computer vision is essential to autonomous vehicle's perception. This paper presents an attack that uses light-emitting diodes and exploits the camera's rolling shutter effect to create adversarial stripes in the captured images to mislead traffic sign recognition. The attack is stealthy because the stripes on the traffic sign are invisible to human. For the attack to be threatening, the recognition results need to be stable over consecutive image frames. To achieve this, we design and implement GhostStripe, an attack system that controls the timing of the modulated light emission to adapt to camera operations and victim vehicle movements. Evaluated on real testbeds, GhostStripe can stably spoof the traffic sign recognition results for up to 94\% of frames to a wrong class when the victim vehicle passes the road section. In reality, such attack effect may fool victim vehicles into life-threatening incidents. We discuss the countermeasures at the levels of camera sensor, perception model, and autonomous driving system.</description>

      <title>Finite Control Set Model Predictive Control with Limit Cycle Stability Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the design of finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) for discrete-time switched affine systems. Existing FCS-MPC methods typically pursue practical stability guarantees, which ensure convergence to a bounded invariant set that contains a desired steady state. As such, current FCS-MPC methods result in unpredictable steady-state behavior due to arbitrary switching among the available finite control inputs. Motivated by this, we present a FCS-MPC design that aims to stabilize a steady-state limit cycle compatible with a desired output reference via a suitable cost function. We provide conditions in terms of periodic terminal costs and finite control set control laws that guarantee asymptotic stability of the developed limit cycle FCS-MPC algorithm. Moreover, we develop conditions for recursive feasibility of limit cycle FCS-MPC in terms of periodic terminal sets and we provide systematic methods for computing ellipsoidal and polytopic periodically invariant sets that contain a desired steady-state limit cycle. Compared to existing periodic terminal ingredients for tracking MPC with a continuous control set, we design and compute terminal ingredients using a finite control set. The developed methodology is validated on switched systems and power electronics benchmark examples.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Digital Reconfigurable Metamaterial Array for Dynamic Beamforming Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel digital reconfigurable 2_bit metamaterial, equipped with a substrate integrated feeding system, is designed for industrial quality control applications within the terahertz frequency range. The proposed feeding mechanism facilitates azimuthal beam steering, spanning from negative 90 degree to positive 90 degree, thereby enabling the reconfiguration of beam patterns within the digital metamaterial. Utilizing the phase distribution concept and comprehensive analysis of coupling and the e_field effect on individual unit cells, the metamaterial array spacing is meticulously designed. Operational at 0.7 THz, the system offers versatile reconfigurability, supporting single, dual, and multibeam modes. Through meticulous optimization, the system demonstrates an impressive negative 138 degree to positive 138 degree beam steering capability. This dynamic beamforming ability, transitioning seamlessly from a singular beam to multibeam configurations, requires minimal software-hardware integration for scanning and inter_satellite links, thus presenting significant potential for enhancing product quality within industrial environments and satellite communication.</description>

      <title>Continuous Control with Coarse-to-fine Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in improving the sample-efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, designing an RL algorithm that can be practically deployed in real-world environments remains a challenge. In this paper, we present Coarse-to-fine Reinforcement Learning (CRL), a framework that trains RL agents to zoom-into a continuous action space in a coarse-to-fine manner, enabling the use of stable, sample-efficient value-based RL algorithms for fine-grained continuous control tasks. Our key idea is to train agents that output actions by iterating the procedure of (i) discretizing the continuous action space into multiple intervals and (ii) selecting the interval with the highest Q-value to further discretize at the next level. We then introduce a concrete, value-based algorithm within the CRL framework called Coarse-to-fine Q-Network (CQN). Our experiments demonstrate that CQN significantly outperforms RL and behavior cloning baselines on 20 sparsely-rewarded RLBench manipulation tasks with a modest number of environment interactions and expert demonstrations. We also show that CQN robustly learns to solve real-world manipulation tasks within a few minutes of online training.</description>

      <title>Vegetable Peeling: A Case Study in Constrained Dexterous Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have made significant progress in addressing dexterous manipulation problems, particularly in in-hand object reorientation. However, there are few existing works that explore the potential utilization of developed dexterous manipulation controllers for downstream tasks. In this study, we focus on constrained dexterous manipulation for food peeling. Food peeling presents various constraints on the reorientation controller, such as the requirement for the hand to securely hold the object after reorientation for peeling. We propose a simple system for learning a reorientation controller that facilitates the subsequent peeling task.

Abstract: Systems in nature are stochastic as well as nonlinear. In traditional applications, engineered filters aim to minimize the stochastic effects caused by process and measurement noise. Conversely, a previous study showed that the process noise can reveal the observability of a system that was initially categorized as unobservable when deterministic tools were used. In this paper, we develop a stochastic framework to explore observability analysis and sensor placement. This framework allows for direct studies of the effects of stochasticity on optimal sensor placement and selection to improve filter error covariance. Numerical results are presented for sensor selection that optimizes stochastic empirical observability in a bioinspired setting.</description>

      <title>A Decentralized Market Mechanism for Energy Communities under Operating Envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an operating envelopes (OEs) aware energy community market mechanism that dynamically charges/rewards its members based on two-part pricing. The OEs are imposed exogenously by a regulated distribution system operator (DSO) on the energy community's revenue meter and is subject to a generalized net energy metering (NEM) tariff design. By formulating the interaction of the community operator and its members as a Stackelberg game, we show that the proposed two-part pricing achieves a Nash equilibrium and maximizes the community's social welfare in a decentralized fashion while ensuring that the community's operation abides by the OEs. The market mechanism conforms with the cost-causation principle and guarantees community members a surplus level no less than their maximum surplus when they autonomously face the DSO. The dynamic and uniform community price is a monotonically decreasing function of the community's aggregate renewable generation. We also analyze the impact of exogenous parameters such as NEM rates and OEs on the value of joining the community. Lastly, through numerical studies, we showcase the community's welfare, and pricing, and compare its members' surplus to customers under the DSO's regime.</description>

      <title>Digital twin with automatic disturbance detection for real-time optimization of a semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) mill</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work describes the development and validation of a digital twin for a semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) mill controlled by an expert system. The digital twin consists of three modules emulating a closed-loop system: fuzzy logic for the expert control, a state-space model for regulatory control, and a recurrent neural network for the SAG mill process. The model was trained with 68 hours of data and validated with 8 hours of test data. It predicts the mill's behavior within a 2.5-minute horizon with a 30-second sampling time. The disturbance detection evaluates the need for retraining, and the digital twin shows promise for supervising the SAG mill with the expert control system. Future work will focus on integrating this digital twin into real-time optimization strategies with industrial validation.</description>

      <title>Learning operando impedance function for battery health with aging-aware equivalent circuit model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The wide usage of Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) requires a deep understanding about battery health. Estimation of battery state-of-health (SOH) is a crucial but yet still challenging task. Pure model-based methods may suffer from inaccuracy and instability of parameter estimations in lifelong aging. While pure data-driven methods rely heavily on quality and quantity of training set, causing lack of generality when extrapolating into unseen cases. In this paper, we propose an aging-aware equivalent circuit model (ECM), which combines model-based and data-driven techniques for SOH estimation. Gaussian process (GP) regression is incorporated in ECM to modelling parameters dependency on operating condition and aging time. The state space formulation of GP is used to enable a computationally efficient co-estimation framework of both parameters and states. Samples from two Open datasets are used to validate model performance, which gives accurate estimation for capacity and impedance. The learnt impedance function can be lined to the shape change of open circuit voltage (OCV) versus SOC curve and thus providing a way to further estimate changes of differential voltage (dV/dQ) curves.</description>

      <title>IRKA is a Riemannian Gradient Descent Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The iterative rational Krylov algorithm (IRKA) is a commonly used fixed-point iteration developed to minimize the $\mathcal{H}_2$ model order reduction error. In this work, IRKA is recast as a Riemannian gradient descent method with a fixed step size over the manifold of rational functions having fixed degree. This interpretation motivates the development of a Riemannian gradient descent method utilizing as a natural extension variable step size and line search. Comparisons made between IRKA and this extension on a few examples demonstrate significant benefits.</description>
