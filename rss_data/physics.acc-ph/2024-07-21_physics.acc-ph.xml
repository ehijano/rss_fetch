      <title>Preparing Fermilab to Carry Out the P5 Plan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past several years, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) has suffered a number of troublesome setbacks. In some cases, failures to respond effectively have only made things worse, resulting in the current crisis atmosphere at the laboratory. This is reflected in part in the poorly rated performance appraisals (or PEMP) that the DOE provides to the lab every year. Three entities are currently responsible for supporting, managing, operating, and leading the lab: the Department of Energy (DOE), Fermi Research Alliance (FRA), and the Laboratory Director Office. Two recent events provide opportunities for interested parties to reverse the recent decline: the release in December 2023 of the P5 Report and the DOE decision to rebid the Management &amp; Operating (M&amp;O) contract. The P5 Report a decadal update of recommendations for US particle physics, includes an ambitious and positive roadmap for projects and activities at Fermilab. Carrying out the P5 plan successfully, however, will also require addressing many of the other problems currently besetting the lab. The selection of a new M&amp;O contractor is under the responsibility of the Deputy Director for Operations of the DOE Office of Science Dr. Juston Fontaine. A new M&amp;O Contractor would replace FRA and name a new Director effective January 1, 2025. A new management team, one hopes, would be motivated to solve problems and would enjoy a honeymoon period, enabling them to make positive changes more easily. Stimulated by these recent developments, the authors of this document, all present or past employees, convened confidentially in order to collect testimonials on a series of events symptomatic of the lab problems, to provide constructive criticism and offer possible solutions. This document summarizes this work.</description>

      <title>Beam Stacking Experiment at a Fixed Field Alternating Gradient Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge in particle accelerators is to achieve high peak intensity. Space charge is particularly strong at lower energy such as during injection and typically limits achievable peak intensity. The beam stacking technique can overcome this limitation by accumulating a beam at high energy where space charge is weaker. In beam stacking, a bunch of particles is injected and accelerated to high energy. This bunch continues to circulate, while a second and subsequent bunches are accelerated to merge into the first. It also allows the user cycle and acceleration cycles to be separated which is often valuable. Beam stacking is not possible in a time varying magnetic field, but a fixed field machine such as an Fixed Field Alternating Gradient Accelerator (FFA) does not sweep the magnetic field. In this paper, we describe experimental demonstration of beam stacking of two beams at KURNS FFA in Kyoto University. The momentum spread and intensity of the beam was analysed by study of the Schottky signal, demonstrating stacking with only a slight increase of momentum spread of the combined beams. The intensity of the first beam was, however, significantly reduced. RF knock-out is the suspected source of the beam loss.</description>

      <title>Development of Rotating Target with Ferrofluid Seal for ILC Electron-Driven Positron Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the ILC electron-driven positron source, acceleration tubes are located immediately downstream of the positron generation target to capture the generated positrons, necessitating high vacuum for their operation. We designed a rotating target using a ferrofluid rotating vacuum seal that can stably maintain a vacuum of $10^{-6}$ Pa and a tangential velocity of 5 m/sec, which meets the requirements of the ILC positron source. We fabricated a full-scale prototype and confirmed the compatibility of rotation and stable vacuum maintenance. Various tests on the radiation resistance of the ferrofluid demonstrated its ability to withstand six years of radiation exposure in normal ILC operation without degradation and to continue exhibiting vacuum sealing performance. Radiation exposure tests on a small-scale target with a structure and material similar to the full-scale target confirmed its operability after two years of radiation exposure in normal ILC operation. The design, including thermal load, stress analysis, and cooling, led to the conclusion of an estimated lifespan of the target of over one year, based on comparison with the SLC target. These results demonstrate and establish the technology of positron generation targets in the ILC electron-driven positron source.</description>
