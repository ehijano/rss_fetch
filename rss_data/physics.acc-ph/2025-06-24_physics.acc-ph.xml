      <title>Relativistic quantum mechanics of charged vortex particles accelerated in a uniform electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relativistic quantum-mechanical description of a charged Laguerre-Gauss beam accelerated in a uniform electric field has been fulfilled. Stationary wave eigenfunctions are rigorously derived. The evolution of the beam parameters during acceleration is considered in detail. The practically important effect of extraordinary suppression of transverse spreading of the beam is discovered, carefully analyzed, and properly explained. Our results provide direct evidence that vortex particle beams can be accelerated without destroying their intrinsic vortex properties, paving the way for high-energy vortex beam applications.</description>

      <title>Prism-based compensation of group delay dispersion in the components of a femtosecond laser resonator and analysis of the influence of prism configuration on laser radiation parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A mathematical algorithm is described for calculating the minimum distance between prisms and the allowable prism insertion depth into the laser beam when solving the general problem of intracavity group delay dispersion (GDD) compensation. GDD is caused by the optical elements of the master oscillator in a femtosecond laser system. The calculation was carried out using analytical and geometrical methods. The influence of changing the distance between the prisms and the depth of their insertion into the laser beam on the GDD compensation has been investigated. Under experimental conditions, this changes the Q-factor of the laser resonator, which determines the central wavelength of the radiation and its spectral width in a titanium-sapphire laser.</description>

      <title>Strategy for Bayesian Optimized Beam Steering at TRIUMF-ISAC's MEBT and HEBT Beamlines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08767v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In preparation for operation of multiple Rare Isotope Beams (RIBs) when the Advanced Rare Isotope Laboratory (ARIEL) becomes operational, TRIUMF embarked on a program of advanced beam tuning applications and machine learning tools. The strategy for operationalzing Bayesian Optimization for beam steering purposes is being developed. A previously reported centroid correction algorithm is used to tune accelerated charged particle beams at TRIUMF's ISAC postaccelerator facility. We present findings and results from multiple machine development experiments conducted between October and November 2024, as part of a pivot toward semi-automated machine tuning methods. These findings were instrumental in shaping the tuning strategy for the medium and high energy beam transport (MEBT, HEBT) lines at ISAC, by sequentially optimizing sub-sections of the beamlines.</description>
