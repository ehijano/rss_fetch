      <title>A Synthetic-to-Real Dehazing Method based on Domain Unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to distribution shift, the performance of deep learning-based method for image dehazing is adversely affected when applied to real-world hazy images. In this paper, we find that such deviation in dehazing task between real and synthetic domains may come from the imperfect collection of clean data. Owing to the complexity of the scene and the effect of depth, the collected clean data cannot strictly meet the ideal conditions, which makes the atmospheric physics model in the real domain inconsistent with that in the synthetic domain. For this reason, we come up with a synthetic-to-real dehazing method based on domain unification, which attempts to unify the relationship between the real and synthetic domain, thus to let the dehazing model more in line with the actual situation. Extensive experiments qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate that the proposed dehazing method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world images.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing RED using the Koopman Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widely used RED (Regularization-by-Denoising) framework uses pretrained denoisers as implicit regularizers for model-based reconstruction. Although RED generally yields high-fidelity reconstructions, the use of black-box denoisers can sometimes lead to instability. In this letter, we propose a data-driven mechanism to stabilize RED using the Koopman operator, a classical tool for analyzing dynamical systems. Specifically, we use the operator to capture the local dynamics of RED in a low-dimensional feature space, and its spectral radius is used to detect instability and formulate an adaptive step-size rule that is model-agnostic, has modest overhead, and requires no retraining. We test this with several pretrained denoisers to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Koopman stabilization.</description>

      <title>CardiacFlow: 3D+t Four-Chamber Cardiac Shape Completion and Generation via Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning 3D+t shape completion and generation from multi-view cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images requires a large amount of high-resolution 3D whole-heart segmentations (WHS) to capture shape priors. In this work, we leverage flow matching techniques to learn deep generative flows for augmentation, completion, and generation of 3D+t shapes of four cardiac chambers represented implicitly by segmentations. Firstly, we introduce a latent rectified flow to generate 3D cardiac shapes for data augmentation, learnt from a limited number of 3D WHS data. Then, a label completion network is trained on both real and synthetic data to reconstruct 3D+t shapes from sparse multi-view CMR segmentations. Lastly, we propose CardiacFlow, a novel one-step generative flow model for efficient 3D+t four-chamber cardiac shape generation, conditioned on the periodic Gaussian kernel encoding of time frames. The experiments on the WHS datasets demonstrate that flow-based data augmentation reduces geometric errors by 16% in 3D shape completion. The evaluation on the UK Biobank dataset validates that CardiacFlow achieves superior generation quality and periodic consistency compared to existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Brain Tumor Detection Through Diverse CNN Architectures in IoT Healthcare Industries: Fast R-CNN, U-Net, Transfer Learning-Based CNN, and Fully Connected CNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered deep learning has advanced brain tumor diagnosis in Internet of Things (IoT)-healthcare systems, achieving high accuracy with large datasets. Brain health is critical to human life, and accurate diagnosis is essential for effective treatment. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides key data for brain tumor detection, serving as a major source of big data for AI-driven image classification. In this study, we classified glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors from MRI images using Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) and UNet architectures. We also applied Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and CNN-based transfer learning models such as Inception-V3, EfficientNetB4, and VGG19. Model performance was assessed using F-score, recall, precision, and accuracy. The Fast R-CNN achieved the best results with 99% accuracy, 98.5% F-score, 99.5% Area Under the Curve (AUC), 99.4% recall, and 98.5% precision. Combining R-CNN, UNet, and transfer learning enables earlier diagnosis and more effective treatment in IoT-healthcare systems, improving patient outcomes. IoT devices such as wearable monitors and smart imaging systems continuously collect real-time data, which AI algorithms analyze to provide immediate insights for timely interventions and personalized care. For external cohort cross-dataset validation, EfficientNetB2 achieved the strongest performance among fine-tuned EfficientNet models, with 92.11% precision, 92.11% recall/sensitivity, 95.96% specificity, 92.02% F1-score, and 92.23% accuracy. These findings underscore the robustness and reliability of AI models in handling diverse datasets, reinforcing their potential to enhance brain tumor classification and patient care in IoT healthcare environments.</description>

      <title>Application Space and the Rate-Distortion-Complexity Analysis of Neural Video CODECs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the decision-making process for choosing video compression systems through a rate-distortion-complexity (RDC) analysis. We discuss the 2D Bjontegaard delta (BD) metric and formulate generalizations in an attempt to extend its notions to the 3D RDC volume. We follow that discussion with another one on the computation of metrics in the RDC volume, and on how to define and measure the cost of a coder-decoder (codec) pair, where the codec is characterized by a cloud of points in the RDC space. We use a Lagrangian cost $D+\lambda R + \gamma C$, such that choosing the best video codec among a number of candidates for an application demands selecting appropriate $(\lambda, \gamma)$ values. Thus, we argue that an application may be associated with a $(\lambda, \gamma)$ point in the application space. An example streaming application was given as a case study to set a particular point in the $(\lambda, \gamma)$ plane. The result is that we can compare Lagrangian costs in an RDC volume for different codecs for a given application. Furthermore, we can span the plane and compare codecs for the entire application space filled with different $(\lambda, \gamma)$ choices. We then compared several state-of-the-art neural video codecs using the proposed metrics. Results are informative and surprising. We found that, within our RDC computation constraints, only four neural video codecs came out as the best suited for any application, depending on where its desirable $(\lambda, \gamma)$ lies.</description>

      <title>Imagining Alternatives: Towards High-Resolution 3D Counterfactual Medical Image Generation via Language Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating 2D images under various conditions; however the impressive performance of these models in 2D is largely enabled by extensive, readily available pretrained foundation models. Critically, comparable pretrained foundation models do not exist for 3D, significantly limiting progress in this domain. As a result, the potential of vision-language models to produce high-resolution 3D counterfactual medical images conditioned solely on natural language descriptions remains completely unexplored. Addressing this gap would enable powerful clinical and research applications, such as personalized counterfactual explanations, simulation of disease progression scenarios, and enhanced medical training by visualizing hypothetical medical conditions in realistic detail. Our work takes a meaningful step toward addressing this challenge by introducing a framework capable of generating high-resolution 3D counterfactual medical images of synthesized patients guided by free-form language prompts. We adapt state-of-the-art 3D diffusion models with enhancements from Simple Diffusion and incorporate augmented conditioning to improve text alignment and image quality. To our knowledge, this represents the first demonstration of a language-guided native-3D diffusion model applied specifically to neurological imaging data, where faithful three-dimensional modeling is essential to represent the brain's three-dimensional structure. Through results on two distinct neurological MRI datasets, our framework successfully simulates varying counterfactual lesion loads in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and cognitive states in Alzheimer's disease, generating high-quality images while preserving subject fidelity in synthetically generated medical images. Our results lay the groundwork for prompt-driven disease progression analysis within 3D medical imaging.</description>

      <title>FASL-Seg: Anatomy and Tool Segmentation of Surgical Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing popularity of robotic minimally invasive surgeries has made deep learning-based surgical training a key area of research. A thorough understanding of the surgical scene components is crucial, which semantic segmentation models can help achieve. However, most existing work focuses on surgical tools and overlooks anatomical objects. Additionally, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models struggle to balance capturing high-level contextual features and low-level edge features. We propose a Feature-Adaptive Spatial Localization model (FASL-Seg), designed to capture features at multiple levels of detail through two distinct processing streams, namely a Low-Level Feature Projection (LLFP) and a High-Level Feature Projection (HLFP) stream, for varying feature resolutions - enabling precise segmentation of anatomy and surgical instruments. We evaluated FASL-Seg on surgical segmentation benchmark datasets EndoVis18 and EndoVis17 on three use cases. The FASL-Seg model achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 72.71% on parts and anatomy segmentation in EndoVis18, improving on SOTA by 5%. It further achieves a mIoU of 85.61% and 72.78% in EndoVis18 and EndoVis17 tool type segmentation, respectively, outperforming SOTA overall performance, with comparable per-class SOTA results in both datasets and consistent performance in various classes for anatomy and instruments, demonstrating the effectiveness of distinct processing streams for varying feature resolutions.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Information Divergence for Robust Semi-Supervised Fetal Ultrasound Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maternal-fetal Ultrasound is the primary modality for monitoring fetal development, yet automated segmentation remains challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality annotations. To address this limitation, we propose a semi-supervised learning framework that leverages information divergence for robust fetal ultrasound segmentation. Our method employs a lightweight convolutional network (1.47M parameters) and a Transformer-based network, trained jointly with labelled data through standard supervision and with unlabelled data via cross-supervision. To encourage consistent and confident predictions, we introduce an information divergence loss that combines per-pixel Kullback-Leibler divergence and Mutual Information Gap, effectively reducing prediction disagreement between the two models. In addition, we apply mixup on unlabelled samples to further enhance robustness. Experiments on two fetal ultrasound datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods. When only 5% of training data is labelled, our framework improves the Dice score by 2.39%, reduces the 95% Hausdorff distance by 14.90, and decreases the Average Surface Distance by 4.18. These results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging information divergence for annotation-efficient and robust medical image segmentation. Our code is publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Impact of Labeling Inaccuracy and Image Noise on Tooth Segmentation in Panoramic Radiographs using Federated, Centralized and Local Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objectives: Federated learning (FL) may mitigate privacy constraints, heterogeneous data quality, and inconsistent labeling in dental diagnostic AI. We compared FL with centralized (CL) and local learning (LL) for tooth segmentation in panoramic radiographs across multiple data corruption scenarios. Methods: An Attention U-Net was trained on 2066 radiographs from six institutions across four settings: baseline (unaltered data); label manipulation (dilated/missing annotations); image-quality manipulation (additive Gaussian noise); and exclusion of a faulty client with corrupted data. FL was implemented via the Flower AI framework. Per-client training- and validation-loss trajectories were monitored for anomaly detection and a set of metrics (Dice, IoU, HD, HD95 and ASSD) was evaluated on a hold-out test set. From these metrics significance results were reported through Wilcoxon signed-rank test. CL and LL served as comparators. Results: Baseline: FL achieved a median Dice of 0.94889 (ASSD: 1.33229), slightly better than CL at 0.94706 (ASSD: 1.37074) and LL at 0.93557-0.94026 (ASSD: 1.51910-1.69777). Label manipulation: FL maintained the best median Dice score at 0.94884 (ASSD: 1.46487) versus CL's 0.94183 (ASSD: 1.75738) and LL's 0.93003-0.94026 (ASSD: 1.51910-2.11462). Image noise: FL led with Dice at 0.94853 (ASSD: 1.31088); CL scored 0.94787 (ASSD: 1.36131); LL ranged from 0.93179-0.94026 (ASSD: 1.51910-1.77350). Faulty-client exclusion: FL reached Dice at 0.94790 (ASSD: 1.33113) better than CL's 0.94550 (ASSD: 1.39318). Loss-curve monitoring reliably flagged the corrupted site. Conclusions: FL matches or exceeds CL and outperforms LL across corruption scenarios while preserving privacy. Per-client loss trajectories provide an effective anomaly-detection mechanism and support FL as a practical, privacy-preserving approach for scalable clinical AI deployment.</description>

      <title>Robustness and accuracy of mean opinion scores with hard and soft outlier detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In subjective assessment of image and video quality, observers rate or compare selected stimuli. Before calculating the mean opinion scores (MOS) for these stimuli from the ratings, it is recommended to identify and deal with outliers that may have given unreliable ratings. Several methods are available for this purpose, some of which have been standardized. These methods are typically based on statistics and sometimes tested by introducing synthetic ratings from artificial outliers, such as random clickers. However, a reliable and comprehensive approach is lacking for comparative performance analysis of outlier detection methods. To fill this gap, this work proposes and applies an empirical worst-case analysis as a general solution. Our method involves evolutionary optimization of an adversarial black-box attack on outlier detection algorithms, where the adversary maximizes the distortion of scale values with respect to ground truth. We apply our analysis to several hard and soft outlier detection methods for absolute category ratings and show their differing performance in this stress test. In addition, we propose two new outlier detection methods with low complexity and excellent worst-case performance. Software for adversarial attacks and data analysis is available.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Anatomy-Contrast Disentanglement: A Domain-General MRI Harmonization Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an invaluable tool for clinical and research applications. Yet, variations in scanners and acquisition parameters cause inconsistencies in image contrast, hindering data comparability and reproducibility across datasets and clinical studies. Existing scanner harmonization methods, designed to address this challenge, face limitations, such as requiring traveling subjects or struggling to generalize to unseen domains. We propose a novel approach using a conditioned diffusion autoencoder with a contrastive loss and domain-agnostic contrast augmentation to harmonize MR images across scanners while preserving subject-specific anatomy. Our method enables brain MRI synthesis from a single reference image. It outperforms baseline techniques, achieving a +7% PSNR improvement on a traveling subjects dataset and +18% improvement on age regression in unseen. Our model provides robust, effective harmonization of brain MRIs to target scanners without requiring fine-tuning. This advancement promises to enhance comparability, reproducibility, and generalizability in multi-site and longitudinal clinical studies, ultimately contributing to improved healthcare outcomes.</description>

      <title>MM-DINOv2: Adapting Foundation Models for Multi-Modal Medical Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision foundation models like DINOv2 demonstrate remarkable potential in medical imaging despite their origin in natural image domains. However, their design inherently works best for uni-modal image analysis, limiting their effectiveness for multi-modal imaging tasks that are common in many medical fields, such as neurology and oncology. While supervised models perform well in this setting, they fail to leverage unlabeled datasets and struggle with missing modalities, a frequent challenge in clinical settings. To bridge these gaps, we introduce MM-DINOv2, a novel and efficient framework that adapts the pre-trained vision foundation model DINOv2 for multi-modal medical imaging. Our approach incorporates multi-modal patch embeddings, enabling vision foundation models to effectively process multi-modal imaging data. To address missing modalities, we employ full-modality masking, which encourages the model to learn robust cross-modality relationships. Furthermore, we leverage semi-supervised learning to harness large unlabeled datasets, enhancing both the accuracy and reliability of medical predictions. Applied to glioma subtype classification from multi-sequence brain MRI, our method achieves a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.6 on an external test set, surpassing state-of-the-art supervised approaches by +11.1%. Our work establishes a scalable and robust solution for multi-modal medical imaging tasks, leveraging powerful vision foundation models pre-trained on natural images while addressing real-world clinical challenges such as missing data and limited annotations.</description>

      <title>LocoMamba: Vision-Driven Locomotion via End-to-End Deep Reinforcement Learning with Mamba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11849v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce LocoMamba, a vision-driven cross-modal DRL framework built on selective state-space models, specifically leveraging Mamba, that achieves near-linear-time sequence modeling, effectively captures long-range dependencies, and enables efficient training with longer sequences. First, we embed proprioceptive states with a multilayer perceptron and patchify depth images with a lightweight convolutional neural network, producing compact tokens that improve state representation. Second, stacked Mamba layers fuse these tokens via near-linear-time selective scanning, reducing latency and memory footprint, remaining robust to token length and image resolution, and providing an inductive bias that mitigates overfitting. Third, we train the policy end-to-end with Proximal Policy Optimization under terrain and appearance randomization and an obstacle-density curriculum, using a compact state-centric reward that balances progress, smoothness, and safety. We evaluate our method in challenging simulated environments with static and moving obstacles as well as uneven terrain. Compared with state-of-the-art baselines, our method achieves higher returns and success rates with fewer collisions, exhibits stronger generalization to unseen terrains and obstacle densities, and improves training efficiency by converging in fewer updates under the same compute budget.</description>

      <title>Hybrid-illumination multiplexed Fourier ptychographic microscopy with robust aberration correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM) is a powerful computational imaging modality that achieves high space-bandwidth product imaging for biomedical samples. However, its adoption is limited by slow data acquisition due to the need for sequential measurements. Multiplexed FPM strategies have been proposed to accelerate imaging by activating multiple LEDs simultaneously, but they typically require careful parameter tuning, and their lack of effective aberration correction makes them prone to image degradation. To address these limitations, we introduce hybrid-illumination multiplexed Fourier ptychographic microscopy (HMFPM), which integrates analytic aberration extraction capability with the efficiency of multiplexed illumination. Specifically, HMFPM employs a hybrid illumination strategy and a customized reconstruction algorithm with analytic and optimization methods. This hybrid strategy substantially reduces the number of required measurements while ensuring robust aberration correction and stable convergence. We demonstrate that HMFPM achieves 1.08 micrometers resolution, representing a 4-fold enhancement over the system's coherent diffraction limit, across a 1.77x1.77 millimeter square field of view using 20 measurements. HMFPM remains robust under diverse aberrations, providing up to 84 micrometers digital refocusing capability, and effectively corrects both field-dependent and scanning-induced aberrations in whole-slide pathology imaging. These results establish HMFPM as a practical, high-throughput, and aberration-free solution for biological and biomedical imaging.</description>

      <title>Near Real-Time Dust Aerosol Detection with 3D Convolutional Neural Networks on MODIS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dust storms harm health and reduce visibility; quick detection from satellites is needed. We present a near real-time system that flags dust at the pixel level using multi-band images from NASA's Terra and Aqua (MODIS). A 3D convolutional network learns patterns across all 36 bands, plus split thermal bands, to separate dust from clouds and surface features. Simple normalization and local filling handle missing data. An improved version raises training speed by 21x and supports fast processing of full scenes. On 17 independent MODIS scenes, the model reaches about 0.92 accuracy with a mean squared error of 0.014. Maps show strong agreement in plume cores, with most misses along edges. These results show that joint band-and-space learning can provide timely dust alerts at global scale; using wider input windows or attention-based models may further sharpen edges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the ISRGC-Q Challenge, built upon the Image Super-Resolution Generated Content Quality Assessment (ISRGen-QA) dataset, and organized as part of the Visual Quality Assessment (VQualA) Competition at the ICCV 2025 Workshops. Unlike existing Super-Resolution Image Quality Assessment (SR-IQA) datasets, ISRGen-QA places a greater emphasis on SR images generated by the latest generative approaches, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models. The primary goal of this challenge is to analyze the unique artifacts introduced by modern super-resolution techniques and to evaluate their perceptual quality effectively. A total of 108 participants registered for the challenge, with 4 teams submitting valid solutions and fact sheets for the final testing phase. These submissions demonstrated state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the ISRGen-QA dataset. The project is publicly available at: https://github.com/Lighting-YXLI/ISRGen-QA.</description>

      <title>Perception-oriented Bidirectional Attention Network for Image Super-resolution Quality Assessment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many super-resolution (SR) algorithms have been proposed to increase image resolution. However, full-reference (FR) image quality assessment (IQA) metrics for comparing and evaluating different SR algorithms are limited. In this work, we propose the Perception-oriented Bidirectional Attention Network (PBAN) for image SR FR-IQA, which is composed of three modules: an image encoder module, a perception-oriented bidirectional attention (PBA) module, and a quality prediction module. First, we encode the input images for feature representations. Inspired by the characteristics of the human visual system, we then construct the perception-oriented PBA module. Specifically, different from existing attention-based SR IQA methods, we conceive a Bidirectional Attention to bidirectionally construct visual attention to distortion, which is consistent with the generation and evaluation processes of SR images. To further guide the quality assessment towards the perception of distorted information, we propose Grouped Multi-scale Deformable Convolution, enabling the proposed method to adaptively perceive distortion. Moreover, we design Sub-information Excitation Convolution to direct visual perception to both sub-pixel and sub-channel attention. Finally, the quality prediction module is exploited to integrate quality-aware features and regress quality scores. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed PBAN outperforms state-of-the-art quality assessment methods.</description>

      <title>Integrating Spatial and Semantic Embeddings for Stereo Sound Event Localization in Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we address the multimodal task of stereo sound event localization and detection with source distance estimation (3D SELD) in regular video content. 3D SELD is a complex task that combines temporal event classification with spatial localization, requiring reasoning across spatial, temporal, and semantic dimensions. The last is arguably the most challenging to model. Traditional SELD approaches typically rely on multichannel input, limiting their capacity to benefit from large-scale pre-training due to data constraints. To overcome this, we enhance a standard SELD architecture with semantic information by integrating pre-trained, contrastive language-aligned models: CLAP for audio and OWL-ViT for visual inputs. These embeddings are incorporated into a modified Conformer module tailored for multimodal fusion, which we refer to as the Cross-Modal Conformer. We perform an ablation study on the development set of the DCASE2025 Task3 Stereo SELD Dataset to assess the individual contributions of the language-aligned models and benchmark against the DCASE Task 3 baseline systems. Additionally, we detail the curation process of large synthetic audio and audio-visual datasets used for model pre-training. These datasets were further expanded through left-right channel swapping augmentation. Our approach, combining extensive pre-training, model ensembling, and visual post-processing, achieved second rank in the DCASE 2025 Challenge Task 3 (Track B), underscoring the effectiveness of our method. Future work will explore the modality-specific contributions and architectural refinements.</description>

      <title>Intraoperative 2D/3D Registration via Spherical Similarity Learning and Inference-Time Differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intraoperative 2D/3D registration aligns preoperative 3D volumes with real-time 2D radiographs, enabling accurate localization of instruments and implants. A recent fully differentiable similarity learning framework approximates geodesic distances on SE(3), expanding the capture range of registration and mitigating the effects of substantial disturbances, but existing Euclidean approximations distort manifold structure and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we explore similarity learning in non-Euclidean spherical feature spaces to better capture and fit complex manifold structure. We extract feature embeddings using a CNN-Transformer encoder, project them into spherical space, and approximate their geodesic distances with Riemannian distances in the bi-invariant SO(4) space. This enables a more expressive and geometrically consistent deep similarity metric, enhancing the ability to distinguish subtle pose differences. During inference, we replace gradient descent with fully differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt optimization to accelerate convergence. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show superior accuracy in both patient-specific and patient-agnostic scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While deep learning holds great promise for disease diagnosis and prognosis in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, its progress is often constrained by highly imbalanced and biased training datasets. To address this issue, we propose a method to alleviate imbalances inherent in datasets through the generation of synthetic data based on sensitive attributes such as sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and health condition. We adopt ControlNet based on a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to condition on text assembled from patient metadata and cardiac geometry derived from segmentation masks. We assess our method using a large-cohort study from the UK Biobank by evaluating the realism of the generated images using established quantitative metrics. Furthermore, we conduct a downstream classification task aimed at debiasing a classifier by rectifying imbalances within underrepresented groups through synthetically generated samples. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in mitigating dataset imbalances, such as the scarcity of diagnosed female patients or individuals with normal BMI level suffering from heart failure. This work represents a major step towards the adoption of synthetic data for the development of fair and generalizable models for medical classification tasks. Notably, we conduct all our experiments using a single, consumer-level GPU to highlight the feasibility of our approach within resource-constrained environments. Our code is available at https://github.com/faildeny/debiasing-cardiac-mri.</description>

Abstract: Objectives: To present a publicly available deep learning-based torso segmentation model that provides comprehensive voxel-wise coverage, including delineations that extend to the boundaries of anatomical compartments. Materials and Methods: We extracted preliminary segmentations from TotalSegmentator, spine, and body composition models for Magnetic Resonance Tomography (MR) images, then improved them iteratively and retrained an nnUNet model. Using a random retrospective subset of German National Cohort (NAKO), UK Biobank, internal MR and Computed Tomography (CT) data (Training: 2897 series from 626 subjects, 290 female; mean age 53+-16; 3-fold-cross validation (20% hold-out). Internal testing 36 series from 12 subjects, 6 male; mean age 60+-11), we segmented 71 structures in torso MR and 72 in CT images: 20 organs, 10 muscles, 19 vessels, 16 bones, ribs in CT, intervertebral discs, spinal cord, spinal canal and body composition (subcutaneous fat, unclassified muscles and visceral fat). For external validation, we used existing automatic organ segmentations, independent ground truth segmentations on gradient echo images, and the Amos data. We used non-parametric bootstrapping for confidence intervals and Wilcoxon rank-sum test for computing statistical significance. Results: We achieved an average Dice score of 0.90+-0.06 on our internal gradient echo test set, which included 71 semantic segmentation labels. Our model ties with the best model on Amos with a Dice of 0,81+-0.14, while having a larger field of view and a considerably higher number structures included. Conclusion: Our work presents a publicly available full-torso segmentation model for MRI and CT images that classifies almost all subject voxels to date.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04290v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pneumonia, a prevalent respiratory infection, remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly among vulnerable populations. Chest X-rays serve as a primary tool for pneumonia detection; however, variations in imaging conditions and subtle visual indicators complicate consistent interpretation. Automated tools can enhance traditional methods by improving diagnostic reliability and supporting clinical decision-making. In this study, we propose a novel multi-scale transformer approach for pneumonia detection that integrates lung segmentation and classification into a unified framework. Our method introduces a lightweight transformer-enhanced TransUNet for precise lung segmentation, achieving a Dice score of 95.68% on the "Chest X-ray Masks and Labels" dataset with fewer parameters than traditional transformers. For classification, we employ pre-trained ResNet models (ResNet-50 and ResNet-101) to extract multi-scale feature maps, which are then processed through a modified transformer module to enhance pneumonia detection. This integration of multi-scale feature extraction and lightweight transformer modules ensures robust performance, making our method suitable for resource-constrained clinical environments. Our approach achieves 93.75% accuracy on the "Kermany" dataset and 96.04% accuracy on the "Cohen" dataset, outperforming existing methods while maintaining computational efficiency. This work demonstrates the potential of multi-scale transformer architectures to improve pneumonia diagnosis, offering a scalable and accurate solution to global healthcare challenges. https://github.com/amirrezafateh/Multi-Scale-Transformer-Pneumonia</description>

      <title>NeuroBOLT: Resting-state EEG-to-fMRI Synthesis with Multi-dimensional Feature Mapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05341v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an indispensable tool in modern neuroscience, providing a non-invasive window into whole-brain dynamics at millimeter-scale spatial resolution. However, fMRI is constrained by issues such as high operation costs and immobility. With the rapid advancements in cross-modality synthesis and brain decoding, the use of deep neural networks has emerged as a promising solution for inferring whole-brain, high-resolution fMRI features directly from electroencephalography (EEG), a more widely accessible and portable neuroimaging modality. Nonetheless, the complex projection from neural activity to fMRI hemodynamic responses and the spatial ambiguity of EEG pose substantial challenges both in modeling and interpretability. Relatively few studies to date have developed approaches for EEG-fMRI translation, and although they have made significant strides, the inference of fMRI signals in a given study has been limited to a small set of brain areas and to a single condition (i.e., either resting-state or a specific task). The capability to predict fMRI signals in other brain areas, as well as to generalize across conditions, remain critical gaps in the field. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel and generalizable framework: NeuroBOLT, i.e., Neuro-to-BOLD Transformer, which leverages multi-dimensional representation learning from temporal, spatial, and spectral domains to translate raw EEG data to the corresponding fMRI activity signals across the brain. Our experiments demonstrate that NeuroBOLT effectively reconstructs unseen resting-state fMRI signals from primary sensory, high-level cognitive areas, and deep subcortical brain regions, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with the potential to generalize across varying conditions and sites, which significantly advances the integration of these two modalities.</description>

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) offers a promising solution for non-contact driver monitoring by detecting subtle blood flow-induced facial color changes from video. However, motion artifacts in dynamic driving environments remain key challenges. This study presents an rPPG framework that combines signal processing techniques before and after applying Eulerian Video Magnification (EVM) for pulse rate (PR) estimation in driving simulators. While not novel, the approach offers insights into the efficiency of the EVM method and its time complexity. We compare results of the proposed rPPG approach against reference Empatica E4 data and also compare it with existing achievements from the literature. Additionally, the possible bias of the Empatica E4 is further assessed using an independent dataset with both the Empatica E4 and the Faros 360 measurements. EVM slightly improves PR estimation, reducing the mean absolute error (MAE) from 6.48 bpm to 5.04 bpm (the lowest MAE (~2 bpm) was achieved under strict conditions) with an additional time required for EVM of about 20 s for 30 s sequence. Furthermore, statistically significant differences are identified between younger and older drivers in both reference and rPPG data. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using rPPG-based PR monitoring, encouraging further research in driving simulations.</description>

Abstract: Potential contrast is typically used as an image quality measure and quantifies the maximal possible contrast between samples from two classes of pixels in an image after an arbitrary grayscale transformation. It has been applied in cultural heritage to evaluate multispectral images using a small number of labeled pixels. In this work, we introduce a normalized version of potential contrast that removes dependence on image format and also prove equalities that enable generalization to more than two classes and to continuous settings. Finally, we exemplify the utility of multi-class normalized potential contrast through an application to a medieval music manuscript with visible bleedthrough from the back of the page. We share our implementations, based on both original algorithms and our new equalities, including generalization to multiple classes, at https://github.com/wallacepeaslee/Multiple-Class-Normalized-Potential-Contrast.</description>

Abstract: Content generation modeling has emerged as a promising direction in computational pathology, offering capabilities such as data-efficient learning, synthetic data augmentation, and task-oriented generation across diverse diagnostic tasks. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of recent progress in the field, organized into four key domains: image generation, text generation, molecular profile-morphology generation, and other specialized generation applications. By analyzing over 150 representative studies, we trace the evolution of content generation architectures -- from early generative adversarial networks to recent advances in diffusion models and generative vision-language models. We further examine the datasets and evaluation protocols commonly used in this domain and highlight ongoing limitations, including challenges in generating high-fidelity whole slide images, clinical interpretability, and concerns related to the ethical and legal implications of synthetic data. The review concludes with a discussion of open challenges and prospective research directions, with an emphasis on developing integrated and clinically deployable generation systems. This work aims to provide a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners developing content generation models in computational pathology.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Segmentation of Ventricles and Normal/Abnormal White Matter Hyperintensities in Clinical MRI using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07123</link>

Abstract: Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis and monitoring rely heavily on accurate assessment of brain MRI biomarkers, particularly white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) and ventricular changes. Current segmentation approaches suffer from several limitations: they typically segment these structures independently despite their pathophysiological relationship, struggle to differentiate between normal and pathological hyperintensities, and are poorly optimized for anisotropic clinical MRI data. We propose a novel 2D pix2pix-based deep learning framework for simultaneous segmentation of ventricles and WMHs with the unique capability to distinguish between normal periventricular hyperintensities and pathological MS lesions. Our method was developed and validated on FLAIR MRI scans from 300 MS patients. Compared to established methods (SynthSeg, Atlas Matching, BIANCA, LST-LPA, LST-LGA, and WMH-SynthSeg), our approach achieved superior performance for both ventricle segmentation (Dice: 0.801+/-0.025, HD95: 18.46+/-7.1mm) and WMH segmentation (Dice: 0.624+/-0.061, precision: 0.755+/-0.161). Furthermore, our method successfully differentiated between normal and abnormal hyperintensities with a Dice coefficient of 0.647. Notably, our approach demonstrated exceptional computational efficiency, completing end-to-end processing in approximately 4 seconds per case, up to 36 times faster than baseline methods, while maintaining minimal resource requirements. This combination of improved accuracy, clinically relevant differentiation capability, and computational efficiency addresses critical limitations in current neuroimaging analysis, potentially enabling integration into routine clinical workflows and enhancing MS diagnosis and monitoring.</description>

      <title>PRO: Projection Domain Synthesis for CT Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13443v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic CT projection data is crucial for advancing imaging research, yet its generation remains challenging. Current image domain methods are limited as they cannot simulate the physical acquisition process or utilize the complete statistical information present in projection data, restricting their utility and fidelity. In this work, we present PRO, a projection domain synthesis foundation model for CT imaging. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that performs CT synthesis in the projection domain. Unlike previous approaches that operate in the image domain, PRO learns rich structural representations from projection data and leverages anatomical text prompts for controllable synthesis. Projection data generation models can utilize complete measurement signals and simulate the physical processes of scanning, including material attenuation characteristics, beam hardening, scattering, and projection geometry, and support research on downstream imaging tasks. Moreover, PRO functions as a foundation model, capable of generalizing across diverse downstream tasks by adjusting its generative behavior via prompt inputs. Experimental results demonstrated that incorporating our synthesized data significantly improves performance across multiple downstream tasks, including low-dose and sparse-view reconstruction. These findings underscore the versatility and scalability of PRO in data generation for various CT applications. These results highlight the potential of projection domain synthesis as a powerful tool for data augmentation and robust CT imaging. Our source code is publicly available at: https://github.com/yqx7150/PRO.</description>

      <title>Identifying actionable driver mutations in lung cancer using an efficient Asymmetric Transformer Decoder</title>

Abstract: Identifying actionable driver mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can impact treatment decisions and significantly improve patient outcomes. Despite guideline recommendations, broader adoption of genetic testing remains challenging due to limited availability and lengthy turnaround times. Machine Learning (ML) methods for Computational Pathology (CPath) offer a potential solution; however, research often focuses on only one or two common mutations, limiting the clinical value of these tools and the pool of patients who can benefit from them. This study evaluates various Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) techniques to detect six key actionable NSCLC driver mutations: ALK, BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS, and MET ex14. Additionally, we introduce an Asymmetric Transformer Decoder model that employs queries and key-values of varying dimensions to maintain a low query dimensionality. This approach efficiently extracts information from patch embeddings and minimizes overfitting risks, proving highly adaptable to the MIL setting. Moreover, we present a method to directly utilize tissue type in the model, addressing a typical MIL limitation where either all regions or only some specific regions are analyzed, neglecting biological relevance. Our method outperforms top MIL models by an average of 3%, and over 4% when predicting rare mutations such as ERBB2 and BRAF, moving ML-based tests closer to being practical alternatives to standard genetic testing.</description>

      <title>Hessian-Based Lightweight Neural Network HessNet for State-of-the-Art Brain Vessel Segmentation on a Minimal Training Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of blood vessels in brain magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is essential for successful surgical procedures, such as aneurysm repair or bypass surgery. Currently, annotation is primarily performed through manual segmentation or classical methods, such as the Frangi filter, which often lack sufficient accuracy. Neural networks have emerged as powerful tools for medical image segmentation, but their development depends on well-annotated training datasets. However, there is a notable lack of publicly available MRA datasets with detailed brain vessel annotations. To address this gap, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning lightweight neural network with Hessian matrices on board for 3D segmentation of complex structures such as tubular structures, which we named HessNet. The solution is a Hessian-based neural network with only 6000 parameters. HessNet can run on the CPU and significantly reduces the resource requirements for training neural networks. The accuracy of vessel segmentation on a minimal training dataset reaches state-of-the-art results. It helps us create a large, semi-manually annotated brain vessel dataset of brain MRA images based on the IXI dataset (annotated 200 images). Annotation was performed by three experts under the supervision of three neurovascular surgeons after applying HessNet. It provides high accuracy of vessel segmentation and allows experts to focus only on the most complex important cases. The dataset is available at https://git.scinalytics.com/terilat/VesselDatasetPartly.</description>

      <title>Learn2Reg 2024: New Benchmark Datasets Driving Progress on New Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical image registration is critical for clinical applications, and fair benchmarking of different methods is essential for monitoring ongoing progress. To date, the Learn2Reg 2020-2023 challenges have released several complementary datasets and established metrics for evaluations. However, these editions did not capture all aspects of the registration problem, particularly in terms of modality diversity and task complexity. To address these limitations, the 2024 edition introduces three new tasks, including large-scale multi-modal registration and unsupervised inter-subject brain registration, as well as the first microscopy-focused benchmark within Learn2Reg. The new datasets also inspired new method developments, including invertibility constraints, pyramid features, keypoints alignment and instance optimisation.</description>

      <title>AURAD: Anatomy-Pathology Unified Radiology Synthesis with Progressive Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical image synthesis has become an essential strategy for augmenting datasets and improving model generalization in data-scarce clinical settings. However, fine-grained and controllable synthesis remains difficult due to limited high-quality annotations and domain shifts across datasets. Existing methods, often designed for natural images or well-defined tumors, struggle to generalize to chest radiographs, where disease patterns are morphologically diverse and tightly intertwined with anatomical structures. To address these challenges, we propose AURAD, a controllable radiology synthesis framework that jointly generates high-fidelity chest X-rays and pseudo semantic masks. Unlike prior approaches that rely on randomly sampled masks-limiting diversity, controllability, and clinical relevance-our method learns to generate masks that capture multi-pathology coexistence and anatomical-pathological consistency. It follows a progressive pipeline: pseudo masks are first generated from clinical prompts conditioned on anatomical structures, and then used to guide image synthesis. We also leverage pretrained expert medical models to filter outputs and ensure clinical plausibility. Beyond visual realism, the synthesized masks also serve as labels for downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation, bridging the gap between generative modeling and real-world clinical applications. Extensive experiments and blinded radiologist evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method across tasks and datasets. In particular, 78% of our synthesized images are classified as authentic by board-certified radiologists, and over 40% of predicted segmentation overlays are rated as clinically useful. All code, pre-trained models, and the synthesized dataset will be released upon publication.</description>

      <title>ADIR: Adaptive Diffusion for Image Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Denoising diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable success in image generation, capturing rich information about natural image statistics. This makes them highly promising for image reconstruction, where the goal is to recover a clean image from a degraded observation. In this work, we introduce a conditional sampling framework that leverages the powerful priors learned by diffusion models while enforcing consistency with the available measurements. To further adapt pre-trained diffusion models to the specific degradation at hand, we propose a novel fine-tuning strategy. In particular, we employ LoRA-based adaptation using images that are semantically and visually similar to the degraded input, efficiently retrieved from a large and diverse dataset via an off-the-shelf vision-language model. We evaluate our approach on two leading publicly available diffusion models--Stable Diffusion and Guided Diffusion--and demonstrate that our method, termed Adaptive Diffusion for Image Reconstruction (ADIR), yields substantial improvements across a range of image reconstruction tasks.</description>

      <title>QuadKAN: KAN-Enhanced Quadruped Motion Control via End-to-End Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address vision-guided quadruped motion control with reinforcement learning (RL) and highlight the necessity of combining proprioception with vision for robust control. We propose QuadKAN, a spline-parameterized cross-modal policy instantiated with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). The framework incorporates a spline encoder for proprioception and a spline fusion head for proprioception-vision inputs. This structured function class aligns the state-to-action mapping with the piecewise-smooth nature of gait, improving sample efficiency, reducing action jitter and energy consumption, and providing interpretable posture-action sensitivities. We adopt Multi-Modal Delay Randomization (MMDR) and perform end-to-end training with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Evaluations across diverse terrains, including both even and uneven surfaces and scenarios with static or dynamic obstacles, demonstrate that QuadKAN achieves consistently higher returns, greater distances, and fewer collisions than state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. These results show that spline-parameterized policies offer a simple, effective, and interpretable alternative for robust vision-guided locomotion. A repository will be made available upon acceptance.</description>
