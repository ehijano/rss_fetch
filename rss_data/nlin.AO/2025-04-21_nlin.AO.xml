      <title>Dynamics of pulsating swarmalators on a ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a simple one-dimensional model of swarmalators, a generalization of phase oscillators that swarm around in space as well as synchronize internal oscillations in time. Previous studies of the model focused on Kuramoto-type couplings, where the phase interactions are governed by phase differences. Here we consider Winfree-type coupling, where the interactions are multiplicative, determined by the product of a phase response function $R(\theta)$ and phase pulse function $P(\theta)$. This more general interaction (from which the Kuramoto phase differences emerge after averaging) produces rich physics: six long-term modes of organization are found, which we characterize numerically and analytically.</description>

      <title>Collision Induced Binding and Transport of Shape Changing Robot Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report in experiment and simulation the spontaneous formation of dynamically bound pairs of shape changing robots undergoing locally repulsive collisions. These physical `gliders' robustly emerge from an ensemble of individually undulating three-link two-motor robots and can remain bound for hundreds of undulations and travel for multiple robot dimensions. Gliders occur in two distinct binding symmetries and form over a wide range of angular oscillation extent. This parameter sets the maximal concavity which influences formation probability and translation characteristics. Analysis of dynamics in simulation reveals the mechanism of effective dynamical attraction -- a result of the emergent interplay of appropriately oriented and timed repulsive interactions. Tactile sensing stabilizes the short-lived conformation via concavity modulation.</description>

      <title>Positive and negative DC glow discharges: a comparative study to characterize self-organized patterns on water surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-organized patterns (SOP) in plasma discharges arise from the complex interplay of electric field, reactive species and charged particles, driven by non-linear plasma dynamics. While studies have explored SOP formation in various configurations, no systematic comparison of positive and negative DC glow discharges has been conducted to explain why SOP form exclusively when polarization is negative. This study aims to analyze SOP formation mechanisms by comparing electrical, optical and spectral properties of positive and negative DC glow discharges interacting with a grounded water surface. Key differences in gas temperature, electric field and reactive species distribution are hence identified. For positive DC glow discharges (PGD), the gas temperature remains in the 350-370 K range, while the reduced electric field remains below 100 Td across the gap. The plasma is dominated by OH and N2* species, whose excitation results from direct electron impact and energy transfer in a low-field environment. The absence of strong ionization and electric field gradients leads to a spatially homogeneous emission layer on the liquid surface, resulting in a circular uniform plasma (CUP) pattern without self-organization. In contrast, SOP emerge exclusively under negative DC glow discharges (NGD) at currents above 15 mA. These discharges present a reduced electric field, peaking at 485 Td at 1mm from the cathode pin, dropping below 100 Td in the central gap and rising to 460 Td near the water surface. There, the plasma layer still contains OH and N2* species but also N2+ ions, the latter being critical for SOP formation. SOP morphology evolves with gap size: at 7 mm, patterns transition from specks to filaments, with pattern diameter and thickness as high as 5.5 mm and 210 {\mu}m respectively. Lowering water surface tension with surfactants reduces SOP size and modifies pattern morphology.</description>

      <title>The universality of filamentation-caused challenges of ultrafast laser energy deposition in semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light propagation in semiconductors is the cornerstone of emerging disruptive technologies holding considerable potential to revolutionize telecommunications, sensors, quantum engineering, healthcare, and artificial intelligence. Sky-high optical nonlinearities make these materials ideal platforms for photonic integrated circuits. The fabrication of such complex devices could greatly benefit from in-volume ultrafast laser writing for monolithic and contactless integration. Ironically, as exemplified for Si, nonlinearities act as an efficient immune system self-protecting the material from internal permanent modifications that ultrashort laser pulses could potentially produce. While nonlinear propagation of high-intensity ultrashort laser pulses has been extensively investigated in Si, other semiconductors remain uncharted. In this work, we demonstrate that filamentation universally dictates ultrashort laser pulse propagation in various semiconductors. The effective key nonlinear parameters obtained strongly differ from standard measurements with low-intensity pulses. Furthermore, the temporal scaling laws for these key parameters are extracted. Temporal-spectral shaping is finally proposed to optimize energy deposition inside semiconductors. The whole set of results lays the foundations for future improvements, up to the point where semiconductors can be selectively tailored internally by ultrafast laser writing, thus leading to countless applications for in-chip processing and functionalization, and opening new markets in various sectors including technology, photonics, and semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Maximum Entropy Production Principle of Thermodynamics for the Birth and Evolution of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on the birth and evolution of life are reviewed with reference to the maximum entropy production principle (MEPP). It has been shown that this principle is essential for consistent understanding of the birth and evolution of life. First, a recent work for the birth of a self-replicative system as pre-RNA life is reviewed in relation to the MEPP. A critical condition of polymer concentration in a local system is reported by a dynamical system approach, above which, an exponential increase of entropy production is guaranteed. Secondly, research works of early stage of evolutions are reviewed; experimental research for the numbers of cells necessary for forming a multi-cellular organization, and numerical research of differentiation of a model system and its relation with MEPP. It is suggested by this review article that the late stage of evolution is characterized by formation of society and external entropy production. A hypothesis on the general route of evolution is discussed from the birth to the present life which follows the MEPP. Some examples of life which happened to face poor thermodynamic condition are presented with thermodynamic discussion. It is observed through this review that MEPP is consistently useful for thermodynamic understanding of birth and evolution of life, subject to a thermodynamic condition far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Beyond classical Hamilton's Rule. State distribution asymmetry and the dynamics of altruism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00518</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.00518v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the relationships between demographic and state-based evolutionary games and Hamilton's rule. It is shown that the classical Hamilton's rule (counterfactual method), combined with demographic payoffs, leads to easily testable models. It works well when the roles of donor and receiver are randomly drawn during each interaction event. This is illustrated by the alarm call example. However, we can imagine situations in which role-switching results from external mechanism, such as, fluxes of individuals between the border and the interior of the habitat, when only border individuals may spot the threat and warn their neighbors. To cover these cases, a new model is extended to the case with explicit dynamics of the role distributions among carriers of different strategies, driven by some general mechanisms. It is shown that even in the case when fluxes between roles are driven by neutral mechanisms (acting in the same way on all strategies), differences in mortality in the focal interaction lead to different distributions of roles for different strategies. This leads to a more complex rule for cooperation than the classical Hamilton's rule. In addition to the cost and benefit components, the new rule contains a third component weighted by the difference in proportions of the donors among carriers of both strategies. Depending on the sign, this component can be termed the "survival surplus", when the donors survival have greater survival than receivers, or the "sacrifice cost" (when it decreases the benefit), when the receiver's survival exceeds that of the helping donor. When we allow different role-switching rates for different strategies, cooperators can win even in the case when the assortment mechanism is inefficient (i.e., the probability of receiving help for noncooperators is slightly greater than for cooperators), which is impossible in classical Hamilton's rule.</description>

      <title>EEG relative phase-based analysis unveils the complexity and universality of human brain dynamics: integrative insights from general anesthesia and ADHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19924v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding brain wave patterns is fundamental to uncovering neural information processing mechanisms, making quantifying complexity across brain states an important line of investigation. We present a comprehensive analysis of the complexity of electroencephalography (EEG) signals, integrating data from seven distinct states experienced by participants undergoing general anesthesia, and resting-state recordings from individuals with inattentive-type ADHD alongside healthy control groups. Departing from prior studies that primarily focus on EEG amplitude dynamics, we adopt a novel relative phase approach to extract patterns of information flow directionality based on EEG phase dynamics. We quantify the complexity of these relative phase directionality patterns across various states using permutation entropy (PE) and statistical complexity measure within ordinal pattern framework. Our analysis: (i) PE is inversely correlated with the level of consciousness during general anesthesia, reflecting a dynamic interplay between anesthetic depth and shifts in directional information flow; (ii) healthy subjects consistently show higher PE than inADHD participants; (iii) when mapped onto the complexity-entropy causality plane, all brain states, regardless of condition or individual differences, align along a single curve, suggesting an underlying universal pattern in brain dynamics; and (iv) brain data consistently exhibit higher complexity than standard stochastic processes, likely due to greater multifractal scaling. These findings highlight that neural information propagation, as captured by EEG relative phase dynamics, is governed by self-organizing principles that are fundamentally more complex than the stochastic processes. Our EEG relative phase-based characterization provides new insight into the complexity of neural information flow directionality.</description>
