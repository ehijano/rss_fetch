      <title>Symmetric Cartan calculus, the Patterson-Walker metric and symmetric cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop symmetric Cartan calculus, an analogue of classical Cartan calculus for symmetric differential forms. We first show that the analogue of the exterior derivative, the symmetric derivative, is not unique and its different choices are parametrized by torsion-free affine connections. We use a choice of symmetric derivative to generate the symmetric bracket and the symmetric Lie derivative, and give geometric interpretations of all of them. By proving the structural identities and describing the role of affine morphisms, we reveal an unexpected link of symmetric Cartan calculus with the Patterson-Walker metric, which we recast as a direct analogue of the canonical symplectic form on the cotangent bundle. We show that, in the light of the Patterson-Walker metric, symmetric Cartan calculus becomes a complete analogue of classical Cartan calculus. As an application of this new framework, we introduce symmetric cohomology, which involves Killing tensors, or, in the case of the Levi-Civita connection, Killing vector fields. We finish by characterizing the round connection of $\mathrm{S}^1$ in terms of symmetric cohomology.</description>

      <title>On the Uniqueness of Certain Types of Circle Packings on Translation Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a collection of finitely many polygons in $\mathbb C$, such that for each side of each polygon, there exists another side of some polygon in the collection (possibly the same) that is parallel and of equal length. A translation surface is the surface formed by identifying these opposite sides with one another. The $H(1, 1)$ stratum consists of genus two translation surfaces with two singularities of order one. A circle packing corresponding to a graph $G$ is a configuration of disjoint disks such that each vertex of $G$ corresponds to a circle, two disks are externally tangent if and only if their vertices are connected by an edge in $G$, and $G$ is a triangulation of the surface. It is proven that for certain circle packings on $H(1, 1)$ translation surfaces, there are only a finite number of ways the packing can vary without changing the contacts graph, if two disks along the slit are fixed in place. These variations can be explicitly characterized using a new concept known as splitting bigons. Finally, the uniqueness theorem is generalized to a specific type of translation surfaces with arbitrary genus $g \geq 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we treat minimal left-invariant unit vector fields on oscillator group and their relations with the ones that define a harmonic map. Particularly, if all structure constants of the oscillator group are equal to each other, then all unit left invariant vector fields that define a harmonic map into the unit tangent bundle with Sasaki metric are minimal.</description>

      <title>Deriving Perelman's Entropy from Colding's Monotonic Volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his groundbreaking work from 2002, Perelman introduced two fundamental monotonic quantities: the reduced volume and the entropy. While the reduced volume was motivated by the Bishop-Gromov volume comparison applied to a suitably constructed $N$-space, which becomes Ricci-flat as $N\rightarrow \infty$, Perelman did not provide a corresponding explanation for the origin of the entropy. In this article, we demonstrate that Perelman's entropy emerges as the limit of Colding's monotonic volume for harmonic functions on Ricci-flat manifolds, when appropriately applied to Perelman's $N$-space.</description>

Abstract: We present a new general construction of examples of mean curvature solitons on manifolds admitting a nowhere-vanishing Killing vector field. Using Riemannian submersion techniques, we reduce the problem from a PDE to an ODE. As an application, we obtain new examples of rotators in hyperbolic space.</description>

      <title>Volume preserving mean curvature flow of round surfaces in asymptotically flat spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the volume preserving mean curvature flow of a surface immersed in an asymptotically flat $3$-manifold modeling an isolated gravitating system in General Relativity. We show that, if the ambient manifold has positive ADM mass and the initial surface is round in a suitable sense, then the flow exists for all times and converges smoothly to a stable CMC surface. This extends to the asymptotically flat setting a classical result by Huisken-Yau (Invent. Math. 1996) and allows to construct a CMC foliation of the outer part of the manifold by an alternative approach to the ones by Nerz (Calc. Var. PDE, 2015) or by Eichmair-Koerber (J. Diff. Geometry, 2024).</description>

      <title>On Polyconvexity and Almgren Uniform Ellipticity With Respect to Polyhedral Test Pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study anisotropic geometric energy functionals defined on a class of k-dimensional surfaces in a Euclidean space. The classical notion of ellipticity, coming from Almgren, for such functionals is investigated. We extend a recent result of De Rosa, Lei, and Young and show that uniform ellipticity of an anisotropic energy functional with respect to real polyhedral chains implies uniform polyconvexity of the integrand.</description>

      <title>Double Disk Bundle Decompositions and Curvature Exclusions in Closed Four-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate closed smooth four-manifolds with a double disk bundle decomposition. We show that such manifolds cannot support a hyperbolic metric, a result which contrasts with the situation in dimension three. Additionally, under a further condition, we prove that these manifolds cannot admit a negatively curved metric. As an application, we derive that the existence of isoparametric functions and a hyperbolic metric on a closed four-manifold are mutually exclusive in a topological sense. This work provides new perspectives on the relationship between topology and geometry in four-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Integrable Birkhoff Billiards inside Cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most interesting problems in the theory of Birkhoff billiards is the problem of integrability. In all known examples of integrable billiards, the billiard tables are either conics, quadrics (closed ellipsoids as well as unclosed quadrics like paraboloids or cones), or specific configurations of conics or quadrics. This leads to the natural question: are there other integrable billiards? The Birkhoff conjecture states that if the billiard inside a convex, smooth, closed curve is integrable, then the curve is an ellipse or a circle.
  In this paper we study the Birkhoff billiard inside a cone in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We prove that the billiard always admits a first integral of degree two in the components of the velocity vector. Using this fact, we prove that every trajectory inside a $C^3$ convex cone has a finite number of reflections. Here, by $C^3$ convex cone, we mean a cone whose section with some hyperplane is a strictly convex closed $C^3$ submanifold of the hyperplane with nondegenerate second fundamental form. The main result of this paper is the following. We prove that the Birkhoff billiard inside a convex $C^3$ cone is integrable. This is the first example of an integrable billiard where the billiard table is neither a quadric nor composed of pieces of quadrics.</description>

      <title>Differential and other reductions of the self-dual conformal structure equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dispersionless integrable system we consider here was introduced to the literature rather recently, it is connected with the general local form of self-dual conformal structure (SDCS) for the signature (2,2). In integrability framework this system possesses a rich structure of reductions, including differential reductions. We will discuss several characteristic reductions for this system, using the Lax pair, hierarchy structure and the dressing scheme. We use reductions to construct solutions for the SDCS equations. One of our goals is to present type B SDCS system and consider its relations with the SDCS system.</description>

Abstract: A special class of symplectic manifolds is those satisfying the Hard Lefschetz condition. The algebraic property of $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb C)$-module gives a natural constraint on the Betti numbers. However, such a constraint is only necessary, and it is not so clear what condition on the Betti numbers is equivalent to the Hard Lefschetz condition. In this paper, we give an equivalent condition on the first Betti number for compact symplectic $4$-manifolds satisfying the Hard Lefschetz condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a complete classification of invariant generalised Killing spinors on three-dimensional Lie groups. We show that, in this context, the existence of a non-trivial invariant generalised Killing spinor implies that all invariant spinors are generalised Killing with the same endomorphism. Notably, this classification is independent of the choice of left-invariant metric. To illustrate the computational methods underlying this classification, we also provide the first known examples of homogeneous manifolds admitting invariant generalised Killing spinors with $n$ distinct eigenvalues for each $n &gt; 4$.</description>

      <title>Orbifold singularity formation along ancient and immortal Ricci flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In stark contrast to lower dimensions, we produce a plethora of ancient and immortal Ricci flows in real dimension $4$ with Einstein orbifolds as tangent flows at infinity. For instance, for any $k\in\mathbb{N}_0$, we obtain continuous families of non-isometric ancient Ricci flows on $\#k(\mathbb{S}^2\times \mathbb{S}^2)$ depending on a number of parameters growing linearly in $k$, and a family of half-PIC ancient Ricci flows on $\mathbb{CP}^2\#\mathbb{CP}^2$.
  The ancient/immortal dichotomy is determined by a notion of linear stability of orbifold singularities with respect to the expected way for them to appear along Ricci flow: by bubbling off Ricci-flat ALE metrics. We discuss the case of Ricci solitons orbifolds and motivate a conjecture that spherical and cylindrical solitons with orbifold singularities, which are unstable in our sense, should not appear along Ricci flow by bubbling off Ricci-flat ALE metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a compact surface $M$, consider the natural right action of the group of diffeomorphisms $\mathcal{D}(M)$ of $M$ on $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}(M,\mathbb{R})$ defined by the rule: $(f,h)\mapsto f\circ h$ for $f\in \mathcal{C}^{\infty}(M,\mathbb{R})$ and $h\in\mathcal{D}(M)$. Denote by $\mathcal{F}(M)$ the subset of $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}(M,\mathbb{R})$ consisting of function $f:M\to\mathbb{R}$ taking constant values on connected components of $\partial{M}$, having no critical points on $\partial{M}$, and such that at each of its critical points $z$ the function $f$ is $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$ equivalent to some homogenenous polynomial without multiple factors. In particular, $\mathcal{F}(M)$ contains all Morse maps. Let also $\mathcal{O}(f) = \{ f\circ h \mid h\in\mathcal{D}(M) \}$ be the orbit of $f$. Previously it was computed the algebraic structure of $\pi_1\mathcal{O}(f)$ for all $f\in\mathcal{F}(M)$, where $M$ is any orientable compact surface distinct from $2$-sphere.
  In the present paper we compute the group $\pi_0\mathcal{S}(f,\partial\mathbb{M})$, where $\mathbb{M}$ is a M\"obius band, and $\mathcal{S}(f,\partial\mathbb{M}) = \{ h\in\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{M}) \mid f\circ h = f, \ h|_{\partial \mathbb{M}} = \mathrm{id}_{\mathbb{M}}\}$ is the subgroup of the corresponding stabilizer of $f$ consisting of diffeomorphisms fixed on the boundary $\partial \mathbb{M}$. As a consequence we obtain an explicit algebraic description of $\pi_1\mathcal{O}(f)$ for all non-orientable surfaces distinct from Klein bottle and projective plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11315v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study rigidity aspects of Penrose's singularity theorem. Specifically, we aim to answer the following question: if a spacetime satisfies the hypotheses of Penrose's singularity theorem except with weakly trapped surfaces instead of trapped surfaces, then what can be said about the global spacetime structure if the spacetime is null geodesically complete? In this setting, we show that we obtain a foliation of MOTS which generate totally geodesic null hypersurfaces. Depending on our starting assumptions, we obtain either local or global rigidity results. We apply our arguments to cosmological spacetimes (i.e., spacetimes with compact Cauchy surfaces) and scenarios involving topological censorship.</description>

      <title>Boundary values of diffeomorphisms of simple polytopes, and controllability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Lie group of smooth diffeomorphisms Diff$(M)$ of a simple polytope $M$ in the euclidean space. Simple polytopes are special cases of manifolds with corners. The geometric setting allows to study in particular, the subgroup of face respecting diffeomorphisms and its Lie theoretic properties. We find a canonical Lie group structure for the quotient of the diffeomorphism by the subgroup Diff$^{\partial,id}(M)$ of maps that equal the identity on the boundary, turning the canonical quotient homomorphism Diff$(M)\rightarrow $Diff$(M)/$Diff$^{\partial,id}(M)$ into a smooth submersion. We also show that the identity component of the diffeomorphism group is generated by the exponential image, by proving general controllability results.</description>

      <title>Distributions in spaces with thick submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02864v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the construction of a theory of distributions (generalized functions) with a ``thick submanifold'', that is, a new theory of thick distributions on $\mathbb{R}^n$ whose domain contains a smooth submanifold on which the test functions may be singular. We define several operations, including ``thick partial derivatives'', and clarify their connection with their classical counterparts in Schwartz distribution theory. We also introduce and study a number of special thick distributions, including new thick delta functions, or more generally thick multilayer distributions along a submanifold.</description>

      <title>On the differential $K$-theory of moduli stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the connective differential $K$-theory and the differential cohomology of the moduli stack of principal $G$-bundles with connection. The results are formulated in terms of invariant polynomials and the representation ring of $G$. We use the homotopy theory of presheaves of spaces and presheaves of spectra to establish the results.</description>
