      <title>Unified Deep Learning Framework for Many-Body Quantum Chemistry via Green's Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum many-body methods provide a systematic route to computing electronic properties of molecules and materials, but high computational costs restrict their use in large-scale applications. Due to the complexity in many-electron wavefunctions, machine learning models capable of capturing fundamental many-body physics remain limited. Here, we present a deep learning framework targeting the many-body Green's function, which unifies predictions of electronic properties in ground and excited states, while offering deep physical insights into electron correlation effects. By learning the $GW$ or coupled-cluster self-energy from mean-field features, our graph neural network achieves competitive performance in predicting one- and two-particle excitations and quantities derivable from one-particle density matrix. We demonstrate its high data efficiency and good transferability across chemical species, system sizes, molecular conformations, and correlation strengths in bond breaking, through multiple molecular and nanomaterial benchmarks. This work opens up new opportunities for utilizing machine learning to solve many-electron problems.</description>

      <title>Functional Analytic Derivation and CP2K Implementation of the SCCS Model Based on the Solvent-Aware Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the self-consistent continuum solvation (SCCS) approach ($\textit{J. Chem. Phys.}$ 136, 064102 (2012)), the analytical expressions of the local solute-solvent interface functions determine the interface function and dielectric function values at a given real space position based solely on the electron density at that position, completely disregarding the surrounding electron density distribution. Therefore, the low electron density areas inside the solute will be identified by the algorithm as regions where implicit solvent exists, resulting in the emergence of non-physical implicit solvent regions within the solute and even potentially leading to the divergence catastrophe of Kohn-Sham SCF calculations. We present a new and efficient SCCS implementation based on the solvent-aware interface ($\textit{J. Chem. Theory Comput.}$ 15, 3, 1996-2009 (2019)) which addresses this issue by utilizing a solute-solvent interface function based on convolution of electron density in the CP2K software package, which is based on the mixed Gaussian and plane waves (GPW) approach. Starting with the foundational formulas of SCCS, we have rigorously and meticulously derived the contributions of the newly defined electrostatic energy to the Kohn-Sham potential and the analytical forces. This comprehensive derivation utilizes the updated versions of the solute-solvent interface function and the dielectric function, tailored to align with the specifics of the GPW implementation. Our implementation has been tested to successfully eliminate non-physical implicit solvent regions within the solute and achieve good SCF convergence, as demonstrated by test results for both bulk and surface models, namely liquid $H_2O$, titanium dioxide, and platinum.</description>

      <title>Numerical investigation of gravity effects on backdraft phenomena in an enclosure with varying geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigated numerically the backdraft phenomenon under different gravity conditions and 4 openings using Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) code. Four different opening geometries are studied under ten different gravity conditions. As demonstrated by an earlier study in our group, backdraft is established under different gravity conditions from 0.1 g to 1 g. The rate at which oxygen reaches an ignition block in the enclosure in the presence of the gravity current plays an important role in the onset of ignition, the subsequent backdraft formation, and the maximum pressure built inside the enclosure before the onset of backdraft. This role also explains why these effects are different under different openings. We observe that the gravity strength affects the ignition time and the onset of backdraft nonlinearly. Moreover, the smoke exiting the enclosure is a precursor for the onset of backdraft, albeit with a short warning, allowing people on the outside to take necessary precautions. The effect of backdraft in the form of heat flow and impact force at the exit is also studied. It is found that the effect of heat flow is more severe than that of impact force.</description>

      <title>Thermal spin-crossover and temperature-dependent zero-field splitting in magnetic nanographene chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanographene-based magnetism at interfaces offers an avenue to designer quantum materials towards novel phases of matter and atomic-scale applications. Key to spintronics applications at the nanoscale is bistable spin-crossover which however remains to be demonstrated in nanographenes. Here we show that antiaromatic 1,4-disubstituted pyrazine-embedded nanographene derivatives, which promote magnetism through oxidation to a non-aromatic radical are prototypical models for the study of carbon-based thermal spin-crossover. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy studies reveal symmetric spin excitation signals which evolve at Tc to a zero-energy peak, and are assigned to the transition of a S = 3/2 high-spin to a S = 1/2 low-spin state by density functional theory. At temperatures below and close to the spin-crossover Tc, the high-spin S= 3/2 excitations evidence pronouncedly different temperature-dependent excitation energies corresponding to a zero-field splitting in the Hubbard-Kanamori Hamiltonian. The discovery of thermal spin crossover and temperature-dependent zero-field splitting in carbon nanomaterials promises to accelerate quantum information, spintronics and thermometry at the atomic scale.</description>

      <title>Geometrical Perspective on Spin-Lattice Density-Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recently developed viewpoint on the fundamentals of density-functional theory for finite interacting spin-lattice systems that centers around the notion of degeneracy regions is presented. It allows for an entirely geometrical description of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem and v-representability. The phenomena receive exemplification by an Anderson impurity model and other small-lattice examples. The case of adiabatic change and the time-dependent setting are examined as well.</description>

      <title>A Large Encoder-Decoder Family of Foundation Models For Chemical Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale pre-training methodologies for chemical language models represent a breakthrough in cheminformatics. These methods excel in tasks such as property prediction and molecule generation by learning contextualized representations of input tokens through self-supervised learning on large unlabeled corpora. Typically, this involves pre-training on unlabeled data followed by fine-tuning on specific tasks, reducing dependence on annotated datasets and broadening chemical language representation understanding. This paper introduces a large encoder-decoder chemical foundation models pre-trained on a curated dataset of 91 million SMILES samples sourced from PubChem, which is equivalent to 4 billion of molecular tokens. The proposed foundation model supports different complex tasks, including quantum property prediction, and offer flexibility with two main variants (289M and $8\times289M$). Our experiments across multiple benchmark datasets validate the capacity of the proposed model in providing state-of-the-art results for different tasks. We also provide a preliminary assessment of the compositionality of the embedding space as a prerequisite for the reasoning tasks. We demonstrate that the produced latent space is separable compared to the state-of-the-art with few-shot learning capabilities.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Flow Network Framework for Chemistry Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce ChemBFN, a language model that handles chemistry tasks based on Bayesian flow networks working on discrete data. A new accuracy schedule is proposed to improve the sampling quality by significantly reducing the reconstruction loss. We show evidence that our method is appropriate for generating molecules with satisfied diversity even when a smaller number of sampling steps is used. A classifier-free guidance method is adapted for conditional generation. It is also worthwhile to point out that after generative training, our model can be fine-tuned on regression and classification tasks with the state-of-the-art performance, which opens the gate of building all-in-one models in a single module style. Our model has been open sourced at https://github.com/Augus1999/bayesian-flow-network-for-chemistry.</description>

      <title>Building spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chains with diaza-nanographenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and engineering the coupling of spins in nanomaterials is of central importance for designing novel devices. Graphene nanostructures with {\pi}-magnetism offer a chemically tunable platform to explore quantum magnetic interactions. However, realizing spin chains bearing controlled odd-even effects with suitable nanographene systems is challenging. Here, we demonstrate the successful on-surface synthesis of spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chains with parity-dependent magnetization based on antiaromatic diaza-hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene (diaza-HBC) units. Using distinct synthetic strategies, two types of spin chains with different terminals were synthesized, both exhibiting a robust odd-even effect on the spin coupling along the chain. Combined investigations using scanning tunneling microscopy, non-contact atomic force microscopy, density functional theory calculations, and quantum spin models confirmed the structures of the diaza-HBC chains and revealed their magnetic properties, which has an S = 1/2 spin per unit through electron donation from the diaza-HBC core to the Au(111) substrate. Gapped excitations were observed in even-numbered chains, while enhanced Kondo resonance emerged in odd-numbered units of odd-numbered chains due to the redistribution of the unpaired spin along the chain. Our findings provide an effective strategy to construct nanographene spin chains and unveil the odd-even effect in their magnetic properties, offering potential applications in nanoscale spintronics.</description>

      <title>Escape of an Active Ring from an Attractive Surface: Behaving Like a Self-Propelled Brownian Particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Escape of active agents from metastable states are of great current interest in statistical and biological physics. In this study, we find that a flexible active Brownian ring escapes from a flat attractive surface though two distinct mechanisms: Kramers-like thermal activation at large rotational diffusion coefficients, but with an effective temperature, and the first-passage process at small rotational diffusion coefficients. The escape time depends explicitly on the shape of potential barrier at large activity and small rotational diffusion coefficient. Moreover, when the propulsion force was biased along its contour, escape becomes more difficult and is primarily caused by thermal noise. Our findings highlight that, despite its intricate configuration, the active ring can be taken as an self-propelled Brownian particle when studying its escape from a smooth surface.</description>

      <title>Cartesian atomic cluster expansion for machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07472v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials are revolutionizing large-scale, accurate atomistic modelling in material science and chemistry. Many potentials use atomic cluster expansion or equivariant message passing frameworks. Such frameworks typically use spherical harmonics as angular basis functions, and then use Clebsch-Gordan contraction to maintain rotational symmetry, which may introduce redundancies in representations and computational overhead. We propose an alternative: a Cartesian-coordinates-based atomic density expansion. This approach provides a complete set of polynormially indepedent features of atomic environments while maintaining interaction body orders. Additionally, we integrate low-dimensional embeddings of various chemical elements and inter-atomic message passing. The resulting potential, named Cartesian Atomic Cluster Expansion (CACE), exhibits good accuracy, stability, and generalizability. We validate its performance in diverse systems, including bulk water, small molecules, and 25-element high-entropy alloys.</description>

      <title>Multi-GPU RI-HF Energies and Analytic Gradients $-$ Towards High Throughput Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents an optimized algorithm and implementation for calculating resolution-of-the-identity Hartree-Fock (RI-HF) energies and analytic gradients using multiple Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). The algorithm is especially designed for high throughput \emph{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations of small and medium size molecules (10-100 atoms). Key innovations of this work include the exploitation of multi-GPU parallelism and a workload balancing scheme that efficiently distributes computational tasks among GPUs. Our implementation also employs techniques for symmetry utilization, integral screening and leveraging sparsity to optimize memory usage and computational efficiency. Computational results show that the implementation achieves significant performance improvements, including over $3\times$ speedups in single GPU AIMD throughput compared to previous GPU-accelerated RI-HF and traditional HF methods. Furthermore, utilizing multiple GPUs can provide super-linear speedup when the additional aggregate GPU memory allows for the storage of decompressed three-center integrals. Additionally, we report strong scaling efficiencies for systems up to 1000 basis functions and demonstrate practical applications through extensive performance benchmarks on up to quadruple-$\zeta$ primary basis sets, achieving floating-point performance of up to 47\% of the theoretical peak on a 4$\times$A100 GPU node.</description>
