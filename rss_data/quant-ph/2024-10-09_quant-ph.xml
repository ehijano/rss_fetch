      <title>Error mitigation and circuit division for early fault-tolerant quantum phase estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As fully fault-tolerant quantum computers capable of solving useful problems remain a future goal, we anticipate an era of "early fault tolerance" allowing for limited error correction. We propose a framework for designing early fault-tolerant algorithms by trading between error correction overhead and residual logical noise, and apply it to quantum phase estimation (QPE). We develop a quantum-Fourier-transform (QFT)-based QPE technique that is robust to global depolarising noise and outperforms the previous state of the art at low and moderate noise rates. We further develop a data processing technique, Explicitly Unbiased Maximum Likelihood Estimation (EUMLE), allowing us to mitigate arbitrary error on QFT-based QPE schemes in a consistent, asymptotically normal way. This extends quantum error mitigation techniques beyond expectation value estimation, which was labeled an open problem for the field. Applying this scheme to the ground state problem of the two-dimensional Hubbard model and various molecular Hamiltonians, we find we can roughly halve the number of physical qubits with a $\sim10\times$ wall-clock time overhead, but further reduction causes a steep runtime increase. This work provides an end-to-end analysis of early fault-tolerance cost reductions and space-time trade-offs, and identifies which areas can be improved in the future.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced phase transitions in monitored infinite-range interacting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge in observing measurement-induced phase transitions is the mitigation of the post-selection barrier, which causes the reproducibility of specific sequences of measurement readouts--the trajectory--to be exponentially small in system size. Recent studies suggest that some classes of monitored infinite-range systems alleviate this problem by exhibiting a fast saturation of entanglement, resulting in only a polynomial post-selection overhead. This paper answers whether this feature is inherent in infinite-range systems, due to their underlying semiclassical dynamics. We consider three experimentally relevant monitored models: a Tavis-Cummings model, a Superradiance model, and a Bose-Hubbard dimer, each exhibiting non-trivial monitored dynamics. We unveil the occurrence of entanglement phase transitions in these models, showing how the saturation time is strongly affected by bistability regions, which also prevent the mitigation of the post-selection barrier. Finally, we propose experimental realizations of these models, providing a discussion of post selection from an experimental perspective.</description>

      <title>Separable ellipsoids around multipartite states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, in finite dimensions, around any $m$-partite product state $\rho_{\rm prod}=\rho_1\otimes...\otimes\rho_m$, there exists an ellipsoid of separable states centered around $\rho_{\rm prod}$. The volume of this separable ellipsoid is typically exponentially larger than that of the separable ball proposed in previous works, due to the large hierarchy of eigenvalues occurring in typical states. We further refine this ellipsoidal criterion to a trace formula, generalize it to characterize the separable region around all separable states, and further study biseparability. Our criterion will help numerical procedures to rigorously detect separability. We apply the procedure for separability detection on three-qubit X state in a dephasing environment, and the 1d transverse field Ising model at finite temperature to illustrate the power of our procedure for understanding entanglement in physical systems.</description>

      <title>Error-Correcting Codes in TQFT on Multispheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological quantum field theories (TQFT) encode quantum correlations in topological features of spaces. In this work, we leverage this feature to explore how information encoded in TQFTs can be stored and retrieved in the presence of local decoherence affecting its physical carriers. TQFT states' inherent nonlocality, redundancy, and entanglement position them as natural error-correcting codes. We demonstrate that information recovery protocols can be derived from the principle that protected information must be uniformly distributed across the system and from interpreting correlations in terms of space connectivity. Specifically, we employ a topological framework to devise erasure error correction protocols, showing that information can be successfully recovered even when parts of the system are corrupted.</description>

      <title>Positive bias makes tensor-network contraction tractable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor network contraction is a powerful computational tool in quantum many-body physics, quantum information and quantum chemistry. The complexity of contracting a tensor network is thought to mainly depend on its entanglement properties, as reflected by the Schmidt rank across bipartite cuts. Here, we study how the complexity of tensor-network contraction depends on a different notion of quantumness, namely, the sign structure of its entries. We tackle this question rigorously by investigating the complexity of contracting tensor networks whose entries have a positive bias.
  We show that for intermediate bond dimension d&gt;~n, a small positive mean value &gt;~1/d of the tensor entries already dramatically decreases the computational complexity of approximately contracting random tensor networks, enabling a quasi-polynomial time algorithm for arbitrary 1/poly(n) multiplicative approximation. At the same time exactly contracting such tensor networks remains #P-hard, like for the zero-mean case [HHEG20]. The mean value 1/d matches the phase transition point observed in [CJHS24]. Our proof makes use of Barvinok's method for approximate counting and the technique of mapping random instances to statistical mechanical models. We further consider the worst-case complexity of approximate contraction of positive tensor networks, where all entries are non-negative. We first give a simple proof showing that a multiplicative approximation with error exponentially close to one is at least StoqMA-hard. We then show that when considering additive error in the matrix 1-norm, the contraction of positive tensor network is BPP-Complete. This result compares to Arad and Landau's [AL10] result, which shows that for general tensor networks, approximate contraction up to matrix 2-norm additive error is BQP-Complete.</description>

      <title>Manipulating quasi-bound states in a photonic crystal with periodic impurities to store quantum information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically model a one-dimensional lattice with periodic impurities representing a photonic crystal from first principles. We then investigate bound states in the continuum by computing the transmission and reflection coefficients. It turns out that when there are more impurities in our designed system then there exists a wider range of wavenumber where particles become essentially trapped. A perturbative-based explanation is shown to verify this phenomenon quantitatively. Due to this window of wavenumbers quantum information could be encoded in our system by constructing differently shaped wave packets that are bound by the tuning of parameters in our system.</description>

      <title>Long-time behavior of multi-level open systems interacting with non-vacuum reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The model of multi-level open quantum system interacting with a non-vacuum reservoir in the rotating wave approximation is considered. We provide an exact integral representation for the reduced density matrix of the system. For identical uncorrelated reservoirs in diagonal states, we have obtained the first perturbative correction for such dynamics in the Bogolubov-van Hove limit. We have shown that after initial state renormalization, it can be completely described in terms of finite-dimensional semigroup. The method we provide can also be applied to the further orders of perturbation theory with Bogolubov-van Hove scaling.</description>

      <title>Discrete Time Crystal Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prethermal discrete time crystals (PDTCs) are a nonequilibrium state of matter characterized by long-range spatiotemporal order, and exhibiting a subharmonic response stabilized by many-body interactions under periodic driving. The inherent robustness of time crystalline order to perturbations in the drive protocol makes DTCs promising for applications in quantum technologies. We exploit the susceptibility of PDTC order to deviations in its order parameter to devise highly frequency-selective quantum sensors for time-varying (AC) magnetic fields in a system of strongly-driven, dipolar-coupled 13C nuclear spins in diamond. Integrating a time-varying AC field into the PDTC allows us to exponentially increase its lifetime, measuring improvement of up to three orders of magnitude (44,204 cycles), and results in a strong resonant response in the time crystalline order parameter. The linewidth of our sensor is limited by the PDTC lifetime alone, as strong interspin interactions help stabilize DTC order. The sensor operates in the 0.5-50 kHz range - a blind spot for sensors based on atomic vapor or electronic spins - and attains a competitive sensitivity. PDTC sensors are resilient to errors in the drive protocol and sample inhomogeneities, and are agnostic to the macroscopic details of the physical platform: the underlying physical principle applies equally to superconducting qubits, neutral atoms, and trapped ions.</description>

      <title>Experimental realization of direct entangling gates between dual-type qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual-type qubits have become a promising way to suppress the crosstalk error of auxiliary operations in large-scale ion trap quantum computation. Here we demonstrate a direct entangling gate between dual-type qubits encoded in the $S_{1/2}$ and $D_{5/2}$ hyperfine manifolds of $^{137}\mathrm{Ba}^{+}$ ions. Our scheme is economic in the hardware, requiring only a single $532\,$nm laser system to entangle both qubit types by driving their Raman transitions. We achieve a Bell state fidelity of $96.3(4)\%$ for the dual-type Molmer-Sorensen gate between an $S$-$D$ ion pair, comparable to that for the same-type $S$-$S$ or $D$-$D$ gates. This technique can reduce the overhead for back-and-forth conversions between dual-type qubits in the quantum circuit with wide applications in quantum error correction and ion-photon quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Compressed space quantum approximate optimization algorithm for constrained combinatorial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization is a promising area for achieving quantum speedup. Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is designed to search for low-energy states of the Ising model, which correspond to near-optimal solutions of combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). However, effectively dealing with constraints of COPs remains a significant challenge. Existing methods, such as tailoring mixing operators, are typically limited to specific constraint types, like one-hot constraints. To address these limitations, we introduce a method for engineering a compressed space that represents the feasible solution space with fewer qubits than the original. Our approach includes a scalable technique for determining the unitary transformation between the compressed and original spaces on gate-based quantum computers. We then propose compressed space QAOA, which seeks near-optimal solutions within this reduced space, while utilizing the Ising model formulated in the original Hilbert space. Experimental results on a quantum simulator demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in solving various constrained COPs.</description>

      <title>On Principles and Representations for Extended Contextuality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been recent interest in whether the concept of quantum contextuality can be extended to systems with disturbance or signaling while retaining the essential properties of standard contextuality. Dzhafarov and Kujala (arXiv:2302.11995) offer a provocative argument that the answer is always affirmative: If standard contextuality satisfies some principle that extended contextuality does not, then that principle must be `non-substantive' in that it depends on a superficial choice of representation. Their argument is based on a ``consistification'' procedure that maps all systems to nondisturbing ones and that preserves contextuality. This paper raises several objections to their argument, including that it neglects how substantive principles change their expression under a change of representation, that it begs the question by presuming the principles are based on non-substantive transformations, and that the argument applies universally to arbitrary extensions of contextuality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an expression for the equilibrium probability distribution of a quantum state in contact with a noisy thermal environment that formally separates contributions from quantum and classical forms of probabilistic uncertainty. A statistical mechanical interpretation of this probability distribution enables us to derive an expression for the minimum free energy costs for arbitrary (reversible or irreversible) quantum state changes. Based on this derivation, we demonstrate that - in contrast to classical systems - the free energy required to erase or reset a qubit depends sensitively on both the fidelity of the target state and on the physical properties of the environment, such as the number of quantum bath states, due primarily to the entropic effects of system-bath entanglement.</description>

      <title>Integrated Encoding and Quantization to Enhance Quanvolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image processing is one of the most promising applications for quantum machine learning (QML). Quanvolutional Neural Networks with non-trainable parameters are the preferred solution to run on current and near future quantum devices. The typical input preprocessing pipeline for quanvolutional layers comprises of four steps: optional input binary quantization, encoding classical data into quantum states, processing the data to obtain the final quantum states, decoding quantum states back to classical outputs. In this paper we propose two ways to enhance the efficiency of quanvolutional models. First, we propose a flexible data quantization approach with memoization, applicable to any encoding method. This allows us to increase the number of quantization levels to retain more information or lower them to reduce the amount of circuit executions. Second, we introduce a new integrated encoding strategy, which combines the encoding and processing steps in a single circuit. This method allows great flexibility on several architectural parameters (e.g., number of qubits, filter size, and circuit depth) making them adjustable to quantum hardware requirements. We compare our proposed integrated model with a classical convolutional neural network and the well-known rotational encoding method, on two different classification tasks. The results demonstrate that our proposed model encoding exhibits a comparable or superior performance to the other models while requiring fewer quantum resources.</description>

      <title>Coupled resonators based on high permittivity dielectrics for microwave sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of coupled cavities with high quality factor is of undoubted interest for several applications including those concerning quantum sensing and metrology. Here we report on a coupled cavity configuration in which a high $Q$-factor elliptical TESLA-shaped superconducting cavity is coupled with a high permittivity ($\varepsilon_\mathrm{r}$) dielectric resonator. We carried out first tests using a SrTiO$_3$ (STO) resonator at 0.1 GHz, whose permittivity has been observed to reach values higher than 30000 a 0.16 K. The sensitivities of such configurations are discussed both in strong coupling and weak coupling regime. In particular we show that the notch of the coupled system has, as a function of the permittivity, a frequency sensitivity of 2.8 MHz for $\varepsilon_\mathrm{r} \approx 230$. These results highlight the potential of the coupled resonator systems as microwave sensors and are useful for the engineering of high permittivity resonators for applications at cryogenic temperatures.</description>

      <title>Experimental coherent-state quantum secret sharing with finite pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum secret sharing (QSS) plays a significant role in multiparty quantum communication and is a crucial component of future quantum multiparty computing networks. Therefore, it is highly valuable to develop a QSS protocol that offers both information-theoretic security and validation in real optical systems under a finite-key regime. In this work, we propose a three-user QSS protocol based on phase-encoding technology. By adopting symmetric procedures for the two players, our protocol resolves the security loopholes introduced by asymmetric basis choice without prior knowledge of the identity of the malicious player. Kato's concentration inequality is exploited to provide security against coherent attacks with the finite-key effect. Moreover, the practicality of our protocol has been validated under a 30-dB channel loss with a transmission distance of 5-km fiber. Our protocol achieves secure key rates ranging from 432 to 192 bps by choosing different pulse intensities and basis selection probabilities. Offering enhanced security and practicality, our protocol stands as an essential element for the realization of quantum multiparty computing networks.</description>

      <title>Explicit Quantum Circuit for Simulating the Advection-Diffusion-Reaction Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess the convergence of the Carleman linearization of advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) equations with a logistic nonlinearity. It is shown that five Carleman iterates provide a satisfactory approximation of the original ADR across a broad range of parameters and strength of nonlinearity. To assess the feasibility of a quantum algorithm based on this linearization, we analyze the projection of the Carleman ADR matrix onto the tensor Pauli basis. It is found that the Carleman ADR matrix requires an exponential number of Pauli gates as a function of the number of qubits. This prevents the practical implementation of the Carleman approach to the quantum simulation of ADR problems on current hardware. We propose to address this limitation by resorting to block-encoding techniques for sparse matrix employing oracles. Such quantum ADR oracles are presented in explicit form and shown to turn the exponential complexity into a polynomial one. However, due to the low probability of successfully implementing the nonunitary Carleman operator, further research is needed to implement the multi-timestep version of the present circuit.</description>

      <title>Exponential entanglement advantage in sensing correlated noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new form of exponential quantum advantage in the context of sensing correlated noise. Specifically, we focus on the problem of estimating parameters associated with Lindblad dephasing dynamics, and show that entanglement can lead to an exponential enhancement in the sensitivity (as quantified via quantum Fisher information of the sensor state) for estimating a small parameter characterizing the deviation of system Lindbladians from a class of maximally correlated dephasing dynamics. This result stands in stark contrast with previously studied scenarios of sensing uncorrelated dephasing noise, where one can prove that entanglement does not lead to an advantage in the signal-to-noise ratio. Our work thus opens a novel pathway towards achieving entanglement-based sensing advantage, which may find applications in characterizing decoherence dynamics of near-term quantum devices. Further, our approach provides a potential quantum-enhanced probe of many-body correlated phases by measuring noise generated by a sensing target. We also discuss realization of our protocol using near-term quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Observing tight triple uncertainty relations in two-qubit systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the fundamental tool in quantum information science, the uncertainty principle is essential for manifesting nonclassical properties of quantum systems.
  Plenty of efforts on the uncertainty principle with two observables have been achieved, making it an appealing challenge to extend the scenario to multiple observables.
  Here, based on an optical setup, we demonstrate the uncertainty relations in two-qubit systems involving three physical components with the tight constant $2/\sqrt{3}$, which signifies a more precise limit in the measurement of multiple quantum components and offers deeper insights into the trade-offs between observables.
  Furthermore, we reveal the correspondence of the maximal values of the uncertainty functions and the degree of entanglement, where the more uncertainty is proportional to the higher degree of entanglement.
  Our results provide a new insight into understanding the uncertainty relations with multiple observables and may motivate more innovative applications in quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Quantum spatial search with multiple excitations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial search is the problem of finding a marked vertex in a graph. A continuous-time quantum walk in the single-excitation subspace of an $n$ spin system solves the problem of spatial search by finding the marked vertex in $O(\sqrt{n})$ time. Here, we investigate a natural extension of the spatial search problem, marking multiple vertices of a graph, which are still marked with local fields. We prove that a continuous-time quantum walk in the $k$-excitation subspace of $n$ spins can determine the binary string of $k$ marked vertices with an asymptotic fidelity in time $O(\sqrt{n})$, despite the size of the state space growing as $O(n^k)$. Numerically, we show that this algorithm can be implemented with interactions that decay as $1/r^\alpha$, where $r$ is the distance between spins, and an $\alpha$ that is readily available in current ion trap systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-dependent Hamiltonian simulation using Trotterization causes two types of errors, i.e., discretization errors and digitization errors. In this paper, we propose a decomposition formula which enables us to completely eliminate digitization errors in digital quantum simulation of quantum annealing. We numerically demonstrate scaling advantage of the present method against the conventional Trotterization approach. We also show that the present method can be applied to quantum annealing with some catalysts. Notably, some combinations of nonstoquastic $XX$-interaction, bias $Z$-field, and counterdiabatic $Y$-field catalysts are included in applications of the present method.</description>

      <title>Entangled quantum trajectories in relativistic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a key resource for quantum technologies, including emerging ground-to-satellite quantum communication. In such a scenario, an important challenge to be overcome is to consider entanglement between two or more quantum particles in different inertial frames, potentially experiencing relativistic effects affecting quantum correlations. In this paper, we present a consistent framework that overcomes this challenge. To this end, we establish the notion of factorizable and entangled multi-time trajectories and derive a class of Euler--Lagrange equations under the constraint of a non-entangling behavior. Comparing this restricted evolution to the solutions of the unrestricted equations of motion allows one to investigate the trajectory-based entanglement of general systems. We solve our equations for interacting particles in a Klein--Gordon-type setting, thereby quantifying the dynamic and relativistic impact of entanglement in a self-consistent manner.</description>

      <title>Unclonable Functional Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a functional encryption (FE) scheme, a user that holds a ciphertext and a function-key can learn the result of applying the function to the plaintext message. Security requires that the user does not learn anything beyond the function evaluation. On the other hand, unclonable encryption (UE) is a uniquely quantum primitive, which ensures that an adversary cannot duplicate a ciphertext to decrypt the same message multiple times. In this work we introduce unclonable quantum functional encryption (UFE), which both extends the notion of FE to the quantum setting and also possesses the unclonable security of UE. We give a construction for UFE that supports arbitrary quantum messages and polynomialy-sized circuit, and achieves unclonable-indistinguishable security for independently sampled function keys. In particular, our UFE guarantees that two parties cannot simultaneously recover the correct function outputs using two independently sampled function keys. Our construction combines quantum garbled circuits [BY22], and quantum-key unclonable encryption [AKY24], and leverages techniques from the plaintext expansion arguments in [Hir+23]. As an application we give the first construction for public-key UE with variable decryption keys. Lastly, we establish a connection between quantum indistinguishability obfuscation (qiO) and quantum functional encryption (QFE); Showing that any multi-input indistinguishability-secure quantum functional encryption scheme unconditionally implies the existence of qiO.</description>

      <title>Quasiclassical theory of out-of-time-ordered correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), defined via the squared commutator of a time-evolving and a stationary operator, represent observables that provide useful indicators for chaos and the scrambling of information in complex quantum systems. Here we present a quasiclassical formalism of OTOCs, which is obtained from the semiclassical van Vleck-Gutzwiller propagator through the application of the diagonal approximation. For short evolution times, this quasiclassical approach yields the same result as the Wigner-Moyal formalism, i.e., OTOCs are classically described via the square of the Poisson bracket between the two involved observables, thus giving rise to an exponential growth in a chaotic regime. For long times, for which the semiclassical framework is, in principle, still valid, the diagonal approximation yields an asymptotic saturation value for the quasiclassical OTOC under the assumption of fully developed classical chaos. However, numerical simulations, carried out within chaotic few-site Bose-Hubbard systems in the absence and presence of periodic driving, demonstrate that this saturation value strongly underestimates the actual threshold value of the quantum OTOC, which is normally attained after the Ehrenfest time. This indicates that nondiagonal and hence genuinely quantum contributions, thus exceeding the framework of the quasiclassical description, are primarily responsible for describing OTOCs beyond the short-time regime.</description>

      <title>Faraday-Ramsey rotation measurement in a thin cell as an analogy to an atomic beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic beams offer measurement capabilities for hot vapors but often require complex, bulky systems, limiting miniaturization. This study explores hot vapors in thin cells (L=30,5 microns) as a simplified analogy to atomic beams. Coherence is maintained only for atoms moving parallel to the cell walls, as wall collisions randomize spin. By filtering non-parallel atoms, we mimic atomic beam behavior and observe the Faraday-Ramsey effect. Rubidium atoms are optically pumped with linearly polarized resonance radiation, evolving in a perpendicular magnetic field and probed via Faraday rotation. We believe that thin cell technology is paving the way for the miniaturization of atomic beam-based sensors.</description>

      <title>Towards robust detection of entangled two-photon absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last 50 years entangled photon pairs have received attention for use in lowering the flux in two-photon absorption imaging and spectroscopy. Despite this, evidence for entangled two-photon absorption (ETPA) effects remain highly debated, especially at low-fluxes. Here, we structure the transverse spatial correlations of entangled photon pairs to evidence signs of ETPA at room-temperature in organic and inorganic chromophores, in the low-flux regime. We demonstrate our scheme to be robust to common artifacts that have previously hampered detection of ETPA such as linear absorption and background fluorescence, and show that ETPA scales with transverse correlation area and chromophore two-photon cross-sections. Our results present a step towards verifying ETPA and experimentally exploring entangled light-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Modular Quantum-to-Quantum Bernoulli Factory in an Integrated Photonic Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generation and manipulation of randomness is a relevant task for several applications of information technology. It has been shown that quantum mechanics offers some advantages for this type of task. A promising model for randomness manipulation is provided by the Bernoulli factories, protocols capable of changing the bias of Bernoulli random processes in a controlled way. At first, this framework was proposed and investigated in a fully classical regime. Recent extensions of this model to the quantum case showed the possibility of implementing a wider class of randomness manipulation functions. We propose a Bernoulli factory scheme with quantum states as input and output, using a photonic path-encoding approach. Our scheme is modular, universal, and its functioning is truly oblivious of the input bias, characteristics that were missing in earlier work. We report on experimental implementations using an integrated and fully programmable photonic platform, thus demonstrating the viability of our approach. These results open new paths for randomness manipulation with integrated quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Statistics of topological defects across a phase transition in a superconducting quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a quantum phase transition is crossed within a finite time, critical slowing down disrupts adiabatic dynamics, resulting in the formation of topological defects. The average density of these defects scales with the quench rate, adhering to a universal power law as predicted by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM). In this study, we aim to investigate the counting statistics of kink density in the 1D transverse-field quantum Ising model. We demonstrate on a 20-qubit quantum processing unit, that higher-order cumulants follow a universal power law scaling as a function of the quench time. We also show the breakdown of the KZM mechanism for short quenches for finite-size systems. Tensor network simulations corroborate our quantum simulation results for bigger systems not in the asymptotic limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how the microscopic properties of open quantum systems affect gate functionality is essential for developing high-quality quantum gates. This work examines driven qubit evolution in a bath of linear harmonic oscillators with a fast external drive. The dynamically prepared state technique and the time-dependent Bloch-Redfield master equation allow for accurate state coherence calculations. This technique eliminates reaction delays for relaxation dynamics and corrects inaccurate dephasing rates caused by factorized initial states in traditional master equations. Furthermore, the interaction with the bath is investigated for its effect on gate fidelity. As a function of the qubit rotation angle, the gate fidelity is minimal for the {\pi}-flip and partially recovers with the 2{\pi}-flip.</description>

Abstract: Optical accordion lattices are routinely used in quantum simulation and quantum computation experiments to tune optical lattice spacings. Here, we present a technique for creating tunable optical lattices using binary-phase transmission gratings. Lattices generated using this technique have high uniformity, contrast, lattice spacing tunability, and power efficiencies. These attributes are crucial for exploring collective quantum phenomena in highly ordered atomic arrays coupled to optical waveguides for quantum networking and quantum simulation. In this paper, we demonstrate adjustable-period lattices that are ideally suited for use with optical nanofibers.</description>

      <title>N-qubit universal quantum logic with a photonic qudit and O(N) linear optics elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional quantum units of information, or qudits, can carry more than one quantum bit of information in a single degree of freedom, and can therefore be used to boost the performance of quantum communication and quantum computation protocols. A photon in a superposition of $2^N$ time bins - a time-bin qudit - contains as much information as N qubits. Here, we show that N-qubit states encoded in a single time-bin qudit can be arbitrarily and deterministically generated, manipulated and measured using a number of linear optics elements that scales linearly with N, as opposed with prior proposals of single-qudit implementation of N-qubit logic, which typically requires $O(2^N)$ elements. The simple and cost-effective implementation we propose can be used as a small-scale quantum processor. We then demonstrate a path towards scalability by interfacing distinct qudit processors to a matter qubit (atom or quantum dot spin) in an optical resonator. Such a cavity QED system allows for more advanced functionalities, such as single-qubit nondemolition measurement and two-qubit gates between distinct qudits. It could also enable quantum interfaces with other matter quantum nodes in the context of quantum networks and distributed quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Hidden-State Proofs of Quantumness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An experimental cryptographic proof of quantumness will be a vital milestone in the progress of quantum information science. Error tolerance is a persistent challenge for implementing such tests: we need a test that not only can be passed by an efficient quantum prover, but one that can be passed by a prover that exhibits a certain amount of computational error. (Brakerski et al. 2018) introduced an innovative two-round proof of quantumness based on the Learning With Errors (LWE) assumption. However, one of the steps in their protocol (the pre-image test) has low tolerance for error. In this work we present a proof of quantumness which maintains the same circuit structure as (Brakerski et al. 2018) while improving the robustness for noise. Our protocol is based on cryptographically hiding an extended Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state within a sequence of classical bits. Asymptotically, our protocol allows the total probability of error within the circuit to be as high as $1 - O ( \lambda^{-C} )$, where $\lambda$ is the security parameter and $C$ is a constant that can be made arbitrarily large. As part of the proof of this result, we also prove an uncertainty principle over finite abelian groups which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>An Optimized Nearest Neighbor Compliant Quantum Circuit for 5-qubit Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The five-qubit quantum error correcting code encodes one logical qubit to five physical qubits, and protects the code from a single error. It was one of the first quantum codes to be invented, and various encoding circuits have been proposed for it. In this paper, we propose a systematic procedure for optimization of encoder circuits for stabilizer codes. We start with the systematic construction of an encoder for a five-qubit code, and optimize the circuit in terms of the number of quantum gates. Our method is also applicable to larger stabilizer codes. We further propose nearest neighbor compliant (NNC) circuits for the proposed encoder using a single swap gate, as compared to three swap gates in a prior design.</description>

      <title>Effective models for quantum optics with multilayer open cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective models to describe the dynamics of an open cavity have been extensively discussed in the literature. In many of these models the cavity leakage to the outside is treated as a loss introduced phenomenologically. In contrast to these, we focus here on characterizing the outgoing photon using a novel approach where the outside is treated as part of the system. In such a global system, in order to separately characterize the photon inside and outside cavity, we demonstrate a first-principle derivation of a coherent cavity-reservoir coupling function for cavities with mirrors consisting of a stack of dielectric layers. In particular, we show that due to the effects induced by the multilayer nature of the cavity mirror, even in the standardly defined high-finesse cavity regime, the cavity-reservoir system description might differ from the one where the structure of the mirror is neglected. Based on this, we define a generalized cavity response function and a cavity-reservoir coupling function, which account for the longitudinal geometric structure of the cavity mirror. This allows us to define an effective reflectivity for the cavity with a multilayer mirror as if it was sitting in a well-defined effective mirror plane. We estimate the error of such a definition by considering cavities of different lengths and mirror structures. Finally, we apply this model to characterize the dynamics of a single photon produced in such a cavity and propagating outside.</description>

      <title>Fast Phase Factor Finding for Quantum Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents two efficient and stable algorithms for recovering phase factors in quantum signal processing (QSP), a crucial component of many quantum algorithms. The first algorithm, the ``Half Cholesky" method, which is based on nonlinear Fourier analysis and fast solvers for structured matrices, demonstrates robust performance across all regimes. The second algorithm, ``Fast Fixed Point Iteration," provides even greater efficiency in the non-fully-coherent regime. Both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate the significant advantages of these new methods over all existing approaches.</description>

      <title>A QUBO Formulation for the Generalized LinkedIn Queens Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a QUBO formulation designed to solve a series of generalisations of the LinkedIn queens game, a version of the N-queens problem. We adapt this formulation for several particular cases of the problem by trying to optimise the number of variables and interactions, improving the possibility of applying it on quantum hardware by means of Quantum Annealing or the Quantum Approximated Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). We also present two new types of problems, the Coloured Chess Piece Problem and the Max Chess Pieces Problem, with their corresponding QUBO formulations.</description>

      <title>On the Computational Power of QAC0 with Barely Superlinear Ancillae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\mathrm{QAC}^0$ is the family of constant-depth polynomial-size quantum circuits consisting of arbitrary single qubit unitaries and multi-qubit Toffoli gates. It was introduced by Moore [arXiv: 9903046] as a quantum counterpart of $\mathrm{AC}^0$, along with the conjecture that $\mathrm{QAC}^0$ circuits can not compute PARITY. In this work we make progress on this longstanding conjecture: we show that any depth-$d$ $\mathrm{QAC}^0$ circuit requires $n^{1+3^{-d}}$ ancillae to compute a function with approximate degree $\Theta(n)$, which includes PARITY, MAJORITY and $\mathrm{MOD}_k$. This is the first superlinear lower bound on the size of the ancillae required for computing parity. We further establish superlinear lower bounds on quantum state synthesis and quantum channel synthesis. These lower bounds are derived by giving low-degree approximations to $\mathrm{QAC}^0$ circuits. We show that a depth-$d$ $\mathrm{QAC}^0$ circuit with $a$ ancillae, when applied to low-degree operators, has a degree $(n+a)^{1-3^{-d}}$ polynomial approximation in the spectral norm. This implies that the class $\mathrm{QLC}^0$, corresponding to linear size $\mathrm{QAC}^0$ circuits, has approximate degree $o(n)$. This is a quantum generalization of the result that $\mathrm{LC}^0$ circuits have approximate degree $o(n)$ by Bun, Robin, and Thaler [SODA 2019]. Our result also implies that $\mathrm{QLC}^0\neq\mathrm{NC}^1$.</description>

      <title>Observation of disorder-free localization and efficient disorder averaging on a quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most challenging problems in the computational study of localization in quantum manybody systems is to capture the effects of rare events, which requires sampling over exponentially many disorder realizations. We implement an efficient procedure on a quantum processor, leveraging quantum parallelism, to efficiently sample over all disorder realizations. We observe localization without disorder in quantum many-body dynamics in one and two dimensions: perturbations do not diffuse even though both the generator of evolution and the initial states are fully translationally invariant. The disorder strength as well as its density can be readily tuned using the initial state. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of our platform by measuring Renyi entropies. Our method could also be extended to higher moments of the physical observables and disorder learning.</description>

      <title>Experimental single-copy distillation of quantumness from higher-dimensional entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is at the heart of quantum theory and is responsible for various quantum-enabling technologies. In practice, during its preparation, storage, and distribution to the intended recipients, this valuable quantum resource may suffer from noisy interactions that reduce its usefulness for the desired information-processing tasks. Conventional schemes of entanglement distillation aim to alleviate this problem by performing collective operations on multiple copies of these decohered states and sacrificing some of them to recover Bell pairs. However, for this scheme to work, the states to be distilled should already contain a large enough fraction of maximally entangled states before these collective operations. Not all entangled quantum states meet this premise. Here, by using the paradigmatic family of two-qutrit Werner states as an exemplifying example, we experimentally demonstrate how one may use single-copy local filtering operations to meet this requirement and to recover the quantumness hidden in these higher-dimensional states. Among others, our results provide the first proof-of-principle experimental certification of the Bell-nonlocal properties of these intriguing entangled states, the activation of their usefulness for quantum teleportation, dense coding, and an enhancement of their quantum steerability, and hence usefulness for certain discrimination tasks. Our theoretically established lower bounds on the steering robustness of these states, when they admit a symmetric quasiextension or a bosonic symmetric extension, and when they show hidden dense-codability may also be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Application of Large Language Models to Quantum State Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers leverage the unique advantages of quantum mechanics to achieve acceleration over classical computers for certain problems. Currently, various quantum simulators provide powerful tools for researchers, but simulating quantum evolution with these simulators often incurs high time costs. Additionally, resource consumption grows exponentially as the number of quantum bits increases. To address this issue, our research aims to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate quantum circuits. This paper details the process of constructing 1-qubit and 2-qubit quantum simulator models, extending to multiple qubits, and ultimately implementing a 3-qubit example. Our study demonstrates that LLMs can effectively learn and predict the evolution patterns among quantum bits, with minimal error compared to the theoretical output states. Even when dealing with quantum circuits comprising an exponential number of quantum gates, LLMs remain computationally efficient. Overall, our results highlight the potential of LLMs to predict the outputs of complex quantum dynamics, achieving speeds far surpassing those required to run the same process on a quantum computer. This finding provides new insights and tools for applying machine learning methods in the field of quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Manipulation of the NV center nuclear spin using invisible transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, rotation sensors utilizing the nuclear spins of nitrogen-vacancy color centers in diamond have been demonstrated. However, these devices are power-intensive and challenging to integrate into small chip-based radiofrequency antennas and circuits necessary for controlling nuclear spins or producing relatively high magnetic fields. To address this issue, the coherent manipulation of nuclear spins via coherent population trapping at moderate magnetic fields using microwave fields has been successfully demonstrated in isotopically pure diamond. In this work, we demonstrate that a similar technique can be applied to a diamond plate with a natural abundance of carbon-13, which holds significant potential for practical sensing applications. Although the forbidden resonances required for coherent control were only partially observed, coherent population trapping was successfully demonstrated at both visible and invisible transitions, with an apparent contrast of up to 98 +- 11% and a true contrast of approximately 35 +-7%. This finding confirms the feasibility of coherent nuclear spin control even in diamond plates with naturally occurring carbon-13.</description>

      <title>Mpemba Meets Quantum Chaos: Anomalous Relaxation and Mpemba Crossings in Dissipative Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect (MPE), named after a student who discovered the phenomenon during a classroom experiment, has intrigued scientists for decades. This effect challenges conventional wisdom by demonstrating that the hot milk can freeze faster than cold milk under certain conditions. Recently, similar effects have been found in integrable quantum systems. However, the key distinction between the classical MPE and its quantum analog is that the latter relies predominantly on the of the properties of the initial states rather than the cooling rate. In this paper, we explore the quench dynamics of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) systems coupled to thermal baths. We investigate three scenarios--an SYK system coupled with an SYK thermal bath, an SYK system coupled with two thermal baths at different temperatures, and a dissipative SYK system modeled by the Lindblad equation. In the regimes where the system and the baths are strongly coupled, we observe effective temperature oscillations and Mpemba crossings (MPCs)--an effect of temperature crossings which are absent in the equilibrium thermodynamic analysis--when the system is strongly coupled to SYK thermal baths. The emergence of the MPCs suggests the observation of a transient MPE in the cooling or heating process before the systems reach the steady states. The emergence of MPCs in quantum chaotic systems exhibits strong parallels with the classical MPE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In experiments requiring extreme darkness, such as experiments probing the limits of human vision, assessment of the background photon flux is essential. However, direct measurement thereof with standard single photon detectors is challenged by dark counts and their fluctuations. Here we report an experiment and detailed statistical analysis of a direct measurement of darkness in a dedicated dark chamber suitable for human vision experiments, only using a standard single photon detector and a mechanical shutter. From a Bayesian analysis of $616$ h of data, we find substantial to decisive evidence for absolute darkness (depending on choice of prior distribution) based on the Savage-Dickey ratio, and a light level $&lt;0.039$ cnt/s (posterior $0.95$-highest density interval).</description>

      <title>Symmetry-enhanced Counterdiabatic Quantum Algorithm for Qudits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qubit-based variational quantum algorithms have undergone rapid development in recent years but still face several challenges. In this context, we propose a symmetry-enhanced digitized counterdiabatic quantum algorithm utilizing qudits instead of qubits. This approach offers three types of compression as compared to with respect to conventional variational circuits. First, compression in the circuit depth is rachieveduced by counterdiabatic protocols. Second, information about the problem is compressed by replacing qubits with qudits, allowing for a more efficient representation of the problem.. Lastly, the number of parameters is reduced by employing the symmetries of the system. We illustrate this approach by tackling a graph-based optimization problem Max-3-Cut and a highly-entangled state preparation, the qutrit W state. As our numerical results show, we achieve a better convergence with a lower circuit depth and less measurement overhead in all the cases considered. This work leads to a better design of shallow variational quantum circuits, improving the feasibility of their implementation on near-term qudit devices.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how stronger noise can enhance the entanglement in inhomogeneously monitored quantum systems. We consider a free fermions model composed of two coupled chains - a system chain and an ancilla chain, each subject to its own different noise - and explore the dynamics of entanglement within the system chain under different noise intensities. Our results demonstrate that, contrary to the detrimental effects typically associated with noise, certain regimes of noise on the ancilla can significantly enhance entanglement within the system. Numerical simulations demonstrate the robustness of such entanglement enhancement across various system sizes and noise parameters. This enhancement is found to be highly dependent on the hopping strength in the ancilla, suggesting that the interplay between unitary dynamics and noise can be tuned to optimize the entanglement of a quantum system.</description>

      <title>Are intrinsic decoherence models physical theories?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrinsic decoherence models (IDMs) have been proposed in order to solve the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. In this work, we assess the status of two of these models as physical theories by establishing the ultimate bounds on the estimability of their parameters. Our results show that dephasing and dissipative IDMs are amenable to falsification and should be considered physical theories worth of experimental study.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field dependence of $V_B^-$ Defects in hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interface with spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride has recently become a promising platform and has shown great potential in a wide range of quantum technologies. Varieties of spin properties of $V_B^-$ defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have been researched widely and deeply, like their structure and coherent control. However, little is known about the influence of off-axis magnetic fields on the coherence properties of $V_B^-$ defects in hBN. Here, by using the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectroscopy, we systematically investigated the variations in ODMR resonance frequencies under different transverse and longitudinal external magnetic field, respectively. In addition, we measured the ODMR spectra under off-axis magnetic fields of constant strength but various angles, and observed that the splitting of the resonance frequencies decreases as the angle increases, aligning with our theoretical calculation based on the Hamiltonian, from which we come up with a solution of detecting the off-axis magnetic field angle. Through Rabi oscillation measurements, we found that the off-axis magnetic field suppresses the spin coherence time. These results are crucial for optimizing $V_B^-$ defects in hBN, establishing their significance as robust quantum sensors for quantum information processing and magnetic sensing in varied environments.</description>

      <title>Integrability is generic in homogeneous U(1)-invariant nearest-neighbor qubit circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrability is an exceptional property believed to hold only for systems with fine-tuned parameters. Contrary, we explicitly show that in homogeneous nearest-neighbor qubit circuits with a U(1) symmetry, i.e., circuits that repeatedly apply the same magnetization-conserving two-qubit gate, this is not the case. There, integrability is generic: all such brickwall qubit circuits are integrable, even with a randomly selected gate. We identify two phases with different conservation laws, transport properties, and strong zero edge modes. Experimentally important is the fact that varying any one of the parameters in the generic U(1) gate, one will typically cross the critical manifold that separates the two phases. Finally, we report on an unconventional time-reversal symmetry causing the system with open boundary conditions to be in the orthogonal class, while the one with periodic boundary conditions is in the unitary class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel quantum instruction set architecture that abstracts quantum circuits to support high-level programming paradigms, including sequential execution and branching. By separating concerns between hardware and software, the proposed architecture simplifies quantum algorithm development, allowing programmers to work with classical structures while still being able to exploit quantum-specific behavior . This abstraction enables developers to focus on algorithm design without being burdened by low-level circuit construction, thus facilitating both hardware optimization and software innovation. The proposed architecture represents a step forward in bridging the gap between classical and quantum programming.</description>

      <title>Tailoring fusion-based photonic quantum computing schemes to quantum emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fusion-based quantum computation is a promising quantum computing model where small-sized photonic resource states are simultaneously entangled and measured by fusion gates. Such operations can be readily implemented with scalable photonic hardware: resource states can be deterministically generated by quantum emitters and fusions require only shallow linear-optical circuits. Here, we propose fusion-based architectures tailored to the capabilities and noise models in quantum emitters. We show that high tolerance to dominant physical error mechanisms can be achieved, with fault-tolerance thresholds of 8% for photon loss, 4% for photon distinguishability between emitters, and spin noise thresholds well below coherence times for typical spin-photon interfaces. Our construction and analysis provide guidelines for the development of photonic quantum hardware targeting fault-tolerant applications with quantum emitters.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling of quantum caustics in the dynamics of interacting particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent theoretical studies have predicted the existence of caustics in many-body quantum dynamics, where they manifest as extended regions of enhanced probability density that obey temporal and spatial scaling relations. Focusing on the transverse-field Ising model, we investigate the dynamics initiated by a local quench in a spin chain, resulting in outward-propagating excitations that create a distinct caustic pattern. We calculate the scaling of the first two maxima of the interference fringes dressing the caustic, finding a universal exponent of 2/3, associated with an Airy function catastrophe. We demonstrate that this property is universal in the entire paramagnetic phase of the model, and starts varying at the quantum phase transition (QPT). This robust scaling persists even under perturbations that break the integrability of the model. We additionally explore the effect of boundary conditions and find that open boundaries introduce significant edge effects, leading to complex interference patterns. Despite these edge-induced dynamics, the overall power-law scaling exponent remains robust. These findings highlight the potential of quantum caustics as a powerful diagnostic tool for QPTs, demonstrating resilience against integrability-breaking perturbations and boundary condition variations.</description>

      <title>Experimental quantum triangle network nonlocality with an AlGaAs multiplexed entangled photon source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of the concept of nonlocality beyond standard Bell scenarios in quantum network architectures unveils fundamentally new forms of correlations that hold a strong potential for future applications of quantum communication networks. To materialize this potential, it is necessary to adapt theoretical advances to realistic configurations. Here we consider a quantum triangle network, for which is was shown in theory that, remarkably, quantum nonlocality without inputs can be demonstrated for sources with an arbitrarily small level of independence. We realize experimentally such correlated sources by carefully engineering the output state of a single AlGaAs multiplexed entangled-photon source, exploiting energy-matched channels cut in its broad spectrum. This simulated triangle network is then used to violate experimentally for the first time a Bell-like inequality that we derive to capture the effect of noise in the correlations present in our system. We also rigorously validate our findings by analysing the mutual information between the generated states. Our results allow us to deepen our understanding of network nonlocality while also pushing its practical relevance for quantum communication networks.</description>

      <title>Engineering the Nonlinearity of Bosonic Modes with a Multi-loop SQUID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering high-order nonlinearities while suppressing lower-order terms is crucial for quantum error correction and state control in bosonic systems, yet it remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we introduce a general framework of Nonlinearity-Engineered Multi-loop SQUID (NEMS) device, enabling the realization of arbitrary nonlinearities by tuning fluxes in multiple loops within superconducting circuits. We demonstrate specific examples of NEMS devices that selectively engineer pure cubic, quartic, and quintic interactions with suppressed parasitic couplings, showing great promise for realizing Kerr-cat bias-preserving {\scshape cnot} gates and stabilizing four-leg cat qubits. By opening new avenues for tailoring nonlinear Hamiltonians of superconducting devices, this work enables sophisticated and precise manipulation of bosonic modes, with potential applications in quantum computation, simulation, and sensing.</description>

      <title>Variational approach to photonic quantum circuits via the parameter shift rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers, variational quantum algorithms represent one of the most viable approaches for their application to solve tasks of interest. These algorithms train a parameterized quantum circuit to execute a specific task encoded in a cost function that needs to be minimized using a classical optimizer. In this context, photonic platforms based on reconfigurable integrated optics appear as one of the prominent platforms for the implementation of variational algorithms. In the circuital model of quantum computation based on qubits, to train variational circuits, the parameter shift rule came into being, which allows for the exact calculation of the derivatives of many functions at the output of a quantum circuit, opening up the possibility of using classical optimisation algorithms based on gradient descent. In this paper, we derive a formulation of the parameter shift rule for reconfigurable optical linear circuits based on the Boson Sampling paradigm. This allows us to naturally embed the common types of experimental noise, such as partial distinguishability, and mixedness of the states, thus obtaining a resilient approach. We also present similar rules for the computations of integrals over the variational parameters. Finally, we employ the developed approach to experimentally test variational algorithms with single-photon states processed in a reconfigurable 6-mode universal integrated interferometer. Specifically, we apply the photonic parameter shift rules to the variational implementation, on a photonic platform, of both an eigensolver and a Universal-Not gate.</description>

      <title>On the role of coherence for quantum computational advantage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying the resources available to a quantum computer appears to be necessary to separate quantum from classical computation. Among them, entanglement, magic and coherence are arguably of great significance. We introduce path coherence as a measure of the coherent paths interferences arising in a quantum computation. Leveraging the sum-over-paths formalism, we obtain a classical algorithm for estimating quantum transition amplitudes, the complexity of which scales with path coherence. As path coherence relates to the hardness of classical simulation, it provides a new perspective on the role of coherence in quantum computational advantage. Beyond their fundamental significance, our results have practical applications for simulating large classes of quantum computations with classical computers.</description>

      <title>Geometric Floquet theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive Floquet theory from quantum geometry. We identify quasienergy folding as a consequence of a broken gauge group of the adiabatic gauge potential $U(1){\mapsto}\mathbb{Z}$. This allows us to introduce a unique gauge-invariant formulation, decomposing the dynamics into a purely geometric and a purely dynamical evolution. The dynamical Kato operator provides an unambiguous sorting of the quasienergy spectrum, identifying a unique Floquet ground state and suggesting a way to define the filling of Floquet-Bloch bands. We exemplify the features of geometric Floquet theory using an exactly solvable XY model and a non-integrable kicked Ising chain; we show that the geometric contribution to the evolution accounts for inherently nonequilibrium effects, like the $\pi$-quasienergy gap in discrete time crystals or edge modes in anomalous Floquet topological insulators. The spectrum of the Kato operator elucidates the origin of both heating and spatiotemporal symmetry-breaking transitions. Last, we demonstrate that the periodic lab frame Hamiltonian generates transitionless counterdiabatic driving for Floquet eigenstates; this enables the direct application of shortcuts-to-adiabaticity techniques to Floquet engineering, turning it into an explicit algorithmic procedure. This work directly bridges seemingly unrelated areas of nonequilibrium physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Frequency Combs with Path Identity for Quantum Remote Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensing promises to revolutionize sensing applications by employing quantum states of light or matter as sensing probes. Photons are the clear choice as quantum probes for remote sensing because they can travel to and interact with a distant target. Existing schemes are mainly based on the quantum illumination framework, which requires a quantum memory to store a single photon of an initially entangled pair until its twin reflects off a target and returns for final correlation measurements. Existing demonstrations are limited to tabletop experiments, and expanding the sensing range faces various roadblocks, including long-time quantum storage and photon loss and noise when transmitting quantum signals over long distances. We propose a novel quantum sensing framework that addresses these challenges using quantum frequency combs with path identity for remote sensing of signatures (``qCOMBPASS"). The combination of one key quantum phenomenon and two quantum resources, namely quantum induced coherence by path identity, quantum frequency combs, and two-mode squeezed light, allows for quantum remote sensing without requiring a quantum memory. The proposed scheme is akin to a quantum radar based on entangled frequency comb pairs that uses path identity to detect/range/sense a remote target of interest by measuring pulses of one comb in the pair that never flew to target, but that contains target information ``teleported" by quantum-induced coherence from the other comb in the pair that did fly to target but is not detected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long-standing challenge in quantum error correction is the infeasibility of universal transversal gates, as shown by the Eastin-Knill theorem. We obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for a quantum code to have universal transversal gates and show that the Eastin-Knill no-go result is a special case that does not hold for a general error model. We present a code construction using~$n$~$d$-dimensional systems that changes the logical error probability from a lower bound~$ \Omega(\nicefrac{1}{n\log d})$ to an upper bound~$\mathcal O (\nicefrac{1}{n d})$ and allows exact correction of both local and correlated errors. Our universality condition determines the existence of a universal gate set for any quantum error-correcting code.</description>

      <title>Towards a benchmark for quantum computers based on an iterated post-selective protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applying post selection in each step of an iterated protocol leads to sensitive quantum dynamics that may be utilized to test and benchmark current quantum computers. An example of this type of protocols was originally proposed for the task of matching an unknown quantum state to a reference state. We propose to employ the quantum state matching protocol for the purpose of testing and benchmarking quantum computers. In particular, we implement this scheme on freely available IBM superconducting quantum computers. By comparing measured values with the theoretical conditional probability of the single, final post-selected qubit, which is easy to calculate classically, we define a benchmark metric. Additionally, the standard deviation of the experimental results from their average serves as a secondary benchmark metric, characterizing fluctuations in the given device. A peculiar feature of the considered protocol is that there is a phase parameter of the initially prepared state, on which the resulting conditional probability should not depend. A careful analysis of the measured values indicates that its dependence on the initial phase can reveal useful information about coherent gate errors of the quantum device.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computing is crucial for realizing large-scale quantum computation, and the interplay between hardware architecture and quantum error-correcting codes is a key consideration. We present a comparative study of two quantum error-correcting codes - the surface code and the honeycomb Floquet code - implemented on variants of the spin-optical quantum computing architecture, enabling a direct comparison of the codes using consistent noise models. Our results demonstrate that the honeycomb Floquet code significantly outperforms the surface code in this setting. Notably, we achieve a photon loss threshold of 6.4% for the honeycomb Floquet code implementation - to our knowledge the highest reported for photonic platforms to date without large-scale multiplexing. This finding is particularly significant given that photon loss is the primary source of errors in photon-mediated quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Effects of DM and KSEA interactions on entanglement, Fisher and Wigner-Yanase information correlations of two XYZ-Heisenberg-qubit states under a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ entanglement negativity, local quantum uncertainty (LQU), and local quantum Fisher information (LQFI) to characterize thermal entanglement between two XYZ-Heisenberg-qubit states under the influence of Dzyaloshinsky Moriya (DM) and Kaplan Shekhtman Entin Wohlman Aharony (KSEA) interactions, as well as a magnetic field and thermal equilibrium temperature. A comparative examination reveals similar behaviors among these correlation measures. For the antiferromagnetic scenario, we observe that increasing the DM interaction parameter Dz enhances thermal entanglement. Conversely, in the ferromagnetic case, the behavior of thermal entanglement differs with varying Dz. Additionally, employing Kraus operators, we explore the performance of these quantifiers under decoherence. Notably, LQFI exhibits greater robustness than negativity and LQU, even displaying a frozen phenomenon at some time under dephasing effects.</description>

      <title>Entanglement, information and non-equilibrium phase transitions in long-range open quantum Ising chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium phase transitions of open quantum systems generically exhibit diverging classical but not quantum correlations. Still entanglement -- characterizing the latter correlations -- can be sensitive to the phase transition. Furthermore, mutual information, bounding the total correlations, should exhibit critical scaling at the transition. In this work, we study these quantities in the steady state of open quantum Ising chains with power-law interactions (with the exponent $0\le \alpha \le 3$) where spins are subject to spontaneous emission. The bulk of this paper is dedicated to a detailed analytical as well as numerical analysis of the infinite-range model ($\alpha=0$), a model that is closely related to the paradigmatic open Dicke model. Our main findings are that the entanglement, while being finite, peaks, exhibits a kink and takes a universal value at the transition, while the mutual information exhibits critical scaling not only at the transition but well into the ordered phase, underscoring a hidden criticality that is not captured by (two-point) correlations. We consider three distinct entanglement measures: logarithmic negativity; quantum Fisher information; and, spin squeezing. Specifically, we show that the collective spin operator that maximizes the quantum Fisher information can be identified with the \textit{gapless} mode of the phase transition, while the squeezed direction is that of the \textit{gapped} mode. Finally, we investigate power-law interacting models using matrix product states where we find comparable bounds on squeezing even when no phase transition is expected (for larger $\alpha$), thus the connection to the phase transition does not appear to hold for shorter-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Exchange-Only Spin-Orbit Qubits in Silicon and Germanium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong spin-orbit interaction in silicon and germanium hole quantum dots enables all-electric microwave control of single spins but is unsuited for multi-spin exchange-only qubits that rely on scalable discrete signals to suppress cross-talk and heating effects in large quantum processors. Here, we propose an exchange-only spin-orbit qubit that utilizes spin-orbit interactions to implement qubit gates and keeps the beneficial properties of the original encoding. Our encoding is robust to significant local variability in hole spin properties and, because it operates with two degenerate states, it eliminates the need for the rotating frame, avoiding the technologically demanding constraints of fast clocks and precise signal calibration. Unlike current exchange-only qubits, which require complex multi-step sequences prone to leakage, our qubit design enables low-leakage two-qubit gates in a single step, addressing critical challenges in scaling spin qubits.</description>

      <title>How do we Observe Relational Observables?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In theories with a diffeomorphism symmetry, such as general relativity and canonical quantum gravity, it is often proposed that the empirical content is encoded in relational observables. But how do relational observables actually make contact with experience? I argue that this question can only be answered by providing a schematization of the observer which is appropriate for the context of a diffeomorphism-invariant theory. I suggest that this may require us to move away from a `passive awareness' conception of consciousness towards a more agential conception, because there is a clear sense in which an embodied agent must experience herself as localised at a time. Finally, I consider what this means for the prospects of using quantum reference frames to address the problem of time, arguing that the way in which quantum reference frames are standardly described does not give us adequate resources to model agency, so some other kind of internal reference frame may be required to fully explain how we observe relational observables in the quantum context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-medium effective carriers with position-dependent mass in a multishell heterostructure are analytically studied. We obtain the exact spectrum of three-dimensional bound eigenstates and the scattering wave-functions for several von Roos ordering classes. Ascribing a continuously varying mass to the carriers in a multilayer type spherical system we use our solutions to compute optical properties such as the absorption coefficients and refraction indices of a nanometric heterostructure. We analyze in detail the case of a GaAs/Al-GaAs alloy and show how these results depend on the ordering class of the kinetic Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Highly Excited Electron Cyclotron for QCD Axion and Dark-Photon Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose using highly excited cyclotron states of a trapped electron to detect meV axion and dark photon dark matter, marking a significant improvement over our previous proposal and demonstration [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 261801]. When the axion mass matches the cyclotron frequency $\omega_c$, the cyclotron state is resonantly excited, with a transition probability proportional to its initial quantum number, $n_c$. The sensitivity is enhanced by taking $n_c \sim 10^6 \left( \frac{0.1~\text{meV}}{\omega_c} \right)^2$. By optimizing key experimental parameters, we minimize the required averaging time for cyclotron detection to $t_{\text{ave}} \sim 10^{-6} $ seconds, permitting detection of such a highly excited state before its decay. An open-endcap trap design enables the external photon signal to be directed into the trap, rendering our background-free detector compatible with large focusing cavities, such as the BREAD proposal, while capitalizing on their strong magnetic fields. Furthermore, the axion conversion rate can be coherently enhanced by incorporating layers of dielectrics with alternating refractive indices within the cavity. Collectively, these optimizations enable us to probe the QCD axion parameter space from 0.1 meV to 2.3 meV (25-560 GHz), covering a substantial portion of the predicted post-inflationary QCD axion mass range. This sensitivity corresponds to probing the kinetic mixing parameter of the dark photon down to $\epsilon \approx 2 \times 10^{-16}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Inspired Portfolio Optimization In The QUBO Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum-inspired optimization approach is proposed to study the portfolio optimization aimed at maximizing the returns of investment portfolio while minimizing its risk by diversifying investment across different asset classes. By integrating conventional approaches with quantum-inspired methods and simulation techniques for penalty coefficient estimation, this approach enables faster solutions to portfolio optimization. The proposed two-stage search strategy further enhances the method by starting with a broad search to quickly identify potential solutions and then refining these results to increase accuracy. The effectiveness of our approach is validated through experiments using a real-world dataset of quarterly financial data spanning ten years. Moreover, the effectiveness of various portfolio strategies under volatile market conditions is also investigated with emphasis on the robustness and predictive capacity of our methodology. This research contributes to the growing body of literature on quantum-inspired techniques in finance, demonstrating its potential as a powerful tool for asset allocation and portfolio management.</description>

      <title>The robustness of skyrmion numbers of structured optical fields in atmospheric turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of vector optical fields has brought forth numerous applications. Among these optical fields, a particular class of vector vortex beams has emerged, leading to the emergence of intriguing optical skyrmion fields characterized by skyrmion numbers. The optical skyrmion fields are well-defined by their effective magnetization and possess topologically protected configurations. It is anticipated that this type of optical structure can be exploited for encoding information in optical communication, even under perturbations such as turbulent air, optical fibers, and even general random media. In this study, we numerically demonstrate that the skyrmion numbers of optical skyrmion fields exhibit a certain degree of robustness to atmospheric turbulence, even though their intensity, phase and polarization patterns are distorted. Intriguingly, it is also observed that a larger difference between the absolute values of two azimuthal indices of the vectorial structured light field can lead to a superior level of resilience. These properties not only enhance the versatility of skyrmion fields and their numbers, but also open up new possibilities for their use in various applications across noisy channels.</description>

      <title>Formation and Controlling of Optical Hopfions in High Harmonic Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Toroidal vortex is a kind of novel and exotic structured light with potential applications in photonic topology and quantum information. Here, we present the study on high harmonic generation (HHG) from the interaction of the intense toroidal vortices with atoms. We show that the spatial distribution of harmonic spectra reveal unique structures, which are kinds of high-order topological toroidal vortex because of the rotating of the driving fields with transverse orbital angular momentum. Then we show that, by synthesizing the toroidal vortices and optical vortices with longitudinal orbital angular momentum, it is able to generate the optical hopfions in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) range, which exhibit completely different topological property compared with both the driving fields. Harnessing the spin angular momentum selection rules, we further show that one can control the topological texture and channel each harmonic into a single mode of controllable Hopf invariant.</description>

      <title>Observation of Higgs and Goldstone modes in U(1) symmetry-broken Rydberg atomic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higgs and Goldstone modes manifest as fluctuations in the order parameter of system, offering insights into its phase transitions and symmetry properties. Exploring the dynamics of these collective excitations in a Rydberg atoms system advances various branches of condensed matter, particle physics, and cosmology. Here, we report an experimental signature of Higgs and Goldstone modes in a U(1) symmetry-broken Rydberg atomic gases. By constructing two probe fields to excite atoms, we observe the distinct phase and amplitude fluctuations of Rydberg atoms collective excitations under the particle-hole symmetry. Due to the van der Waals interactions between the Rydberg atoms, we detect a symmetric variance spectrum divided by the divergent regime and phase boundary, capturing the full dynamics of the additional Higgs and Goldstone modes. Studying the Higgs and Goldstone modes in Rydberg atoms allows us to explore fundamental aspects of quantum phase transitions and symmetry breaking phenomena, while leveraging the unique properties of these highly interacting systems to uncover new physics and potential applications in quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Vortex bound states in dimerized $\pi$-flux optical lattices: characterization, state preparation and current measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice models display bound states for repulsive interactions that smoothly connect to high-energy two-particle states of doubly occupied sites, namely doublons, for strong onsite interactions. In this work, we show that a distinct type of repulsively bound states, namely vortex bound states of two bosons, appear in dimerized square lattices pierced by a uniform $\pi$-flux for moderate interactions. By focusing on a ladder geometry as an illustrative example, we characterize their properties, including chirality-changing decay channels induced by flux detuning, and we develop protocols to perform state preparation in optical lattices via adiabatic sequences or recently developed current imprinting methods. Finally, we show how to measure currents and thus chirality by quenching the system onto isolated pairs of nearest-neighbor sites and then sampling the corresponding dynamics. These results can also provide an experimentally realistic strategy for state preparation and probing of chiral gapped many-body phases in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit coupled mean-field Bose gas at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the spin-orbit coupled Bose gas with repulsive mean-field interparticle interactions. We analyze the phase diagram of the system varying the temperature $T&gt;0$, the chemical potentials, as well as interparticle and spin-orbit interaction couplings. Our results indicate that, for Rashba- and Weyl-type spin-orbit couplings, condensates featuring ordering wavevector $\vec{Q}\neq \vec{0}$ are fragile with respect to thermal fluctuations and, at $T&gt;0$, the only stable thermodynamic phases involving the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) are those of uniform type with $\vec{Q}=\vec{0}$. On the other hand, presence of the spin-orbit coupling stabilizes the $\vec{Q}=\vec{0}$ BEC state at any dimensionality $d&gt;1$ and modifies either the order or the universality class of the corresponding phase transition. We emphasize the singular nature of the limit of vanishing spin-orbit interaction coupling $v$, sizable shifts of the phase boundaries upon varying $v$, as well as the role of the relative magnitudes of the interparticle interaction couplings for the character of the condensation transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among interesting applications of cold atoms, quantum simulations attract a lot of attention. In this context, rare-earth ultracold atoms are particularly appealing for such simulators due to their numerous Fano-Feshbach resonances and magnetic dipole moments in the ground state. However, creating a quantum gas microscope with these atoms presents challenges, primarily because of the need to transfer the atoms from the main cooling chamber to another chamber with large optical access. Stray magnetic fields complicate this transfer by exerting forces on the atoms. Using thulium atoms as an example, the study demonstrates that stray magnetic fields can be measured directly using the atoms themselves, allowing for these fields to be accounted for during the transfer process. This approach significantly improves the efficiency of the transfer, allowing to transfer over 1/3 of the atoms from the main chamber to the scientific chamber, located 56 cm away.</description>

      <title>Ring-exchange physics in a chain of three-level ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the presence of ring exchange interactions, bosons in a ladder-like lattice may form the bosonic analogon of a correlated metal, known as the d-wave Bose liquid (DBL). In this Letter, we show that a chain of trapped ions with three internal levels can be used to mimic a ladder-like system constrained to a maximum occupation of one boson per rung. The setup enables tunable ring exchange interactions, giving rise to a transition between a polarized regime with all bosons confined to one leg and the DBL regime. The latter state is characterized by a splitting of the peak in the momentum distribution and an oscillating pair correlation function.</description>

      <title>Thermomajorization Mpemba Effect: Unification and Universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect is a counterintuitive physical phenomenon where a hot system cools faster than a warm one. In recent years, theoretical analyses of the Mpemba effect have been developed for microscopic systems and experimentally verified. However, the conventional theory relies on a specific choice of distance measure to quantify relaxation speed, leading to several theoretical ambiguities. In this Letter, we derive a rigorous quantification of the Mpemba effect based on thermomajorization theory, referred to as the thermomajorization Mpemba effect. This approach resolves all existing ambiguities and provides a unification of the conventional Mpemba effect across all monotone measures. Furthermore, we demonstrate the universality of the thermomajorization Mpemba effect for Markovian dynamics, rigorously proving that it can occur in any temperature regime with fixed energy levels. Our findings offer a paradigm shift in understanding thermal relaxation processes and provide insights into designing systems that exhibit the Mpemba effect.</description>

      <title>Kramers-Wannier self-duality and non-invertible translation symmetry in quantum chains: a wave-function perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kramers-Wannier self-duality of critical quantum chains is examined from the perspective of model wave functions. We demonstrate, using the transverse-field Ising chain and the $3$-state Potts chain as examples, that the symmetry operator for the Kramers-Wannier self-duality follows in a simple and direct way from a `generalised' translation symmetry of the model wave function in the anyonic fusion basis. This translation operation, in turn, comprises a sequence of $F$-moves in the underlying fusion category. The symmetry operator thus obtained naturally admits the form of a matrix product operator and obeys non-invertible fusion rules. The findings reveal an intriguing connection between the (non-invertible) translation symmetry on the lattice and topological aspects of the conformal field theory describing the scaling limit.</description>

      <title>The manifestations of 'l-Doubling' in gas-phase rotational dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 'l-Doubling' phenomenon emanates from the coupling between molecular rotations and perpendicular vibrations (bending modes) in polyatomic molecules. This elusive phenomenon has been largely discarded in laser-induced molecular alignment. Here we explore and unveil the ramifications of 'l-Doubling' to the coherent rotational dynamics of triatomic molecules at ambient temperatures and above. The observed 'l-Doubling' dynamics may be wrongly considered as collisional decay throughout the first few hundreds of picoseconds past excitation, highlighting the importance of correct assimilation of l-Doubling in current research of dissipative rotational dynamics and in coherent rotational dynamics in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that a consistent coupling of a quantum theory to gravity requires an extension of ordinary `first order' Riemannian geometry to second order Riemannian geometry, which incorporates both a line element and an area element. This extension results in a misalignment between the dimension of the manifold and the dimension of the tangent spaces. In particular, we find that for a 4-dimensional spacetime, tangent spaces become 18-dimensional. We then discuss the construction of physical theories within this framework, which involves the introduction of terms that are quadratic in derivatives in the action. On a flat spacetime, the quadratic sector is perpendicular to the first order sector and only affects the normalization of the path integral, whereas in a curved spacetime the quadratic sector couples to the first order sector. Moreover, we show that, despite the introduction of higher order derivatives, the Ostragradski instability can be avoided, due to an order mixing of the two sectors. Finally, we comment on extensions to higher order geometry and on relations with non-commutative and generalized geometry.</description>

      <title>Crystallinity in Niobium oxides: A pathway to mitigate Two-Level System Defects in Niobium 3D Resonator for quantum applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials imperfections in Nniobium based superconducting quantum circuits, in particular, two-level-system (TLS) defects, are a major source of decoherence, ultimately limiting the performance of quantum computation and sensing. Thus, identifying and understanding the microscopic origin of possible TLS defects in these devices and developing strategies to eliminate them is key to superconducting qubit performance improvement. In this paper, we demonstrate the reduction of two-level system losses in three-dimensional superconducting radio frequency (SRF) niobium resonators by a 10-hour high vacuum (HV) heat treatment at 650{\deg}C, even after exposure to air and high pressure rinsing (HPR). By probing the effect of this annealing on niobium samples using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we witness an alteration of the native oxide composition re-grown after air exposure and HPR and the creation of nano-scale crystalline oxide regions, which correlates with the measured tenfold quality factor enhancement at low fields of the 1.3 GHz niobium resonator.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal-Time Quantum Algorithms for Approximate Pattern Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximate Pattern Matching is among the most fundamental string-processing tasks. Given a text $T$ of length $n$, a pattern $P$ of length $m$, and a threshold $k$, the task is to identify the fragments of $T$ that are at distance at most $k$ to $P$. We consider the two most common distances: Hamming distance (the number of character substitutions) in Pattern Matching with Mismatches and edit distance (the minimum number of character insertions, deletions, and substitutions) in Pattern Matching with Edits. We revisit the complexity of these two problems in the quantum setting.
  Our recent work [STOC'24] shows that $\hat{O}(\sqrt{nk})$ quantum queries are sufficient to solve (the decision version of) Pattern Matching with Edits. However, the quantum time complexity of the underlying solution does not provide any improvement over classical computation. On the other hand, the state-of-the-art algorithm for Pattern Matching with Mismatches [Jin and Nogler; SODA'23] achieves query complexity $\hat{O}(\sqrt{nk^{3/2}})$ and time complexity $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{nk^2})$, falling short of an unconditional lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{nk})$ queries.
  In this work, we present quantum algorithms with a time complexity of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{nk}+\sqrt{n/m}\cdot k^2)$ for Pattern Matching with Mismatches and $\hat{O}(\sqrt{nk}+\sqrt{n/m}\cdot k^{3.5})$ for Pattern Matching with Edits; both solutions use $\hat{O}(\sqrt{nk})$ queries. The running times are near-optimal for $k\ll m^{1/3}$ and $k\ll m^{1/6}$, respectively, and offer advantage over classical algorithms for $k\ll (mn)^{1/4}$ and $k\ll (mn)^{1/7}$, respectively. Our solutions can also report the starting positions of approximate occurrences of $P$ in $T$ (represented as collections of arithmetic progressions); in this case, the unconditional lower bound and the complexities of our algorithms increase by a $\Theta(\sqrt{n/m})$ factor.</description>

      <title>$\phi_0$-junction and Josephson diode effect in high-temperature superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent progress in both the Josephson diode effect (JDE) and the high-temperature Josephson junction, we propose to realize the JDE in an s-wave/d-wave/s-wave (s-d-s) superconductor junction and investigate the high-temperature superconducting order parameters. The interlayer coupling between s-wave and d-wave superconductors can induce an effective $d+is$ superconducting state, spontaneously breaking time-reversal symmetry. The asymmetric s-d interlayer couplings break the inversion symmetry. Remarkably, the breaking of these two symmetries leads to a $\phi_0$-junction but does not generate JDE. We find that the emergence of the JDE in this junction depends on the $C_4$ rotational symmetry of the system. Although breaking $C_4$ rotational symmetry does not affect time-reversal and inversion symmetries, it can control the magnitude and polarity of diode efficiency. Furthermore, we propose observing C$_{4}$ symmetry breaking controlled JDE through asymmetric Shapiro steps. Our work suggests a JDE mechanism that relies on high-temperature d-wave pairing, which could inversely contribute to a potential experimental method for detecting the unconventional pairing symmetry in superconductors.</description>

      <title>The (1+3)-dimensional 'quantum principle of relativity' is Einstein's principle of relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the $(1+3)$-dimensional `superboost' operators, proposed in Dragan and Ekert's most recent work on superluminal reference frames [arXiv:2209.01836], are simply the canonical Lorentz boosts, expressed in nonstandard notation. Their $(1+3)$-dimensional `superflip', which is claimed to interchange time and space dimensions for a superluminal observer, travelling with infinite speed, is equivalent to applying the identity operator together with an arbitrary relabelling. Physically, it corresponds to staying put within the canonical rest frame, then renaming space as `time' and time as `space'. We conclude that their extension of the `quantum principle of relativity', proposed in earlier work on $(1+1)$-dimensional spacetimes [arXiv:1910.02780], to ordinary Minkowski space [arXiv:2209.01836], is simply the principle of relativity proposed by Einstein in 1905.</description>

      <title>Exponents for Shared Randomness-Assisted Channel Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the exact error and strong converse exponents of shared randomness-assisted channel simulation in worst case total-variation distance. Namely, we find that these exponents can be written as simple optimizations over the R\'enyi channel mutual information. Strikingly, and in stark contrast to channel coding, there are no critical rates, allowing a tight characterization for arbitrary rates below and above the simulation capacity. We derive our results by asymptotically expanding the meta-converse for channel simulation [Cao {\it et al.}, IEEE Trans.~Inf.~Theory (2024)], which corresponds to non-signaling assisted codes. We prove this to be asymptotically tight by employing the approximation algorithms from [Berta {\it et al.}, Proc.~IEEE ISIT (2024)], which show how to round any non-signaling assisted strategy to a strategy that only uses shared randomness. Notably, this implies that any additional quantum entanglement-assistance does not change the error or the strong converse exponents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A system of two identical spinless bosons on the two-dimensional lattice is considered under the assumption that on-site and first and second nearest-neighboring site interactions between the bosons are only nontrivial and that these interactions are of magnitudes $\gamma$, $\lambda$, and $\mu$, respectively. A partition of the $(\gamma,\lambda,\mu)$-space into connected components is established such that, in each connected component, the two-boson Schroedinger operator corresponding to the zero quasi-momentum of the center of mass has a definite (fixed) number of eigenvalues, which are situated below the bottom of the essential (continuous) spectrum and above its top. Moreover, for each connected component, a sharp lower bound is established on the number of isolated eigenvalues for the two-boson Schr\"odinger operator corresponding to any admissible nonzero value of the center-of-mass quasimomentum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1808.02729v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of correctly identifying a malfunctioning quantum device that forms part of a network of $N$ such devices, which can be considered as the quantum analogue of classical anomaly detection. In the case where the devices in question are sources assumed to prepare identical quantum pure states, with the faulty source producing a different anomalous pure state, we show that the optimal probability of successful identification requires a global quantum measurement. We also put forth several local measurement strategies -- both adaptive and non-adaptive, that achieve the same optimal probability of success in the limit where the number of devices to be checked are large. In the case where the faulty device performs a known unitary operation we show that the use of entangled probes provides an improvement that even allows perfect identification for values of the unitary parameter that surpass a certain threshold. Finally, if the faulty device implements a known qubit channel we find that the optimal probability for detecting the position of rank-one and rank-two Pauli channels can be achieved by product state inputs and separable measurements for any size of network, whereas for rank-three and general amplitude damping channels optimal identification requires entanglement with N qubit ancillas.</description>

Abstract: Quantum states are the key mathematical objects in quantum mechanics, and entanglement lies at the heart of the nascent fields of quantum information processing and computation. However, there has not been a general, necessary and sufficient, and operational separability condition to determine whether an arbitrary quantum state is entangled or separable. In this paper, we show that whether a quantum state is entangled or not is determined by a threshold within the quantum state. We first introduce the concept of \emph{finer} and \emph{optimal} separable states based on the properties of separable states in the role of higher-level witnesses. Then we show that any bipartite quantum state can be decomposed into a convex mixture of its optimal entangled state and its optimal separable state. Furthermore, we show that whether an arbitrary quantum state is entangled or separable, as well as positive partial transposition (PPT) or not, is determined by the robustness of its optimal entangled state to its optimal separable state with reference to a crucial threshold. Moreover, for an arbitrary quantum state, we provide operational algorithms to obtain its optimal entangled state, its optimal separable state, its best separable approximation (BSA) decomposition, and its best PPT approximation decomposition while it was an open question that how to calculate the BSA in high-dimension systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum generalisation of Einstein's Equivalence Principle can be verified with entangled clocks as quantum reference frames</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.03303v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Einstein Equivalence Principle (EEP) is of crucial importance to test the foundations of general relativity. When the particles involved in the test exhibit quantum properties, it is unknown whether this principle still holds. A violation of the EEP would have drastic consequences for physics. A more conservative possibility is that the EEP holds in a generalised form for delocalised quantum particles. Here we formulate such a generalised EEP by extending one of its paradigmatic tests with clocks to quantum clocks that are in a quantum superposition of positions and velocities. We show that the validity of such a generalised version of the EEP is equivalent to the possibility of transforming to the perspective of an arbitrary Quantum Reference Frame (QRF), namely a reference frame associated to the quantum state of the clock. We further show that this generalised EEP can be verified by measuring the proper time of entangled clocks in a quantum superposition of positions in the Earth gravitational field. The violation of the generalised EEP corresponds to the impossibility of defining dynamical evolution in the frame of each clock, and results in a modification to the probabilities of measurements calculated in the laboratory frame. Hence, it can be verified experimentally, for instance in an atom interferometer.</description>

Abstract: A central building block of many quantum algorithms is the diagonalization of Pauli operators. Although it is always possible to construct a quantum circuit that simultaneously diagonalizes a given set of commuting Pauli operators, only resource-efficient circuits can be executed reliably on near-term quantum computers. Generic diagonalization circuits, in contrast, often lead to an unaffordable Swap gate overhead on quantum devices with limited hardware connectivity. A common alternative is to exclude two-qubit gates altogether. However, this comes at the severe cost of restricting the class of diagonalizable sets of Pauli operators to tensor product bases (TPBs). In this article, we introduce a theoretical framework for constructing hardware-tailored (HT) diagonalization circuits. Our framework establishes a systematic and highly flexible procedure for tailoring diagonalization circuits with ultra-low gate counts. We highlight promising use cases of our framework and - as a proof-of-principle application - we devise an efficient algorithm for grouping the Pauli operators of a given Hamiltonian into jointly-HT-diagonalizable sets. For several classes of Hamiltonians, we observe that our approach requires fewer measurements than conventional TPB approaches. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that HT circuits can improve the efficiency of estimating expectation values with cloud-based quantum computers.</description>

      <title>On the Optimal Linear Contraction Order of Tree Tensor Networks, and Beyond</title>

Abstract: The contraction cost of a tensor network depends on the contraction order. However, the optimal contraction ordering problem is known to be NP-hard. We show that the linear contraction ordering problem for tree tensor networks admits a polynomial-time algorithm, by drawing connections to database join ordering. The result relies on the adjacent sequence interchange property of the contraction cost, which enables a global decision of the contraction order based on local comparisons. Based on that, we specify a modified version of the IKKBZ database join ordering algorithm to find the optimal tree tensor network linear contraction order. Finally, we extend our algorithm as a heuristic to general contraction orders and arbitrary tensor network topologies.</description>

Abstract: While volume violation of area law has been exhibited in several quantum spin chains, the construction of a corresponding ground state in higher dimensions, entangled in more than one direction, has been an open problem. Here we construct a 2D frustration-free Hamiltonian with maximal violation of the area law. We do so by building a quantum model of random surfaces with color degree of freedom that can be viewed as a collection of colored Dyck paths. The Hamiltonian may be viewed as a 2D generalization of the Fredkin spin chain. It relates all the colored random surface configurations subject to a Dirichlet boundary condition and hard wall constraint from below to one another, and the ground state is therefore a superposition of all such classical states and non-degenerate. Its entanglement entropy between subsystems undergoes a quantum phase transition as the deformation parameter is tuned. The area- and volume-law phases are similar to the one-dimensional model, while the critical point scales with the linear size of the system $L$ as $L\log L$. Further it is conjectured that similar models with entanglement phase transitions can be built in higher dimensions with even softer area law violations at the critical point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13736v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to the pioneering work of Nielsen and collaborators, the length of the minimal geodesic in a geometric realization of a suitable operator space provides a measure of the quantum complexity of an operation. Compared with the original concept of complexity based on the minimal number of gates required to construct the desired operation as a product, this geometrical approach amounts to a more concrete and computable definition, but its evaluation is nontrivial in systems with a high-dimensional Hilbert space. The geometrical formulation can more easily be evaluated by considering the geometry associated with a suitable finite-dimensional group generated by a small number of relevant operators of the system. In this way, the method has been applied in particular to the harmonic oscillator, which is also of interest in the present paper. However, subtle and previously unrecognized issues of group theory can lead to unforeseen complications, motivating a new formulation that remains on the level of the underlying Lie algebras for most of the required steps. Novel insights about complexity can thereby be found in a low-dimensional setting, with the potential of systematic extensions to higher dimensions as well as interactions. Specific examples include the quantum complexity of various target unitary operators associated with a harmonic oscillator, inverted harmonic oscillator, and coupled harmonic oscillators. The generality of this approach is demonstrated by an application to an anharmonic oscillator with a cubic term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01955v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We comment on the so-called negative-result experiments (also known as null measurements, interaction-free measurements, and so on) in quantum mechanics (QM), in the light of the new general understanding of the quantum-measurement processes, proposed recently. All experiments of this kind (null-measurements) can be understood as improper measurements with an intentionally biased detector set up, which introduces exclusion or selection of certain events. The prediction on the state of a microscopic system under study based on a null measurement, is sometimes dramatically described as ``wave-function collapse without any microsystem-detector interactions". Though certainly correct, such a prediction is just a consequence of the standard QM laws, not different from the situation in the so-called state-preparation procedure. Another closely related concept is the (first-class or) repeatable measurements. The verification of the prediction made by a null-measurement requires eventually a standard unbiased measurement involving the microsystem-macroscopic detector interactions, which are nonadiabatic, irreversible processes of signal amplification.</description>

      <title>Non-asymptotic Approximation Error Bounds of Parameterized Quantum Circuits</title>

Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have emerged as a promising approach for quantum neural networks. However, understanding their expressive power in accomplishing machine learning tasks remains a crucial question. This paper investigates the expressivity of PQCs for approximating general multivariate function classes. Unlike previous Universal Approximation Theorems for PQCs, which are either nonconstructive or rely on parameterized classical data processing, we explicitly construct data re-uploading PQCs for approximating multivariate polynomials and smooth functions. We establish the first non-asymptotic approximation error bounds for these functions in terms of the number of qubits, quantum circuit depth, and number of trainable parameters. Notably, we demonstrate that for approximating functions that satisfy specific smoothness criteria, the quantum circuit size and number of trainable parameters of our proposed PQCs can be smaller than those of deep ReLU neural networks. We further validate the approximation capability of PQCs through numerical experiments. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for designing practical PQCs and quantum neural networks for machine learning tasks that can be implemented on near-term quantum devices, paving the way for the advancement of quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>Tensor Network Decoding Beyond 2D</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decoding algorithms based on approximate tensor network contraction have proven tremendously successful in decoding 2D local quantum codes such as surface/toric codes and color codes, effectively achieving optimal decoding accuracy. In this work, we introduce several techniques to generalize tensor network decoding to higher dimensions so that it can be applied to 3D codes as well as 2D codes with noisy syndrome measurements (phenomenological noise or circuit-level noise). The three-dimensional case is significantly more challenging than 2D, as the involved approximate tensor contraction is dramatically less well-behaved than its 2D counterpart. Nonetheless, we numerically demonstrate that the decoding accuracy of our approach outperforms state-of-the-art decoders on the 3D surface code, both in the point and loop sectors, as well as for depolarizing noise. Our techniques could prove useful in near-term experimental demonstrations of quantum error correction, when decoding is to be performed offline and accuracy is of utmost importance. To this end, we show how tensor network decoding can be applied to circuit-level noise and demonstrate that it outperforms the matching decoder on the rotated surface code.

      <title>Simultaneous Measurement of Multiple Incompatible Observables and Tradeoff in Multiparameter Quantum Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How well can multiple incompatible observables be implemented by a single measurement? This is a fundamental problem in quantum mechanics with wide implications for the performance optimization of numerous tasks in quantum information science. While existing studies have been mostly focusing on the approximation of two observables with a single measurement, in practice multiple observables are often encountered, for which the errors of the approximations are little understood. Here we provide a framework to study the implementation of an arbitrary finite number of observables with a single measurement. Our methodology yields novel analytical bounds on the errors of these implementations, significantly advancing our understanding of this fundamental problem. Additionally, we introduce a more stringent bound utilizing semi-definite programming that, in the context of two observables, generates an analytical bound tighter than previously known bounds. The derived bounds have direct applications in assessing the trade-off between the precision of estimating multiple parameters in quantum metrology, an area with crucial theoretical and practical implications. To validate the validity of our findings, we conducted experimental verification using a superconducting quantum processor. This experimental validation not only confirms the theoretical results but also effectively bridges the gap between the derived bounds and empirical data obtained from real-world experiments. Our work paves the way for optimizing various tasks in quantum information science that involve multiple noncommutative observables.</description>

      <title>Dimension-independent weak value estimation via controlled SWAP operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weak values of quantum observables are a powerful tool for investigating quantum phenomena. Some methods for measuring weak values in the laboratory require weak interactions and postselection, while others are deterministic, but require statistics over a number of experiments that grows linearly with the dimension of the measured system in the worst case over all possible observables. Here we propose a deterministic dimension-independent scheme for estimating weak values of arbitrary observables. The scheme is based on controlled SWAP operations, and associates states and observables in the mathematical expression of the weak value to preparations devices and measurements devices in the experimental setup, respectively. Thanks to this feature, it provides insights into the relation between states of two identical quantum systems at a single moment of time and states of a single quantum system at two moments of time, also known as two-time states. Specifically, our scheme provides an alternative expression for two-time states, and establishes a link between two-time states accessible through the controlled-SWAP scheme and bipartite quantum states with positive partial transpose.</description>

Abstract: Recently, it was shown that if two distant test masses, each in a spatially superposed quantum state, become entangled due to their mutual gravitational interaction, then this entanglement could serve as evidence of the quantum nature of gravity. We extend this treatment to a many-body system in a general setup and study the entanglement properties of the time-evolved state. We exactly compute the time-dependent I-concurrence for every bipartition and obtain the necessary and sufficient condition for the creation of genuine many-body entanglement. We further show that this entanglement is of generalised GHZ type when certain conditions are met. We also evaluate the amount of multipartite entanglement in the system using a set of generalised Meyer-Wallach measures.</description>

      <title>CAMEL: Physically Inspired Crosstalk-Aware Mapping and gatE scheduLing for Frequency-Tunable Quantum Chips</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18160v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crosstalk represents a formidable obstacle in quantum computing. When quantum gates are executed parallelly, the resonance of qubit frequencies can lead to residual coupling, compromising the fidelity. Existing crosstalk solutions encounter difficulties in mitigating crosstalk and decoherence when dealing with parallel two-qubit gates in frequency-tunable quantum chips. Inspired by the physical properties of frequency-tunable quantum chips, we introduce a Crosstalk-Aware Mapping and gatE Scheduling (CAMEL) approach to address these challenges. CAMEL aims to mitigate crosstalk of parallel two-qubit gates and suppress decoherence. Utilizing the features of the tunable coupler, the CAMEL approach integrates a pulse compensation method for crosstalk mitigation. Furthermore, we present a compilation framework, including two steps. Firstly, we devise a qubit mapping approach that accounts for both crosstalk and decoherence. Secondly, we introduce a gate timing scheduling approach capable of prioritizing the execution of the largest set of crosstalk-free parallel gates to shorten quantum circuit execution times. Evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of CAMEL in mitigating crosstalk compared to crosstalk-agnostic methods. Furthermore, in contrast to approaches serializing crosstalk gates, CAMEL successfully suppresses decoherence. Finally, CAMEL exhibits better performance over dynamic-frequency awareness in low-complexity hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effects of chromatic dispersion on single-photon temporal wave functions (TWFs) in the context of quantum communications. Departing from classical beam analysis, we focus on the temporal shape of single photons, specifically exploring generalized Gaussian modes. From this foundation, we introduce chirped and unchirped Gaussian TWFs, demonstrating the impact of the chirp parameter in mitigating chromatic dispersion effects. Furthermore, we extend our investigation to time-bin qubits, a topic of ongoing research relevance. By exploring the interplay of dispersion effects on qubit interference patterns, we contribute essential insights to quantum information processing. This comprehensive analysis considers various parameters, introducing a level of complexity not previously explored in the context of dispersion management. We demonstrate the relationships between different quantities and their impact on the spreading of TWFs. Our results not only deepen the theoretical understanding of single-photon TWFs but also offer practical guidelines for system designers to optimize symbol rates in quantum communications.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the dimensionality of bipartite quantum systems by construction of a device-independent null witness test. This test assesses whether a given bipartite state conforms with the expected quantum dimension, Schmidt number, and distinguishes between real and complex spaces. By employing local measurements on each party, the proposed method aims to determine the minimal rank. By performing an experimental demonstration on IBM Quantum devices, we prove the exceptional accuracy of the test and its usefulness in diagnostics beyond routine calibrations.
  One of the tests shows agreement with theoretical expectations within statistical errors. However, the second test failed by more than 6 standard deviations, indicating unspecified parasitic entanglements, with no known simple origin.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing promises to provide the next step up in computational power for diverse application areas. In this review, we examine the science behind the quantum hype, and the breakthroughs required to achieve true quantum advantage in real world applications. Areas that are likely to have the greatest impact on high performance computing (HPC) include simulation of quantum systems, optimization, and machine learning. We draw our examples from electronic structure calculations and computational fluid dynamics which account for a large fraction of current scientific and engineering use of HPC. Potential challenges include encoding and decoding classical data for quantum devices, and mismatched clock speeds between classical and quantum processors. Even a modest quantum enhancement to current classical techniques would have far-reaching impacts in areas such as weather forecasting, aerospace engineering, and the design of "green" materials for sustainable development. This requires significant effort from the computational science, engineering and quantum computing communities working together.</description>

      <title>Weak value advantage in overcoming noise on the primary system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The weak value exhibits numerous intriguing characteristics, such as values outside the operator spectrum, leading to unexpected phenomena. The measurement protocol used for measuring the weak value has been the subject of an on-going controversy. In particular, the possibility of gaining a metrological advantage using weak measurements was questioned. A rigorous characterization of this advantage is still missing when the primary system is noisy. We thus consider here the challenge of learning an unknown operator under the influence of noise on the primary system. For unital noise channels, we prove that the weak value measurement protocol (WVMP) is quadratically more robust to noise than strong measurements. Since the WVMP makes use both of weak entanglement as well as postselection, one might suspect that the advantage is solely due to the postselection aspect of the WVMP. We refute this by showing that for the amplitude and phase damping noise channel, the WVMP achieves a quadratic advantage even over strong measurement protocols which are allowed to apply postselection. By this we rigorously prove that in certain cases, the WVMP possesses a strict, provable advantage in robustness to noise.</description>

      <title>Integrated photonic structures for photon-mediated entanglement of trapped ions</title>

Abstract: Trapped atomic ions are natural candidates for quantum information processing and have the potential to realize or improve quantum computing, sensing, and networking. These applications often require the collection of individual photons emitted from ions into guided optical modes, in some cases for the production of entanglement between separated ions. Proof-of-principle demonstrations of such photon collection from trapped ions have been performed using high-numerical-aperture lenses or cavities and single-mode fibers, but integrated photonic elements in ion-trap structures offer advantages in scalability and manufacturabilty over traditional optics. In this paper we analyze structures monolithically fabricated with an ion trap for collecting ion-emitted photons, coupling them into waveguides, and manipulating them via interference. We calculate geometric limitations on collection efficiency for this scheme, simulate a single-layer grating that shows performance comparable to demonstrated free-space optics, and discuss practical fabrication and fidelity considerations. Based on this analysis, we conclude that integrated photonics can support scalable systems of trapped-ions that can distribute quantum information via photon-mediated entanglement.</description>

      <title>Federated learning with distributed fixed design quantum chips and quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13421v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The privacy in classical federated learning can be breached through the use of local gradient results combined with engineered queries to the clients. However, quantum communication channels are considered more secure because a measurement on the channel causes a loss of information, which can be detected by the sender. Therefore, the quantum version of federated learning can be used to provide better privacy. Additionally, sending an $N$-dimensional data vector through a quantum channel requires sending $\log N$ entangled qubits, which can potentially provide efficiency if the data vector is utilized as quantum states.
  In this paper, we propose a quantum federated learning model in which fixed design quantum chips are operated based on the quantum states sent by a centralized server. Based on the incoming superposition states, the clients compute and then send their local gradients as quantum states to the server, where they are aggregated to update parameters. Since the server does not send model parameters, but instead sends the operator as a quantum state, the clients are not required to share the model. This allows for the creation of asynchronous learning models. In addition, the model is fed into client-side chips directly as a quantum state; therefore, it does not require measurements on the incoming quantum state to obtain model parameters in order to compute gradients. This can provide efficiency over models where the parameter vector is sent via classical or quantum channels and local gradients are obtained through the obtained values these parameters.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement assisted via Duffing nonlinearity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16809v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to enhance quantum entanglement in an optomechanical system by exploiting the so-called Duffing nonlinearity. Our model system consists of two mechanically coupled mechanical resonators, both driven by an optical field. One resonator supports Duffing nonlinearity, while the other does not.The resonators are coupled to each other via the so-called phonon hopping mechanism. The hopping rate is $\theta$-phase-dependent that induces Exceptional Points (EPs) singularities in the system. Interestingly, while the resonator with Duffing nonlinearity exhibits vanishing entanglement with light, we observe an increase in entanglement between light and the other mechanical resonator. This enhanced entanglement persists longer against thermal fluctuations compared to the one without the nonlinearity. Additionally, this entanglement features a sudden death and revival phenomenon, where the peaks happen at the multiple of $\theta=\frac{\pi}{2}$. This work opens a new avenue for exploiting nonlinear resources to generate strong quantum entanglement, paving the way for advancements in quantum information processing, quantum sensing, and quantum computing within complex systems.</description>

      <title>Robust Error Accumulation Suppression for Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a robust error accumulation suppression (REAS) technique to manage errors in quantum computers. Our method reduces the accumulation of errors in any quantum circuit composed of single- or two-qubit gates expressed as $e^{-i \sigma\theta }$ for Pauli operators $\sigma$ and $\theta \in [0,\pi)$, which forms a universal gate set. For coherent errors -- which include gate overrotation and crosstalk -- we demonstrate a reduction of the error scaling in an $L$-depth circuit from $O(L)$ to $O(\sqrt{L})$. This asymptotic error suppression behavior can be proven in a regime where all gates -- including those constituting the error-suppressing protocol itself -- are noisy. Going beyond coherent errors, we derive the general form of decoherence noise that can be suppressed by REAS. Lastly, we experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach regarding realistic errors using 100-qubit circuits with up to 64 two-qubit gate layers on IBM Quantum processors.</description>

Abstract: Local measurements cannot create entanglement, but they can convert short-range entanglement to long-range entanglement, as in quantum teleportation. This phenomenon of measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) has been widely discussed in recent work on measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions and related phenomena. Here, we situate MIE in a broader context of the growth of long-range conditional mutual information (CMI) under decoherence. We upper-bound the rate at which decoherence can generate long-range CMI, and derive a characterization of states that saturate this bound. We point out that the structure of states saturating the CMI upper bound can be very different under different decoherent dynamics and provide explicit examples. We additionally explore the dynamics of CMI in random quantum circuits subject to random local decoherence, as a function of circuit depth. We argue that the universality class of the finite-depth teleportation transition, as well as its lower critical dimension, are different for erasures than for measurements.</description>

      <title>Trainability Barriers in Low-Depth QAOA Landscapes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) is a prominent variational quantum algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Its effectiveness depends on identifying input parameters that yield high-quality solutions. However, understanding the complexity of training QAOA remains an under-explored area. Previous results have given analytical performance guarantees for a small, fixed number of parameters. At the opposite end of the spectrum, barren plateaus are likely to emerge at $\Omega(n)$ parameters for $n$ qubits. In this work, we study the difficulty of training in the intermediate regime, which is the focus of most current numerical studies and near-term hardware implementations. Through extensive numerical analysis of the quality and quantity of local minima, we argue that QAOA landscapes can exhibit a superpolynomial growth in the number of low-quality local minima even when the number of parameters scales logarithmically with $n$. This means that the common technique of gradient descent from randomly initialized parameters is doomed to fail beyond small $n$, and emphasizes the need for good initial guesses of the optimal parameters.</description>

      <title>Quantum Advantage: A Single Qubit's Experimental Edge in Classical Data Storage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We implement an experiment on a photonic quantum processor establishing efficacy of the elementary quantum system in classical information storage. The advantage is established by considering a class of simple bipartite games played with the communication resource qubit and classical bit (c-bit), respectively. Conventional wisdom, supported by the no-go theorems of Holevo and Frenkel-Weiner, suggests that such a quantum advantage is unattainable when the sender and receiver share randomness or classical correlations. However, our results reveal a quantum advantage in a scenario devoid of any shared randomness. Our experiment involves the development of a variational triangular polarimeter, enabling the realization of positive operator value measurements crucial for establishing the targeted quantum advantage. Beyond showcasing a robust communication advantage with a single qubit, our work paves the way for immediate applications in near-term quantum technologies. It provides a semi-device-independent certification scheme for quantum encoding-decoding systems and offers an efficient method for information loading and transmission in quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Single-Shot Readout and Weak Measurement of a Tin-Vacancy Qubit in Diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The negatively charged tin-vacancy center in diamond (SnV$^-$) is an emerging platform for building the next generation of long-distance quantum networks. This is due to the SnV$^-$'s favorable optical and spin properties including bright emission, insensitivity to electronic noise, and long spin coherence times at temperatures above 1 Kelvin. Here, we demonstrate measurement of a single SnV$^-$ electronic spin with a single-shot readout fidelity of $87.4\%$, which can be further improved to $98.5\%$ by conditioning on multiple readouts. We show this performance is compatible with rapid microwave spin control, demonstrating that the trade-off between optical readout and spin control inherent to group-IV centers in diamond can be overcome for the SnV$^-$. Finally, we use weak quantum measurement to study measurement induced dephasing; this illuminates the fundamental interplay between measurement and decoherence in quantum mechanics, and makes use of the qubit's spin coherence as a metrological tool. Taken together, these results overcome an important hurdle in the development of the SnV$^-$ based quantum technologies, and in the process, develop techniques and understanding broadly applicable to the study of solid-state quantum emitters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a quantum learning task called agnostic tomography, where given copies of an arbitrary state $\rho$ and a class of quantum states $\mathcal{C}$, the goal is to output a succinct description of a state that approximates $\rho$ at least as well as any state in $\mathcal{C}$ (up to some small error $\varepsilon$). This task generalizes ordinary quantum tomography of states in $\mathcal{C}$ and is more challenging because the learning algorithm must be robust to perturbations of $\rho$.
  We give an efficient agnostic tomography algorithm for the class $\mathcal{C}$ of $n$-qubit stabilizer product states. Assuming $\rho$ has fidelity at least $\tau$ with a stabilizer product state, the algorithm runs in time $n^{O(1 + \log(1/\tau))} / \varepsilon^2$. This runtime is quasipolynomial in all parameters, and polynomial if $\tau$ is a constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A pure state of fixed Hamming weight is a superposition of computational basis states such that each bitstring in the superposition has the same number of ones. Given a Hilbert space of the form $\mathcal{H} = (\mathbb{C}_2)^{\otimes n}$, or an $n$-qubit system, the identity operator can be decomposed as a sum of projectors onto subspaces of fixed Hamming weight. In this work, we propose several quantum algorithms that realize a coherent Hamming weight projective measurement on an input pure state, meaning that the post-measurement state of the algorithm is the projection of the input state onto the corresponding subspace of fixed Hamming weight. We analyze a depth-width trade-off for the corresponding quantum circuits, allowing for a depth reduction of the circuits at the cost of more control qubits. For an $n$-qubit input, the depth-optimal algorithm uses $O(n)$ control qubits and the corresponding circuit has depth $O(\log (n))$, assuming that we have the ability to perform qubit resets. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm construction uses only one- and two-qubit gates.</description>

Abstract: Metastable states of quantum many-body systems with confinement offer a means to simulate false vacuum phenomenology, including non-equilibrium dynamical processes like decay by nucleation, in truncated limits. Recent work has examined the decay process in 1D ferromagnetic Ising spins and superfluids. In this paper, we study nucleation dynamics in 1D antiferromagnetic neutral atom chains with Rydberg interactions, using both numerical simulations and analytic modeling. We apply a staggered local detuning field to generate the metastable and ground states. Our efforts focus on two dynamical regimes: decay and annealing. In the first, we corroborate the phenomenological decay rate scaling and determine the associated parameter range for the decay process; in the second, we uncover and elucidate a procedure to anneal the metastable state from the initial to the final system, with intermediate nucleation events. We further propose experimental protocols to prepare the required states and perform quenches on near-term neutral atom quantum simulators, examining the experimental feasibility of our proposed setup and parameter regime.</description>

Abstract: Metastable states arise in a range of quantum systems and can be observed in various dynamical scenarios, including decay, bubble nucleation, and long-lived oscillations. The phenomenology of metastable states has been examined in quantum many-body systems, notably in 1D ferromagnetic Ising spin systems and superfluids. In this paper, we study long-lived oscillations of metastable and ground states in 1D antiferromagnetic neutral atom chains with long-range Rydberg interactions. We use a staggered local detuning field to achieve confinement. Using theoretical and numerical models, we identify novel spectral signatures of quasiparticle oscillations distinct to antiferromagnetic neutral atom systems and interpret them using a classical energy model of short-range meson repulsion. Finally, we evaluate the experimental accessibility of our proposed setup on current neutral-atom platforms and discuss experimental feasibility and constraints.</description>

Abstract: Nonstabilizerness, or `magic', is a critical quantum resource that, together with entanglement, characterizes the non-classical complexity of quantum states. Here, we address the problem of quantifying the average nonstabilizerness of random Matrix Product States (RMPS). RMPS represent a generalization of random product states featuring bounded entanglement that scales logarithmically with the bond dimension $\chi$. We demonstrate that the $2$-Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy converges to that of Haar random states as $N/\chi^2$, where $N$ is the system size. This indicates that MPS with a modest bond dimension are as magical as generic states. Subsequently, we introduce the ensemble of Clifford enhanced Matrix Product States ($\mathcal{C}$MPS), built by the action of Clifford unitaries on RMPS. Leveraging our previous result, we show that $\mathcal{C}$MPS can approximate $4$-spherical designs with arbitrary accuracy. Specifically, for a constant $N$, $\mathcal{C}$MPS become close to $4$-designs with a scaling as $\chi^{-2}$. Our findings indicate that combining Clifford unitaries with polynomially complex tensor network states can generate highly non-trivial quantum states.</description>

Abstract: Generative machine learning models aim to learn the underlying distribution of the data in order to generate new samples. Quantum circuit Born machines (QCBMs) are a popular choice of quantum generative models which can be implemented on shallow circuits. Within the framework of photonic quantum computing, we present a QCBM designed for linear optics. We show that a new error mitigation technique, called recycling mitigation, greatly improves the training of QCBMs in realistic scenarios with photon loss, both through simulations and an experiment on a quantum photonic integrated processor.</description>

      <title>Dirac Brackets $\leftrightarrow$ Lindblad Equation: A Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The time evolution of an open quantum system is governed by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindlad equation for the reduced density operator of the system. This operator is obtained from the full density operator of the composite system involving the system itself, the bath, and the interactions between them, by performing a partial trace over the bath degrees of freedom. The entanglement between the system and the bath leads to a generalized Liouville evolution that involves, amongst other things, dissipation and decoherence of the system.
  In a similar fashion, the time evolution of a physical observable in a classically constrained dynamical system is governed by a generalization of the Liouville equation, in which the usual Poisson bracket is replaced by the so-called Dirac bracket. The generalization takes into account the reduction in the phase space of the system because of constraints which arise either because they are introduced by hand, or because of singular Lagrangians.
  We derive an intriguing, but precise classical-quantum correspondence between the aforementioned situations which connects the Lindblad operators to the constraints. The correspondence is illustrated in the ubiquitous example of coupled simple harmonic oscillators studied earlier in various contexts like quantum optics, dissipative quantum systems, Brownian motion, and the area law for the entropy of black holes.</description>

      <title>Fermi's golden rule rate expression for transitions due to nonadiabatic derivative couplings in the adiabatic basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from a general molecular Hamiltonian expressed in the basis of adiabatic electronic and nuclear position states, where a compact and complete expression for nonadiabatic derivative coupling (NDC) Hamiltonian term is obtained, we provide a general analysis of the Fermi's golden rule (FGR) rate expression for nonadiabatic transitions between adiabatic states. We then consider a quasi-adiabatic approximation that uses crude adiabatic states evaluated at the minimum potential energy configuration of the initial adiabatic state as the basis for the zeroth order adiabatic and NDC coupling terms of the Hamiltonian. Although application of this approximation is rather limited, it allows deriving a general FGR rate expression without further approximation and still accounts for non-Condon effect arising from momentum operators of NDC terms and its coupling with vibronic displacements. For a generic and widely used model where all nuclear degrees of freedom and environmental effects are represented as linearly coupled harmonic oscillators, we derive a closed form FGR rate expression that requires only Fourier transform. The resulting rate expression includes quadratic contributions of NDC terms and their couplings to Franck-Condon modes, which require evaluation of two additional bath spectral densities in addition to conventional one that appears in a typical FGR rate theory based on the Condon approximation. Model calculations for the case where nuclear vibrations consist of both a sharp high frequency mode and an Ohmic bath spectral density illustrate new features and implications of the rate expression. We then apply our theoretical expression to the nonradiative decay from the first excited singlet state of azulene, which illustrates the utility and implications of our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement enables single-shot trajectory sensing for weakly interacting particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sensors for mapping the trajectory of an incoming particle find important utility in experimental high energy physics and searches for dark matter. For a quantum sensing protocol that uses projective measurements on a multi-qubit sensor array to infer the trajectory of an incident particle, we establish that entanglement can dramatically reduce the particle-qubit interaction strength $\theta$ required for perfect trajectory discrimination. Within an interval of $\theta$ above this reduced threshold, any unentangled sensor requires $\Theta(\log(1/\epsilon))$ repetitions of the protocol to estimate a previously unknown particle trajectory with $\epsilon$ error probability, whereas an entangled sensor can succeed with zero error in a single shot. Furthermore, entanglement can enhance trajectory sensing in realistic scenarios where $\theta$ varies continuously over the sensor qubits, exemplified by a Gaussian-profile laser pulse propagating through an array of atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09126v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A procedure to find optimal regimes for quantum thermal engines (QTMs) is described and demonstrated. The QTMs are modelled as the periodically-driven non-equilibrium steady states of open quantum systems, whose dynamics is approximated in this work with Markovian master equations. The action of the external agent, and the couplings to the heat reservoirs can be modulated with control functions, and it is the time-dependent shape of these control functions the object of optimisation. Those functions can be freely parameterised, which permits to constrain the solutions according to experimental or physical requirements.</description>

      <title>Characterizing MPS and PEPS Preparable via Measurement and Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preparing long-range entangled states poses significant challenges for near-term quantum devices. It is known that measurement and feedback (MF) can aid this task by allowing the preparation of certain paradigmatic long-range entangled states with only constant circuit depth. Here we systematically explore the structure of states that can be prepared using constant-depth local circuits and a single MF round. Using the framework of tensor networks, the preparability under MF translates to tensor symmetries. We detail the structure of matrix-product states (MPS) and projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) that can be prepared using MF, revealing the coexistence of Clifford-like properties and magic. In one dimension, we show that states with abelian symmetry protected topological order are a restricted class of MF-preparable states. In two dimensions, we parameterize a subset of states with abelian topological order that are MF-preparable. Finally, we discuss the analogous implementation of operators via MF, providing a structural theorem that connects to the well-known Clifford teleportation.</description>

      <title>Explicit gate construction of block-encoding for Hamiltonians needed for simulating partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computation is an emerging technology with important potential for solving certain problems pivotal in various scientific and engineering disciplines. This paper introduces an efficient quantum protocol for the explicit construction of block-encoding for an important class of Hamiltonians. Using the Schrodingerisation technique -- which converts non-conservative PDEs into conservative ones -- this particular class of Hamiltonians is shown to be sufficient for simulating any linear partial differential equations that have coefficients which are polynomial functions. The class of Hamiltonians consist of discretisations of polynomial products and sums of position and momentum operators. This construction is explicit and leverages minimal one- and two-qubit operations. The explicit construction of this block-encoding forms a fundamental building block for constructing the unitary evolution operator for this Hamiltonian. The proposed algorithm exhibits polynomial scaling with respect to the spatial partitioning size, suggesting an exponential speedup over classical finite-difference methods. This work provides an important foundation for building explicit and efficient quantum circuits for solving partial differential equations.</description>

Abstract: We construct a null test of the two-level space of a qubit, which is both device independent and needs a small number of different experiments. We demonstrate its feasibility on IBM Quantum, with most qubits failing the test by more than 10 standard deviations. The robustness of the test against common technical imperfections, like decoherence and phase shifts, and supposedly negligible leakage, indicates that the origin of deviations is beyond known effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a type of phase transition in quantum many-body systems, which occurs in highly excited quantum many-body scar states, while most of the spectrum is largely unaffected. Such scar state phase transitions can be realized by embedding a matrix product state, known to undergo a phase transition, as a scar state into the thermal spectrum of a parent Hamiltonian. We find numerically that the mechanism for the scar state phase transition involves the formation or presence of low-entropy states at energies similar to the scar state in the vicinity of the phase transition point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08064v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general, fully gate-based quantum algorithm for counterdiabatic driving. The algorithm does not depend on heuristics as in previous variational methods, and exploits regularisation of the adiabatic gauge potential to suppress only the transitions from the eigenstate of interest. This allows for a rigorous quantum gate complexity upper bound in terms of the minimum gap $\Delta$ around this eigenstate. We find that, in the worst case, the algorithm requires at most $\tilde O(\Delta^{-(3 + o(1))} \epsilon^{-(1 + o(1))})$ quantum gates to achieve a target state fidelity of at least $1 - \epsilon^2$, where $\Delta$ is the minimum spectral gap. In certain cases, the gap dependence can be improved to quadratic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of distinguishing between the elements of a bipartite maximally entangled orthonormal basis using local operations and classical communication (LOCC) and a partially entangled state acting as a resource. We derive an exact formula for the optimum success probability and find that it corresponds to the fully entangled fraction of the resource state. The derivation consists of two steps: First, we consider a relaxation of the problem by replacing LOCC with positive-partial-transpose (PPT) measurements and establish an upper bound on the success probability as the solution of a semidefinite program, and then show that this upper bound is achieved by a teleportation-based LOCC protocol. This further implies that separable and PPT measurements provide no advantage over LOCC for this task. We also present lower and upper bounds on the success probability for distinguishing the elements of an incomplete orthonormal maximally entangled basis in the same setup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Does determinism (or even the incompleteness of quantum mechanics) follow from locality and perfect correlations? In a 1964 paper John Bell gave the first demonstration that quantum mechanics is incompatible with local hidden variables. Since then a vigorous debate has rung out over whether he relied on an assumption of determinism or instead, as he later claimed in a 1981 paper, derived determinism from assumptions of locality and perfect correlation. This paper aims to bring clarity to the debate via simple examples and rigorous results. It is first recalled, via quantum and classical counterexamples, that the weakest statistical form of locality consistent with Bell's 1964 paper (parameter independence) is insufficient for the derivation of determinism. Attention is then turned to critically assess Bell's appealing to the Einstein-Rosen-Podolsky (EPR) incompleteness argument to support his claim. It is shown this argument is itself incomplete, via counterexamples that expose two logical gaps. Closing these gaps via a strong "counterfactual" reality criterion enables a rigorous derivation of both determinism and parameter independence, and in this sense justifies Bell's claim. Conversely, however, it is noted that whereas the EPR argument requires a weaker "measurement choice" assumption than Bell's demonstration, it nevertheless leads to a similar incompatibility with quantum predictions rather than to quantum incompleteness.</description>

      <title>The impact of microwave phase noise on diamond quantum sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precision optical measurements of the electron-spin precession of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond form the basis of numerous applications. The most sensitivity-demanding applications, such as femtotesla magnetometry, require the ability to measure changes in GHz spin transition frequencies at the sub-millihertz level, corresponding to a fractional resolution of better than 10^{-12}. Here we study the impact of microwave (MW) phase noise on the response of an NV sensor. Fluctuations of the phase of the MW waveform cause undesired rotations of the NV spin state. These fluctuations are imprinted in the optical readout signal and, left unmitigated, are indistinguishable from magnetic field noise. We show that the phase noise of several common commercial MW generators results in an effective pT s^{1/2}-range noise floor that varies with the MW carrier frequency and the detection frequency of the pulse sequence. The data are described by a frequency domain model incorporating the MW phase noise spectrum and the filter-function response of the sensing protocol. For controlled injection of white and random-walk phase noise, the observed NV magnetic noise floor is described by simple analytic expressions that accurately capture the scaling with pulse sequence length and the number of pi pulses. We outline several strategies to suppress the impact of MW phase noise and implement a version, based on gradiometry, that realizes a &gt;10-fold suppression. Our study highlights an important challenge in the pursuit of sensitive diamond quantum sensors and is applicable to other qubit systems with a large transition frequency.</description>

Abstract: We show how to prepare magnonic squeezed states in an optomagnomechanical system, in which magnetostriction induced mechanical displacement couples to an optical cavity via radiation pressure. We discuss two scenarios depending on whether the magnomechanical coupling is linear or dispersive. We show that in both cases the strong mechanical squeezing obtained via two-tone driving of the optical cavity can be efficiently transferred to the magnon mode. In the linear coupling case, stationary magnon squeezing is achieved; while in the dispersive coupling case, a transient magnonic squeezed state is prepared in a two-step protocol. The proposed magnonic squeezed states find promising applications in quantum information processing and quantum sensing using magnons.</description>

Abstract: Tensor networks and quantum computation are two of the most powerful tools for the simulation of quantum many-body systems. Rather than viewing them as competing approaches, here we consider how these two methods can work in tandem. We introduce a novel algorithm that combines tensor networks and quantum computation to produce results that are more accurate than what could be achieved by either method used in isolation. Our algorithm is based on multiproduct formulas (MPF) - a technique that linearly combines Trotter product formulas to reduce algorithmic error. Our algorithm uses a quantum computer to calculate the expectation values and tensor networks to calculate the coefficients used in the linear combination. We present a detailed error analysis of the algorithm and demonstrate the full workflow on a one-dimensional quantum simulation problem on $50$ qubits using two IBM quantum computers: $ibm\_torino$ and $ibm\_kyiv$.</description>

      <title>Qualitatively altered driven Dicke superradiance in extended systems due to infinitesimal perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The driven Dicke model, with interesting quantum phases induced by parameterized driving, has been intensively studied in cavities, where permutation symmetry applies due to the atoms' equal coupling to the field and identical interaction. As a result, the system, with proper initialization, can remain in a highly symmetric subset of the state space, where the photon emission of each atom constructively interferes with each other, leading to superradiance at steady state. However, because of the degeneracy of steady states for the driven Dicke model, the steady state can be qualitatively altered by an infinitesimal perturbation. In this work, we simulate superconducting qubits coupled to a 1D waveguide as the extended system and theoretically investigate four kinds of perturbations: local dephasing, individual driving phases, the separation between adjacent qubits, and individual detunings. Using an angular momentum basis, we predict the dimension of the degenerate subspace and study the transition within the subspace due to the perturbation.</description>

      <title>A Unified Theory of Quantum Neural Network Loss Landscapes</title>

Abstract: Classical neural networks with random initialization famously behave as Gaussian processes in the limit of many neurons, which allows one to completely characterize their training and generalization behavior. No such general understanding exists for quantum neural networks (QNNs), which -- outside of certain special cases -- are known to not behave as Gaussian processes when randomly initialized. We here prove that QNNs and their first two derivatives instead generally form what we call "Wishart processes," where certain algebraic properties of the network determine the hyperparameters of the process. This Wishart process description allows us to, for the first time: give necessary and sufficient conditions for a QNN architecture to have a Gaussian process limit; calculate the full gradient distribution, generalizing previously known barren plateau results; and calculate the local minima distribution of algebraically constrained QNNs. Our unified framework suggests a certain simple operational definition for the "trainability" of a given QNN model using a newly introduced, experimentally accessible quantity we call the "degrees of freedom" of the network architecture.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Reduced Circuit Depths Using Trotter Error Mitigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Product formulae are a popular class of digital quantum simulation algorithms due to their conceptual simplicity, low overhead, and performance which often exceeds theoretical expectations. Recently, Richardson extrapolation and polynomial interpolation have been proposed to mitigate the Trotter error incurred by use of these formulae. This work provides an improved, rigorous analysis of these techniques for the task of calculating time-evolved expectation values. We demonstrate that, to achieve error $\epsilon$ in a simulation of time $T$ using a $p^\text{th}$-order product formula with extrapolation, circuits depths of $O\left(T^{1+1/p} \textrm{polylog}(1/\epsilon)\right)$ are sufficient -- an exponential improvement in the precision over product formulae alone. Furthermore, we achieve commutator scaling, improve the complexity with $T$, and do not require fractional implementations of Trotter steps. Our results provide a more accurate characterisation of the algorithmic error mitigation techniques currently proposed to reduce Trotter error.</description>

      <title>Efficient Strategies for Reducing Sampling Error in Quantum Krylov Subspace Diagonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the realm of early fault-tolerant quantum computing (EFTQC), quantum Krylov subspace diagonalization (QKSD) has emerged as a promising quantum algorithm for the approximate Hamiltonian diagonalization via projection onto the quantum Krylov subspace. However, the algorithm often requires solving an ill-conditioned generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) involving erroneous matrix pairs, which can significantly distort the solution. Since EFTQC assumes limited-scale error correction, finite sampling error becomes a dominant source of error in these matrices. This work focuses on quantifying sampling errors during the measurement of matrix element in the projected Hamiltonian examining two measurement approaches based on the Hamiltonian decompositions: the linear combination of unitaries and diagonalizable fragments. To reduce sampling error within a fixed budget of quantum circuit repetitions, we propose two measurement strategies: the shifting technique and coefficient splitting. The shifting technique eliminates redundant Hamiltonian components that annihilate either the bra or ket states, while coefficient splitting optimizes the measurement of common terms across different circuits. Numerical experiments with electronic structures of small molecules demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies, reducing sampling costs by a factor of 20-500.</description>

      <title>Maximal work extraction unitarily from an unknown quantum state: Ergotropy estimation via feedback experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering the emerging applications of quantum technologies, studying energy storage and usage at the quantum level is of great interest. In this context, there is a significant contemporary interest in studying ergotropy, the maximum amount of work that can be extracted unitarily from an energy-storing quantum device. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a feedback-based algorithm (FQErgo) for estimating ergotropy. This method also transforms an arbitrary initial state to its passive state, which allows no further unitary work extraction. FQErgo applies drive fields whose strengths are iteratively adjusted via certain expectation values, conveniently read using a single probe qubit. Thus, FQErgo provides a practical way for unitary energy extraction and for preparing passive states. By numerically analyzing FQErgo on random initial states, we confirm the successful preparation of passive states and estimation of ergotropy, even in the presence of drive errors. Finally, we implement FQErgo on two- and three-qubit NMR registers, prepare their passive states, and accurately estimate their ergotropy.</description>

      <title>Low Depth Phase Oracle Using a Parallel Piecewise Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the important task of applying a phase $exp(i f(x))$ to a computational basis state $\left| x \right&gt;$. The closely related task of rotating a target qubit by an angle depending on $f(x)$ is also studied. Such operations are key in many quantum subroutines, and often the function $f$ can be well-approximated by a piecewise linear composition. Examples range from the application of diagonal Hamiltonian terms (such as the Coulomb interaction) in grid-based many-body simulation, to derivative pricing algorithms. Here we exploit a parallelisation of the piecewise approach so that all constituent elementary rotations are performed simultaneously, that is, we achieve a total rotation depth of one. Moreover, we explore the use of recursive catalyst 'towers' to implement these elementary rotations efficiently. Depending on the choice of implementation strategy, we find a depth as low as $O(log n + log S)$ for a register of $n$ qubits and a piecewise approximation of $S$ sections. In the limit of multiple repetitions of the oracle, we find that catalyst tower approaches have an $O(S \cdot n)$ T-count, whereas linear interpolation with QROM has an $O(n^{log_2(3)})$ T-count.</description>

      <title>Training quantum machine learning models on cloud without uploading the data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the linearity of quantum unitary operations, we propose a method that runs the parameterized quantum circuits before encoding the input data. This enables a dataset owner to train machine learning models on quantum cloud computation platforms, without the risk of leaking the information about the data. It is also capable of encoding a vast amount of data effectively at a later time using classical computations, thus saving runtime on quantum computation devices. The trained quantum machine learning models can be run completely on classical computers, meaning the dataset owner does not need to have any quantum hardware, nor even quantum simulators. Moreover, our method mitigates the encoding bottleneck by reducing the required circuit depth from $O(2^{n})$ to $O(n)$, and relax the tolerance on the precision of the quantum gates for the encoding. These results demonstrate yet another advantage of quantum and quantum-inspired machine learning models over existing classical neural networks, and broaden the approaches to data security.</description>

      <title>In-situ tunable interaction with an invertible sign between a fluxonium and a post cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computation with bosonic modes presents a powerful paradigm for harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics to perform complex information processing tasks. In constructing a bosonic qubit with superconducting circuits, nonlinearity is typically introduced to a cavity mode through an ancillary two-level qubit. However, the ancilla's spurious heating has impeded progress towards fully fault-tolerant bosonic qubits. The ability to in situ decouple the ancilla when not in use would be beneficial but has so far only been realized with tunable couplers or additional parametric drives. This work presents a novel architecture for quantum information processing, comprising a 3D post cavity coupled to a fluxonium ancilla via a readout resonator. This system's intricate energy level structure results in a complex landscape of interactions whose sign can be tuned in situ by the magnetic field threading the fluxonium loop without the need of additional elements. Our results could significantly advance the lifetime and controllability of bosonic qubits.</description>

Abstract: We define fermionic convolution and demonstrate its utility in characterizing fermionic non-Gaussian components, which are essential to the computational advantage of fermionic systems. Using fermionic convolution, we propose an efficient protocol that tests the fermionic Gaussianity of pure states using three copies of the input state. We also introduce "Non-Gaussian Entropy," an experimentally accessible resource measure that quantifies fermionic non-Gaussianity. These results provide new insights into the study of fermionic quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quantum random tensor network states where the bond dimensions scale polynomially with the system size, $N$. Specifically, we examine the delocalization properties of random Matrix Product States (RMPS) in the computational basis by deriving an exact analytical expression for the Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR) of any degree, applicable to both open and closed boundary conditions. For bond dimensions $\chi \sim \gamma N$, we determine the leading order of the associated overlaps probability distribution and demonstrate its convergence to the Porter-Thomas distribution, characteristic of Haar-random states, as $\gamma$ increases. Additionally, we provide numerical evidence for the frame potential, measuring the $2$-distance from the Haar ensemble, which confirms the convergence of random MPS to Haar-like behavior for $\chi \gg \sqrt{N}$. We extend this analysis to two-dimensional systems using random Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS), where we similarly observe the convergence of IPRs to their Haar values for $\chi \gg \sqrt{N}$. These findings demonstrate that random tensor networks with bond dimensions scaling polynomially in the system size are fully Haar-anticoncentrated and approximate unitary designs, regardless of the spatial dimension.</description>

      <title>Quantum Error Correction of Qudits Beyond Break-even</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hilbert space dimension is a key resource for quantum information processing. A large Hilbert space is not only an essential requirement for quantum error correction, but it can also be advantageous for realizing gates and algorithms more efficiently. There has thus been considerable experimental effort in recent years to develop quantum computing platforms using qudits (d-dimensional quantum systems with d&gt;2) as the fundamental unit of quantum information. Just as with qubits, quantum error correction of these qudits will be necessary in the long run, but to date error correction of logical qudits has not been demonstrated experimentally. Here we report the experimental realization of an error-corrected logical qutrit (d=3) and ququart (d=4) by employing the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) bosonic code. Using a reinforcement learning agent, we optimize the GKP qutrit (ququart) as a ternary (quaternary) quantum memory and achieve beyond break-even error correction with a gain of 1.82 +/- 0.03 (1.87 +/- 0.03). This work represents a new way of leveraging the large Hilbert space of a harmonic oscillator for hardware-efficient quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Fast unconditional reset and leakage reduction in fixed-frequency transmon qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The realization of fault-tolerant quantum computing requires the execution of quantum error-correction (QEC) schemes, to mitigate the fragile nature of qubits. In this context, to ensure the success of QEC, a protocol capable of implementing both qubit reset and leakage reduction is highly desirable. We demonstrate such a protocol in an architecture consisting of fixed-frequency transmon qubits pair-wise coupled via tunable couplers -- an architecture that is compatible with the surface code. We use tunable couplers to transfer any undesired qubit excitation to the readout resonator of the qubit, from which this excitation decays into the feedline. In total, the combination of qubit reset, leakage reduction, and coupler reset takes only 83ns to complete. Our reset scheme is fast, unconditional, and achieves fidelities well above 99%, thus enabling fixed-frequency qubit architectures as future implementations of fault-tolerant quantum computers. Our protocol also provides a means to both reduce QEC cycle runtime and improve algorithmic fidelity on quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a generalized phase-space representation of qubit systems called the BEADS representation which makes it possible to visualize arbitrary quantum states in an intuitive and an easy to grasp way. At the same time, our representation is exact, bijective, and general. It bridges the gap between the highly abstract mathematical description of quantum mechanical phenomena and the mission to convey them to non-specialists in terms of meaningful pictures and tangible models. Several levels of simplifications can be chosen, e.g., when using the BEADS representation in the communication of quantum mechanics to the general public. In particular, this visualization has predictive power in contrast to simple metaphors such as Schr\"odinger's cat.</description>

      <title>Bounding conditional entropy of bipartite states with Bell operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum information theory explores numerous properties that surpass classical paradigms, offering novel applications and benefits. Among these properties, negative conditional von Neumann entropy (CVNE) is particularly significant in entangled quantum systems, serving as an indicator of potential advantages in various information-theoretic tasks, despite its indirect observability. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between CVNE and the violation of Bell inequalities. Our goal is to establish upper bounds on CVNE through semi-definite programming applied to entangled qubits and qutrits, utilizing selected Bell operators.
  Our findings reveal that a semi-device-independent certification of negative CVNE is achievable and could be practically beneficial. We further explore two types of robustness: robustness against detection efficiency loopholes, measured by relative violation, and robustness against white noise and imperfections in state preparation, measured by critical visibility. Additionally, we analyze parametrized families of Bell inequalities to identify optimal parameters for different robustness criteria.
  This study demonstrates that different Bell inequalities exhibit varying degrees of robustness depending on the desired properties, such as the type of noise resistance or the target level of negative CVNE. By bridging the gap between Bell inequalities and CVNE, our research enhances understanding of the quantum properties of entangled systems and offers insights for practical quantum information processing tasks.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of integrating quantum algorithms as subroutines of simulation-based optimisation problems with relevance to and potential applications in mathematical finance. To this end, we conduct a thorough analysis of all systematic errors arising in the formulation of quantum Monte Carlo integration in order to better understand the resources required to encode various distributions such as a Gaussian, and to evaluate statistical quantities such as the Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional-Value-at-Risk (CVaR) of an asset. Finally, we study the applicability of quantum Monte Carlo integration for fundamental financial use cases in terms of simulation-based optimisations, notably Mean-Conditional-Value-at-Risk (Mean-CVaR) and (risky) Mean-Variance (Mean-Var) optimisation problems. In particular, we study the Mean-Var optimisation problem in the presence of noise on a quantum device, and benchmark a quantum error mitigation method that applies to quantum amplitude estimation -- a key subroutine of quantum Monte Carlo integration -- showcasing the utility of such an approach.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-assisted Quantum Error Correcting Code Saturating The Classical Singleton Bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a construction for entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECCs) that saturates the classical Singleton bound with less shared entanglement than any known method for code rates below $ \frac{k}{n} = \frac{1}{3} $. For higher rates, our EAQECC also meets the Singleton bound, although with increased entanglement requirements. Additionally, we demonstrate that any classical $[n,k,d]_q$ code can be transformed into an EAQECC with parameters $[[n,k,d;2k]]_q$ using $2k$ pre-shared maximally entangled pairs. The complexity of our encoding protocol for $k$-qudits with $q$ levels is $\mathcal{O}(k \log_{\frac{q}{q-1}}(k))$, excluding the complexity of encoding and decoding the classical MDS code. While this complexity remains linear in $k$ for systems of reasonable size, it increases significantly for larger-levelled systems, highlighting the need for further research into complexity reduction.</description>

Abstract: Gibbs state preparation, or Gibbs sampling, is a key computational technique extensively used in physics, statistics, and other scientific fields. Recent efforts for designing fast mixing Gibbs samplers for quantum Hamiltonians have largely focused on commuting local Hamiltonians (CLHs), a non-trivial subclass of Hamiltonians which include highly entangled systems such as the Toric code and quantum double model. Most previous Gibbs samplers relied on simulating the Davies generator, which is a Lindbladian associated with the thermalization process in nature.
  Instead of using the Davies generator, we design a different Gibbs sampler for various CLHs by giving a reduction to classical Hamiltonians, in the sense that one can efficiently prepare the Gibbs state for some CLH $H$ on a quantum computer as long as one can efficiently do classical Gibbs sampling for the corresponding classical Hamiltonian $H^{(c)}$. We demonstrate that our Gibbs sampler is able to replicate state-of-the-art results as well as prepare the Gibbs state in regimes which were previously unknown, such as the low temperature region, as long as there exists fast mixing Gibbs samplers for the corresponding classical Hamiltonians. Our reductions are as follows.
  - If $H$ is a 2-local qudit CLH, then $H^{(c)}$ is a 2-local qudit classical Hamiltonian.
  - If $H$ is a 4-local qubit CLH on 2D lattice and there are no classical qubits, then $H^{(c)}$ is a 2-local qudit classical Hamiltonian on a planar graph. As an example, our algorithm can prepare the Gibbs state for the (defected) Toric code at any non-zero temperature in $\mathcal O(n^2)$ time.
  - If $H$ is a 4-local qubit CLH on 2D lattice and there are classical qubits, assuming that quantum terms are uniformly correctable, then $H^{(c)}$ is a constant-local classical Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Generalised Quantum Gates for Qudits and their Application in Quantum Fourier Transform</title>

Abstract: Quantum computing with qudits, quantum systems with $d &gt; 2$ levels, offers a powerful extension beyond qubits, expanding the computational possibilities of quantum systems, allowing the simplification of the implementation of several algorithms and, possibly, providing a foundation for optimised error correction. In this work, we propose a novel formulation of qudit gates that is universally applicable for any number of levels $d$, without restrictions on the dimensionality. By extending the mathematical framework of quantum gates to arbitrary dimensions, we derive explicit gate operations that form a universal set for quantum computation on qudits of any size. We demonstrate the validity of our approach through the implementation of the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) for arbitrary $d$, verifying both the correctness and utility of our generalized gates. This novel methodology broadens the design space for quantum algorithms and fault-tolerant architectures, paving the way for advancements in qudit-based quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on quantum decoherence during inflation</title>

Abstract: Since inflationary perturbations must generically couple to all degrees of freedom present in the early Universe, it is more realistic to view these fluctuations as an open quantum system interacting with an environment. Then, on very general grounds, their evolution can be modelled with a Lindblad equation. This modified evolution leads to quantum decoherence of the system, as well as to corrections to observables such as the power spectrum of curvature fluctuations. On one hand, current cosmological observations constrain the properties of possible environments and place upper bounds on the interaction strengths. On the other hand, imposing that decoherence completes by the end of inflation implies lower bounds on the interaction strengths. Therefore, the question arises of whether successful decoherence can occur without altering the power spectrum. In this paper, we systematically identify all scenarios in which this is possible. As an illustration, we discuss the case in which the environment consists of a heavy test scalar field. We show that this realises the very peculiar configuration where the correction to the power spectrum is quasi scale invariant. In that case, the presence of the environment improves the fit to the data for some inflationary models but deteriorates it for others. This clearly demonstrates that decoherence is not only of theoretical importance but can also be crucial for astrophysical observations.</description>

Abstract: Muon decay is self-analyzing: the spectral-angular distribution of the emitted electron reveals the spin orientation of the polarized muon. Here, we show that the same feature applies to muons in non-plane-wave states and helps reveal the rich polarization opportunities available. We focus on the so-called vortex states, in which the muon carries a non-zero orbital angular momentum with respect to the average propagation direction and exhibits a cone structure in the momentum distribution. We compute the spectrum and the angular distribution of the electrons emitted in decays of vortex muons and show that the most revealing observable is not the angular distribution but the fixed-angle electron spectra. Even for very small cone opening angles of the vortex muons, it will be easy to observe significant modifications of the electron spectra which would allow one to distinguish vortex muons from approximately plane wave muons, as well as to differentiate among various polarization states. These features will be the key to tracking the evolution of vortex muons in external magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Quantum Locally Testable Code with Constant Soundness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.11405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present two constructions of quantum locally testable codes (QLTC) with constant soundness. In the first approach, we introduce an operation called check product, and show how this operation gives rise to QLTCs of constant soundness, constant rate, and distance scaling with locality. In the second approach, we consider hypergraph product of a quantum code and a classical repetition code, and observe a special case in which the soundness of component codes is preserved. This insight leads us to construct QLTCs of constant soundness, scalable rate and distance, and constant average locality. Our work marks a step towards constructing QLTCs of high soundness and distance, which would give a different construction to the No Low-Energy Trivial States (NLTS) theorem.</description>

      <title>Extending the planar theory of anyons to quantum wire networks</title>

Abstract: The braiding of the worldlines of particles restricted to move on a network (graph) is governed by the graph braid group, which can be strikingly different from the standard braid group known from two-dimensional physics. It has been recently shown that imposing the compatibility of graph braiding with anyon fusion for anyons exchanging at a single wire junction leads to new types of anyon models with the braiding exchange operators stemming from solutions of certain generalised hexagon equations. In this work, we establish these graph-braided anyon fusion models for general wire networks. We show that the character of braiding strongly depends on the graph-theoretic connectivity of the given network. In particular, we prove that triconnected networks yield the same braiding exchange operators as the planar anyon models. In contrast, modular biconnected networks support independent braiding exchange operators in different modules. Consequently, such modular networks may lead to more efficient topological quantum computer circuits. Finally, we conjecture that the graph-braided anyon fusion models will possess the (generalised) coherence property where certain polygon equations determine the braiding exchange operators for an arbitrary number of anyons. We also extensively study solutions to these polygon equations for chosen low-rank multiplicity-free fusion rings, including the Ising theory, quantum double of Z2, and Tambara-Yamagami models. We find numerous solutions that do not appear in the planar theory of anyons.</description>

Abstract: Matter-wave jets are ejected from a Bose-Einstein condensate subjected to a modulation of the interaction strength. For sufficiently strong modulation additional higher harmonic matter-wave jets emerge. Here we report the first experimental observation of incommensurable "golden" $\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ matter-wave jets in a Bose-Einstein condensate exposed to a single frequency interaction modulation. We study the formation of higher-order jets and the corresponding incommensurable density waves in quasi-one-dimensional geometry with numerical one dimensional (1D) Gross-Pitaevskii equation simulation. We explore the process of jet formation experimentally and theoretically for a wide range of modulation amplitudes and frequencies and establish a phase diagram delineating different regimes of jet formation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Vector Signal Analyzer: Wideband Electric Field Sensing via Motional Raman Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultrasensitive detection of the frequency, phase, and amplitude of radio frequency (RF) electric fields is central to a variety of important applications, including radio communication, cosmology, dark matter searches, and high-fidelity qubit control. Quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) systems, especially trapped ions, have been used with several quantum sensing techniques to achieve electric field sensing with state-of-the-art sensitivity and nanometer spatial resolution. However, these systems are limited to a narrow frequency range centered around either the motional frequency of the trapped ion oscillator or the frequency of an optical transition in the ion; often these techniques are not sensitive to the RF phase. Here, we propose and demonstrate a procedure that unlocks the extreme sensitivity of a QHO to allow high precision wideband detection of the frequency, phase, and amplitude of an unknown electric field. Specifically, we use motional Raman transitions in a single trapped ion, cooled near its motional ground state to realize state of the art sensitivities to frequency, phase, and amplitude, and show the technique works over a frequency range that is &gt;800x larger than previous techniques. Further, this technique is shown to be compatible with both quantum amplification via squeezing and measurement in the Fock basis, allowing performance 3.4(20) dB below the standard quantum limit and the potential for several orders of magnitude improvement in sensitivity with moderate upgrades. In addition to providing an attractive platform for quantum sensing of small fields, this technique allows in situ calibration of qubit control lines in QHO systems, as well as transduction of external, non-resonant drives into oscillator excitation. Additionally, this approach can be extended to other QHO systems, such as a superconducting qubit-resonator system.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of dual Shapiro steps in small Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06599v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bloch oscillations in small Josephson junctions were predicted theoretically as the quantum dual to Josephson oscillations. A significant consequence of this prediction is the emergence of quantized current steps, so-called dual Shapiro steps, when synchronizing Bloch oscillations to an external microwave signal. These steps potentially enable a fundamental standard of current $I$, defined via the frequency $f$ of the external signal and the elementary charge $e$, $I=\pm n \times 2ef$, where $n$ is a natural number. Here, we realize this fundamental relation by synchronizing the Bloch oscillations in small Al/AlO$_\mathrm{x}$/Al Josephson junctions to sinusoidal drives with frequencies varying from $1$ to $6\:\mathrm{GHz}$ and observe dual Shapiro steps up to $I\approx 3 \: \mathrm{nA}$. Inspired by today's voltage standards and to further confirm the duality relation, we investigate a pulsed drive regime, which is dual to the single flux quantum mode of Josephson oscillations, and observe a similar asymmetric pattern of dual Shapiro steps. This work confirms quantum duality effects in Josephson junctions and paves the way towards a range of applications in quantum metrology based on well-established fabrication techniques and straightforward circuit design.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect in two-dimensional honeycomb topological antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional systems with honeycomb lattice are known to be a paradigmatic platform to explore the various types of Hall effects, owing to that the interplay of lattice geometry, spin-orbit coupling and magnetism can give rise to very rich features in the quantum geometry of wave functions. In this work, we consider honeycomb topological antiferromagets that are effectively described by a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnetic Kane-Mele model, and explore the evolution of its nonlinear Hall response with respect to the change of lattice anisotropy, chemical potential, and the direction of the N\'{e}el vector. Due to the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry, the leading-order Hall effect of quantum geometric origin is the intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect, which is a second-order effect of electric fields and is independent of the scattering time. We investigate the behavior of the intrinsic nonlinear Hall conductivity tensor across topological phase transitions driven by antiferromagnetic exchange field and lattice anisotropy and find that its components do not change sign, which is different from the extrinsic nonlinear Hall effect. In the weakly doped regime, we find that the intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect is valley-polarized. By varying the chemical potential, we find that the nonlinear Hall conductivity tensors exhibit kinks when the Fermi surface undergoes Lifshitz transitions. Furthermore, we find that the existence of spin-orbit coupling to lift the spin-rotation symmetry is decisive for the use of intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect to detect the direction of the N\'{e}el vector. Our work shows that the two-dimensional honeycomb topological antiferromagnets are an ideal class of material systems with rich properties for the study of intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect.</description>

      <title>On the Communication Complexity of Approximate Pattern Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The decades-old Pattern Matching with Edits problem, given a length-$n$ string $T$ (the text), a length-$m$ string $P$ (the pattern), and a positive integer $k$ (the threshold), asks to list all fragments of $T$ that are at edit distance at most $k$ from $P$. The one-way communication complexity of this problem is the minimum amount of space needed to encode the answer so that it can be retrieved without accessing the input strings $P$ and $T$.
  The closely related Pattern Matching with Mismatches problem (defined in terms of the Hamming distance instead of the edit distance) is already well understood from the communication complexity perspective: Clifford, Kociumaka, and Porat [SODA 2019] proved that $\Omega(n/m \cdot k \log(m/k))$ bits are necessary and $O(n/m \cdot k\log (m|\Sigma|/k))$ bits are sufficient; the upper bound allows encoding not only the occurrences of $P$ in $T$ with at most $k$ mismatches but also the substitutions needed to make each $k$-mismatch occurrence exact.
  Despite recent improvements in the running time [Charalampopoulos, Kociumaka, and Wellnitz; FOCS 2020 and 2022], the communication complexity of Pattern Matching with Edits remained unexplored, with a lower bound of $\Omega(n/m \cdot k\log(m/k))$ bits and an upper bound of $O(n/m \cdot k^3\log m)$ bits stemming from previous research. In this work, we prove an upper bound of $O(n/m \cdot k \log^2 m)$ bits, thus establishing the optimal communication complexity up to logarithmic factors. We also show that $O(n/m \cdot k \log m \log (m|\Sigma|))$ bits allow encoding, for each $k$-error occurrence of $P$ in $T$, the shortest sequence of edits needed to make the occurrence exact.
  We leverage the techniques behind our new result on the communication complexity to obtain quantum algorithms for Pattern Matching with Edits.</description>

      <title>Infinite Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator method for zero-temperature equilibrium quantum impurity problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator (GTEMPO) method has proven to be an accurate and efficient numerical method for the real-time dynamics of quantum impurity problems. Whereas its application for imaginary-time calculations is much less competitive compared to well-established methods such as the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo (CTQMC). In this work, we unleash the full power of GTEMPO for zero-temperature imaginary-time calculations: the multi-time impurity state is time-translationally invariant with infinite boundary condition, therefore it can be represented as an infinite Grassmann matrix product state (GMPS) with nontrivial unit cell in a single time step, instead of an open boundary GMPS spanning the whole imaginary-time axis. We devise a very efficient infinite GTEMPO algorithm targeted at zero-temperature equilibrium quantum impurity problems, which is known to be a hard regime for quantum Monte Carlo methods. To demonstrate the performance of our method, we benchmark it against exact solutions in the noninteracting limit, and against CTQMC calculations in the Anderson impurity models with up to two orbitals, where we show that the required bond dimension of the infinite GMPS is much smaller than its finite-temperature counterpart.</description>

      <title>Solving quantum impurity problems on the L-shaped Kadanoff-Baym contour</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05410v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The path integral formalism is the building block of many powerful numerical methods for quantum impurity problems. However, existing fermionic path integral based numerical calculations have only been performed in either the imaginary-time or the real-time axis, while the most generic scenario formulated on the L-shaped Kadanoff-Baym contour is left unexplored. In this work, we extended the recently developed Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator (GTEMPO) method to solve quantum impurity problems directly on the Kadanoff-Baym contour. The resulting method is numerically exact, with only two sources of numerical errors, e.g., the time discretization error and the matrix product state bond truncation error. The accuracy of this method is numerically demonstrated against exact solutions in the noninteracting case, and against existing calculations on the real- and imaginary-time axes for the single-orbital Anderson impurity model. We also show that the numerical errors of the method can be well suppressed as we refine the hyperparameters. Our method is a perfect benchmarking baseline for its alternatives which often employ less-controlled approximations, and can also be used as a real-time impurity solver in dynamical mean field theory.</description>

      <title>All-fiber microendoscopic polarization sensing at single-photon level aided by deep-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02172v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The polarization of light conveys crucial information about the spatial ordering and optical properties of a specimen. However, precise polarization measurement in challenging conditions, including constrained spaces, low light levels, and high-speed scenarios, remains a severe challenge. Addressing this problem, we introduce a real-time polarization measurement method that is accurate down to a single-photon level and provides complete information about the polarization state. Free of moving components, the polarization sensor utilizes a short rigid piece of few-mode fiber followed by a fiber array and a detector array. The calibration of the sensor relies on a neural network yielding unprecedented accuracy across all polarization states, including partially polarized light. We validate the approach by visualizing the polarization structure of biological specimens and the liquid crystal polymer sample (birefringent USAF test). Our method offers an efficient and reliable solution for real-time polarization sensing and microendoscopy under low-light conditions.</description>

      <title>Incompressible Navier-Stokes solve on noisy quantum hardware via a hybrid quantum-classical scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partial differential equation solvers are required to solve the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow. Recently, algorithms have been proposed to simulate fluid dynamics on quantum computers. Fault-tolerant quantum devices might enable exponential speedups over algorithms on classical computers. However, current and foreseeable quantum hardware introduce noise into computations, requiring algorithms that make judicious use of quantum resources: shallower circuit depths and fewer qubits. Under these restrictions, variational algorithms are more appropriate and robust. This work presents a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. A classical device performs nonlinear computations, and a quantum one uses a variational solver for the pressure Poisson equation. A lid-driven cavity problem benchmarks the method. We verify the algorithm via noise-free simulation and test it on noisy IBM superconducting quantum hardware. Results show that high-fidelity results can be achieved via this approach, even on current quantum devices. Multigrid preconditioning of the Poisson problem helps avoid local minima and reduces resource requirements for the quantum device. A quantum state readout technique called HTree is used for the first time on a physical problem. Htree is appropriate for real-valued problems and achieves linear complexity in the qubit count, making the Navier-Stokes solve further tractable on current quantum devices. We compare the quantum resources required for near-term and fault-tolerant solvers to determine quantum hardware requirements for fluid simulations with complexity improvements.</description>

      <title>Semi-Markov Processes in Open Quantum Systems. III. Large Deviations of First Passage Time Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a specific class of open quantum systems with finite and fixed numbers of collapsed quantum states, the semi-Markov process method is used to calculate the large deviations of the first passage time statistics. The core formula is an equation of poles, which is also applied in determining the scaled generating functions (SCGFs) of the counting statistics. For simple counting variables, the SCGFs of the first passage time statistics are derived by finding the largest modulus of the roots of this equation with respect to the $z$-transform parameter and then calculating its logarithm. The procedure is analogous to that of solving for the SCGFs of the counting statistics. However, for current-like variables, the method generally fails unless the equation of pole is simplified to a quadratic form. The fundamental reason for this lies in the nonuniqueness between the roots and the region of convergence for the joint transform. We illustrate these results via a resonantly driven two-level quantum system, where for several counting variables the solutions to the SCGFs of the first passage time are analytically obtained. Furthermore, we apply these functions to investigate quantum violations of the classical kinetic and thermodynamic uncertainty relations.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional photonic wire as a single-photon source: Implications of cavity QED to a phonon bath of reduced dimensionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the semiconductor quantum dot placed in a solid-state material allows for deterministic emission of single photons, the photon indistinguishability is strongly influenced by the intrinsic coupling to lattice vibrations, phonons, of the solid-state environment. This work investigates the phonon-induced decoherence for a quantum dot placed in the one-dimensional system of a homogeneous cylindrical nanowire. Such a structure supports multiple longitudinal phonon branches, and we consider both a linear and a quadratic coupling of the emitter to these modes. Under a polaron approach, we initially derive an analytical expression for the 1D pure dephasing rate, which leads to a reduced pure dephasing rate compared with bulk. By implementing these results into a full cavity quantum electrodynamic model, we demonstrate that multimode coupling is necessary to correctly predict the indistinguishability in a 1D system, which may otherwise be significantly underestimated.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm in systems with large condition numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21641v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm offers an exponential speedup in system size for treating linear equations of the form $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$ on quantum computers when compared to their traditional counterparts, it faces a challenge related to the condition number ($\mathcal{\kappa}$) scaling of the $A$ matrix. In this work, we address the issue by introducing the post-selection-improved HHL (Psi-HHL) approach that involves a simple yet effective modification of the HHL algorithm to extract a feature of $|x\rangle$, and which leads to achieving optimal behaviour in $\mathcal{\kappa}$ (linear scaling) for large condition number situations. This has the important practical implication of having to use substantially fewer shots relative to the traditional HHL algorithm. We carry out two sets of simulations, where we go up to 26-qubit calculations, to demonstrate the ability of Psi-HHL to handle situations involving large $\mathcal{\kappa}$ matrices via: (a) a set of toy matrices, for which we go up to size $64 \times 64$ and $\mathcal{\kappa}$ values of up to $\approx$ 1 million, and (b) a deep-dive into quantum chemistry, where we consider matrices up to size $256 \times 256$ that reach $\mathcal{\kappa}$ of about 466. The molecular systems that we consider are Li$_{\mathrm{2}}$, RbH, and CsH. Although the feature of $|x\rangle$ considered in our examples is an overlap between the input and output states of the HHL algorithm, our approach is general and can be applied in principle to any transition matrix element involving $|x\rangle$.</description>

      <title>Multifold Majorana corner modes arising from multiple pairs of helical edge states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall insulators with a pair of helical edge states and proximity-induced superconductivity have been shown to support second-order topological superconductors with Majorana corner modes. As the Majorana corner modes are originated from the helical edge states of the quantum spin Hall insulators, whether quantum spin Hall insulators with multiple pairs of helical edge states and proximity-induced superconductivity can give rise to second-order topological superconductors with multifold Majorana corner modes is an interesting question to address. In this work, we consider a quantum spin Hall insulator with two pairs of helical edge states. We find robust twofold Majorana corner modes can be achieved when the helical edge states are gapped by a combined action of a magnetic exchange field and an $s$-wave pairing, or an $s+p$ mixed-parity pairing. The stability of two Majorana zero modes per corner under the action of magnetic exchange fields is attributed to the protection from the chiral symmetry. Our study reveals that heterostructures composed of superconductors and quantum spin Hall insulators with multiple pairs of helical edge states could serve as a platform to pursue multifold Majorana corner modes.</description>

      <title>Efficient excitation transfer in an LH2-inspired nanoscale stacked ring geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subwavelength ring-shaped structures of quantum emitters exhibit outstanding radiation properties and are useful for antennas, excitation transport, and storage. Taking inspiration from the oligomeric geometry of biological light-harvesting 2 (LH2) complexes, we study here generic examples and predict highly efficient excitation transfer in a three-dimensional (3D) subwavelength concentric stacked ring structure with a diameter of 400 $nm$, formed by two-level atoms. Utilizing the quantum optical open system master equation approach for the collective dipole dynamics, we demonstrate that, depending on the system parameters, our bio-mimicked 3D ring enables efficient excitation transfer between two ring layers. Our findings open prospects for engineering other biomimetic light-matter platforms and emitter arrays to achieve efficient energy transfer.</description>

      <title>(SPT-)LSM theorems from projective non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Projective symmetries are ubiquitous in quantum lattice models and can be leveraged to constrain their phase diagram and entanglement structure. In this paper, we investigate the consequences of projective algebras formed by non-invertible symmetries and lattice translations in a generalized $1+1$D quantum XY model based on group-valued qudits. This model is specified by a finite group $G$ and enjoys a projective $\mathsf{Rep}(G)\times Z(G)$ and translation symmetry, where symmetry operators obey a projective algebra in the presence of symmetry defects. For invertible symmetries, such projective algebras imply Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomalies. However, this is not generally true for non-invertible symmetries, and we derive a condition on $G$ for the existence of an LSM anomaly. When this condition is not met, we prove an SPT-LSM theorem: any unique and gapped ground state is necessarily a non-invertible weak symmetry protected topological (SPT) state with non-trivial entanglement, for which we construct an example fixed-point Hamiltonian. The projectivity also affects the dual symmetries after gauging $\mathsf{Rep}(G)\times Z(G)$ sub-symmetries, giving rise to non-Abelian and non-invertible dipole symmetries, as well as non-invertible translations. We complement our analysis with the SymTFT, where the projectivity causes it to be a topological order non-trivially enriched by translations. Throughout the paper, we develop techniques for gauging $\mathsf{Rep}(G)$ symmetry and inserting its symmetry defects on the lattice, which are applicable to other non-invertible symmetries.</description>

      <title>Superluminal spacetime boundary, time reflection and quantum light generation from relativistic plasma mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A plasma mirror is an optical device for high-power, ultrashort-wavelength electromagnetic fields, utilizing a sheet of relativistic oscillating electrons to generate and manipulate light. In this work, we propose that the spatiotemporally varying plasma oscillation, induced by an ultra-high-intensity laser beam, functions as a "spacetime mirror" with significant potential for exploring quantum light. We find that the spacetime mirror exhibits several exotic features: (i) a superluminal spacetime boundary, (ii) time reflection and refraction, and (iii) quantum light sources with pair generation. Our theoretical and simulation results are in excellent agreement, and experimental verification is underway. Our work demonstrates the interplay with emerging fields such as time varying media, suggesting the plasma mirror as an ideal platform to study strong-field quantum optics at extremes.</description>

      <title>Applying Quantum Autoencoders for Time Series Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection is an important problem with applications in various domains such as fraud detection, pattern recognition or medical diagnosis. Several algorithms have been introduced using classical computing approaches. However, using quantum computing for solving anomaly detection problems in time series data is a widely unexplored research field.
  This paper explores the application of quantum autoencoders to time series anomaly detection. We investigate two primary techniques for classifying anomalies: (1) Analyzing the reconstruction error generated by the quantum autoencoder and (2) latent representation analysis. Our simulated experimental results, conducted across various ansaetze, demonstrate that quantum autoencoders consistently outperform classical deep learning-based autoencoders across multiple datasets. Specifically, quantum autoencoders achieve superior anomaly detection performance while utilizing 60-230 times fewer parameters and requiring five times fewer training iterations. In addition, we implement our quantum encoder on real quantum hardware. Our experimental results demonstrate that quantum autoencoders achieve anomaly detection performance on par with their simulated counterparts.</description>
