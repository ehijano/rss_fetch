      <title>Wormhole solutions under the effect of dark matter in $f(R,L_m)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the background of $f(R, L_m)$ gravity, this work investigates three distinct dark matter halo profiles to test the possibility of generalised wormhole geometry within the galactic halo regions. The current study aims to accomplish these goals by examining various dark matter profiles including Universal Rotation Curves (URC), Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) model-I, and NFW model-II inside two distinct $f(R, L_m)$ gravity models. According to the $f(R, L_m) = \frac{R}{2} + L_m^\alpha$ model, the DM halo density profiles produce suitable shape functions that meet all the necessary requirements for exhibiting the wormhole geometries with appropriate choice of free parameters. In addition, to examine DM profiles under the $f(R, L_m) = \frac{R}{2} + (1 + \lambda R)L_m$ model, we consider a specific shape function. Further, we observed that the derived solution from both two models violates the null energy constraints, confirming that the DM supports wormholes to maintain in the galactic halo.</description>

      <title>Tidal deformations of slowly spinning isolated horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is generally believed that tidal deformations of a black hole in an external field, as measured using its gravitational field multipoles, vanish. However, this does not mean that the black hole horizon is not deformed. Here we shall discuss the deformations of a black hole horizon in the presence of an external field using a characteristic initial value formulation. Unlike existing methods, the starting point here is the black hole horizon itself. The effect of, say, a binary companion responsible for the tidal deformation is encoded in the geometry of the spacetime in the vicinity of the horizon. The near horizon spacetime geometry, i.e. the metric, spin coefficients, and curvature components, are all obtained by integrating the Einstein field equations outwards starting from the horizon. This method yields a reformulation of black hole perturbation theory in a neighborhood of the horizon. By specializing the horizon geometry to be a perturbation of Kerr, this method can be used to calculate the metric for a tidally deformed Kerr black hole with arbitrary spin. As a first application, we apply this formulation here to a slowly spinning black hole and explicitly construct the spacetime metric in a neighborhood of the horizon. We propose natural definitions of the electric and magnetic surficial Love numbers based on the Weyl tensor component $\Psi_2$. From our solution, we calculate the tidal perturbations of the black hole, and we extract both the field Love numbers and the surficial Love numbers which quantify the deformations of the horizon.</description>

      <title>Rotational Doppler Effect and Spin-Rotation Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rotational Doppler Effect (RDE) involves both the orbital angular momentum of electromagnetic radiation as well as its helicity. The RDE phenomena associated with photon helicity go beyond the standard theory of relativity. The purpose of this paper is to elucidate the theoretical basis of the helicity-dependent RDE in terms of the general phenomenon of spin-rotation coupling. The physical implications of this coupling are briefly pointed out and the nonlocal theory of rotating observers is described. For an observer rotating uniformly about the direction of incidence of a plane wave of definite helicity, the nonlocally measured amplitude of the wave is larger (smaller) if the observer rotates in the same (opposite) sense as the electromagnetic field. The implications of the nonlocal helicity dependence of the measured amplitude of the radiation are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>A novel signal-consistency test for gravitational-wave searches of generic black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel signal-consistency test applicable to a broad search for gravitational waves emitted by generic binary black hole (BBH) systems. The test generalizes the time domain $\xi^2$ signal-consistency test currently utilized by the GstLAL pipeline, which is restricted to aligned-spin circular orbits and does not account for higher-order modes (HMs). After addressing the mathematical details of the new test, we quantify its advantages in the context of searching for precessing BBHs and/or BBHs with HM content. Our results reveal that for precessing signals, the new test has the potential to diminish $\xi^2$ by up to two orders of magnitude when compared to the standard test. However, in the case of signals with HM content, only a modest enhancement is observed. Recognizing the computational burden associated with the new test, we also derive an approximated signal-consistency test. This approximation maintains the same computational cost as the standard test while sacrificing only a few percent of accuracy in the low SNR regime. The approximated test can be easily implemented in any matched filtering pipeline aimed at searching for BBH signals with strong precession content.</description>

      <title>Searching for gravitational-wave signals from precessing black hole binaries with the GstLAL pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precession in Binary Black Holes (BBH) is caused by the failure of the Black Hole spins to be aligned and its study can open up new perspectives in gravitational waves (GW) astronomy, providing, among other advancements, a precise measure of distance and an accurate characterization of the BBH spins. However, detecting precessing signals is a highly non-trivial task, as standard matched filtering pipelines for GW searches are built on many assumptions that do not hold in the precessing case. This work details the upgrades made to the GstLAL pipeline to facilitate the search for precessing BBH signals. The implemented changes in the search statistics and in the signal consistency test are then described in detail. The performance of the upgraded pipeline is evaluated through two extensive searches of precessing signals, targeting two different regions in the mass space, and the consistency of the results is examined. Additionally, the benefits of the upgrades are assessed by comparing the sensitive volume of the precessing searches with two corresponding traditional aligned-spin searches. While no significant sensitivity improvement is observed for precessing binaries with mass ratio $q\lesssim 6$, a volume increase of up to 100\% is attainable for heavily asymmetric systems with largely misaligned spins. This work paves the way for a large-scale search of precessing signals, possibly leading to an exciting future detection.</description>

      <title>A unimodular Kaluza-Klein theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unimodular gravity became an object of increasing interest in the late $80$-ties and was recently used in primordial Universe modeling with cosmological constant, in the context of the Brans-Dicke gravity including scalar field. In the present article we investigate the possibility of imposing the unimodular condition within the $5$-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory including the scalar field. The variational principle is formulated in $5$ dimensions first, and dimensional reduction is applied to the resulting set of equations. A cosmological model based on these equations is then presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Study on high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations in rotating black bounce spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate dynamical effects of particles moving around rotating SV regular BH and traversable wormholes, and the deviation from Kerr BH. We found that the rotating SV traversable wormhole spacetime has a closer innermost stable circular orbit to the central object than Kerr and rotating regular BHs. Furthermore, the paper provides the general form of the epicycle frequency in this spacetime, presenting the radial profile of the angular frequency of particles undergoing oscillatory motion. Unlike the commonly used $\chi$-square analysis method, with considering a generalized data analysis approach in this paper we hypothesize that the observational data of three microguasars can be explained through an axisymmetric SV spacetime, fitting the data to find the range of spin values for three types of SV objects, and analyzing the possible mechanisms of HFQPOs (high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations) generation for different types of axisymmetric SV objects. We found that for a Kerr BH with $l^*=0$, the observational data of three microquasars can be explained by the HFQPOs model used in this paper (excluding ER4 model); for a regular BH with $l^*=1$, the HFQPO phenomenon observed through the three microquasars can be explained by the ER0, ER1, ER2, ER3, RP0, RP1, RP2, TD and WD models. For a traversable wormhole with $l^*=3$, the mechanism of HFQPO can be interpreted by the ER1, ER3, RP0, RP1, RP2, TD and WD models. Moreover, we observed that for the same HFQPOs model, the limiting range of the spin parameter $\alpha^*$ increases with the increase of the parameter $l^*$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the old problem of the energy-momentum tensor in general relativistic field theories. On the basis of the general covariance we derive a simple equation for the Hilbert and Noether energy-momentum tensors for the scalar and electromagnetic field theories. We see that the two definitions of energy-momentum tensors coincide and identify the Noether current if the space-time has the Killing vector. Relation to the Wald entropy is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Rapid neutron star equation of state inference with Normalising Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first direct detection of gravitational waves from binary neutron stars on the 17th of August, 2017, (GW170817) heralded the arrival of a new messenger for probing neutron star astrophysics and provided the first constraints on neutron star equation of state from gravitational wave observations. Significant computational effort was expended to obtain these first results and therefore, as observations of binary neutron star coalescence become more routine in the coming observing runs, there is a need to improve the analysis speed and flexibility. Here, we present a rapid approach for inferring the neutron star equation of state based on Normalising Flows. As a demonstration, using the same input data, our approach, ASTREOS, produces results consistent with those presented by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration but requires &lt; 1 sec to generate neutron star equation of state confidence intervals. Furthermore, ASTREOS allows for non-parametric equation of state inference. This rapid analysis will not only facilitate neutron star equation of state studies but can potentially enhance future alerts for electromagnetic follow-up observations of binary neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Hairy black holes in extended Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theories with magnetic charge and kinetic couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study black hole (BH) solutions in extended Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theories which is classified in a subclass of the $U(1)$ gauge-invariant scalar-vector-tensor theories. The scalar field is coupled to the vector field, which has electric and magnetic charges. For the static and spherically symmetric spacetime, we investigate modifications to the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m solutions focusing on the three types of scalar-vector interactions, including derivative couplings. We solve the field equations analytically in two asymptotic regions which are the vicinity of the BH horizon and the spatial infinity, and clarify the condition for the existence of scalar hair. To understand the behaviors of solutions in intermediate scales, the field equations are integrated numerically for concrete models with different types of couplings. We find new hairy BH solutions with scalar hair in the presence of magnetic charge and kinetic coupling. The magnetic charge plays an important role in distinguishing hairy BH solutions originated from three types of different interactions at a large coupling limit.</description>

      <title>Greybody Factors Imprinted on Black Hole Ringdowns. II. Merging Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral amplitude of the merger-ringdown gravitational wave (GW) emitted by a comparable mass-ratio black hole merger is modeled by the greybody factor of the remnant black hole. Our model does not include fitting parameters except for a single overall spectral amplitude. We perform the mass-spin inference from the SXS data without introducing fitting parameters and without tuning the data range of each SXS template. Also, we find that the exponential damping in the ringdown spectral amplitude can be modeled well with the exponential damping in the greybody factor at high frequencies. Based on the findings, we propose a conjecture that the light ring of the remnant black hole, which sources the ringdown, forms as early as during the merger stage. We discuss the formation of the light ring in the static binary solution as a first step towards the understanding of how the separation of merging black holes may affect the formation of the light ring.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the so-called `tachyonic' scalar fields in de Sitter (dS) spacetime. Through a rigorous group-theoretical analysis, we argue that labeling these fields as `tachyonic' lacks physical relevance, frequently resulting in misinterpretations in scholarly discourse, such as the misconception of faster-than-light travel associated with the corresponding particles.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vacuum decay and symmetry breaking play an important role in the fundamental structure of the matter and the evolution of the universe. In this work we study how the purely classical effect of accretion of fundamental fields onto black holes can lead to shells of symmetry restoration in the midst of a symmetry broken phase. We also show how it can catalyze vacuum decay, forming a bubble that expands asymptotically at the speed of light. These effects offer an alternative, purely classical mechanism to quantum tunnelling for seeding phase transitions in the universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the new physics phenomena of gravidynamics governed by the inhomogeneous spin gauge symmetry based on the gravitational quantum field theory. Such a gravidynamics enables us to derive the generalized Einstein equation and an equation beyond it. To simplify the analyses, we linearize the dynamic equations of gravitational interaction by keeping terms up to the leading order in the dual gravigauge field. We then apply the linearized dynamic equations into two particular gravitational phenomena. First, we consider the linearized equations in the absence of source fields, which is shown to have five physical propagating polarizations as gravitational waves, i.e., two tensor modes, two vector modes, and one scalar, instead of two tensor polarizations in the general relativity. Second, we examine the Newtonian limit in which the gravitational fields and the matter source distribution are weak and static. By deriving the associated Poisson equation, we obtain the exact relation of the fundamental interaction coupling in the gravidynamics with the experimentally measured Newtonian constant. We also make use of nonrelativistic objects and relativistic photons to probe the Newtonian field configurations. In particular, the experiments from the gravitational deflection of light rays and the Shapiro time delay can place stringent constraints on the linearized gravidynamics in the gravitational quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Study of Massive Compact Star Admitting Conformal Motion Under Bardeen Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article primarily investigates the existence of the charged compact star under the conformal motion treatment within the context of f(Q) gravity. We have developed two models by implementing the power-law and linear form of conformal factor, enabling an in-depth comparison in our study. We have selected the MIT Bag model equation of state to describe the connection between pressure and energy density and matched the interior spherically symmetric space-time with the Bardeen space-time. In addition, the present research examines various physically valid characteristics of realistic stars, such as PSR J1614-2230, PSR J1903+327, Vela X-1, Cen X-3, and SMC X-1. We compare two constructed models by attributing the behavior of density, pressure, equilibrium conditions, and the adiabatic index. We have additionally included a brief analysis of the scenario involving Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime as an external geometry for the matching condition. In contrast to the Reissner-Nordstrom instance, the Bardeen model with the extra term in the asymptotic representations yields a more intriguing and viable result. The current analysis reveals that the resulting compact star solutions are physically acceptable and authentic when considering the presence of charge with conformal motion in f(Q) gravity.</description>

Abstract: The Kerr spacetime is a fundamental solution of general relativity (GR), describing the gravitational field around a rotating, uncharged black hole (BH). Kerr spacetime has been crucial in modern astrophysics and it serves as a foundation for the study of gravitational waves (GWs). Possible deviations in Kerr geometry may indicate deviations from GR predictions. In this work, we consider the Johannsen-Psaltis metric, which is a beyond-Kerr metric characterized by a single free parameter, and then we probe this theory framework using several GWs observations from the third Gravitational-wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3). We find that, for most of the events analyzed, there are no significant deviations from the null hypothesis, i.e. the Kerr metric. Our main findings demonstrate alignment and certain enhancements when compared to previous estimates documented in the literature.</description>

      <title>Double polytropic cosmic acceleration from the Murnaghan equation of state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a double polytropic cosmological fluid and demonstrate that, when one constituent resembles a bare cosmological constant while the other emulates a generalized Chaplygin gas, a good description of the Universe's large-scale dynamics is obtained. In particular, our double polytropic reduces to the Murnaghan equation of state, whose applications are already well established in solid state physics and classical thermodynamics. Intriguingly, our model approximates the conventional $\Lambda$CDM paradigm while reproducing the collective effects of logotropic and generalized Chaplygin fluids across different regimes. To check the goodness of our fluid description, we analyze first order density perturbations, refining our model through various orders of approximation, utilizing $\sigma_8$ data alongside other cosmological data sets. Encouraging results suggest that our model, based on the Murnaghan equation of state, outperforms the standard cosmological background within specific approximate regimes and, on the whole, surpasses the standard phenomenological reconstruction of dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new type of wavefunction for the universe computed from the Euclidean path integral, with asymptotically $AdS$ boundary conditions. In the semiclassical limit, it describes a Euclidean (half)-wormhole geometry, exhibiting a local maximum of the scale factor at the surface of reflection symmetry, giving rise to an expanding universe upon analytic continuation to Lorentzian signature. We find that these Euclidean wormholes set natural initial conditions for inflation and that the semi-classical Wheeler-DeWitt wavefunction can favor a long lasting inflationary epoch, resolving a well known issue of the no-boundary proposal. Due to the asymptotic $AdS$ conditions in the Euclidean past they raise the possibility of describing the physics of inflating cosmologies and their perturbations within the context of holography.</description>

      <title>Dual AGNs: Precursors of Binary Supermassive Black Hole Formation and Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) on scales of a few tens of kpc can be used to study merger-induced accretion on supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and offer insights about SMBH mergers, using dual AGNs as merger precursors. In this study, we use the Romulus25 cosmological simulation to investigate the properties and evolution of dual AGNs. We first analyze the properties of AGNs ($L_{bol} &gt; 10^{43} \rm erg/s$) and their neighboring SMBHs (any SMBHs closer than 30 pkpc to an AGN) at $z \leq 2$. This is our underlying population. Subsequently, we applied the luminosity threshold of $L_{bol} &gt; 10^{43} erg/s$ to the neighboring SMBHs thereby identifying dual and multiple AGNs in our simulation. We examined the properties and statistics of dual AGNs in comparison to single AGNs. Our findings indicate an increase in the number of both single and dual AGNs from lower to higher redshifts. All dual AGNs in our sample resulted from major mergers. Compared with the single AGN population, duals are characterized by a lower black hole to halo mass ratio. We found that the properties of dual AGN host halos, including halo mass, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and gas mass, are generally consistent with those of single AGN halos, albeit tending towards the higher end of their respective property ranges. Our analysis uncovered a diverse array of evolutionary patterns among dual AGNs, including rapidly evolving systems, slower ones, and instances where SMBH mergers are ineffective.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Edge Mode in $\mathcal{N}=1$ Jackiw-Teitelboim Supergravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the gravitational edge mode in the $\mathcal{N}=1$ Jackiw-Teitelboim~(JT) supergravity on the disk and it $osp(2|1)$ BF formulation. We revisit the derivation of the finite-temperature Schwarzian action in the conformal gauge of the bosonic JT gravity through wiggling boundary and the frame fluctuation descriptions. Extending our method to $\mathcal{N}=1$ JT supergravity, we derive the finite-temperature super-Schwarzian action for the edge mode from both the wiggling boundary and the superframe field fluctuation. We emphasize the crucial role of the supersymmetric version of the inversion formula in elucidating the relation between the isometry and the $OSp(2|1)$ gauging of the super-Schwarzian action. In $osp(2|1)$ BF formulation, we discuss the asymptotic AdS condition. We employ the Iwasawa-like decomposition of $OSp(2|1)$ group element to derive the super-Schwarzian action at finite temperature. We demonstrate that the $OSp(2|1)$ gauging arises from inherent redundancy in the Iwasawa-like decomposition. We also discuss the path integral measure obtained from the Haar measure of $OSp(2|1)$.</description>

Abstract: Recent investigations [arXiv:2111.02429][arXiv:2210.09647][arXiv:2304.05453] have introduced an infinite class of novel gravitational observables in Asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) space that reside on codimension-one or -zero regions of the bulk spacetime. These observables encompass well-established holographic complexity measures such as the maximum volume of the extremal hypersurfaces and the action or spacetime volume of the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) patch. Furthermore, this family of observables exhibits two universal properties when applied to the thermofield double (TFD) state: they exhibit linear growth at late times and faithfully reproduce the switchback effect. This implies that any observable from this class has the potential to serve as a gravitational dual for the circuit complexity of boundary states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ double holography to examine a system of two entangled gravitating universes that live on two codimension-one branes in an asymptotically AdS$_3$ spacetime with two disjoint conformal boundaries. There are distinct brane configurations depending on the temperature of the thermofield double (TFD) state between the left and right systems. The topology transition between two branes is naturally identified with the emergence of an Einstein-Rosen bridge connecting the two entangled universes. This doubly holographic construction offers a holographic perspective on gravitational collapse and black hole formation in brane universes. Through this holographic framework, we analyze the quantum information structure of the two gravitating universes. Specifically, we calculate the mutual information between defects present in the boundary theories on the left and right sides. Furthermore, we investigate the decoupling process in the Hayden-Preskill protocol applied to the two copies of the defect field theory and discuss the interpretation of the Yoshida-Kitaev decoding protocol.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose to adapt the precise definition of the flowing effective action in order to obtain a functional flow equation with simple properties close to physical intuition. The simplified flow equation is invariant under local gauge transformations and suitable for both euclidean and Minkowski signature and analytic continuation. The cutoff always removes fluctuations close to zeros of the inverse full propagator. A formulation of the simplified flow equation in terms of renormalized scale invariant fields permits direct access to scaling solutions and associated fixed points. Corrections to the simplified flow equation involve a field-dependent modification of the cutoff for which we discuss a systematic expansion. Truncated solutions for a scalar field theory in four dimensions suggest a new fixed point with a field-dependent coefficient of the kinetic term.</description>

Abstract: In previous work we have shown that the dipole in the low redshift supernovae of the Pantheon+SH0ES data does not agree with the one inferred from the velocity of the solar system as obtained from CMB data. We interpreted this as the presence of significant bulk velocities. In this paper we study the monopole, dipole and quadrupole in the Pantheon+SH0ES data. We find that in addition to the dipole also both, the monopole and the quadrupole are detected with high significance. They are of similar amplitudes as the bulk flow. While the monopole is only significant at very low redshift, the quadrupole even increases with redshift.</description>

      <title>Solution Generation of a Capped Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing the electric Harrison transformation developed in five-dimensional minimal supergravity, we construct an exact solution characterizing non-BPS charged rotating black holes with a horizon cross-section of a lens space L(n;1). Among these solutions, only the ones corresponding to n=0 and n=1 do not have any curvature singularities, conical singularities, Dirac-Misner string singularities, and orbifold singularities both on and outside the horizon; additionally, it is free from closed timelike curves. The solution for n=0 corresponds to the charged dipole black ring that we constructed in the previous paper. The specific solution for n=1, referred to as the ``capped black hole," was introduced in our previous letter. This provides the first example of a non-BPS exact solution, representing an asymptotically flat, stationary spherical black hole with a domain of outer communication (DOC) having a nontrivial topology in five-dimensional minimal supergravity. We demonstrate that the DOC on a timeslice has the topology of $[R^4\# CP^2 ]\setminus B^4$. Differing from the well-known Myers-Perry and Cveti\v{c}-Youm black holes describing a spherical horizon topology and a DOC with a trivial topology of $R^4 \setminus B^4$ on a timeslice, the capped black hole's horizon is capped by a disc-shaped bubble. We explicitly demonstrate that the capped black hole carries mass, two angular momenta, an electric charge, and a magnetic flux, with only three of these quantities being independent. Furthermore, we reveal that this black hole can possess identical conserved charges as the Cveti\v{c}-Youm black hole. The existence of this solution challenges black hole uniqueness beyond both the black ring and the BPS spherical black hole. Moreover, within specific parameter regions, the capped black hole can exhibit a larger entropy than the Cveti\v{c}-Youm black hole.</description>

      <title>Searching for large dark matter clumps using the Galileo Satnav clock variations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents bounds on transient variations of fundamental constants, with typical timescales ranging from minutes to months, using clocks in space. The underlying phenomenology describing such transient variations relies on models for Dark Matter (DM) which suggest possible encounters of macroscopic compact objects with the Earth, due to the motion of the solar system in the galactic halo. If such compact objects possess an effective feeble interaction with the ordinary matter beyond the gravitational one, it may result in effective transient variations of fundamental constants. Such variations leave signatures on clocks onboard GNSS satellites. In this paper, we introduce a phenomenological study dedicated to the search for such DM transient objects using the network of passive hydrogen masers (H-Masers) onboard Galileo satellites. We first model the signature of transient variations of fundamental constants as a frequency modulation in the difference between two satellite clocks, considering the satellite trajectories relative to the transient event. Then, we present first results based on a fast analysis method, the maximum reach analysis. The main result is a significant extension of the discovery range for DM transients, with a sensitivity never achieved before. We investigate indeed the range of transient sizes from $10^5$ to $10^9$ kilometres, which, apart from indirect and model-dependent non-transient effects, has never been explored previously.</description>

Abstract: Considering an anisotropic cosmological background is an interesting and simultaneously challenging problem of theoretical physics, since we not only assume a high degree of anisotropy in the early stages of the Universe, but also observe it to a small degree until now. In this paper we have constructed the unconstrained action for the perturbations above Bianchi I type background in the most general scalar-tensor theory of gravity, the Horndeski theory, and evaluate the effect of the deviation from the anisotropic background on the previously established stable solution obtained in previous works.</description>

      <title>The Accuracy of Neutron Star Radius Measurement with the Next Generation of Terrestrial Gravitational-Wave Observatories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05376v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the prospect for improving the measurement accuracy of masses and radii of neutron stars. We consider imminent and long-term upgrades of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and Virgo, as well as next-generation observatories -- the Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope. We find that neutron star radius with single events will be constrained to within roughly 500m with the current generation of detectors and their upgrades. This will improve to 200m, 100m and 50m with a network of observatories that contain one, two or three next-generation observatories, respectively. Combining events in bins of 0.05 solar masses we find that for stiffer (softer) equations-of-state like ALF2 (APR4), a network of three XG observatories will determine the radius to within 30m (100m) over the entire mass range of neutron stars from 1 to 2.0 solar masses (2.2 solar masses), allowed by the respective equations-of-state. Neutron star masses will be measured to within 0.5 percent with three XG observatories irrespective of the actual equation-of-state. Measurement accuracies will be a factor of 4 or 2 worse if the network contains only one or two XG observatories, respectively, and a factor of 10 worse in the case of networks consisting of Advanced LIGO, Virgo KAGRA and their upgrades. Tens to hundreds of high-fidelity events detected by future observatories will allow us to accurately measure the mass-radius curve and hence determine the dense matter equation-of-state to exquisite precision.</description>

      <title>A generalized mass-to-horizon relation: a new global approach to entropic cosmologies and its connection to $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a new generalized mass-to-horizon relation to be used in the context of entropic cosmologies and holographic principle scenarios. We show that a general scaling of the mass with the Universe horizon as $M=\gamma \frac{c^2}{G}L^n$ leads to a new generalized entropy $S_n = \gamma \frac{n}{1+n}\frac{2 \pi\,k_B\,c^3}{G\,\hbar} L^{n+1}$ from which we can recover many of the recently proposed forms of entropies at cosmological and black hole scales and also establish a thermodynamically consistent relation between each of them and Hawking temperature. We analyse the consequences of introducing this new mass-to-horizon relation on cosmological scales by comparing the corresponding modified Friedmann, acceleration, and continuity equations to cosmological data. We find that when $n=3$, the entropic cosmology model is fully and totally equivalent to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, thus providing a new fundamental support for the origin and the nature of the cosmological constant. In general, if $\log \gamma &lt; -3$, and irrespective of the value of $n$, we find a very good agreement with the data comparable with $\Lambda$CDM from which, in Bayesian terms, our models are indistinguishable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15778v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the impact of antisymmetric tensor effects on spherically symmetric black holes, investigating photon spheres, shadows, emission rate and quasinormal frequencies in relation to a parameter which triggers the Lorentz symmetry breaking. We examine these configurations without and with the presence of a cosmological constant. In the first scenario, the Lorentz violation parameter, denoted as $\lambda$, plays a pivotal role in reducing both the photon sphere and the shadow radius, while also leading to a damping effect on quasinormal frequencies. Conversely, in the second scenario, as the values of the cosmological constant ($\Lambda$) increase, we observe an expansion in the shadow radius. Also, we provide the constraints of the shadows based on the analysis observational data obtained from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) focusing on Sagittarius $A^{*}$ shadow images. Additionally, with the increasing $\Lambda$, the associated gravitational wave frequencies exhibit reduced damping modes.</description>

Abstract: The recent start of the fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration has reopened the hunt for gravitational-wave (GW) signals, with one compact-binary-coalescence (CBC) signal expected to be observed every few days. Among the signals that could be detected for the first time there is the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) from the superposition of unresolvable GW signals that cannot be detected individually. In fact, multiple SGWBs are likely to arise given the variety of sources, making it crucial to identify the dominant components and assess their origin. However, most search methods with ground-based detectors assume the presence of one SGWB component at a time, which could lead to biased results in estimating its spectral shape if multiple SGWBs exist. Therefore, a joint estimate of the components is necessary. In this work, we adapt such an approach and analyse the data from the first three LVK observing runs, searching for a multi-component isotropic SGWB. We do not find evidence for any SGWB and establish upper limits on the dimensionless energy parameter $\Omega_{\rm gw}(f)$ at 25 Hz for five different power-law spectral indices, $\alpha = 0, \, 2/3,\, 2,\, 3,\, 4$, jointly. For the spectral indices $\alpha = 2/3,\, 2, \, 4$, corresponding to astrophysical SGWBs from CBCs, r-mode instabilities in young rotating neutron stars, and magnetars, we draw further astrophysical implications by constraining the ensemble parameters $K_{\rm CBC}, \, K_{\rm r-modes}, \, K_{\rm magnetars}$, defined in the main text.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Aharonov-Bohm Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect, by placing a quantum system in free-fall around a gravitating body {\it e.g.} a satellite orbiting the Earth. Since the system is in free-fall, by the equivalence principle, the quantum system is locally in flat, gravity-free space-time - it is screened from the gravitational field. For a slightly elliptical orbit, the gravitational potential will change with time. This leads to the energy levels of the quantum system developing side bands which is the signature for this version of the Aharonov-Bohm effect. This contrasts with the normal signature of the Aharonov-Bohm effect of shifting of interference fringes.</description>

      <title>Structural aspects of the anti-de Sitter black hole pseudospectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black holes in anti-de Sitter spacetime provide an important testing ground for both gravitational and field-theoretic phenomena. In particular, the study of perturbations can be useful to further our understanding regarding certain physical processes, such as superradiance, or the dynamics of strongly coupled conformal field theories through the holographic principle. In this work we continue our systematic study of the ultraviolet instabilities of black-hole quasinormal modes, built on the characterization of the latter as eigenvalues of a (spectrally unstable) non-selfadjoint operator and using the pseudospectrum as a main analysis tool, extending our previous studies in the asymptotically flat setting to Anti-de Sitter asymptotics. Very importantly, this step provides a singularly well-suited probe into some of the key structural aspects of the pseudospectrum. This is a consequence of the specific features of the Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter geometry, together with the existence of a sound characterization by Warnick of quasinormal modes as eigenvalues, that is still absent in asymptotic flatness. This work focuses on such structural aspects, with an emphasis on the convergence issues of the pseudospectrum and, in particular, the comparison between the hyperboloidal and null slicing cases. As a physical by-product of this structural analysis we assess, in particular, the spectral stability of purely imaginary ``hydrodynamic" modes, which appear for axial gravitational perturbations, that become dominant when the black-hole horizon is larger than the anti-de Sitter radius. We find that their spectral stability, under perturbations, depends on how close they are to the real axis, or conversely how distant they are from the first oscillatory overtone.</description>

      <title>Infinite quantum twisting at the Cauchy horizon of rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a numerical calculation of the expectation value of the quantum angular-momentum current flux density for a scalar field in the Unruh state near the inner horizon of a Kerr-de Sitter black hole. Our results indicate that this flux diverges as $V_-^{-1}$ in a suitable Kruskal coordinate such that $V_-=0$ at the inner horizon. Depending on the parameter values of the scalar field and black hole that we consider, and depending on the polar angle (latitude), this flux can have different signs. In the near extremal cases considered, the angle average of the expectation value of the quantum angular momentum current flux is of the opposite sign as the angular momentum of the background itself, suggesting that, in the cases considered, quantum effects tend to decrease the total angular momentum of the spheres away from the extremal value. We also numerically calculate the energy flux component, which provides the leading order divergence of the quantum stress energy tensor, dominant over the classical stress energy tensor, at the inner horizon. Taking our expectation value of the quantum stress tensor as the source in the semiclassical Einstein equation, our analysis suggests that the spheres approaching the inner horizon can undergo an infinite twisting due to quantum effects along latitudes separating regions of infinite expansion and contraction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incorporating first-order QED effects, we explore the shadows of Kerr-Newman black holes with a magnetic charge through the numerical backward ray-tracing method. Our investigation accounts for both the direct influence of the electromagnetic field on light rays and the distortion of the background spacetime metric due to QED corrections. We notice that the area of the shadow increases with the QED effect, mainly due to the fact that the photons move more slowly in the effective medium and become easier to be trapped by the black hole.</description>

      <title>Effect of Deviations from General Relativity on Searches for Gravitational Wave Microlensing and Type II Strong Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the gravitational wave detector network is upgraded and the sensitivity of the detectors improves, novel scientific avenues open for exploration. For example, tests of general relativity will become more accurate as smaller deviations can be probed. Additionally, the detection of lensed gravitational waves becomes more likely. However, these new avenues could also interact with each other, and a gravitational wave event presenting deviations from general relativity could be mistaken for a lensed one. Here, we explore how phenomenological deviations from general relativity or binaries of exotic compact objects could impact those lensing searches focusing on a single event. We consider strong lensing, millilensing, and microlensing and find that certain phenomenological deviations from general relativity may be mistaken for all of these types of lensing. Therefore, our study shows that future candidate lensing events would need to be carefully examined to avoid a false claim of lensing where instead a deviation from general relativity has been seen.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04427v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a dilaton gravity model, we revisit the calculation of the temperature of an evaporating black hole that is initially formed by a shock wave, taking into account the quantum backreaction. Based on the holographic principle, along with the assumption of a boundary equation of motion, we show that the black hole energy is maintained for a while during the early stage of evaporation. Gradually, it decreases as time goes on and eventually vanishes. Thus, the Stefan-Boltzmann law tells us that the black hole temperature, defined by the emission rate of the black hole energy, starts from zero temperature and reaches a maximum value at a critical time, and finally vanishes. It is also shown that the maximum temperature of the evaporating black hole never exceeds the Hawking temperature of the eternal AdS$_{2}$ black hole. We discuss physical implications of the initial zero temperature of the evaporating black hole.</description>

      <title>Constraints on peculiar velocity distribution of binary black holes using gravitational waves with GWTC-3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Peculiar velocity encodes rich information about the formation, dynamics, evolution, and merging history of binary black holes. In this work, we employ a hierarchical Bayesian model to infer the peculiar velocity distribution of binary black holes. We use the data from GWTC-3 and assume a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for the peculiar velocities, but do not consider the dependence of peculiar velocity on the masses of black hole binaries. The constraint on the peculiar velocity distribution parameter, $v_0$, is weak and uninformative. However, the determination of peculiar velocity distribution can be significantly improved with next-generation ground-based gravitational wave detectors. For the Einstein Telescope, the relative uncertainty of $v_0$ will reduce to $\sim$ 10\% using $10^3$ golden binary black hole events. Our statistical approach thus provides a robust and prospective inference for determining the peculiar velocity distribution.</description>

      <title>Notes on emergent conformal symmetry for black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02262v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the motion of the massless scalar field and nearly bound null geodesics in the near-ring region of a black hole, which may possess either acceleration or a gravitomagnetic mass. Around such black holes, the photon ring deviates from the equatorial plane. In the large angular momentum limit, we demonstrate that the massless scalar field exhibits an emergent conformal symmetry in this near-ring region. Additionally, in the nearly bound limit, we observe the emergence of a conformal symmetry for the null geodesics that constitute the photon ring in the black hole image. These findings suggest that the hidden conformal symmetry, associated with the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{s l}(2, \mathbb{R})$, persists even for black holes lacking north-south reflection symmetry, thereby broadening the foundation of photon ring holography. Finally, we show that the conformal symmetry also emerges for nearly bound timelike geodesics and scalar fields in proximity to the particle ring, and with specific mass around a Schwarzschild black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05151v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Hamiltonian formulation of a dynamical system forced to move on a submanifold $G_\alpha(q^A)=0$. If for some reasons we are interested in knowing the dynamics of all original variables $q^A(t)$, the most economical would be a Hamiltonian formulation on the intermediate phase-space submanifold spanned by reducible variables $q^A$ and an irreducible set of momenta $p_i$, $[i]=[A]-[\alpha]$. We describe and compare two different possibilities for establishing the Poisson structure and Hamiltonian dynamics on an intermediate submanifold: Hamiltonian reduction of the Dirac bracket and intermediate formalism. As an example of the application of intermediate formalism, we deduce on this basis the Euler-Poisson equations of a spinning body, establish the underlying Poisson structure, and write their general solution in terms of the exponential of the Hamiltonian vector field.</description>

Abstract: Explaining the behavior of macroscopic objects from the point of view of the quantum paradigm has challenged the scientific community for a century today. A mechanism of gravitational self-interaction, governed by the so-called Schroedinger-Newton equation, is among the proposals that aim to shed some light on it. Despite all efforts, this mechanism has been proven difficult to probe. Here, we consider a simple Stern-Gerlach-like experiment to try it out. The Schroedinger-Newton equation can be analytically solved under certain proper conditions, and a dephasing effect induced by the gravitational self-interacting potential can be calculated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) describes the non-equilibrium dynamics and topological defect formation in systems undergoing second-order phase transitions. KZM has found applications in fields such as cosmology and condensed matter physics. However, it is generally not suitable for describing first-order phase transitions. It has been demonstrated that transitions in systems like superconductors or charged superfluids, typically classified as second-order, can exhibit weakly first-order characteristics when the influence of fluctuations is taken into account. Moreover, the order of the phase transition (i.e., the extent to which it becomes first rather than second order) can be tuned. We explore quench-induced formation of topological defects in such tunable phase transitions and propose that their density can be predicted by combining KZM with nucleation theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The universal eigenvalue distribution characterizing the Gram matrix of semiclassical ensembles of black hole microstates is recognized as the Marchenko-Pastur distribution, which plays a prominent role as the universal limit distribution in a large class of random matrix and vector models. It is proposed that this distribution also universally determines the energy spectral density of black holes, which allows to construct a Krylov space for the time evolution of typical black hole states and calculate their state complexity. It is checked that the state complexity growth at late times saturates Lloyd's bound. Some implications of the proposed spectral density for the generation of Hawking radiation and black hole evaporation are discussed.</description>

      <title>Dark Branes for Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a setup for the origin of dark matter based on spacetime with a warped extra dimension and three branes: the Planck brane, the TeV brane, at a (few) TeV scale $\rho_T$, and a dark brane, at a (sub)-GeV scale $\rho_1\lesssim 100$ GeV $\ll\rho_T$. The Standard Model is localized in the TeV brane, thus solving the Higgs hierarchy problem, while the dark matter $\chi$, a Dirac fermion with mass $m_\chi&lt;\rho_1$, is localized in the dark brane. The radion, with mass $m_r&lt;m_\chi$, interacts strongly ($\sim m_\chi/\rho_1\sim\mathcal O(1)$) with dark matter and very weakly ($\sim m_{f}\rho_1/\rho_T^2\ll 1$) with the Standard Model matter $f$. The generic conflict between the bounds on its detection signatures and its proper relic abundance is avoided as dark matter annihilation is $p$-wave suppressed. The former is determined by its very weak interactions with the SM and the latter by its much stronger annihilation into radions. Therefore, there is a vast range in the Dark Matter's parameter space where the correct relic abundance is achieved consistently with the existing bounds. Moreover, for the dark brane with $\rho_1\lesssim 10$~GeV, a confinement/deconfinement first order phase transition, where the radion condensates, produces a stochastic gravitational waves background at the nanoHz frequencies, which can be identified with the signal detected by the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) experiments. In the PTA window, for $0.15 \textrm{ GeV}\lesssim m_\chi\lesssim 2$ GeV the relic abundance is reproduced and all constraints are satisfied.</description>

Abstract: We compute the 5PM order contributions to the scattering angle and impulse of classical black hole scattering in the conservative sector at first self-force order (1SF) using the worldline quantum field theory formalism. This challenging four-loop computation required the use of advanced integration-by-parts and differential equation technology implemented on high-performance computing systems. Use of partial fraction identities allowed us to render the complete integrand in a fully planar form. The resulting function space is simpler than expected: in the scattering angle we see only multiple polylogarithms up to weight three, and a total absence of the elliptic integrals that appeared at 4PM order. All checks on our result, both internal - cancellation of dimensional regularization poles, preservation of the on-shell condition - and external - matching the slow-velocity limit with the post-Newtonian (PN) literature up to 5PN order and matching the tail terms to the 4PM loss of energy - are passed.</description>

      <title>Von Neumann Algebras in Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It's been argued that a finite effective temperature emerges and characterizes the thermal property of double-scaled SYK model in the infinite temperature limit. On the other hand, in static patch of de Sitter, the maximally entangled state exhibits KMS condition of infinite temperature, suggesting the Type II$_1$ nature of the algebra formed by operators that are gravitationally dressed to the static patch observer. In the current work we study the double-scaled algebra generated by chord operators in double-scaled SYK model. We show that the algebra exhibits a behavior reminiscent of both perspectives. In particular, we prove that it's a Type II$_1$ factor, and the empty state with no chords satisfies the tracial property, thus aligning with the expectation in previous work. Furthermore, we show it's a cyclic separating state by exploring the modular structure of the algebra. We then study various limits of the theory and explore corresponding relations to JT gravity, theory of baby universe, and Brownian double-scaled SYK. We also present a full solution to the energy spectrum of $0$- and $1$- particle irreducible representations.</description>
