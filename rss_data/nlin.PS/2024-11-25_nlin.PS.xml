      <title>Exact expression for the propagating front velocity in nonlinear discrete systems under nonreciprocal coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear waves are a robust phenomenon observed in complex systems ranging from mechanics to ecology. Fronts are fundamental due to their robustness against perturbations and capacity to propagate one state over another. Controlling and understanding these waves is then fundamental to make use of their properties. Their velocity is one of the most important properties, which can be theoretically computed only in limited conditions of the dynamical system, and it becomes elusive in the presence of spatial discreteness and nonreciprocal coupling. This work reveals that fronts in discrete systems can be treated as rigid objects when analyzing their whole trajectory instead of the instantaneous one. Then, a relationship between the front velocity and its found shape is given. The formula provides insight into fronts' long-observed properties and agrees with the approximative and parameterized methods described in the literature. Numerical simulations show perfect agreement with the theory.</description>

      <title>Noise-induced nonreciprocal topological dissipative solitons in directionally coupled chains and lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal coupling can alter the transport properties of material media, producing striking phenomena such as unidirectional amplification of waves, boundary modes, or self-assembled pattern formation. It is responsible for nonlinear convective instabilities in nonlinear systems that drive topological dissipative solitons in a single direction, producing a lossless information transmission. Considering fluctuations, which are intrinsic to every macroscopic dynamical system, noise-sustained structures emerge permanently in time. Here, we study arrays of nonreciprocally coupled bistable systems exhibiting noise-sustained topological phase wall (or soliton) dynamics. The bifurcations between different steady states are analytically addressed, and the properties of the noise-sustained states are unveiled as a function of the reciprocal and nonreciprocal coupling parameters. Furthermore, we study critical points where the structures' characteristic size diverges with different power law exponents. Our numerical results agree with the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Breather bound states in a parametrically driven magnetic wire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the results of systematic investigation of localized dynamical states in the model of a one-dimensional magnetic wire, which is based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation. The dissipative term in the LLG equation is compensated by the parametric drive imposed by the external AC magnetic field, which is uniformly applied perpendicular to the rectilinear wire. The existence and stability of the localized states is studied in the plane of the relevant control parameters, viz., the amplitude of the driving term and the detuning of its frequency from the parametric resonance. With the help of systematically performed simulations of the LLG equation, existence and stability areas are identified in the parameter plane for several species of the localized states: stationary single- and two-soliton modes, single and double breathers, drifting double breathers with spontaneously broken inner symmetry, and multi-soliton complexes. Multistability occurs in this system. The breathers emit radiation waves (which explains their drift caused by the spontaneous symmetry breaking, as it breaks the balance between the recoil from the waves emitted to left and right), while the multi-soliton complexes exhibit cycles of periodic transitions between three-, five-, and seven-soliton configurations. Dynamical characteristics of the localized states are systematically calculated too. These include, in particular, the average velocity of the asymmetric drifting modes, and the largest Lyapunov exponent, whose negative and positive values imply that the intrinsic dynamics of the respective modes is regular or chaotic, respectively.</description>

      <title>Self-organized quantization and oscillations on continuous fixed-energy sandpiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.04470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric self-organization and activator-inhibitor dynamics in biology provide examples of checkerboard-like spatio-temporal organization. We study a simple model for local activation-inhibition processes. Our model, first introduced in the context of atmospheric moisture dynamics, is a continuous-energy and non-Abelian version of the fixed-energy sandpile model. Each lattice site is populated by a non-negative real number, its energy. Upon each timestep all sites with energy exceeding a unit threshold re-distribute their energy at equal parts to their nearest neighbors. The limit cycle dynamics gives rise to a complex phase diagram in dependence on the mean energy $\mu$: For low $\mu$, all dynamics ceases after few re-distribution events. For large $\mu$, the dynamics is well-described as a diffusion process, where the order parameter, spatial variance $\sigma$, is removed. States at intermediate $\mu$ are dominated by checkerboard-like period-two phases which are however interspersed by much more complex phases of far longer periods. Phases are separated by discontinuous jumps in $\sigma$ or $\partial_{\mu}\sigma$ - akin to first and higher-order phase transitions. Overall, the energy landscape is dominated by few energy levels which occur as sharp spikes in the single-site density of states and are robust to noise.</description>
