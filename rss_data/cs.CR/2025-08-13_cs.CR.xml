      <title>Selective KV-Cache Sharing to Mitigate Timing Side-Channels in LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global KV-cache sharing has emerged as a key optimization for accelerating large language model (LLM) inference. However, it exposes a new class of timing side-channel attacks, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive user inputs via shared cache entries. Existing defenses, such as per-user isolation, eliminate leakage but degrade performance by up to 38.9% in time-to-first-token (TTFT), making them impractical for high-throughput deployment. To address this gap, we introduce SafeKV (Secure and Flexible KV Cache Sharing), a privacy-aware KV-cache management framework that selectively shares non-sensitive entries while confining sensitive content to private caches. SafeKV comprises three components: (i) a hybrid, multi-tier detection pipeline that integrates rule-based pattern matching, a general-purpose privacy detector, and context-aware validation; (ii) a unified radix-tree index that manages public and private entries across heterogeneous memory tiers (HBM, DRAM, SSD); and (iii) entropy-based access monitoring to detect and mitigate residual information leakage. Our evaluation shows that SafeKV mitigates 94% - 97% of timing-based side-channel attacks. Compared to per-user isolation method, SafeKV improves TTFT by up to 40.58% and throughput by up to 2.66X across diverse LLMs and workloads. SafeKV reduces cache-induced TTFT overhead from 50.41% to 11.74% on Qwen3-235B. By combining fine-grained privacy control with high cache reuse efficiency, SafeKV reclaims the performance advantages of global sharing while providing robust runtime privacy guarantees for LLM inference.</description>

      <title>Designing with Deception: ML- and Covert Gate-Enhanced Camouflaging to Thwart IC Reverse Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated circuits (ICs) are essential to modern electronic systems, yet they face significant risks from physical reverse engineering (RE) attacks that compromise intellectual property (IP) and overall system security. While IC camouflage techniques have emerged to mitigate these risks, existing approaches largely focus on localized gate modifications, neglecting comprehensive deception strategies. To address this gap, we present a machine learning (ML)-driven methodology that integrates cryptic and mimetic cyber deception principles to enhance IC security against RE. Our approach leverages a novel And-Inverter Graph Variational Autoencoder (AIG-VAE) to encode circuit representations, enabling dual-layered camouflage through functional preservation and appearance mimicry. By introducing new variants of covert gates -- Fake Inverters, Fake Buffers, and Universal Transmitters -- our methodology achieves robust protection by obscuring circuit functionality while presenting misleading appearances. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy in maintaining circuit functionality while achieving high camouflage and similarity scores with minimal structural overhead. Additionally, we validate the robustness of our method against advanced artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced RE attacks, highlighting its practical applicability in securing IC designs. By bridging the gap in mimetic deception for hardware security, our work sets a new standard for IC camouflage, advancing the application of cyber deception principles to protect critical systems from adversarial threats.</description>

      <title>AI Security Map: Holistic Organization of AI Security Technologies and Impacts on Stakeholders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the social implementation of AI has been steadily progressing, research and development related to AI security has also been increasing. However, existing studies have been limited to organizing related techniques, attacks, defenses, and risks in terms of specific domains or AI elements. Thus, it extremely difficult to understand the relationships among them and how negative impacts on stakeholders are brought about. In this paper, we argue that the knowledge, technologies, and social impacts related to AI security should be holistically organized to help understand relationships among them. To this end, we first develop an AI security map that holistically organizes interrelationships among elements related to AI security as well as negative impacts on information systems and stakeholders. This map consists of the two aspects, namely the information system aspect (ISA) and the external influence aspect (EIA). The elements that AI should fulfill within information systems are classified under the ISA. The EIA includes elements that affect stakeholders as a result of AI being attacked or misused. For each element, corresponding negative impacts are identified. By referring to the AI security map, one can understand the potential negative impacts, along with their causes and countermeasures. Additionally, our map helps clarify how the negative impacts on AI-based systems relate to those on stakeholders. We show some findings newly obtained by referring to our map. We also provide several recommendations and open problems to guide future AI security communities.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Critical Infrastructure in Smart Grids: A Unified Framework for Synthetic Data Generation and Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In digital substations, security events pose significant challenges to the sustained operation of power systems. To mitigate these challenges, the implementation of robust defense strategies is critically important. A thorough process of anomaly identification and detection in information and communication technology (ICT) frameworks is crucial to ensure secure and reliable communication and coordination between interconnected devices within digital substations. Hence, this paper addresses the critical cybersecurity challenges confronting IEC61850-based digital substations within modern smart grids, where the integration of advanced communication protocols, e.g., generic object-oriented substation event (GOOSE), has enhanced energy management and introduced significant vulnerabilities to cyberattacks. Focusing on the limitations of traditional anomaly detection systems (ADSs) in detecting threats, this research proposes a transformative approach by leveraging generative AI (GenAI) to develop robust ADSs. The primary contributions include the suggested advanced adversarial traffic mutation (AATM) technique to generate synthesized and balanced datasets for GOOSE messages, ensuring protocol compliance and enabling realistic zero-day attack pattern creation to address data scarcity. Then, the implementation of GenAI-based ADSs incorporating the task-oriented dialogue (ToD) processes has been explored for improved detection of attack patterns. Finally, a comparison of the GenAI-based ADS with machine learning (ML)-based ADSs has been implemented to showcase the outperformance of the GenAI-based frameworks considering the AATM-generated GOOSE datasets and standard/advanced performance evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Hypervisor-based Double Extortion Ransomware Detection Method Using Kitsune Network Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double extortion ransomware attacks have become mainstream since many organizations adopt more robust and resilient data backup strategies against conventional crypto-ransomware. This paper presents detailed attack stages, tactics, procedures, and tools used in the double extortion ransomware attacks. We then present a novel detection method using low-level storage and memory behavioral features and network traffic features obtained from a thin hypervisor to establish a defense-in-depth strategy for when attackers compromise OS-level protection. We employed the lightweight \emph{Kitsune} Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)'s network feature to detect the data exfiltration phase in double extortion ransomware attacks. Our experimental results showed that the presented method improved by 0.166 in the macro F score of the data exfiltration phase detection rate. Lastly, we discuss the limitations of the presented method and future work.</description>

      <title>Evasive Ransomware Attacks Using Low-level Behavioral Adversarial Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protecting state-of-the-art AI-based cybersecurity defense systems from cyber attacks is crucial. Attackers create adversarial examples by adding small changes (i.e., perturbations) to the attack features to evade or fool the deep learning model. This paper introduces the concept of low-level behavioral adversarial examples and its threat model of evasive ransomware. We formulate the method and the threat model to generate the optimal source code of evasive malware. We then examine the method using the leaked source code of Conti ransomware with the micro-behavior control function. The micro-behavior control function is our test component to simulate changing source code in ransomware; ransomware's behavior can be changed by specifying the number of threads, file encryption ratio, and delay after file encryption at the boot time. We evaluated how much an attacker can control the behavioral features of ransomware using the micro-behavior control function to decrease the detection rate of a ransomware detector.</description>

      <title>Approximate DBSCAN under Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08749v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper revisits the DBSCAN problem under differential privacy (DP). Existing DP-DBSCAN algorithms aim at publishing the cluster labels of the input points. However, we show that both empirically and theoretically, this approach cannot offer any utility in the published results. We therefore propose an alternative definition of DP-DBSCAN based on the notion of spans. We argue that publishing the spans actually better serves the purposes of visualization and classification of DBSCAN. Then we present a linear-time DP-DBSCAN algorithm achieving the sandwich quality guarantee in any constant dimensions, as well as matching lower bounds on the approximation ratio. A key building block in our algorithm is a linear-time algorithm for constructing a histogram under pure-DP, which is of independent interest. Finally, we conducted experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to verify the practical performance of our DP-DBSCAN algorithm.</description>

      <title>Never Compromise to Vulnerabilities: A Comprehensive Survey on AI Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08789v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI has expanded its capabilities across domains, yet introduced critical technical vulnerabilities, such as algorithmic bias and adversarial sensitivity, that pose significant societal risks, including misinformation, inequity, security breaches, physical harm, and eroded public trust. These challenges highlight the urgent need for robust AI governance. We propose a comprehensive framework integrating technical and societal dimensions, structured around three interconnected pillars: Intrinsic Security (system reliability), Derivative Security (real-world harm mitigation), and Social Ethics (value alignment and accountability). Uniquely, our approach unifies technical methods, emerging evaluation benchmarks, and policy insights to promote transparency, accountability, and trust in AI systems. Through a systematic review of over 300 studies, we identify three core challenges: (1) the generalization gap, where defenses fail against evolving threats; (2) inadequate evaluation protocols that overlook real-world risks; and (3) fragmented regulations leading to inconsistent oversight. These shortcomings stem from treating governance as an afterthought, rather than a foundational design principle, resulting in reactive, siloed efforts that fail to address the interdependence of technical integrity and societal trust. To overcome this, we present an integrated research agenda that bridges technical rigor with social responsibility. Our framework offers actionable guidance for researchers, engineers, and policymakers to develop AI systems that are not only robust and secure but also ethically aligned and publicly trustworthy.

      <title>Image selective encryption analysis using mutual information in CNN based embedding space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As digital data transmission continues to scale, concerns about privacy grow increasingly urgent - yet privacy remains a socially constructed and ambiguously defined concept, lacking a universally accepted quantitative measure. This work examines information leakage in image data, a domain where information-theoretic guarantees are still underexplored. At the intersection of deep learning, information theory, and cryptography, we investigate the use of mutual information (MI) estimators - in particular, the empirical estimator and the MINE framework - to detect leakage from selectively encrypted images. Motivated by the intuition that a robust estimator would require a probabilistic frameworks that can capture spatial dependencies and residual structures, even within encrypted representations - our work represent a promising direction for image information leakage estimation.</description>

      <title>EditMF: Drawing an Invisible Fingerprint for Your Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is resource-intensive and expensive, making protecting intellectual property (IP) for LLMs crucial. Recently, embedding fingerprints into LLMs has emerged as a prevalent method for establishing model ownership. However, existing back-door-based methods suffer from limited stealth and efficiency. To simultaneously address these issues, we propose EditMF, a training-free fingerprinting paradigm that achieves highly imperceptible fingerprint embedding with minimal computational overhead. Ownership bits are mapped to compact, semantically coherent triples drawn from an encrypted artificial knowledge base (e.g., virtual author-novel-protagonist facts). Causal tracing localizes the minimal set of layers influencing each triple, and a zero-space update injects the fingerprint without perturbing unrelated knowledge. Verification requires only a single black-box query and succeeds when the model returns the exact pre-embedded protagonist. Empirical results on LLaMA and Qwen families show that EditMF combines high imperceptibility with negligible model's performance loss, while delivering robustness far beyond LoRA-based fingerprinting and approaching that of SFT embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EditMF is an effective and low-overhead solution for secure LLM ownership verification.</description>

      <title>Redactable Blockchains: An Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchains are widely recognized for their immutability, which provides robust guarantees of data integrity and transparency. However, this same feature poses significant challenges in real-world situations that require regulatory compliance, correction of erroneous data, or removal of sensitive information. Redactable blockchains address the limitations of traditional ones by enabling controlled, auditable modifications to blockchain data, primarily through cryptographic mechanisms such as chameleon hash functions and alternative redaction schemes. This report examines the motivations for introducing redactability, surveys the cryptographic primitives that enable secure edits, and analyzes competing approaches and their shortcomings. Special attention is paid to the practical deployment of redactable blockchains in private settings, with discussions of use cases in healthcare, finance, Internet of drones, and federated learning. Finally, the report outlines further challenges, also in connection with reversible computing, and the future potential of redactable blockchains in building law-compliant, trustworthy, and scalable digital infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Load-Altering Attacks Against Power Grids: A Case Study Using the GB-36 Bus System Open Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing digitalization and the rapid adoption of high-powered Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled devices (e.g., EV charging stations) have increased the vulnerability of power grids to cyber threats. In particular, the so-called Load Altering Attacks (LAAs) can trigger rapid frequency fluctuations and potentially destabilize the power grid. This paper aims to bridge the gap between academic research and practical application by using open-source datasets released by grid operators. It investigates various LAA scenarios on a real-world transmission network, namely the Great Britain (GB)-36 Zone model released by the UK's National Electricity System Operator (NESO). It evaluates the threshold of LAA severity that the grid can tolerate before triggering cascading effects. Additionally, it explores how Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) based fast frequency response services can mitigate or prevent such impacts. Simulations are conducted using DIgSILENT PowerFactory to ensure realistic system representation. The analysis provides several useful insights to grid operators on the LAA impact, such as the influence of the relative locations of BESS and LAA, as well as how delays in attack execution can influence the overall system response.</description>

      <title>Attacks and Defenses Against LLM Fingerprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models are increasingly deployed in sensitive environments, fingerprinting attacks pose significant privacy and security risks. We present a study of LLM fingerprinting from both offensive and defensive perspectives. Our attack methodology uses reinforcement learning to automatically optimize query selection, achieving better fingerprinting accuracy with only 3 queries compared to randomly selecting 3 queries from the same pool. Our defensive approach employs semantic-preserving output filtering through a secondary LLM to obfuscate model identity while maintaining semantic integrity. The defensive method reduces fingerprinting accuracy across tested models while preserving output quality. These contributions show the potential to improve fingerprinting tools capabilities while providing practical mitigation strategies against fingerprinting attacks.</description>

      <title>Developing a Transferable Federated Network Intrusion Detection System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are a vital part of a network-connected device. In this paper, we develop a deep learning based intrusion detection system that is deployed in a distributed setup across devices connected to a network. Our aim is to better equip deep learning models against unknown attacks using knowledge from known attacks. To this end, we develop algorithms to maximize the number of transferability relationships. We propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, along with two algorithms that maximize the number of relationships observed. One is a two step data pre-processing stage, and the other is a Block-Based Smart Aggregation (BBSA) algorithm. The proposed system succeeds in achieving superior transferability performance while maintaining impressive local detection rates. We also show that our method is generalizable, exhibiting transferability potential across datasets and even with different backbones.

      <title>Obfuscated Quantum and Post-Quantum Cryptography</title>

Abstract: In this work, we present an experimental deployment of a new design for combined quantum key distribution (QKD) and post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Novel to our system is the dynamic obfuscation of the QKD-PQC sequence of operations, the number of operations, and parameters related to the operations; coupled to the integration of a GPS-free quantum synchronization protocol within the QKD process. We compare the performance and overhead of our QKD-PQC system relative to a standard QKD system with one-time pad encryption, demonstrating that our design can operate in real time with little additional overhead caused by the new security features. Since our system can offer additional defensive strategies against a wide spectrum of practical attacks that undermine deployed QKD, PQC, and certain combinations of these two primitives, we suggest that our design represents one of the most secure communication systems currently available. Given the dynamic nature of its obfuscation attributes, our new system can also be adapted in the field to defeat yet-to-be-discovered practical attacks.</description>

      <title>Oblivionis: A Lightweight Learning and Unlearning Framework for Federated Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly leverage Federated Learning (FL) to utilize private, task-specific datasets for fine-tuning while preserving data privacy. However, while federated LLM frameworks effectively enable collaborative training without raw data sharing, they critically lack built-in mechanisms for regulatory compliance like GDPR's right to be forgotten. Integrating private data heightens concerns over data quality and long-term governance, yet existing distributed training frameworks offer no principled way to selectively remove specific client contributions post-training. Due to distributed data silos, stringent privacy constraints, and the intricacies of interdependent model aggregation, federated LLM unlearning is significantly more complex than centralized LLM unlearning. To address this gap, we introduce Oblivionis, a lightweight learning and unlearning framework that enables clients to selectively remove specific private data during federated LLM training, enhancing trustworthiness and regulatory compliance. By unifying FL and unlearning as a dual optimization objective, we incorporate 6 FL and 5 unlearning algorithms for comprehensive evaluation and comparative analysis, establishing a robust pipeline for federated LLM unlearning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Oblivionis outperforms local training, achieving a robust balance between forgetting efficacy and model utility, with cross-algorithm comparisons providing clear directions for future LLM development.</description>

      <title>FetFIDS: A Feature Embedding Attention based Federated Network Intrusion Detection Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have an increasingly important role in preventing exploitation of network vulnerabilities by malicious actors. Recent deep learning based developments have resulted in significant improvements in the performance of IDS systems. In this paper, we present FetFIDS, where we explore the employment of feature embedding instead of positional embedding to improve intrusion detection performance of a transformer based deep learning system. Our model is developed with the aim of deployments in edge learning scenarios, where federated learning over multiple communication rounds can ensure both privacy and localized performance improvements. FetFIDS outperforms multiple state-of-the-art intrusion detection systems in a federated environment and demonstrates a high degree of suitability to federated learning. The code for this work can be found at https://github.com/ghosh64/fetfids.</description>

      <title>Whispers in the Machine: Confidentiality in Agentic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06922v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction between users and applications is increasingly shifted toward natural language by deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) as the core interface. The capabilities of these so-called agents become more capable the more tools and services they serve as an interface for, ultimately leading to agentic systems. Agentic systems use LLM-based agents as interfaces for most user interactions and various integrations with external tools and services. While these interfaces can significantly enhance the capabilities of the agentic system, they also introduce a new attack surface. Manipulated integrations, for example, can exploit the internal LLM and compromise sensitive data accessed through other interfaces. While previous work primarily focused on attacks targeting a model's alignment or the leakage of training data, the security of data that is only available during inference has escaped scrutiny so far. In this work, we demonstrate how the integration of LLMs into systems with external tool integration poses a risk similar to established prompt-based attacks, able to compromise the confidentiality of the entire system. Introducing a systematic approach to evaluate these confidentiality risks, we identify two specific attack scenarios unique to these agentic systems and formalize these into a tool-robustness framework designed to measure a model's ability to protect sensitive information. Our analysis reveals significant vulnerabilities across all tested models, highlighting an increased risk when models are combined with external tools.</description>

      <title>Evaluating lightweight unsupervised online IDS for masquerade attacks in CAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13778v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vehicular controller area networks (CANs) are susceptible to masquerade attacks by malicious adversaries. In masquerade attacks, adversaries silence a targeted ID and then send malicious frames with forged content at the expected timing of benign frames. As masquerade attacks could seriously harm vehicle functionality and are the stealthiest attacks to detect in CAN, recent work has devoted attention to compare frameworks for detecting masquerade attacks in CAN. However, most existing works report offline evaluations using CAN logs already collected using simulations that do not comply with the domain's real-time constraints. Here we contribute to advance the state of the art by presenting a comparative evaluation of four different non-deep learning (DL)-based unsupervised online intrusion detection systems (IDS) for masquerade attacks in CAN. Our approach differs from existing comparative evaluations in that we analyze the effect of controlling streaming data conditions in a sliding window setting. In doing so, we use realistic masquerade attacks being replayed from the ROAD dataset. We show that although evaluated IDS are not effective at detecting every attack type, the method that relies on detecting changes in the hierarchical structure of clusters of time series produces the best results at the expense of higher computational overhead. We discuss limitations, open challenges, and how the evaluated methods can be used for practical unsupervised online CAN IDS for masquerade attacks.</description>

      <title>ObfusQate: Unveiling the First Quantum Program Obfuscation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces ObfusQate, a novel tool that conducts obfuscations using quantum primitives to enhance the security of both classical and quantum programs. We have designed and implemented two primary categories of obfuscations: quantum circuit level obfuscation and code level obfuscation, encompassing a total of eight distinct methods. Quantum circuit-level obfuscation leverages on quantum gates and circuits, utilizing strategies such as quantum gate hiding and identity matrices to construct complex, non-intuitive circuits that effectively obscure core functionalities and resist reverse engineering, making the underlying code difficult to interpret. Meanwhile, code-level obfuscation manipulates the logical sequence of program operations through quantum-based opaque predicates, obfuscating execution paths and rendering program behavior more unpredictable and challenging to analyze. Additionally, ObfusQate can be used to obfuscate malicious code segments, making them harder to detect and analyze. These advancements establish a foundational framework for further exploration into the potential and limitations of quantum-based obfuscation techniques, positioning ObfusQate as a valuable tool for future developers to enhance code security in the evolving landscape of software development. To the best of our knowledge, ObfusQate represents the pioneering work in developing an automated framework for implementing obfuscations leveraging quantum primitives. Security evaluations show that obfuscations by ObfusQate maintain code behavior with polynomial overheads in space and time complexities. We have also demonstrated an offensive use case by embedding a keylogger into Shor's algorithm and obfuscating it using ObfusQate. Our results show that current Large language models like GPT 4o, GPT o3 mini and Grok 3 were not able to identify the malicious keylogger after obfuscation.</description>

      <title>ELFuzz: Efficient Input Generation via LLM-driven Synthesis Over Fuzzer Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10323v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generation-based fuzzing produces appropriate test cases according to specifications of input grammars and semantic constraints to test systems and software. However, these specifications require significant manual effort to construct. This paper proposes a new approach, ELFuzz (Evolution Through Large Language Models for Fuzzing), that automatically synthesizes generation-based fuzzers tailored to a system under test (SUT) via LLM-driven synthesis over fuzzer space. At a high level, it starts with minimal seed fuzzers and propels the synthesis by fully automated LLM-driven evolution with coverage guidance. Compared to previous approaches, ELFuzz can 1) seamlessly scale to SUTs of real-world sizes -- up to 1,791,104 lines of code in our evaluation -- and 2) synthesize efficient fuzzers that catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. Our evaluation compared ELFuzz with specifications manually written by domain experts and synthesized by state-of-the-art approaches. It shows that ELFuzz achieves up to 434.8% more coverage over the second best and triggers up to 216.7% more artificially injected bugs, compared to the state-of-the-art. We also used ELFuzz to conduct a real-world fuzzing campaign on the newest version of cvc5 for 14 days, and encouragingly, it found five 0-day bugs (three are exploitable). Moreover, we conducted an ablation study, which shows that the fuzzer space model, the key component of ELFuzz, contributes the most (up to 62.5%) to the effectiveness of ELFuzz. Further analysis of the fuzzers synthesized by ELFuzz confirms that they catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. The results present the promising potential of ELFuzz for more automated, efficient, and extensible input generation for fuzzing.</description>

      <title>ScamDetect: Towards a Robust, Agnostic Framework to Uncover Threats in Smart Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Smart contracts have transformed decentralized finance by enabling programmable, trustless transactions. However, their widespread adoption and growing financial significance have attracted persistent and sophisticated threats, such as phishing campaigns and contract-level exploits. Traditional transaction-based threat detection methods often expose sensitive user data and interactions, raising privacy and security concerns. In response, static bytecode analysis has emerged as a proactive mitigation strategy, identifying malicious contracts before they execute harmful actions. Building on this approach, we introduced PhishingHook, the first machine-learning-based framework for detecting phishing activities in smart contracts via static bytecode and opcode analysis, achieving approximately 90% detection accuracy. Nevertheless, two pressing challenges remain: (1) the increasing use of sophisticated bytecode obfuscation techniques designed to evade static analysis, and (2) the heterogeneity of blockchain environments requiring platform-agnostic solutions. This paper presents a vision for ScamDetect (Smart Contract Agnostic Malware Detector), a robust, modular, and platform-agnostic framework for smart contract malware detection. Over the next 2.5 years, ScamDetect will evolve in two stages: first, by tackling obfuscated Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode through graph neural network (GNN) analysis of control flow graphs (CFGs), leveraging GNNs' ability to capture complex structural patterns beyond opcode sequences; and second, by generalizing detection capabilities to emerging runtimes such as WASM. ScamDetect aims to enable proactive, scalable security for the future of decentralized ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Chimera: Harnessing Multi-Agent LLMs for Automatic Insider Threat Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Insider threats, which can lead to severe losses, remain a major security concern. While machine learning-based insider threat detection (ITD) methods have shown promising results, their progress is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality data. Enterprise data is sensitive and rarely accessible, while publicly available datasets, when limited in scale due to cost, lack sufficient real-world coverage; and when purely synthetic, they fail to capture rich semantics and realistic user behavior. To address this, we propose Chimera, the first large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework that automatically simulates both benign and malicious insider activities and collects diverse logs across diverse enterprise environments. Chimera models each employee with agents that have role-specific behavior and integrates modules for group meetings, pairwise interactions, and autonomous scheduling, capturing realistic organizational dynamics. It incorporates 15 types of insider attacks (e.g., IP theft, system sabotage) and has been deployed to simulate activities in three sensitive domains: technology company, finance corporation, and medical institution, producing a new dataset, ChimeraLog. We assess ChimeraLog via human studies and quantitative analysis, confirming its diversity, realism, and presence of explainable threat patterns. Evaluations of existing ITD methods show an average F1-score of 0.83, which is significantly lower than 0.99 on the CERT dataset, demonstrating ChimeraLog's higher difficulty and utility for advancing ITD research.</description>
