      <title>A Pathwise Coordinate Descent Algorithm for LASSO Penalized Quantile Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\ell_1$ penalized quantile regression is used in many fields as an alternative to penalized least squares regressions for high-dimensional data analysis. Existing algorithms for penalized quantile regression either use linear programming, which does not scale well in high dimension, or an approximate coordinate descent (CD) which does not solve for exact coordinatewise minimum of the nonsmooth loss function. Further, neither approaches build fast, pathwise algorithms commonly used in high-dimensional statistics to leverage sparsity structure of the problem in large-scale data sets. To avoid the computational challenges associated with the nonsmooth quantile loss, some recent works have even advocated using smooth approximations to the exact problem. In this work, we develop a fast, pathwise coordinate descent algorithm to compute exact $\ell_1$ penalized quantile regression estimates for high-dimensional data. We derive an easy-to-compute exact solution for the coordinatewise nonsmooth loss minimization, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been reported in the literature. We also employ a random perturbation strategy to help the algorithm avoid getting stuck along the regularization path. In simulated data sets, we show that our algorithm runs substantially faster than existing alternatives based on approximate CD and linear program, while retaining the same level of estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Tensor cross interpolation for global discrete optimization with application to Bayesian network inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global discrete optimization is notoriously difficult due to the lack of gradient information and the curse of dimensionality, making exhaustive search infeasible. Tensor cross approximation is an efficient technique to approximate multivariate tensors (and discretized functions) by tensor product decompositions based on a small number of tensor elements, evaluated on adaptively selected fibers of the tensor, that intersect on submatrices of (nearly) maximum volume. The submatrices of maximum volume are empirically known to contain large elements, hence the entries selected for cross interpolation can also be good candidates for the globally maximal element within the tensor. In this paper we consider evolution of epidemics on networks, and infer the contact network from observations of network nodal states over time. By numerical experiments we demonstrate that the contact network can be inferred accurately by finding the global maximum of the likelihood using tensor cross interpolation. The proposed tensor product approach is flexible and can be applied to global discrete optimization for other problems, e.g. discrete hyperparameter tuning.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference from time series of allele frequency data using exact simulation techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central statistical problem in population genetics is to infer evolutionary and biological parameters such as the strength of natural selection and allele age from DNA samples extracted from a contemporary population. That all samples come only from the present-day has long been known to limit statistical inference; there is potentially more information available if one also has access to ancient DNA so that inference is based on a time-series of historical changes in allele frequencies. We introduce a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for Bayesian inference from allele frequency time-series data based on an underlying Wright--Fisher diffusion model of evolution, through which one can infer the parameters of essentially any selection model including those with frequency-dependent effects. The chief novelty is that we show this method to be exact in the sense that it is possible to augment the state space explored by MCMC with the unobserved diffusion trajectory, even though the transition function of this diffusion is intractable. Through careful design of a proposal distribution, we describe an efficient method in which updates to the trajectory and accept/reject decisions are calculated without error. We illustrate the method on data capturing changes in coat colour over the past 20,000 years, and find evidence to support previous findings that the mutant alleles ASIP and MC1R responsible for changes in coat color have experienced very strong, possibly overdominant, selection and further provide estimates for the ages of these genes.</description>

      <title>A Primal Dual Active Set with Continuation Algorithm for $\ell_0$-Penalized High-dimensional Accelerated Failure Time Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accelerated failure time model has garnered attention due to its intuitive linear regression interpretation and has been successfully applied in fields such as biostatistics, clinical medicine, economics, and social sciences. This paper considers a weighted least squares estimation method with an $\ell_0$-penalty based on right-censored data in a high-dimensional setting. For practical implementation, we adopt an efficient primal dual active set algorithm and utilize a continuous strategy to select the appropriate regularization parameter. By employing the mutual incoherence property and restricted isometry property of the covariate matrix, we perform an error analysis for the estimated variables in the active set during the iteration process. Furthermore, we identify a distinctive monotonicity in the active set and show that the algorithm terminates at the oracle solution in a finite number of steps. Finally, we perform extensive numerical experiments using both simulated data and real breast cancer datasets to assess the performance benefits of our method in comparison to other existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Score Matching Riemannian Diffusion Means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating means on Riemannian manifolds is generally computationally expensive because the Riemannian distance function is not known in closed-form for most manifolds. To overcome this, we show that Riemannian diffusion means can be efficiently estimated using score matching with the gradient of Brownian motion transition densities using the same principle as in Riemannian diffusion models. Empirically, we show that this is more efficient than Monte Carlo simulation while retaining accuracy and is also applicable to learned manifolds. Our method, furthermore, extends to computing the Fr\'echet mean and the logarithmic map for general Riemannian manifolds. We illustrate the applicability of the estimation of diffusion mean by efficiently extending Euclidean algorithms to general Riemannian manifolds with a Riemannian $k$-means algorithm and maximum likelihood Riemannian regression.</description>

      <title>Natural Language-Based Synthetic Data Generation for Cluster Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14301v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cluster analysis relies on effective benchmarks for evaluating and comparing different algorithms. Simulation studies on synthetic data are popular because important features of the data sets, such as the overlap between clusters, or the variation in cluster shapes, can be effectively varied. Unfortunately, creating evaluation scenarios is often laborious, as practitioners must translate higher-level scenario descriptions like "clusters with very different shapes" into lower-level geometric parameters such as cluster centers, covariance matrices, etc. To make benchmarks more convenient and informative, we propose synthetic data generation based on direct specification of high-level scenarios, either through verbal descriptions or high-level geometric parameters. Our open-source Python package repliclust implements this workflow, making it easy to set up interpretable and reproducible benchmarks for cluster analysis. A demo of data generation from verbal inputs is available at https://demo.repliclust.org.</description>
