      <title>Neural network biased corrections: Cautionary study in background corrections for quenched jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jets clustered from heavy ion collision measurements combine a dense background of particles with those actually resulting from a hard partonic scattering. The background contribution to jet transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) may be corrected by subtracting the collision average background; however, the background inhomogeneity limits the resolution of this correction. Many recent studies have embedded jets into heavy ion backgrounds and demonstrated a markedly improved background correction is achievable by using neural networks (NNs) trained with aspects of jet substructure which are used to map measured jet $p_\mathrm{T}$ to the embedded truth jet $p_\mathrm{T}$. However, jet quenching in heavy ion collisions modifies jet substructure, and correspondingly biases the NNs' background corrections. This study investigates those biases by using simulations of jet quenching in central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=200\;\mathrm{GeV}/c$ with hydrodynamically modeled quark-gluon plasma (QGP) evolution. To demonstrate the magnitude of the effect of such biases in measurement, a leading jet nuclear modification factor ($R_\mathrm{AA}$) is calculated and reported using the NN background correction on jets quenched utilizing a brick of QGP.</description>

      <title>Case Studies of Using the Partial-Structure R1 and the Single-Atom R1 to Assemble Small-Molecule Crystal Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates how pre-knowledge of a crystal structure, including the constituent fragments, the atomic connectivity, and the approximate bond lengths, etc., can be utilized in the partial-structure R1 (pR1) and the single-atom R1 (sR1) calculations. It has been shown that taking advantage of pre-known information the calculations can proceed in an orderly and well-planned manner. Furthermore, in the case of the sR1 calculation, computer time can also be greatly reduced. Because the pR1 calculation is more time-consuming than the sR1 calculation, when there is a choice between the pR1 and the sR1, the former should be avoided. So, the usual strategy of assembling a light-atom-only structure should start with the normal sR1 method to determine a basic framework of the structure, and then uses the connectivity-guided sR1 method to complete the model. However, when the data resolution is low, the first step is necessary to use the pR1 method to assemble the known fragments. For a heavy-atom-containing structure, the correct strategy starts with the normal sR1 method to determine the heavy-atom substructure, and then uses the connectivity-guided sR1 to complete the model.</description>

      <title>Covariance Analysis of Impulsive Streaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive framework of modeling covariance in angular streaking experiments. Within the impulsive streaking regime, the displacement of electron momentum distribution (MD) provides a tight connection between the dressing-free MD and the dressed MD. Such connection establishes universal structures in the composition of streaking covariance that are common across different MDs, regardless of their exact shape. Building on this robust framework, we have developed methods for retrieving temporal information from angular streaking measurements. By providing a detailed understanding of the covariance structure in angular streaking experiments, our work enables more accurate and robust temporal measurements in a wide range of experimental scenarios.</description>
