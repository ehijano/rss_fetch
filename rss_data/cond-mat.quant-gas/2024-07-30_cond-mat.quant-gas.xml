      <title>Chiral polaron formation on the edge of topological quantum matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Immersing a mobile impurity in a quantum many-body environment can reveal fundamental properties of the background medium, hence providing a powerful probe of quantum matter. This approach is particularly intriguing when considering media with exotic properties, such as strongly-correlated phases and topological states of matter. In this work, we study the dressing of a mobile impurity interacting with a chiral mode, as provided by the edge of topological quantum matter. The resulting ''chiral polaron'' is characterized by an asymmetric spectral function, which reflects the chirality and group velocity of the topological edge mode and the drag experienced by the mobile impurity. We first build our theoretical understanding from an effective one-dimensional chiral model, which captures the hallmark signatures of the chiral polaron. We then demonstrate how this simple picture extends to realistic models of integer and fractional Chern insulator states, by adapting tensor-network methods to polaron spectroscopy. Injecting mobile impurities on the edge of topological quantum matter is shown to be a powerful tool to probe exotic edge properties, particularly suitable for cold-atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional solitons supported by the spin-orbit coupling and Rydberg-Rydberg interactions in PT-symmetric potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excited states (ESs) of two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) solitons of the semivortex (SV) and mixed-mode (MM) types, supported by the interplay of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and local nonlinearity in binary Bose-Einstein condensates, are unstable, on the contrary to the stability of the SV and MM solitons in their fundamental states. We propose a stabilization strategy for these states in 3D, combining SOC and long-range Rydberg-Rydberg interactions (RRI), in the presence of a spatially-periodic potential, that may include a parity-time (PT)-symmetric component. ESs of the SV solitons, which carry integer vorticities S and S+1 in their two components, exhibit robustness up to S= 4. ESs of MM solitons feature an interwoven necklace-like structure, with the components carrying opposite fractional values of the orbital angular momentum. Regions of the effective stability of the 3D solitons of the SV and MM types (both fundamental ones and ESs), are identified as functions of the imaginary component of the PT-symmetric potential and strengths of the SOC and RRI terms.</description>

      <title>Synthetic monopole with half-integer magnetic charge in Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to create monopoles with half-integer magnetic charges in a spinful cold atom system. With a minimal monopole in the center, we derive the ground-state single-vortex wave function on the sphere and develop the vortex's kinematic equation in the presence of an external electromagnetic field. The vortex's trajectory is generally depicted by the precession of the system. We further formulate the inter-vortex interaction and build up a theory of multi-vortex dynamics in high-charge monopole systems. We predict the vortices'trajectory in the bi-vortex system and figure out stable vortex (line) patterns in multi-vortex systems. Our study provides deep insights into properties of magnetic monopoles and vortices and paves the way for experimental verification.</description>

      <title>Spin-self-organization in an optical cavity facilitated by inhomogeneous broadening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the onset of collective spin-self-organization in a thermal ensemble of driven two-level atoms confined in an optical cavity. The atoms spontaneously form a spin-pattern above a critical driving strength that sets a threshold and is determined by the cavity parameters, the initial temperature, and the transition frequency of the atomic spin. Remarkably, we find that inhomogeneous Doppler broadening facilitates the onset of spin-self-organization. In particular, the threshold is non-monotonic when increasing the spin transition frequency and reaches a minimum when the Doppler broadening is of similar magnitude. This feature emerges due to Doppler-induced resonances. Above the threshold, we find cooperative dynamics of spin, spatial, and momentum degrees of freedom leading to density modulations, fast reduction of kinetic energy, and the emergence of non-thermal states. More broadly, our work demonstrates how broadening can facilitate strong light-matter interactions in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamical signatures of the Yang-Lee edge singularity in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Yang-Lee edge singularity is an intriguing critical phenomenon characterized by nonunitary field theory. However, its experimental realization for interacting many-body systems remains elusive. We show that Yang-Lee edge singularities, regarded as many-body exceptional points, can be observed using both the self-normal and the associated-biorthogonal Loschmidt echoes, leveraging the advantages of nonunitary dynamics in non-Hermitian systems. The Loschmidt echoes are demonstrated to display unitary dynamics in the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime but exhibit nonunitary dynamics in the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry-broken regime, leading to a sharp change near an exceptional point. We hereby identify exceptional points in both the non-Hermitian transverse field Ising model and the Yang-Lee model, and determine the critical exponent that is consistent with nonunitary conformal field theory. This work provides a direct observation of Yang-Lee edge singularities in non-Hermitian many-body systems arising from nonunitary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Commensurate supersolids and re-entrant transitions in an extended Bose-Hubbard ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ground state phases of an extended Bose-Hubbard ladder of unit filling via the density-matrix-renormalization-group method and, in particular, the effect of rung-hoppings. In contrast to a single-chain, a commensurate supersolid emerges, and based on the Luttinger parameter, we classify them into two types. The latter leads to a reentrant gapless behavior as the onsite interaction is increased while keeping all other parameters intact. A reentrant gapped transition is also found as a function of nearest-neighbor interactions. Further, we show that the string order characterizing the Haldane phase vanishes for a finite inter-chain hopping amplitude, however small it is. Finally, we propose two experimental platforms to observe our findings, using either dipolar atoms or polar molecules and Rydberg admixed atoms.</description>

      <title>Self-Consistent Stochastic Finite-Temperature Modelling: Ultracold Bose Gases with Local (s-wave) and Long-Range (Dipolar) Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a generalized self-consistent quantum kinetic theory including thermal fluctuations and stochastic contributions for modelling ultracold Bose gases interacting via a generic long-range interaction. Our generalised equations take the usual form of an effective field theory, separating coherent, low-lying, modes of the system from incoherent, higher-lying, thermal modes. The low-lying modes are described by a stochastic Langevin equation with two explicitly time-dependent collisional terms (corresponding to a dissipative and an energy-correcting contribution) and their corresponding additive and multiplicative stochastic noise terms. By coupling such an equation to an explicitly non-equilibrium gas of incoherent (thermal) particles described by a quantum Boltzmann equation, we thus extend beyond both earlier stochastic approaches (including the full SPGPE) and generalised kinetic models inspired by a two-gas picture (the so-called ZNG formalism) commonly used in the context of short-range interactions, such as those relevant in ultracold alkali atoms. Long-range interactions are further included into our model by the self-consistent addition of a Poisson-like equation for the long-range interaction potential. Our approach leads directly to a self-consistent model for finite-temperature Bose-Einstein condensation in a long-range interacting system within the regime where thermal fluctuations dominate over quantum fluctuations. While such an approach could be of general use for a variety of experimentally-accessible long-range interacting systems, we focus specifically here on the well-studied case of dipolar atomic condensates. In this particular context, we additionally supplement our Keldysh non-equilibrium analysis for fluctuations of the fast (incoherent) modes by a somewhat ad hoc extension of the slow (coherent) modes via the usual route of Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations.</description>

      <title>Protecting Quantum Information via Many-Body Dynamical Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamically localized states in quantum many-body systems are fundamentally important in understanding quantum thermalization and have applications in quantum information processing. Here we explore many-body dynamical localization (MBDL) without disorders in a non-integrable quantum XY spin chain under periodical and quadratic kicks. We obtain the localization phase diagram with the MBDL and delocalization states and show dynamical observables to extract the phase diagram. For proper kick strengths in the MBDL regime, we reveal a local dynamical decoupling effect for persistent Rabi oscillation of certain spins. Furthermore, we propose the MBDL-protected quantum information at high temperatures, and present an analysis of the dynamical decoupling to obtain the required system parameters for quantum storage. Compared to other non-thermalized states, the disorder-free MBDL states require much fewer repetitions and resources, providing a promising way to protect and store quantum information robust against thermal noises.</description>

      <title>Anomalous symmetry protected blockade of skin effect in one-dimensional non-Hermitian lattice systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), an anomalous localization behavior of the bulk states, is an inherently non-Hermitian phenomenon, which can not find a counterpart in Hermitian systems. However, the fragility of NHSE has been revealed recently, such as the boundary sensitivity, and it stimulates a lot of studies on discussing the fate of that. Here we present a theorem which shows that the combined spatial reflection symmetry can be considered as a criterion in one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems to determine whether the NHSE can exist or not. Distinct from previous studies, our proposed criterion only relies on analyzing the symmetry of the system, freeing out other requirements, such as the information of the energy spectrum. Furthermore, by taking the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain as an example, we verify our theorem through both a mathematical proof via the non-Bloch band theory and the exact diagonalization numerical studies. Our results reveal a profound connection between the symmetry and the fate of NHSE.</description>

      <title>Kibble-Zurek behavior in a topological phase transition with a quadratic band crossing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism describes the scaling behavior when driving a system across a continuous symmetry-breaking transition. Previous studies have shown that the KZ-like scaling behavior also lies in the topological transitions in the Qi-Wu-Zhang model (2D) and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model (1D), although symmetry breaking does not exist here. Both models with linear band crossings give that $\nu=1$ and $z=1$. We wonder whether different critical exponents can be acquired in topological transitions beyond linear band crossing. In this work, we look into the KZ behavior in a topological 2D checkerboard lattice with a quadratic band crossing. We investigate from dual perspectives: momentum distribution of the Berry curvature in clean systems for simplicity, and real-space analysis of domain-like local Chern marker configurations in disordered systems, which is a more intuitive analog to conventional KZ description. In equilibrium, we find the correlation length diverges with a power $\nu\simeq 1/2$. Then, by slowly quenching the system across the topological phase transition, we find that the freeze-out time $t_\mathrm{f}$ and the unfrozen length scale $\xi(t_\mathrm{f})$ both satisfy the KZ scaling, verifying $z\simeq 2$. We subsequently explore KZ behavior in topological phase transitions with other higher-order band crossing and find the relationship between the critical exponents and the order. Our results extend the understanding of the KZ mechanism and non-equilibrium topological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Universal corrections to the superfluid gap in a cold Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A framework for computing the superfluid gap in an effective field theory (EFT) of fermions interacting via momentum-independent contact forces is developed. The leading universal corrections in the EFT are one-loop in-medium effects at the Fermi surface, and reproduce the well-known Gor'kov-Melik-Barkhudarov result. The complete subleading universal corrections are presented here, and include one-loop effects away from the Fermi surface, two-loop in-medium effects, as well as modifications to the fermion propagator. Together, these effects are found to reduce the gap at low densities. Applications to neutron superfluidity in neutron stars are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: The Bose polaron is a quasiparticle that arises from the interaction between impurities and Bogoliubov excitation in Bose-Einstein condensates, analogous to the polaron formed by electrons and phonons in solid-state physics. In this paper, we investigate the effect of phase separation on weakly coupled and strongly coupled Bose polarons. Our findings reveal that phase separation induces a remarkable alteration in the properties of weakly coupled Bose polarons. However, in the case of strong coupling, phase separation cannot destroy the highly self-trapping state of Bose polarons.</description>

      <title>Topological Properties of Single-Particle States Decaying into a Continuum due to Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how topological Chern numbers can be defined when single-particle states hybridize with continua. We do so exemplarily in a bosonic Haldane model at zero temperature with an additional on-site decay of one boson into two and the conjugate fusion of two bosons into one. Restricting the Hilbert space to two bosons at maximum, the exact self-energy is accessible. We use the bilinear Hamiltonian $H_0$ corrected by the self-energy $\Sigma$ to compute Chern numbers by two different approaches. The results are gauged against a full many-body calculation in the Hilbert space where possible. We establish numerically and analytically that the effective Hamiltonian $H_\text{eff}=H_0(\vec k) +\Sigma(\omega,\vec k)$ reproduces the correct many-body topology if the considered band does not overlap with the continuum. In case of overlaps, one can extend the definition of the Chern number to the non-Hermitian $H_\text{eff}$ and there is evidence that the Chern number changes at exceptional points. But the bulk-boundary correspondence appears to be no longer valid and edge modes delocalize.</description>

      <title>Accuracy of the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation in a Double-Well Potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) in a double well potential produces solutions that break the symmetry of the underlying non-interacting Hamiltonian, i.e., asymmetric solutions. The GPE is derived from the more general second-quantized Fock Schroedinger equation (FSE). We investigate whether such solutions appear in the more general case or are artifacts of the GPE. We use two-mode analyses for a variational treatment of the GPE and to treat the Fock equation. An exact diagonalization of the FSE in dual-condensates yields degenerate ground states that are very accurately fitted by phase-state representations of the degenerate asymmetric states found in the GPE. The superposition of degenerate asymmetrical states forms a cat state. An alternative form of cat state results from a change of the two-mode basis set.</description>

      <title>Two liquid states of distinguishable helium-4: the existence of another non-superfluid frozen by heating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07716v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there can exist two liquid states in distinguishable helium-4 ($^4$He) obeying Boltzmann statistics by path integral centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) simulations. This is an indication of quantum liquid polyamorphism induced by nuclear quantum effect. For 0.08-3.3 K and 1-500 bar, we extensively conducted the isothermal-isobaric CMD simulations to explore not only possible states and state diagram but the state characteristics. The distinguishable $^4$He below 25 bar does not freeze down to 0.1 K even though it includes no Bosonic exchange effect and therefore no Bose condensation. One liquid state, low quantum-dispersion liquid (LQDL), is nearly identical to normal liquid He-I of real $^4$He. The other is high quantum-dispersion liquid (HQDL) consisting of atoms with longer quantum wavelength. This is another non-superfluid existing below 0.5 K or the temperatures of LQDL. The HQDL is also a low-entropy and fragile liquid to exhibit, unlike conventional liquids, rather gas-like relaxation of velocity autocorrelation function, while there the atoms diffuse without noticeable contribution from quantum tunneling. The LQDL-HQDL transition is not a thermodynamic phase transition but a continuous crossover accompanied by the change of the expansion factor of quantum wavelength. Freezing of HQDL into the low quantum-dispersion amorphous solid occurs by heating from 0.2 to 0.3 K at 40-50 bar, while this $P$-$T$ condition coincides with the Kim-Chan normal-supersolid phase boundary of real $^4$He. The obtained state diagram was compared with that of the confined subnano-scale $^4$He systems where Bosonic correlation is considerably suppressed.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the problem of constructing self-adjoint and lower bounded Hamiltonians for a system of $n&gt;2$ non-relativistic quantum particles in dimension three with contact (or zero-range or $\delta$) interactions. Such interactions are described by (singular) boundary conditions satisfied at the coincidence hyperplanes, i.e., when the coordinates of two particles coincide. Following the line of recent works appeared in the literature, we introduce a boundary condition slightly modified with respect to usual boundary condition one has in the one-body problem. With such new boundary condition we can show that the instability property due to the fall to the center phenomenon described by Minlos and Faddeev in 1962 is avoided. Then one obtains a physically reasonable Hamiltonian for the system. We apply the method to the case of a gas of $N$ interacting bosons and to the case of $N$ distinguishable particles of equal mass $M$ interacting with a different particle. In the latter case we also discuss the limit of the model for $M \longrightarrow +\infty$. We show that in the limit one obtains the one-body Hamiltonian for the light particle subject to $N$ (non-local) point interactions placed at fixed positions. We will verify that such non-local point interactions do not exhibit the ultraviolet pathologies that are present in the case of standard local point interactions.</description>
