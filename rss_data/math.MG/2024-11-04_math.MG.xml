      <title>Vertical curves and vertical fibers in the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb H$ denote the three-dimensional Heisenberg group. In this paper, we study vertical curves in $\mathbb H$ and fibers of maps $\mathbb H \to \mathbb R^2$ from a metric perspective. We say that a set in $\mathbb H$ is a vertical curve if it satisfies a cone condition with respect to a homogeneous cone with axis $\langle Z \rangle$, the center of $\mathbb H$. This is analogous to the cone condition used to define intrinsic Lipschitz graphs.
  In the first part of the paper, we prove that connected vertical curves are locally biH\"older equivalent to intervals. We also show that the class of vertical curves coincides with the class of intersections of intrinsic Lipschitz graphs satisfying a transversality condition. Unlike intrinsic Lipschitz graphs, the Hausdorff dimension of a vertical curve can vary; we construct vertical curves with Hausdorff dimension either strictly larger or strictly smaller than 2. Consequently, there are intersections of intrinsic Lipschitz graphs with Hausdorff dimension either strictly larger or strictly smaller than 2.
  In the second part of the paper, we consider smooth functions $\beta$ from the unit ball $B$ in $\mathbb H$ to $\mathbb R^2$. We show that, in contrast to the situation in Euclidean space, there are maps such that $\beta$ is arbitrarily close to the projection $\pi$ from $\mathbb H$ to the horizontal plane, but the average $\mathcal{H}^2$ measure of a fiber of $\beta$ in $B$ is arbitrarily small.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Discrete Potentials of Spherical (k,k)-Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive universal lower and upper bounds for max-min and min-max problems (also known as polarization) for the potential of spherical $(k,k)$-designs and provide certain examples, including unit-norm tight frames, that attain these bounds. The universality is understood in the sense that the bounds hold for all spherical $(k,k)$-designs and for a large class of potential functions, and the bounds involve certain nodes and weights that are independent of the potential. When the potential function is $h(t)=t^{2k}$, we prove an optimality property of the spherical $(k,k)$-designs in the class of all spherical codes of the same cardinality both for max-min and min-max potential problems.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial approach to nonlinear spectral gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A seminal open question of Pisier and Mendel--Naor asks whether every degree-regular graph which satisfies the classical discrete Poincar\'e inequality for scalar functions, also satisfies an analogous inequality for functions taking values in \textit{any} normed space with non-trivial cotype. Motivated by applications, it is also greatly important to quantify the dependence of the corresponding optimal Poincar\'e constant on the cotype $q$. Works of Odell--Schlumprecht (1994), Ozawa (2004), and Naor (2014) make substantial progress on the former question by providing a positive answer for normed spaces which also have an unconditional basis, in addition to finite cotype. However, little is known in the way of quantitative estimates: the mentioned results imply a bound on the Poincar\'e constant depending super-exponentially on $q$.
  We introduce a novel combinatorial framework for proving quantitative nonlinear spectral gap estimates. The centerpiece is a property of regular graphs that we call \emph{long range expansion}, which holds with high probability for random regular graphs. Our main result is that any regular graph with the long-range expansion property satisfies a discrete Poincar\'{e} inequality for any normed space with an unconditional basis and cotype $q$, with a Poincar\'{e} constant that depends \emph{polynomially} on $q$, which is optimal. As an application, any normed space with an unconditional basis which admits a low distortion embedding of an $n$-vertex random regular graph, must have cotype at least polylogarithmic in $n$. This extends a celebrated lower-bound of Matou\v{s}ek for low distortion embeddings of random graphs into $\ell_q$ spaces.</description>

      <title>Polyhedral structure of maximal Gromov hyperbolic spaces with finite boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The boundary $\partial X$ of a boundary continuous Gromov hyperbolic space $X$ carries a natural Moebius structure on the boundary. For a proper, geodesically complete, boundary continuous Gromov hyperbolic space $X$, the boundary $\partial X$ equipped with its cross-ratio is a particular kind of quasi-metric space, called a quasi-metric antipodal space. Given a quasi-metric antipodal space $Z$, one may consider the family of all hyperbolic fillings of $Z$. In \cite{biswas2024quasi} it was shown that this family has a unique upper bound $\mathcal{M}(Z)$ (with respect to a natural partial order on hyperbolic fillings of $Z$), which can be described explicitly in terms of the cross-ratio on $Z$. As shown in \cite{biswas2024quasi}, the spaces $\mathcal{M}(Z)$ constitute a natural class of spaces called maximal Gromov hyperbolic spaces.
  A natural problem is to describe explicitly the maximal Gromov hyperbolic spaces $X$ whose boundary $\partial X$ is finite. We show that for a maximal Gromov hyperbolic space $X$ with boundary $\partial X$ of cardinality $n$, the space $X$ is isometric to a finite polyhedral complex embedded in $(\mathbb{R}^n, ||\cdot||_{\infty})$ with cells of dimension at most $n/2$, given by attaching $n$ half-lines to vertices of a compact polyhedral complex. In particular the geometry at infinity of $X$ is trivial. The combinatorics of the polyhedral complex is determined by certain relations $R \subset \partial X \times \partial X$ on the boundary $\partial X$, called antipodal relations.
  In \cite{biswas2024quasi} it was shown that maximal Gromov hyperbolic spaces are injective metric spaces. We give a shorter, simpler proof of this fact in the case of spaces with finite boundary. We also consider the space of deformations of a maximal Gromov hyperbolic space with finite boundary, and define an associated Teichmuller space.</description>

      <title>Finsler currents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18095v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a slight variant of Ambrosio and Kirchheim's definition of a metric current. We show that with this new definition it is possible to obtain certain volume functionals from Finsler geometry as mass measures of currents. As an application, we obtain a whole family of extendibly convex $n$-volume densities. This family includes the mass* and the circumscribed Riemannian volume densities.</description>

      <title>K\"{a}hler manifolds with an almost $1/4$-pinched metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct an almost negatively $1/4$-pinched Riemannian metric on a class of compact manifolds recently discovered by Stover and Toledo in [17]. It is known that these manifolds are K\"{a}hler and not locally symmetric. These are the first known examples of not locally symmetric K\"{a}hler manifolds admitting such a metric and, via the result of Hernandez [9] and Yau and Zheng [18], these manifolds cannot admit a negatively quarter-pinched Riemannian metric. This metric is also interesting because it is a generalization to the complex hyperbolic setting of the famous pinched metric constructed by Gromov and Thurston in [8].</description>

      <title>Mixed volumes of zonoids and the absolute value of the Grassmannian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zonoids are Hausdorff limits of zonotopes, while zonotopes are convex polytopes defined as the Minkowski sums of finitely many segments. We present a combinatorial framework that links the study of mixed volumes of zonoids (a topic that has applications in algebraic combinatorics) with the study of the absolute value of the Grassmannian, defined as the image of the Grassmannian under the coordinate-wise absolute value map. We use polyhedral computations to derive new families of inequalities for n zonoids in dimension d, when (n,d)=(6,2) and (6,3). Unlike the classical geometric inequalities, originating from the Brunn-Minkowski and Aleksandrov-Fenchel inequalities, the inequalities we produce have the special feature of being Minkowski linear in each of the n zonoids they involve.</description>
