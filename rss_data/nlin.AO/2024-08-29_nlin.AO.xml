      <title>Reduced-order adaptive synchronization in a chaotic neural network with parameter mismatch: A dynamical system vs. machine learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the reduced-order synchronization problem between two chaotic memristive Hindmarsh-Rose (HR) neurons of different orders using two distinct methods. The first method employs the Lyapunov active control technique. Through this technique, we develop appropriate control functions to synchronize a 4D chaotic HR neuron (response system) with the canonical projection of a 5D chaotic HR neuron (drive system). Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. The second method is data-driven and leverages a machine learning-based control technique. Our technique utilizes an ad hoc combination of reservoir computing (RC) algorithms, incorporating reservoir observer (RO), online control (OC), and online predictive control (OPC) algorithms. We anticipate our effective heuristic RC adaptive control algorithm to guide the development of more formally structured and systematic, data-driven RC control approaches to chaotic synchronization problems, and to inspire more data-driven neuromorphic methods for controlling and achieving synchronization in chaotic neural networks in vivo.</description>

      <title>The nonlinear economy (I): How resource constrains lead to business cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the nonlinear dynamics of a macroeconomic model with resource constraints. The dynamics is derived from a production function that considers capital and a generalized form of energy as inputs. Energy, the new variable, is depleted during the production process and has to be renewed, whereas capital grows with production and decreases from depreciation. Dependent on time scales and energy related control parameters, we obtain steady states of high or low production, but also sustained oscillations that show properties of business cycles. We also find conditions for the coexistence of stable fixed points and limit cycles. Our model allows to specify investment and saving functions for Kaldor's model of business cycles. We provide evidence for an endogenous origin of business cycles if depleting resources are taken into account.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann approach to collective motion via non-local visual interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual cues play crucial roles in the collective motion of animals, birds, fish, and insects. The interaction mediated by visual information is essentially non-local and has many-body nature due to occlusion, which poses a challenging problem in modeling the emergent collective behavior. In this Letter, we introduce a Boltzmann-equation approach incorporating non-local visual interaction. Occlusion is treated in a self-consistent manner via a coarse-grained density field, which renders the interaction effectively pairwise. Our model also incorporates the recent finding that each organism stochastically selects a neighbor to interact at each instant. We analytically derive the order-disorder transition point, and show that the visual screening effect substantially raises the transition threshold, which does not vanish when the density of the agents or the range of the intrinsic interaction is taken to infinity. Our analysis suggests that the model exhibits a discontinuous transition as in the local interaction models, and but the discontinuity is weakened by the non-locality. Our study clarifies the essential role of non-locality in the visual interactions among moving organisms.</description>
