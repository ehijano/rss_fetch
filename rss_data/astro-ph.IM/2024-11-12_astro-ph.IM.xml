      <title>qCMOS detectors and the case of hypothetical primordial black holes in the solar system, near earth objects, transients, and other high cadence observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress with CMOS detector development has opened new parameter space for high cadence time resolved imaging of transients and fast proper motion solar system objects. Using computer simulations for a ground-based 1.23 m telescope, this research note illustrates the gain of a new generation of fast readout low noise qCMOS sensors over CCDs and makes the case for high precision monitoring of asteroid orbits that can potentially shed light on the hypothetical existence of low mass primordial black holes, as well as for other applications requiring high speed imaging.</description>

      <title>A method based on Generative Adversarial Networks for disentangling physical and chemical properties of stars in astronomical spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data compression techniques focused on information preservation have become essential in the modern era of big data. In this work, an encoder-decoder architecture has been designed, where adversarial training, a modification of the traditional autoencoder, is used in the context of astrophysical spectral analysis. The goal of this proposal is to obtain an intermediate representation of the astronomical stellar spectra, in which the contribution to the flux of a star due to the most influential physical properties (its surface temperature and gravity) disappears and the variance reflects only the effect of the chemical composition over the spectrum. A scheme of deep learning is used with the aim of unraveling in the latent space the desired parameters of the rest of the information contained in the data. This work proposes a version of adversarial training that makes use of a discriminator per parameter to be disentangled, thus avoiding the exponential combination that occurs in the use of a single discriminator, as a result of the discretization of the values to be untangled. To test the effectiveness of the method, synthetic astronomical data are used from the APOGEE and Gaia surveys. In conjunction with the work presented, we also provide a disentangling framework (GANDALF) available to the community, which allows the replication, visualization, and extension of the method to domains of any nature.</description>

      <title>First Use of GPS Satellites for Beam Calibration of Radio Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from the first application of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS; GPS is one example of a collection of satellites in GNSS) for radio beam calibration using a commercial GNSS receiver with the Deep Dish Development Array (D3A) at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO). Several GNSS satellites pass through the main and side lobes of the beam each day, enabling efficient mapping of the 2D beam structure. Due to the high SNR and abundance of GNSS satellites, we find evidence that GNSS can probe several side lobes of the beam through repeatable measurements of the beam over several days. Over three days of measurements, we find a measured difference reaching a minimum of 0.56 db-Hz in the main lobe of the primary beam. These results show promise for the use of GNSS in beam mapping for the Canadian Hydrogen Observatory and Radio-transient Detector (CHORD) and other future "large-N" radio interferometers. They also motivate future development of the technique within radio astronomy.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Neural Ratio and Posterior Estimators to Distributional Shifts for Population-Level Dark Matter Analysis in Strong Gravitational Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the robustness of Neural Ratio Estimators (NREs) and Neural Posterior Estimators (NPEs) to distributional shifts in the context of measuring the abundance of dark matter subhalos using strong gravitational lensing data. While these data-driven inference frameworks can be accurate on test data from the same distribution as the training sets, in real applications, it is expected that simulated training data and true observational data will differ in their distributions. We explore the behavior of a trained NRE and trained sequential NPEs to estimate the population-level parameters of dark matter subhalos from a large sample of images of strongly lensed galaxies with test data presenting distributional shifts within and beyond the bounds of the training distribution in the nuisance parameters (e.g., the background source morphology). While our results show that NREs and NPEs perform well when tested perfectly in distribution, they exhibit significant biases when confronted with slight deviations from the examples seen in the training distribution. This indicates the necessity for caution when applying NREs and NPEs to real astrophysical data, where high-dimensional underlying distributions are not perfectly known.</description>

      <title>The COBREX archival survey: improved constraints on the occurrence rate of wide-orbit substellar companions. I. A uniform re-analysis of 400 stars from the GPIES survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct imaging (DI) campaigns are uniquely suited to probing the outer regions around young stars and looking for giant exoplanet and brown dwarf companions, hence providing key complementary information to radial velocity (RV) and transit searches for the purpose of demographic studies. However, the critical 5-20 au region, where most giant planets are thought to form, remains poorly explored, lying in-between RV and DI capabilities. Significant gains in detection performances can be attained at no instrumental cost by means of advanced post-processing techniques. In the context of the COBREX project, we have assembled the largest collection of archival DI observations to date in order to undertake a large and uniform re-analysis. In particular, this paper details the re-analysis of 400 stars from the GPIES survey operated at GPI@Gemini South. Following the pre-reduction of raw frames, GPI data cubes were processed by means of the PACO algorithm. Candidates were identified and vetted based on multi-epoch proper motion analysis -- whenever possible -- and by means of a suitable color-magnitude diagram. The conversion of detection limits into detectability maps allowed for an estimate of unbiased occurrence frequencies of giant planets and brown dwarfs. Deeper detection limits were derived compared to the literature, with up to a twofold gain in minimum detectable mass compared to previous GPI-based publications. Although no new substellar companion was confirmed, we identified two interesting planet candidates awaiting follow-up observations. We derive an occurrence rate of $1.7_{-0.7}^{+0.9}\%$ for $5$~\mjup$ &lt; m &lt; 13$~\mjup planets in $10~\text{au}&lt; a &lt; 100~\text{au}$, that raises to $2.2_{-0.8}^{+1.0}\%$ when including substellar objects up to 80 \mjup.(abridged)</description>

      <title>Detecting Secular Perturbations in Kepler Planetary Systems Using Simultaneous Impact Parameter Variation Analysis (SIPVA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recovering impact parameter variations in multi-planet systems is an effective approach for detecting non-transiting planets and refining planetary mass estimates. Traditionally, two methodologies have been employed: the Individual Fit, which fits each transit independently to analyze impact parameter changes, and the Dynamical Fit, which simulates planetary dynamics to match transit light curves. We introduce a new fitting method, Simultaneous Impact Parameter Variation Analysis (SIPVA), which outperforms the Individual Fit and is computationally more efficient than the Dynamical Fit. SIPVA directly integrates a linear time-dependent model for impact parameters into the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) algorithm by fitting all transits simultaneously. We evaluate SIPVA and the Individual Fit on artificial systems with varying LLRs and find that SIPVA consistently outperforms the Individual Fit in recovery rates and accuracy. When applied to selected Kepler planetary candidates exhibiting significant transit duration variations (TDVs), SIPVA identifies significant impact parameter trends in 10 out of 16 planets. In contrast, the Individual Fit does so in only 4. We also employ probabilistic modeling to calculate the theoretical distribution of planets with significant impact parameter variations across all observed Kepler systems and compare the distribution of recovered candidates by the Individual Fit and Dynamical Fit from previous work with our theoretical distribution. Our findings offer an alternative framework for analyzing planetary transits, relying solely on Bayesian inference without requiring prior assumptions about the planetary system's dynamical architecture.</description>

      <title>Towards Model-free Temperature Diagnostics of Warm Dense Matter from Multiple Scattering Angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Warm dense matter (WDM) plays an important role in astrophysical objects and technological applications, but the rigorous diagnostics of corresponding experiments is notoriously difficult. In this work, we present a model-free analysis of x-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) measurements at multiple scattering angles. Specifically, we analyze scattering data that have been collected for isochorically heated graphite at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). Overall, we find good consistency in the extracted temperature between small and large scattering angles, whereas possible signatures of non-equilibrium may be hidden by the source function, and by the available dynamic spectral range. The present proof-of-principle study directly points to improved experimental set-ups for equation-of-state measurements and for the model-free study of relaxation times.</description>

      <title>Collective modes in relativistic cold asymmetric nuclear matter within the covariant Vlasov approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A covariant relativistic approach based on the Vlasov equation is applied to the study of infinite asymmetric nuclear matter. We use several Walecka-type hadronic models and obtain the dispersion relations for the longitudinal modes. The isovector and isoscalar collective modes are determined for a wide range of densities as a function of isospin asymmetry and momentum transfer within a set of eleven relativistic mean field models with different nuclear matter properties. Special attention is given to beta-equilibrium matter. It is shown that the possible propagation of isoscalar and isovector-like modes depends directly on the density dependence of the symmetric nuclear matter equation of state and of the symmetry energy, with a stiff equation of state favouring the propagation of isoscalar like collective modes at high densities, and a stiff symmetry energy defining the behavior of the isovector like modes which propagate for densities below two times saturation density. The coupling of the nuclear modes to the electron plasmon is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Event-horizon-scale Imaging of M87* under Different Assumptions via Deep Generative Image Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing images from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of M87*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87, depends on a prior to impose desired image statistics. However, given the impossibility of directly observing black holes, there is no clear choice for a prior. We present a framework for flexibly designing a range of priors, each bringing different biases to the image reconstruction. These priors can be weak (e.g., impose only basic natural-image statistics) or strong (e.g., impose assumptions of black-hole structure). Our framework uses Bayesian inference with score-based priors, which are data-driven priors arising from a deep generative model that can learn complicated image distributions. Using our Bayesian imaging approach with sophisticated data-driven priors, we can assess how visual features and uncertainty of reconstructed images change depending on the prior. In addition to simulated data, we image the real EHT M87* data and discuss how recovered features are influenced by the choice of prior.</description>

      <title>Neural network method to search for long transient gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02391v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new method to search for long transient gravitational waves signals, like those expected from fast spinning newborn magnetars, in interferometric detector data. Standard search techniques are computationally unfeasible (matched filtering) or very demanding (sub-optimal semi-coherent methods). We explored a different approach by means of machine learning paradigms, to define a fast and inexpensive procedure. We used convolutional neural networks to develop a classifier that is able to discriminate between the presence or the absence of a signal. To complement the classification and enhance its effectiveness, we also developed a denoiser. We studied the performance of both networks with simulated colored noise, according to the design noise curve of LIGO interferometers. We show that the combination of the two models is crucial to increase the chance of detection. Indeed, as we decreased the signal initial amplitude (from $10^{-22}$ down to $10^{-23}$) the classification task became more difficult. In particular, we could not correctly tag signals with an initial amplitude of $2 \times 10^{-23}$ without using the denoiser. By studying the performance of the combined networks, we found a good compromise between the search false alarm rate (2$\%$) and efficiency (90$\%$) for a single interferometer. In addition, we demonstrated that our method is robust with respect to changes in the power law describing the time evolution of the signal frequency. Our results highlight the computationally low cost of this method to generate triggers for long transient signals. The study carried out in this work lays the foundations for further improvements, with the purpose of developing a pipeline able to perform systematic searches of long transient signals.</description>

      <title>AstroMLab 1: Who Wins Astronomy Jeopardy!?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of proprietary and open-weights large language models using the first astronomy-specific benchmarking dataset. This dataset comprises 4,425 multiple-choice questions curated from the Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics, covering a broad range of astrophysical topics. Our analysis examines model performance across various astronomical subfields and assesses response calibration, crucial for potential deployment in research environments. Claude-3.5-Sonnet outperforms competitors by up to 4.6 percentage points, achieving 85.0% accuracy. For proprietary models, we observed a universal reduction in cost every 3-to-12 months to achieve similar score in this particular astronomy benchmark. open-weights models have rapidly improved, with LLaMA-3-70b (80.6%) and Qwen-2-72b (77.7%) now competing with some of the best proprietary models. We identify performance variations across topics, with non-English-focused models generally struggling more in exoplanet-related fields, stellar astrophysics, and instrumentation related questions. These challenges likely stem from less abundant training data, limited historical context, and rapid recent developments in these areas. This pattern is observed across both open-weights and proprietary models, with regional dependencies evident, highlighting the impact of training data diversity on model performance in specialized scientific domains. Top-performing models demonstrate well-calibrated confidence, with correlations above 0.9 between confidence and correctness, though they tend to be slightly underconfident. The development for fast, low-cost inference of open-weights models presents new opportunities for affordable deployment in astronomy. The rapid progress observed suggests that LLM-driven research in astronomy may become feasible in the near future.</description>

      <title>Suppressing data anomalies of gravitational reference sensors with time delay interferometry combinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.10664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the LISA and Taiji missions, both transient and continuous data anomalies would pose significant challenges to the detection, estimation, and subsequent scientific interpretation of gravitational wave signals. As is indicated by the experiences of LISA PathFinder and Taiji-1, these anomalies may originate from the disturbances of the gravitational reference sensors due to routine maintenances and unexpected environmental or instrumental issues. To effectively mitigate such anomalies and thereby enhance the robustness and reliability of the scientific outputs, we suggest to employ the ``position noise suppressing'' time delay interferometry channels. Through analytical derivations and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that these time delay interferometry channels can suppress data anomalies by more than 2 orders of magnitude within the sensitive band of 0.1 mHz - 0.05 Hz, while still remaining sensitive to most of the target signals. Compared with existing researches that focus on reconstructing and subtracting data anomalies, our method does not rely on the prior knowledge about the models of anomalies. Furthermore, the potential application scenarios of these channels have also been explored.</description>

      <title>Recovering pulsar periodicity from time of arrival data by finding the shortest vector in a lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The strict periodicity of pulsars is the primary source of information we have to learn about their nature and environment, it allows us to challenge general relativity and measure gravitational waves. Identifying such a periodicity from a discrete set of arrival times is a difficult algorithmic problem, particularly when the pulsar is in a binary system. This challenge is especially acute in $\gamma$-ray pulsar astronomy as there are hundreds of unassociated Fermi-LAT sources awaiting a timing solution that will reveal their nature, and may allow adding them to pulsar timing arrays. The same issue arises when attempting to recover a strict periodicity for repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs). Such a detection would be a major breakthrough, providing us with the FRB source's age, magnetic field, and binary orbit.
  The problem of recovering a timing solution from sparse time-of-arrival (TOA) data is currently unsolvable for pulsars in binary systems and incredibly hard even for single pulsars. In a series of papers, we will develop an algorithmic set of tools that will allow us to solve the timing recovery problem under different regimes. In this paper, we frame the timing recovery problem as the problem of finding a short vector in a lattice and obtain the solution using off-the-shelf lattice reduction and sieving techniques. As a proof of concept, we solve PSR J0318+0253, a millisecond $\gamma$-ray pulsar discovered by FAST in a $\gamma$-ray directed search, in a few CPU-minutes.

      <title>Modeling Foreground Spatial Variations in 21 cm Gaussian Process Component Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) have been extensively utilized as nonparametric models for component separation in 21 cm data analyses. This exploits the distinct spectral behavior of the cosmological and foreground signals, which are modeled through the GP covariance kernel. Previous approaches have employed a global GP kernel along all lines of sight (LoS). In this work, we study Bayesian approaches that allow for spatial variations in foreground kernel parameters, testing them against simulated HI intensity mapping observations. We consider a no-pooling (NP) model, which treats each LoS independently by fitting for separate covariance kernels, and a hierarchical Gaussian Process (HGP) model that allows for variation in kernel parameters between different LoS, regularized through a global hyperprior. We find that accounting for spatial variations in the GP kernel parameters results in a significant improvement in cosmological signal recovery, achieving up to a 30% reduction in the standard deviation of the residual distribution and improved model predictive performance. Allowing for spatial variations in GP kernel parameters also improves the recovery of the HI power spectra and wavelet scattering transform coefficients. Whilst the NP model achieves superior recovery as measured by the residual distribution, it demands extensive computational resources, faces formidable convergence challenges, and is prone to overfitting. Conversely, the HGP model strikes a balance between the accuracy and robustness of the signal recovery. Further improvements to the HGP model will require more physically motivated modeling of foreground spatial variations.</description>

      <title>gSeaGen code by KM3NeT: an efficient tool to propagate muons simulated with CORSIKA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The KM3NeT Collaboration has tackled a common challenge faced by the astroparticle physics community, namely adapting the experiment-specific simulation software to work with the CORSIKA air shower simulation output. The proposed solution is an extension of the open-source code gSeaGen, allowing for the transport of muons generated by CORSIKA to a detector of any size at an arbitrary depth. The gSeaGen code was not only extended in terms of functionalities but also underwent a thorough redesign of the muon propagation routine, resulting in a more accurate and efficient simulation. This paper presents the capabilities of the new gSeaGen code as well as prospects for further developments.</description>
