      <title>The chiral phase transition in the 3D Columbia plot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of the chiral phase transition of QCD continues to represent a fundamental open problem in the study of strongly interacting matter. In recent years, significant progress has been achieved by exploiting systematic variations of theory parameters in regimes free of the sign problem. In this work, the idea of a follow-up investigation that extends a previous study at zero chemical potential is presented. A concrete programme for such an extension is discussed, outlining the required numerical steps, from data production to final analysis, and pointing to all the software tools that have been released to support these studies.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the mixed-fermion-action Effects using different fermion and gauge actions with 2+1 and 2+1+1 flavors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The leading-order low-energy constant $\Delta_{\rm mix}$ in mixed-action chiral perturbation theory is calculated using $2+1+1$-flavor gauge ensembles with HISQ fermions and a tadpole-improved Symanzik gauge action at four lattice spacings $a \in [0.048, 0.111]$ fm. By comparing our results to those from different actions and a $2+1$-flavor case, we find that the fermion action has the major impact, but the gauge action and charm quark loops also contribute significantly.</description>

      <title>$f_K/f_{\pi}$ in iso-symmetric QCD and the CKM matrix unitarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present lattice results for $f_K/f_{\pi}$ in the iso-symmetric limit of pure QCD (isoQCD) with $N_f=2+1$ flavours, along with a determination of $|V_{us}|/|V_{ud}|$ and a study on the unitarity of the first row of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix after introducing strong isospin-breaking and QED effects. The results obtained are based on a combination of a Wilson unitary action and the mixed-action setup introduced in arXiv:2309.14154, arXiv:2510.20450. The combination of the two regularisations enables a more precise control over the continuum-limit extrapolation.</description>

      <title>Variational Autoregressive Networks Applied to $\phi^4$ Field Theory Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine reinforcement learning with variational autoregressive networks (VANs) to perform data-free training and sampling for the discrete Ising model and the continuous $\phi^4$ scalar field theory. We quantify the complexity of the target distribution via the KL divergence between the magnetization distribution and a reference Gaussian distribution, and observe that configurations with smaller KL divergence typically require fewer training steps. Motivated by this observation, we investigate transfer learning and show that fine-tuning models pretrained at a single value of $\kappa$ can reduce training time compared with training from a Gaussian field. In addition, inspired by single-site and cluster Monte Carlo updates, we introduce single-site and block Metropolis--Hastings (MH) updates on top of VAN proposals. These MH corrections systematically reduce the residual bias of pure VAN sampling in the parameter range we study, while maintaining high sampling efficiency in terms of the effective sample size (ESS). For both the Ising model and the $\phi^4$ theory, our results agree with standard Monte Carlo benchmarks within errors, and no clear critical slowing down is observed in the explored parameter ranges.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a higher lattice gauge theory based on the representation of 2-groups described by a category of crossed modules on a lattice model described by path 2-groupoids. Using these lattice gauge representations, an exactly solvable Hamiltonian for topological phases in 3+1 dimensions is constructed. We show that the ground states of this model are topological observables.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide results for the vacuum expectation values of the flowed action density, the quark condensate, and the quark kinetic operator in the gradient-flow formalism. We work in $N_\text{F}$-flavor QCD, keeping the heaviest quark massive and all others massless. The vacuum expectation values of these operators are calculated numerically through next-to-next-to-leading order QCD, providing important input for the extraction of fundamental QCD parameters from lattice calculations. While the focus is on charm- and bottom-quark mass effects, we provide the results in a form that is independent of the specific quark mass.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of deep inelastic scattering in the Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hadronic tensors encode the nonperturbative structure of hadrons probed in deep inelastic scattering (DIS), yet their direct evaluation requires real-time evolution that presents a challenge for traditional Euclidean lattice approaches. In this work, we present the first study of the hadronic tensors in DIS using quantum simulation in the Schwinger model, i.e (1+1)-dimensional QED. Using two complementary quantum-simulation strategies -- quantum-circuit and tensor-network methods -- we compute the real-time current-current correlator directly on the lattice and validate our results against exact diagonalization where applicable. From this correlator, we compute the hadronic tensor and determine the longitudinal structure function, the sole nonvanishing DIS observable in two space-time dimensions. Our study demonstrates that quantum simulation offers a viable complementary pathway towards the evaluation of real-time observables relevant for hadronic structure. It also provides a foundation for extending the calculations from Schwinger model to other gauge theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow equation methods, more generally known as Similarity Renormalization Group (SRG) techniques, were developed to address multiscale problems where multiple length or energy scales contribute simultaneously. In this Thesis, we formulate the flow equation method within a wavelet-based framework and apply it to study scale (resolution) separation in a two-dimensional scalar field theory. We demonstrate that the flow systematically block-diagonalizes the Hamiltonian with respect to wavelet resolution, achieving improved truncation compared to earlier studies. Using a model of two real scalar fields coupled through a quadratic interaction, we show that the flow equations effectively suppress couplings between low- and high-resolution degrees of freedom. This provides a clear mechanism for isolating low-resolution physics and offers insight into the construction of effective Hamiltonians using a wavelet-based flow equation approac</description>

      <title>Lepton anomalous magnetic moments: Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The anomalous magnetic moment of a lepton encodes the fraction of the lepton's interaction strength with an external magnetic field, which is generated by quantum corrections. Lepton anomalous magnetic moments are sensitive probes of fundamental interactions and play a pivotal role in the quest for "new physics" that may be able to explain the shortcomings of the Standard Model. This chapter introduces the basic concepts and describes the calculation of the individual contributions arising from electromagnetism, the strong and the weak interactions.</description>

      <title>Emergent chiral spin symmetry, non-perturbative dynamics and thermoparticles in hot QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several non-perturbative results for hot QCD are challenging some aspects of the phase diagram and its associated degrees of freedom which were previously believed to be well understood. With increasing temperature, the chiral crossover is followed by an intermediate region with an approximate chiral spin symmetry larger than chiral symmetry, in which pseudo-scalar mesons continue to exist as hadron-like excitations, before at some higher temperature the expected chiral symmetry is recovered. By testing general formal considerations against lattice data, it can be shown that thermally modified versions of stable vacuum particles, so-called thermoparticles, form the constituents of thermal quantum field theories, with properties quite different from what is expected perturbatively. This ``viewpoint'' aims to raise broader and, in particular, phenomenological interest in these directions.</description>

      <title>Multi-neutron correlations in light nuclei via ab-initio lattice simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quest to understand multi-neutron systems has a long history, and recent experimental efforts aim to probe candidate four-neutron configurations in neutron-rich light nuclei such as ${}^8$He and ${}^7$H via quasi-free knockout reactions. However, the ground-state energies of the hydrogen isotopes ${}^6$H and ${}^7$H are not yet well constrained, with substantial discrepancies across experimental analyses and theoretical predictions. Using ab initio nuclear lattice effective field theory with an ensemble of 282 chiral two- and three-nucleon forces, we perform an uncertainty-quantified analysis of the ground-state energies of ${}^6$H and ${}^7$H. The marginal posteriors suggest single-neutron separation energy $S_n({}^{7}\text{H})=0.35^{+0.32}_{-0.32}$ MeV, disfavoring sequential ${}^{6}\mathrm{H}+n$ decay and pointing towards direct $t+4n$ emission. Intrinsic densities indicate triton- and $\alpha$-like clusters in ${}^7$H and ${}^8$He, respectively. By computing two-body and reduced four-body correlation functions, we find that the valence neutrons in the surface region of these systems form compact dineutrons that predominantly organize into symmetric dineutron-dineutron configurations, with only a small but non-negligible fraction assembling into more compact tetraneutron-like substructures. In ${}^7$H, these components account for roughly 95% and 5% of the sampled four-neutron configurations, respectively, and ${}^8$He exhibits a similar hierarchy. For these configurations, we also extract the corresponding spatial and angular correlation patterns among the nucleons. These results provide nuclear-structure insights into the debate surrounding four-neutron clusters and complement ongoing experimental searches for tetraneutron signatures in light nuclei.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Fifth- and Sixth-Order Fluctuations of (Net-)proton Number in Au+Au Collisions from Phase II of the Beam Energy Scan Program at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report high-statistics measurements of fifth- and sixth-order factorial cumulants and cumulant ratios of (net-)proton multiplicity distributions in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7$--27 GeV, using data from the STAR experiment collected during the Beam Energy Scan Phase~II at RHIC. Protons and antiprotons are identified at midrapidity ($|y| &lt; 0.5$) with transverse momentum $0.4 &lt; p_T &lt; 2.0$ GeV/$c$. The proton factorial cumulants $\kappa_4$, $\kappa_5$, and $\kappa_6$ increase with order but exhibit no sign alternation within current uncertainties, offering no evidence for a two-component structure in the proton multiplicity distribution, as might be expected near a first-order phase transition. The cumulant ratios $C_{5}/C_{1}$ and $C_{6}/C_{2}$ fluctuate around zero in collisions at 0--40\% centrality. The results are consistent with both the negative predictions from lattice QCD (LQCD) and the positive trends obtained from the Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) model. At $\sqrt{s_{NN}} \gtrsim 27$ GeV, the $C_4/C_2$ and $C_5/C_1$ results are compatible with predictions from lattice QCD, functional renormalization group (FRG), and hadron resonance gas (HRG) models, while UrQMD describes the data better at lower energies. These measurements place constraints on baryon number fluctuations and offer valuable insights into the QCD phase structure.</description>

      <title>Trigonometric continuous-variable gates and hybrid quantum simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid qubit-qumode quantum computing platforms provide a natural setting for simulating interacting bosonic quantum field theories. However, existing continuous-variable gate constructions rely predominantly on polynomial functions of canonical quadratures. In this work, we introduce a complementary universality paradigm based on trigonometric continuous-variable gates, which enable a Fourier-like representation of bosonic operators and are particularly well suited for periodic and non-perturbative interactions. We present a deterministic ancilla-based method for implementing unitary and non-unitary trigonometric gates whose arguments are arbitrary Hermitian functions of qumode quadratures. As a concrete application, we develop a hybrid qubit-qumode quantum simulation of the lattice sine-Gordon model. Using these gates, we prepare ground states via quantum imaginary-time evolution, simulate real-time dynamics, compute time-dependent vertex two-point correlation functions, and extract quantum kink profiles under topological boundary conditions. Our results demonstrate that trigonometric continuous-variable gates provide a physically natural framework for simulating interacting field theories on near-term hybrid quantum hardware, while establishing a parallel route to universality beyond polynomial gate constructions. We expect that the trigonometric gates introduced here to find broader applications, including quantum simulations of condensed matter systems, quantum chemistry, and biological models.</description>

      <title>Extracting quantum field theory dynamics from an approximate ground state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a linear-programming method to extract dynamical information from static ground-state correlators in quantum field theory. We recast the K\"all\'en-Lehmann inversion as a convex optimization problem, in a spirit similar to the recent approach of Lawrence [arXiv:2408.11766]. This produces robust estimates of the smeared spectral density, the real-time propagator, and the mass gap directly from an approximate equal-time two-point function, and simultaneously yields an \emph{a posteriori} lower bound on the correlation-function error. We test the method on the $1+1$-dimensional $\phi^4$ model, using a variational approximation to the vacuum -- relativistic continuous matrix product states -- that provides accurate correlators in the continuum and thermodynamic limits. The resulting mass gaps agree with renormalized Hamiltonian truncation and Borel-resummed perturbation theory across a wide range of couplings, demonstrating that accurate dynamical data can be recovered from a single equal-time slice.</description>

      <title>LaMET's Asymptotic Extrapolation vs. Inverse Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET) is a physics-guided systematic expansion to calculate light-cone parton distributions, including collinear (PDFs) and transverse-momentum-dependent ones, at any fixed momentum fraction $x$ within a range of $[x_{\rm min}, x_{\rm max}]$. It theoretically solves the ill-posed inverse problem that afflicts other theoretical approaches to collinear PDFs, such as short-distance factorizations. Recently, arXiv:2504.17706 [1] raised practical concerns about whether current or even future lattice data will have sufficient precision in the sub-asymptotic correlation region to support an error-controlled extrapolation -- and if not, whether it becomes an inverse problem where the relevant uncertainties cannot be properly quantified. While we agree that not all current lattice data have the desired precision to qualify for an asymptotic extrapolation, some calculations do, and more are expected in the future. We comment on the analysis and results in Ref. [1] and argue that a physics-based systematic extrapolation still provides the most reliable error estimates, even when the data quality is not ideal. In contrast, re-framing the long-distance asymptotic extrapolation as a data-driven-only inverse problem with ad hoc mathematical conditioning could lead to unnecessarily conservative errors.</description>

      <title>$\eta$ and $\eta'$ mesons from $N_f = 2+1$ lattice QCD at the physical point using topological charge operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By fitting the two-point correlation functions of topological charge density operators calculated on two $2+1$-flavor gauge ensembles with physical pion mass, we determine both the $\eta$ and $\eta'$ masses and also the mixing angle to be $m_\eta = 0.505(72)(75)$ GeV, $m_{\eta'}=0.952(47)(40)$ GeV, and $\theta_1 = -8.9(2.1)(1.8)^\circ$, respectively, where the first error is the statistical uncertainty and the second one is the systematic uncertainty. This is the first extraction of both $\eta/\eta'$ masses and the mixing angle $\theta_1$ using topological charge operators. Compared with previous studies using quark bilinear operators, the error of the $\eta$ mass is relatively large, but the mixing angle has comparable precision. This demonstrates that the topological charge operators are well suited to study the $\eta$ and $\eta'$ mesons.</description>

      <title>Lattice study of scattering phase shifts for $DD^*$ and $BB^*$ systems using twisted boundary conditions: Search for bound state formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the $S$- and $P$-wave phase shifts for the $DD^\ast$ and $BB^\ast$ scatterings using L\"uscher's finite-size method under twisted boundary conditions to search for doubly charmed tetraquaks, $T_{cc}^+$, and doubly bottomed tetraquarks, $T_{bb}^-$ as the hadronic bound states. The $T_{cc}^+$ state was observed as a peak just bellow the $DD^*$ threshold by LHCb Collaboration, while the $T_{bb}^-$ state is a theoretically predicted tetraquark state having heavier quark flavors $bb\bar u \bar d$. L\"uscher's finite-size method is one of the well established methods for calculating the scattering phase shifts between two hadrons in lattice QCD simulations. Several studies have used simulations under the periodic boundary condition to determine the scattering phase shifts at a few discrete momenta for the $DD^*$ system. However, the scattering phase shift has not been investigated for the $BB^*$ system. In this study, $S$- and $P$-wave scattering phase shifts for the $DD^*$ and $BB^*$ systems in both $I=0$ and $I=1$ channels under several types of partially twisted boundary conditions. The use of the partially twisted boundary conditions enables us to obtain the scattering phase shift at any momentum by continuously varying the twisting angle. It also allows us to easily access the $P$-wave scattering phase shifts through the mixing of $S$- and $P$-waves, which is induced by the imposed boundary conditions. The 2+1 flavor PACS-CS gauge ensembles at $m_\pi=295$, 411 and 569 MeV are used. For charm and bottom quarks, the relativistic heavy quark action is adopted to reduce the lattice discretization artifacts due to the heavy quark mass. We discuss the emergence of a shallow bound state with a binding energy of $O(100)$ keV at the physical pion mass in the $BB^*$ system, which has the quantum number $I(J^P)=0(1^+)$.</description>

      <title>SO(3) real algebra method for SU(3) QCD at finite baryon-number densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For SU(3) lattice QCD calculations at finite baryon-number densities, we propose the ``SO(3) real algebra method'', in which the SU(3) gauge variable is divided into the SO(3) and SU(3)/SO(3) parts. In this method, we introduce the ``maximal SO(3) gauge'' by minimizing the SU(3)/SO(3) part of the SU(3) gauge variable. In the Monte Carlo calculation, the SO(3) real algebra method employs the SO(3) fermionic determinant, i.e., the fermionic determinant of the SO(3) part of the SU(3) gauge variable, in the maximal SO(3) gauge, as well as the positive SU(3) gauge action factor $e^{-S_G}$. Here, the SO(3) fermionic determinant is real, and it is non-negative for the even-number flavor case ($N_f=2n$) of the same quark mass, e.g., $m_u=m_d$. The SO(3) real algebra method alternates between the maximal SO(3) gauge fixing and Monte Carlo updates on the SO(3) determinant and $e^{-S_G}$. After the most importance sampling, the ratio of the SU(3) and SO(3) fermionic determinants is treated as a weight factor. If the phase factor of the ratio does not fluctuate significantly among the sampled gauge configurations for a set of parameters (e.g., volume, chemical potential, and quark mass), then SU(3) lattice QCD calculations at finite densities would be feasible.</description>

      <title>Casimir effect in critical $\mathrm{O}(N)$ models from non-equilibrium Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\mathrm{O}(N)$ vector models in three dimensions, when defined in a geometry with a compact direction and tuned to criticality, exhibit long-range fluctuations which induce a Casimir effect. The strength of the resulting interaction is encoded in the excess free-energy density, which depends on a universal coefficient: the Casimir amplitude. We present a high-precision numerical calculation of the latter, by means of a novel non-equilibrium Monte Carlo algorithm, and compare our findings with results obtained from large-$N$ expansions and from the conformal bootstrap.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Equilibrium Dynamics in a U(1) Lattice Gauge Theory via Local Information Flows: Scattering and String Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce local information flows as a diagnostic tool for characterizing out-of-equilibrium quantum dynamics in lattice gauge theories. We employ the information lattice framework, a local decomposition of total information into spatial- and scale-resolved contributions, to characterize the propagation and buildup of quantum correlations in real-time processes. Focusing on the Schwinger model, a canonical $(1+1)$-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theory, we apply this framework to two scenarios. First, in the near-threshold scattering of two vector mesons, we demonstrate that the emergence of correlations at a longer length scale in the information lattice marks the production of heavier scalar mesons. Second, in the dynamics of electric field strings, we clearly distinguish between the confining regime, which evolves towards a steady state with a static correlation profile, and the string-breaking sector. The latter is characterized by dynamic correlation patterns that reflect the sequential formation and annihilation of strings. This information-centric approach provides a direct, quantitative, and interpretable visualization of complex many-body phenomena, offering a promising tool for analyzing dynamics in higher-dimensional gauge theories and experiments on quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Nonleptonic $\Omega_{b}^{*}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*}P(V)$ weak transitions in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20937v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nonleptonic two-body weak decays of the single bottom baryon $\Omega_{b}^{*}$ into $\Omega_{c}^{*}P(V)$ final states within the factorization framework. Employing this framework and incorporating the contributions from the current-current operators, we compute the tree-level decay amplitudes and decay widths of the $\Omega_{b}^{*}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*}P(V)$ processes in terms of the $\Omega_{b}^{*}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*}$ transition form factors. Here, $P$ and $V$ denote pseudoscalar and vector mesons, respectively. Using the form factors obtained in our previous work, we evaluate the numerical values of the decay widths for the dominant nonleptonic weak channels. This study complements our previous analysis of the semileptonic weak transitions $\Omega_{b}^{*}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*}\ell\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ reported in Ref. [1], thereby providing a detailed investigation of dominant $\Omega_{b}^{*}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*}$ weak decays of the $\Omega_{b}^{*}$ baryon.</description>

      <title>Tensor form factors of the $\Delta^+$ baryon induced by isovector and isoscalar currents in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tensor form factors of the $\Delta^+$ baryon are defined through the matrix element of the tensor current and describe its internal structure and spin distribution. We present the full Lorentz decomposition for the $\Delta^+ \rightarrow \Delta^+$ tensor current matrix element, including all independent structures consistent with Lorentz covariance, the Rarita-Schwinger constraints, and the discrete symmetries of Hermiticity, time-reversal, and parity invariance. By investigating the tensor form factors corresponding to both the isovector and isoscalar tensor currents, we observe differences that reflect the distinct contributions of up and down quark components in the $\Delta^+$ baryon.</description>
