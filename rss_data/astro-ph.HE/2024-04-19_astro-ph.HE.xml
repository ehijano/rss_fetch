      <title>Supermassive black holes from runaway mergers and accretion in nuclear star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid formation of supermassive black holes occurs in dense nuclear star clusters that are initially gas-dominated. Stellar-mass black hole remnants of the most massive cluster sink into the core, where a massive runaway black hole forms as a consequence of combined effects of repeated mergers and Eddington-limited gas accretion. The associated gravitational-wave signals of high-redshift extreme mass-ratio inspirals are a unique signature of the nuclear star cluster scenario.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a nearly orthogonal rotator in GX 301--2 with phase-resolved cyclotron resonant scattering features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyclotron resonant scattering features (CRSFs) are the absorption features in the X-ray spectra of strongly magnetized accretion neutron stars (NSs), which are probably the most reliable probe to the surface magnetic fields of NSs. The high mass X-ray binary GX 301--2 exhibits a very wide, variable and complicated CRSF in the average spectra, which should be two absorption lines based on NuStar and Insight-HXMT observations. With the Insight-HXMT frequent observations, we performed the phase-resolved spectroscopy and confirmed two cyclotron absorption lines in the phase-resolved spectra, with their centroid energy ratio $\sim 1.6-1.7$ in the super-critical luminosity case. A major hindrance in understanding those CRSFs is the very poorly constrained magnetic inclination angle, which is also a fundamental property of a NS and key to understanding the emission characteristics of a pulsar. Comparing the phase-resolved CRSF with simulated X-ray spectra, the magnetic inclination angle is found to be $\gtrsim 70^{\circ}$, i.e., nearly orthogonal between the NS's spin and magnetic axies. The implications of an orthogonal rotator and magnetic structure evolution in the accreting X-ray binary are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from nonradial oscillations of stochastically accreting neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oscillating neutron stars are sources of continuous gravitational waves. We study analytically the excitation of stellar oscillations by the mechanical impact on the stellar surface of ''clumps'' of stochastically accreted matter. We calculate the waveform and spectrum of the gravitational wave signal emitted by the accretion-driven pulsations. Results are generated for an idealised model of a nonrotating, unmagnetised, one-component star with uniform polytropic index $n_{\rm poly}$ assuming Newtonian gravity and the Cowling approximation. We find that the excited mode amplitudes grow with increasing $n_{\rm poly}$ and mode order $n$. The gravitational wave signal forms a sequence of amplitude-modulated packets for $n_{\rm poly}=1$, lasting $\sim 10^{-3}$s after each impact. The gravitational wave strain increases with increasing $n_{\rm poly}$, but decreases with increasing $n$ and increasing multipole order $l$ for $n_{\rm poly}=1$. In the observing band of current long-baseline interferometers, $g$-modes emit higher, narrower peaks in the amplitude spectral density than $f$- and $p$-modes, with the highest peaks reaching $\sim 10^{-26}$Hz$^{-1/2}$ for modes with damping time $\tau_{nl} \sim 10^{8}$yr. The root-mean-square strain $h_{\text{rms}}$, calculated by summing over modes with $2\leq l\leq4$ and $\tau_{nl} \leq 10^{8}$yr, spans the range $10^{-33} \leq h_{\text{rms}} \leq 10^{-32}$ for $1\leq n_{\text{poly}}\leq 2$.</description>

      <title>Finding the particularity of the active episode of SGR J1935+2154 during which FRB 20200428 occurred: Implication from a statistics of \textit{Fermi}/GBM X-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using the \textit{Fermi}/GBM data of the X-ray bursts (XRBs) of SGR J1935+2154, we investigate the temporal clustering of the bursts and the cumulative distribution of the waiting time and fluence/flux. It is found that the bursts occurring in the episode hosting FRB 20200428 have obviously shorter waiting times than those in the other episodes. The general statistical properties of the XRBs further indicate they could belong to a self-organized critical (SOC) system (e.g., starquakes), making them very similar to the earthquake phenomena. Then, according to a unified scaling law between the waiting time and energy of the earthquakes as well as their aftershocks, we implement an analogy analysis on the XRBs and find that the FRB episode owns more dependent burst events than the other episodes. It is indicated that the FRB emission could be produced by the interaction between different burst events, which could correspond to a collision between different seismic/Alfven waves or different explosion outflows. Such a situation could appear when the magnetar enters into a global intensive activity period.</description>

      <title>Coherent Inverse Compton Scattering in Fast Radio Bursts Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing observations of temporal, spectral, and polarization properties of fast radio bursts (FRBs) indicate that the radio emission of the majority of bursts is likely produced inside the magnetosphere of its central engine, likely a magnetar. We revisit the idea that FRBs are generated via coherent inverse Compton scattering (ICS) off low-frequency X-mode electromagnetic waves (fast magnetosonic waves) by bunches at a distance of a few hundred times of the magnetar radius. Following findings are revealed: 1. Crustal oscillations during a flaring event would excite kHz Alfv\'en waves. Fast magnetosonic waves with the same frequency can be generated directly or be converted from Alfv\'en waves at a large radius, with an amplitude large enough to power FRBs via the ICS process. 2. The cross section increases rapidly with radius and significant ICS can occur at $r \gtrsim 100 R_\star$ with emission power much greater than the curvature radiation power but still in the linear scattering regime. 3. The low-frequency fast magnetosonic waves naturally redistribute a fluctuating relativistic plasma in the charge-depleted region to form bunches with the right size to power FRBs. 4. The required bunch net charge density can be sub-Goldreich-Julian, which allows a strong parallel electric field to accelerate the charges, maintain the bunches, and continuously power FRB emission. 5. This model can account for a wide range of observed properties of repeating FRB bursts, including high degrees of linear and circular polarization and narrow spectra as observed in many bursts from repeating FRB sources.</description>

      <title>Comparing the three-dimensional morphological asymmetries in the ejecta of Kepler and Tycho in X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent simulations have shown that asymmetries in the ejecta distribution of supernova remnants (SNRs) may be a reflection of asymmetries left over from the initial supernova explosion. Thus, SNR studies provide a vital means for testing and constraining model predictions in relation to the distribution of heavy elements, which are key to improving our understanding of the explosion mechanisms in Type Ia supernovae.
  The use of a novel blind source separation method applied to the megasecond X-ray observations of the historic Kepler and Tycho supernova remnants has revealed maps of the ejecta distribution. These maps are endowed with an unprecedented level of detail and clear separations from the continuum emission. Our method also provides a three-dimensional (3D) view of the ejecta by individually disentangling red- and blueshifted spectral components associated with images of the Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe emission. This approach provides insights into the morphology of the ejecta distribution in those two remnants.
  Those mappings have allowed us to thoroughly investigate the asymmetries in the intermediate-mass elements and Fe distribution in two Type Ia supernova remnants. We also compared the results with the core-collapse Cassiopeia A remnant, which we had studied previously. The images obtained confirm, as expected for Type Ia SNRs, that the Fe distribution is mostly closer to the core than that of intermediate-mass elements. They also highlight peculiar features in the ejecta distribution, such as the Fe-rich southeastern knot in Tycho.</description>

      <title>The 2018 outburst of MAXI J1820+070 as seen by Insight-HXMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the whole 2018 outburst of the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070 with Insight-HXMT data. We focus our study on the temporal evolution of the parameters of the source. We employ two different models to fit the thermal spectrum of the disk: the Newtonian model DISKBB and the relativistic model NKBB. These two models provide different pictures of the source in the soft state. With DISKBB, we find that the inner edge of the disk is close to the innermost stable circular orbit of a fast-rotating black hole and the corona changes geometry from the hard to the soft state, probably becoming compact and close to the black hole. With NKBB, we find that the disk is truncated in the soft state and that the coronal geometry does not change significantly during the whole outburst. However, we find that the model with NKBB can predict an untruncated disk around a fast-rotating black hole if we assume that the inclination angle of the disk is around 30 degrees (instead of 60 degrees, which is the inclination angle of the jet and is usually adopted as the inclination angle of the disk in the literature) and we employ a high-density reflection model. In such a case, we measure a high value of the black hole spin parameter with observations in the soft state, in agreement with the high spin value found from the analysis of the reflection features and in disagreement with the low spin value found by previous continuum-fitting method measurements with the inclination angle of the disk set to the value of the inclination angle of the jet.</description>

      <title>A New Computational Method for Energetic Particle Acceleration and Transport with its Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a new computational method to explore astrophysical and heliophysical phenomena, especially those considerably influenced by non-thermal energetic particles. This novel approach considers the backreaction from these energetic particles by incorporating the non-thermal fluid pressure into Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. The pressure of the non-thermal fluid is evaluated from the energetic particle distribution evolved through Parker's transport equation, which is solved using stochastic differential equations. We implement this method in the HOW-MHD code (Seo \&amp; Ryu 2023), which achieves 5th-order accuracy. We find that without spatial diffusion, the method accurately reproduces the Riemann solution in the hydrodynamic shock tube test when including the non-thermal pressure. Solving Parker's transport equation allows the determination of pressure terms for both relativistic and non-relativistic non-thermal fluids with adiabatic indices $\gamma_{\rm{NT}}=4/3$ and $\gamma_{\rm{NT}}=5/3$, respectively. The method also successfully replicates the Magnetohydrodynamic shock tube test with non-thermal pressure, successfully resolving the discontinuities within a few cells. Introducing spatial diffusion of non-thermal particles leads to marginal changes in the shock but smooths the contact discontinuity. Importantly, this method successfully simulates the energy spectrum of the non-thermal particles accelerated through shock, which includes feedback from the non-thermal population. These results demonstrate that this method is very powerful for studying particle acceleration when a significant portion of the plasma energy is taken by energetic particles.</description>

      <title>The Host Galaxy of a Dormant, Overmassive Black Hole at $z=6.7$ May Be Restarting Star Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST is discovering a large population of $z&gt;4$ supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that are overmassive with respect to the stellar content of their hosts. A previous study developed a physical model to interpret this overmassive population as the result of quasar feedback acting on a compact host galaxy. In this Note, we apply this model to JADES GN 1146115, a dormant supermassive black hole at $z=6.7$ whose mass is $\sim40\%$ of the host's mass in stars and accreting at $\sim2\%$ of the Eddington limit. The host has been forming stars at the low rate of $\sim 1 \, \rm M_\odot \,yr^{-1}$ for the past $\sim 100$ Myr. Our model suggests that this galactic system is on the verge of a resurgence of global star formation activity. This transition comes after a period of domination by the effect of its overmassive black hole, whose duration is comparable to typical quasar lifetimes.</description>

      <title>IMBH Progenitors from Stellar Collisions in Dense Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Very massive stars (VMSs) formed via a sequence of stellar collisions in dense star clusters have been proposed as the progenitors of massive black hole seeds. VMSs could indeed collapse to form intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), which would then grow by accretion to become the supermassive black holes observed at the centers of galaxies and powering high-redshift quasars. Previous studies have investigated how different cluster initial conditions affect the formation of a VMS, including mass segregation, stellar collisions, and binaries, among others. In this study, we investigate the growth of VMSs with a new grid of Cluster Monte Carlo (CMC) star cluster simulations -- the most expansive to date. The simulations span a wide range of initial conditions, varying the number of stars, cluster density, stellar initial mass function (IMF), and primordial binary fraction. We find a gradual shift in the mass of the most massive collision product across the parameter space; in particular, denser clusters born with top-heavy IMFs provide strong collisional regimes that form VMSs with masses easily exceeding 1000 solar masses. Our results are used to derive a fitting formula that can predict the typical mass of a VMS formed as a function of the star cluster properties. Additionally, we study the stochasticity of this process and derive a statistical distribution for the mass of the VMS formed in one of our models, recomputing the model 50 times with different initial random seeds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A semiclassical investigation of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a charged particle in a radially freely falling motion in Schwarzschild spacetime is carried out. We use quantum field theory at tree level to obtain the one-particle-emission amplitudes. We analyze and compare the energy spectrum and total energy released, which are calculated from these amplitudes, for particles with varying initial positions and for particles originating from infinity with varying kinetic energy. We also compare the results with those due to a falling charged "string" extended in the radial direction.</description>

      <title>Future Perspectives for Gamma-ray Burst Detection from Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since their first discovery in the late 1960s, Gamma-ray bursts have attracted an exponentially growing interest from the international community due to their central role in the most highly debated open questions of the modern research of astronomy, astrophysics, cosmology, and fundamental physics. These range from the intimate nuclear composition of high density material within the core of ultra-dense neuron stars, to stellar evolution via the collapse of massive stars, the production and propagation of gravitational waves, as well as the exploration of the early Universe by unveiling first stars and galaxies (assessing also their evolution and cosmic re-ionization). GRBs have stimulated in the past $\sim$50 years the development of cutting-edge technological instruments for observations of high energy celestial sources from space, leading to the launch and successful operations of many different scientific missions (several of them still in data taking mode nowadays). In this review, we provide a brief description of the GRB-dedicated missions from space being designed and developed for the future. The list of these projects, not meant to be exhaustive, shall serve as a reference to interested readers to understand what is likely to come next to lead the further development of GRB research and associated phenomenology.</description>

      <title>A Self-Consistent Treatment of the Line-Driving Radiation Force for Active Galactic Nuclei Outflows: New Prescriptions for Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flows driven by photons have been studied for almost a century, and a quantitative description of the radiative forces on atoms and ions is important for understanding a wide variety of systems with outflows and accretion disks, such as active galactic nuclei. Quantifying the associated forces is crucial to determining how these outflows enable interactive mechanisms within these environments, such as AGN feedback. The total number of spectral lines in any given ion of the outflow material must be tabulated in order to give a complete characterization of this force. Here we provide calculations of the dimensionless line force multiplier for AGN environments. For a wide array of representative AGN sources, we explicitly calculate the photoionization balance at the proposed wind-launching region above the accretion disk, compute the strength of the line-driving force on the gas, and revisit and formalize the role of the commonly-used ionization parameter $\xi$ in ultimately determining the line-driving force. We perform these computations and analyses for a variety of AGN central source properties, such as black hole mass, initial wind velocity, and number density. We find that, while useful, the ionization parameter provides an incomplete description of the overall ionization state of the outflow material. We use these findings to provide an updated method for calculating the strength of the radiative line-driving using both the X-ray spectral index $\Gamma_X$ and the ionization parameter.</description>

      <title>Generation of relativistic electrons at the termination shock in the solar flare region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar flares are accompanied by an enhanced emission of electromagnetic waves from the radio up to the gamma-ray range. The associated hard X-ray (HXR) and microwave radiation is generated by energetic electrons, which carry a substantial part of the energy released during a flare. The flare is generally understood as a manifestation of magnetic reconnection in the corona. The so-called standard CSHKP model is one of the most widely accepted models for eruptive flares. The solar flare on September 10, 2017 offers a unique opportunity to study this model. The observations from the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA) show that 1.6x10^4 electrons with energies &gt;300 keV were generated in the flare region. There are signatures in solar radio and extreme ultraviolet observations as well as numerical simulations that a termination shock (TS) appears in the magnetic reconnection outflow region. Electrons accelerated at the TS can be considered to generate the loop-top HXR sources. In contrast to previous studies, we investigate whether the heating of the plasma at the TS provides enough relativistic electrons needed for the HXR and microwave emission observed during the X8.2 solar flare on September 10, 2017. We studied the heating of the plasma at the TS by evaluating the jump in the temperature across the shock by means of the Rankine-Hugoniot relationships under coronal circumstances measured during that event. The part of relativistic electrons was calculated in the heated downstream region. In the magnetic reconnection outflow region, the plasma is strongly heated at the TS. Thus, there are enough energetic electrons in the tail of the electron distribution function needed for the microwave and HXR emission observed during that event. The generation of relativistic electrons at the TS is a possible mechanism to explain the enhanced microwave and HXR radiation emitted during flares.</description>

      <title>The relic density and temperature evolution of light dark sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a set of four fully coupled Boltzmann equations to precisely determine the relic density and temperature of dark matter by including three distinct sectors: dark matter, light scalar, and standard model sectors. The intricacies of heat transfer between DM and the SM sector through a light scalar particle are explored, inspired by stringent experimental constraints on the scalar-Higgs mixing angle and the DM-scalar coupling. Three distinct sectors emerge prior to DM freeze-out, requiring fully coupled Boltzmann equations to accurately compute relic density. Investigation of forbidden, resonance, and secluded DM scenarios demonstrates significant deviations between established methods and the novel approach with fully coupled Boltzmann equations. Despite increased computational demands, this emphasizes the need for improved precision in relic density calculations, underlining the importance of incorporating these equations in comprehensive analyses.</description>

      <title>Improving inference on neutron star properties using information from binary merger remnants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational-wave signal GW170817 is a result of a binary neutron star coalescence event. The observations of electromagnetic counterparts suggest that the event didn't led to the prompt formation of a black-hole. In this work, we first classify the GW170817 LIGO-Virgo data sample into prompt collapse to a black-hole using the $q$-dependent threshold mass fits and then remove these cases from the data sample. We find that the cases without a prompt black-hole formation do not support radii $ &lt;$ 10 km unlike the LIGO-Virgo data sample. This is consistent with the maximum mass constraint, based on the binary pulsar J0348+0432, imposed LIGO-Virgo data sample. Additionally, we find that the cases without the prompt collapse to a black-hole improve the uncertainty range of neutron star radii from 3.3 km to 2.6 km for the data sample without the mass constraint and from 2.8 km to 2.5 km for the data sample with the mass constraint, implying improved constraints on the neutron star radii and hence the equation-of-state.</description>

      <title>Low-frequency pulse-jitter measurement with the uGMRT I : PSR J0437$-$4715</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01875v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-precision pulsar timing observations are limited in their accuracy by the jitter noise that appears in the arrival time of pulses. Therefore, it is important to systematically characterise the amplitude of the jitter noise and its variation with frequency. In this paper, we provide jitter measurements from low-frequency wideband observations of PSR J0437$-$4715 using data obtained as part of the Indian Pulsar Timing Array experiment. We were able to detect jitter in both the 300 - 500 MHz and 1260 - 1460 MHz observations of the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT). The former is the first jitter measurement for this pulsar below 700 MHz, and the latter is in good agreement with results from previous studies. In addition, at 300 - 500 MHz, we investigated the frequency dependence of the jitter by calculating the jitter for each sub-banded arrival time of pulses. We found that the jitter amplitude increases with frequency. This trend is opposite as compared to previous studies, indicating that there is a turnover at intermediate frequencies. It will be possible to investigate this in more detail with uGMRT observations at 550 - 750 MHz and future high sensitive wideband observations from next generation telescopes, such as the Square Kilometre Array. We also explored the effect of jitter on the high precision dispersion measure (DM) measurements derived from short duration observations. We find that even though the DM precision will be better at lower frequencies due to the smaller amplitude of jitter noise, it will limit the DM precision for high signal-to-noise observations, which are of short durations. This limitation can be overcome by integrating for a long enough duration optimised for a given pulsar.</description>

      <title>Impact of anisotropic cosmic-ray transport on the gamma-ray signatures in the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The very high energy (VHE) emission of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is rarely modelled in 3D. Most approaches describe the morphology in 1D or simplify the diffusion to the isotropic case. In this work we show the impact of a realistic 3D magnetic field configuration and gas distribution on the VHE gamma-ray distribution of the CMZ. We solve the 3D cosmic-ray transport equation with an anisotropic diffusion tensor using the approach of stochastic differential equations as implemented in the CRPropa framework. We test two different source distributions for five different anisotropies of the diffusion tensor, covering the range of effectively fieldline-parallel diffusion to isotropic diffusion. Within the tested magnetic field configuration the anisotropy of the diffusion tensor is close to the isotropic case and three point sources within the CMZ are favoured. Future missions like the upcoming CTA will reveal more small-scale structures which are not jet included in the model. Therefor a more detailed 3D gas distribution and magnetic field structure will be needed.</description>

      <title>Deep Optical Emission-Line Images of Nine Known and Three New Galactic Supernova Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep optical emission-line images are presented for nine known plus three new Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs), all but one having at least one angular dimension greater than one degree. Wide-field images taken in H$\alpha$ and [O III] $\lambda$5007 reveal many new and surprising remnant structures including large remnant shock extensions and `breakout' features not seen in published optical or radio data. These images represent over 12,000 individual images totaling more than 1000 hours of exposure time taken over the last two years mainly using small aperture telescopes which detected fainter nebular line emissions than published emission-line images. During the course of this imaging program, we discovered three new SNRs, namely G107.5-5.1 (the Nereides Nebula), G209.9-8.2, and G210.5+1.3, two of which have diameters &gt;1.5 degrees. Besides offering greater structural detail on the nine already known SNRs, a key finding of this study is the importance of [O III] emission-line imaging for mapping the complete shock emissions of Galactic SNRs.</description>

      <title>The disappearance of the blue and luminous progenitor of the Type IIn SN 2010jl</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type IIn supernovae (SNe) exhibit narrow hydrogen lines that arise from the strong interaction between ejecta and circumstellar material. It remains poorly understood, however, what progenitor stars give rise to these explosions. In this work, we perform a detailed analysis of the progenitor and environment of the nearby Type IIn SN 2010jl. With newer images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, we confirm that the previously reported progenitor candidate is a blend of the progenitor itself and a field star cluster in its close vicinity. SN 2010jl has now become much fainter than the progenitor. The progenitor is very blue and luminous with an effective temperature of log $T_{\rm eff}/{\rm K}$=4.26$^{+0.11}_{-0.09}$ and a luminosity of log $L/L_{\odot}$ =6.52$^{+0.20}_{-0.16}$. It is located in a very young star-forming region, but its luminosity is much higher than that expected from the environmental stellar populations. We suggest that the progenitor was in outburst when observed. Its nature and evolutionary history remain to be investigated.</description>

      <title>Sky location of Massive Black Hole Binaries in the foreground of Galactic white dwarf binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sky locating massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) from the foreground of double white dwarf (DWD) is essential for space-based gravitational wave (GW) detection. In an orbit period of the space crafts, there is an optimal orbital position of the GW detectors to observe GW sources, where the signal intensity is at its peak. From the model Q3-d, five MBHB sources are selected based on the optimal observation orbital positions of the GW detectors, which are associated with the orientation of the MBHB perpendicular to the detection arms. For two MBHB sources of lower intensity, luminosity distance uncertainties, $\Delta D_L$/$D_L$ at the 95$\%$ confidence level from the overlapping GW signals of MBHB and DWD sources, when employing wavelet decomposition and reconstruction methods, are improved by $\sim$ 2 times and $\sim$ 10 times. Besides, the angular resolutions $\Delta \Omega_s$ are also improved by a factor of $\sim$ 35 and $\sim$ 8. These results imply that we can obtain relatively high accuracy of quickly localizing MBHB from the overlapped GW signals with DWDs at the best observation orbit position. The luminosity distance uncertainties at the 95$\%$ confidence level for MBHB sources with the higher sign-noise ratio, have constraints on the precision of the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Probe of Primordial Black Hole Origin via Superradiance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we have used stochastic gravitational wave background as a unique probe to gain insight regarding the creation mechanism of primordial black holes. We have considered the cumulative gravitational wave background which consists of the primary part coming from the creation mechanism of the primordial black holes and the secondary part coming from the different mechanisms the primordial black holes go through. We have shown that in the presence of light or ultra light scalar bosons, superradiant instability generates the secondary part of the gravitational wave background which is the most detectable. In order to show the unique features of the cumulative background, we have considered the delayed vacuum decay during a first order phase transition as the origin of primordial black holes. We have shown the dependence of the features of the cumulative background, such as the mass of the relevant light scalars, peak frequencies, etc. on the transition parameters. We have also generated the cumulative background for a few benchmark cases to further illustrate our claim.</description>

      <title>Nucleonic models at finite temperature with in-medium effective fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a calculation of dense and hot nuclear matter where the mean interaction between nucleons is described by in-medium effective fields and where we employ analytical approximations of the Fermi integrals. We generalize a previous work where we have addressed the case of the Fermi gas model with in-medium effective mass. In the present work, we fully treat the in-medium interaction by considering both its contribution to the in-medium effective fields, which can be subsumed by the mass in some cases, and to the potential term. Our formalism is general and could be applied to relativistic and nonrelativistic approaches. It is illustrated for different popular models -- Skyrme, nonlinear, and density-dependent relativistic mean-field models --, but also for the metamodel, and it provides a clear understanding of the in-medium correction to the pressure, which is present in the case of the Skyrme and metamodel but is not for the relativistic ones. For the Fermi integrals, we compare the analytical approximation to the, so-called, ``exact'' numerical calculations in order to quantitatively estimate the accuracy of the approximation.</description>

      <title>Proto-strange quark stars from density-dependent quark mass model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the evolution of strange quark stars (SQS) from birth as proto-strange quark stars to maturity as stable SQSs at a zero temperature. We assume that self-bound free quarks form {entirely the compact} star and study its evolution {through a series of snapshots} using a density-dependent quark mass model. We consider $\beta$-equilibrated stellar matter at two major stages of the star's evolution: neutrino trapped regime and neutrino transparent regime during the deleptonization and cooling processes of the star. We fix the entropy density per baryon and the lepton fraction to investigate the nuclear equation of state (EoS), particle distribution, temperature profile inside the star, sound velocity, polytropic index, and the structure of the star. Our results show that stars with higher neutrino concentrations are slightly more massive than the neutrino-poor ones along the evolution lines of the SQS. We obtain EoSs in agreement with the conformal boundary set through sound velocity, and also the 2 M$_\odot$ mass constraint for NSs was satisfied at all stages of the star's evolution.</description>

Abstract: Radio galaxies in clusters of galaxies are prominent reservoirs of magnetic fields and of non-thermal particles, which get mixed with the intracluster medium. We review the observational and theoretical knowledge of the role of these crucial ingredients for the formation of diffuse radio emission in clusters (radio halos, relics, mini halos) and outline the open questions in this field.</description>
