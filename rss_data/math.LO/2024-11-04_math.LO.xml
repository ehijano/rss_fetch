      <title>Wilson conjecture for omega-categorical Lie algebras, the case 3-Engel characteristic 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the Wilson conjecture for $\omega$-categorical $3$-Engel Lie algebras over a field of characteristic $5$: every $\omega$-categorical Lie algebra over $\mathbb{F}_5$ which satisfies the identity $[x,y^3] = 0$ is nilpotent. We also include an extended introduction to Wilson's conjecture: every $\omega$-categorical locally nilpotent $p$-group is nilpotent, and present variants of this conjecture and connections to local/global nilpotency problems (Burnside, Kurosh-Levitzki, Engel groups). No particular knowledge of model theory is assumed except basic notions of formulas and definable sets.</description>

      <title>Quantifying calibration error in modern neural networks through evidence based theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trustworthiness in neural networks is crucial for their deployment in critical applications, where reliability, confidence, and uncertainty play pivotal roles in decision-making. Traditional performance metrics such as accuracy and precision fail to capture these aspects, particularly in cases where models exhibit overconfidence. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel framework for quantifying the trustworthiness of neural networks by incorporating subjective logic into the evaluation of Expected Calibration Error (ECE). This method provides a comprehensive measure of trust, disbelief, and uncertainty by clustering predicted probabilities and fusing opinions using appropriate fusion operators. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, where post-calibration results indicate improved trustworthiness. The proposed framework offers a more interpretable and nuanced assessment of AI models, with potential applications in sensitive domains such as healthcare and autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Wilson conjecture for omega-categorical Lie algebras, the case 4-Engel characteristic 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue our study of the Wilson conjecture for $\omega$-categorical Lie algebras and prove that $\omega$-categorical $4$-Engel Lie algebras of characteristic $3$ are nilpotent. We develop a set of tools to adapt in the definable context some classical methods for studying Engel Lie algebras (Higgins, Kostrikin, Zelmanov, Vaughan-Lee, Traustason and others). We solve the case at hand by starting a systematic study of Lie algebras for which there is a $k$ such that the principal ideal generated by any element is nilpotent of class $&lt;k$ (which we call $k$-strong Lie algebras). We use computer algebra to check basic cases of a conjectural arithmetical property of those, namely that $x^{k-1}y^{k-1} = (-1)^{k-1}y^{k-1}x^{k-1}$ is an identity for Lie elements of the enveloping algebra. The solution is given by reducing the problem to $k$-strong Lie algebras generated by particularly well behaved sandwiches in the sense of Kostrikin.</description>

      <title>Context, Judgement, Deduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.09438v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce judgemental theories and their calculi as a general framework to present and study deductive systems. As an exemplification of their expressivity, we approach dependent type theory and natural deduction as special kinds of judgemental theories. Our analysis sheds light on both the topics, providing a new point of view. In the case of type theory, we provide an abstract definition of type constructor featuring the usual formation, introduction, elimination and computation rules. For natural deduction we offer a deep analysis of structural rules, demystifying some of their properties, and putting them into context. We finish the paper discussing the internal logic of a topos, a predicative topos, an elementary 2-topos et similia, and show how these can be organized in judgemental theories.</description>

      <title>Higher stationarity and derived topologies on $\mathcal{P}_{\kappa}(A)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00805v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\kappa$ be a regular limit cardinal, $\kappa \subseteq A$. We study a notion of $n$-s-stationarity on $\mathcal{P}_{\kappa}(A)$. We construct a sequence of topologies $\langle \tau_0, \tau_1, \dots \rangle $ on $\mathcal{P}_{\kappa}(A)$ characterising the simultaneous reflection of a pair of $n$-s-stationary sets in terms of elements in the base of $\tau_n$. This result constitutes a complete generalisation to the context of $\mathcal{P}_{\kappa}(A)$ of Bagaria's prior characterisation of $n$-simultaneous reflection in terms of derived topologies on ordinals.</description>

      <title>Measurable Brooks's Theorem for Directed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a descriptive version of Brooks's theorem for directed graphs. In particular, we show that, if $D$ is a Borel directed graph on a standard Borel space $X$ such that the maximum degree of each vertex is at most $d \geq 3$, then unless $D$ contains the complete symmetric directed graph on $d + 1$ vertices, $D$ admits a $\mu$-measurable $d$-dicoloring with respect to any Borel probability measure $\mu$ on $X$, and $D$ admits a $\tau$-Baire-measurable $d$-dicoloring with respect to any Polish topology $\tau$ compatible with the Borel structure on $X$. We also prove a definable version of Gallai's theorem on list dicolorings for directed graphs by showing that any Borel directed graph of bounded degree whose connected components are not Gallai trees is Borel degree-list-dicolorable.</description>
