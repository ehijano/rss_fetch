      <title>Real-Time Aware IP-Networking for Resource-Constrained Embedded Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This dissertation explores the area of real-time IP networking for embedded devices, especially those with limited computational resources. With the increasing convergence of information and operational technologies in various industries, and the growing complexity of communication requirements in (semi-)autonomous machines, there is a need for more advanced and reliable networking solutions. This research focuses on the challenge of integrating real-time embedded devices into packet-switched networks. Through a comprehensive review of current real-time communication technologies, standards, and practices in the context of Industry 4.0, a notable gap is identified: the lack of a robust real-time communication standard tailored for wireless mobile machines, and insufficient research on real-time embedded devices in highly networked environments. The study includes detailed experimentation with commercially available off-the-shelf networked microcontrollers, revealing a priority inversion problem where network packet processing interrupts real-time tasks, potentially causing real-time violations. To address this challenge, this thesis proposes mitigation methods and system designs that include software and hardware implementations. These include a new embedded network subsystem that prioritizes packet processing based on task priority, and a real-time-aware network interface controller that moderates interrupt requests. In addition, a hybrid hardware-software co-design approach is developed to ensure predictable and reliable real-time task execution despite network congestion. Furthermore, the research extends to task offloading in wireless Industrial Internet of Things environments, presenting a system architecture and scheduler capable of maintaining real-time constraints even under heavy loads and network uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Quantification of Capacity and Throughput in Integrated Space and Terrestrial Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantification of network capacity and throughput is crucial for performance evaluation of integrated space and terrestrial network (ISTN).However, existing studies mainly consider the maximum throughput as the network capacity, but such a definition would make it unreasonable that the value of the network capacity would change with different employed routing algorithms and congestion control policy, instead of being a constant quantity.
  In this paper, we argue that the capacity of an ISTN is solely dependent on the characteristics of the network infrastructure,and the throughput of an ISTN is the aggregate traffic transported by the network under a given traffic scenario. Then, we present a quantitative approach to assessing network capacity in relation to an unreliable ISL model (cap-uISL), and a Constrained Path Expansion throughput calculation method (THP-CPE) based on a set of known traffic paths. This method allows us to obtain the current throughput value of the network based on any given traffic paths and load demand matrix. As the traffic load increases, the throughput approaches its maximum value, which is notably smaller than the network's capacity.
  We experimentally determine the network capacity of CAP-uISL under various link parameters and compare our throughput quantization method, THP-CPE, with other state-of-the-art methods under four emerging ISTNs. We find that, compared with the THP-CPE, existing throughput calculation methods tend to be overestimated, while our proposed throughput calculation method maintains reasonable intervals in terms of path utilization ($&lt;1$) under all load cases.</description>

      <title>A Flexible Infrastructure-Sharing 5G Network Architecture Based on Network Slicing and Roaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sharing of mobile network infrastructure has become a key topic with the introduction of 5G due to the high costs of deploying such infrastructures, with neutral host models coupled with features such as network function virtualization (NFV) and network slicing emerging as viable solutions for the challenges in this area. With this in mind, this work presents the design, implementation, and test of a flexible infrastructure-sharing 5G network architecture capable of providing services to any type of client, whether an operator or not. The proposed architecture leverages 5G's network slicing for traffic isolation and compliance with the policies of different clients, with roaming employed for the authentication of users of operator clients. The proposed architecture was implemented and tested in a simulation environment using the UERANSIM and Open5GS open-source tools. Qualitative tests successfully validated the authentication and the traffic isolation features provided by the slices for the two types of clients. Results also demonstrate that the proposed architecture has a positive impact on the performance of the neutral host network infrastructure, achieving 61.8% higher throughput and 96.8% lower packet loss ratio (PLR) in a scenario sharing the infrastructure among four clients and eight users when compared to a single client with all the network resources.</description>

      <title>Optimal Planning for Heterogeneous Smart Radio Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart Radio Environment (SRE) is a central paradigms in 6G and beyond, where integrating SRE components into the network planning process enables optimized performance for high-frequency Radio Access Network (RAN). This paper presents a comprehensive planning framework utilizing realistic urban scenarios and precise channel models to analyze diverse SRE components, including Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS), Network-Controlled Repeater (NCR), and advanced technologies like Simultaneous transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR RIS) and trisectoral NCR (3SNCR). We propose two optimization methods, full coverage minimum cost (FCMC) and maximum budget-constrained coverage (MBCC), that address key cost and coverage objectives by considering both physical characteristics and scalable costs of each component, influenced by factors such as NCR amplification gain and RIS dimensions. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the significant impact of these models in enhancing network planning efficiency for high-density urban environments.</description>

      <title>Performance Evaluation of Self-Organizing Features in Wireless Sensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With recent advancements in microelectromechanical systems, low-power integrated circuits, and wireless communications, wireless sensor networks have gained immense significance [1][2]These distributed networks facilitate the efficient utilization of resources as well as create countless opportunities for everyday life applications: personal healthcare, home automation, environment monitoring, industrial automation, and defense surveillance to name a few. Sensor networks are vulnerable to environmental conditions of their deployment area and may experience damage. If a part of the network is destroyed, the network needs to be reconfigured or repaired. Due to a number of issues and adjustments in available resources, the mechanisms of the wireless sensor network must be self-organized. For example, in task allocation, cooperative communication, and dynamic data-collection activities, self-organization can enhance the capabilities of wireless sensor networks related to applications, network, and physical layer.</description>

      <title>Efficient Multi-user Offloading of Personalized Diffusion Models: A DRL-Convex Hybrid Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the impressive generative capabilities of diffusion models, personalized content synthesis has emerged as the most highly anticipated. However, the large model sizes and iterative nature of inference make it difficult to deploy personalized diffusion models broadly on local devices with varying computational power. To this end, we propose a novel framework for efficient multi-user offloading of personalized diffusion models, given a variable number of users, diverse user computational capabilities, and fluctuating available computational resources on the edge server. To enhance computational efficiency and reduce storage burden on edge servers, we first propose a tailored multi-user hybrid inference manner, where the inference process for each user is split into two phases with an optimizable split point. The initial phase of inference is processed on a cluster-wide model using batching techniques, generating low-level semantic information corresponding to each user's prompt. Then, the users employ their own personalized model to add further details in the later inference phase. Given the constraints on edge server computational resources and users' preferences for low latency and high accuracy, we model the joint optimization of each user's offloading request handling and split point as an extension of the Generalized Quadratic Assignment Problem (GQAP). Our objective is to maximize a comprehensive metric that accounts for both latency and accuracy across all users. To tackle this NP-hard problem, we transform the GQAP into an adaptive decision sequence, model it as a Markov decision process, and develop a hybrid solution combining deep reinforcement learning with convex optimization techniques. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior optimality and low complexity compared to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Space-ground Fluid AI for 6G Edge Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge artificial intelligence (AI) and space-ground integrated networks (SGIN) are two main usage scenarios of the sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks. Edge AI supports pervasive low-latency AI services to users, whereas SGIN provide digital services to spatial, aerial, maritime and ground users. This article advocates the integration of the two technologies by extending edge AI to space, thereby delivering AI services to every corner of the planet. Beyond a simple combination, our novel framework, called Space-ground Fluid AI, leverages the predictive mobility of satellites to facilitate fluid horizontal and vertical task/model migration in the networks. This ensures non-disruptive AI service provisioning in spite of the high mobility of satellite servers. The aim of the article is to introduce the (Space-ground) Fluid AI technology. First, we outline the network architecture and unique characteristics of Fluid AI. Then, we delve into three key components of Fluid AI, i.e., fluid learning, fluid inference, and fluid model downloading. They share the common feature of coping with satellite mobility via inter-satellite and space-ground cooperation to support AI services. Finally, we present some experimental case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of Fluid AI and identify further research opportunities.</description>

      <title>Internet Measurement of Quantum-Resistant IKEv2 in Constrained Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within 1-2 decades, quantum computers are expected to obsolesce current public-key cryptography, driving authorities such as IETF and NIST to push for adopting quantum-resistant cryptography (QRC) in ecosystems like Internet Protocol Security (IPsec). However, IPsec struggles to adopt QRC, primarily due to the limited ability of Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2), which establishes IPsec connections, to tolerate the large public keys and digital signatures of QRC. Many solutions (e.g., IETF RFCs) are proposed to integrate QRC into IKEv2, but remain largely untested in practice. In this paper, we measure the performance of these proposals over the Internet by designing and implementing a novel, scalable, and flexible testbed for quantum-resistant IPsec, and we expose the serious shortcomings of existing proposals for quantum-resistant IKEv2 when deployed in constrained (e.g., lossy, rate-limited) networks. Through experimental deployments ranging from cloud-based virtual networks to hardware-in-the-loop wireless links between software-defined radios, as well as deployment on the international FABRIC testbed for next-generation networks, we show that today's solutions for quantum-resistant IPsec are insufficient, necessitating development of better approaches.</description>

      <title>Static and Dynamic Routing, Fiber, Modulation Format, and Spectrum Allocation in Hybrid ULL Fiber-SSMF Elastic Optical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional standard single-mode fibers (SSMF) are unable to satisfy the future long-distance and high-speed optical channel transmission requirement due to their relatively large signal losses. To address this issue, the ultra-low loss and large effective area (ULL) fibers are successfully manufactured and expected to deployed in the existing optical networks. For such ULL fiber deployment, network operators prefer adding ULL fibers to each link rather than replace existing SSMFs, resulting in a scenario where both of SSMF and ULL fiber coexist on the same link. In this paper, we investigated the routing, fiber, modulation format, and spectrum allocation (RFMSA) problem in the context of an elastic optical network (EON) where ULL fiber and SSMF coexisting on each link under both the static and dynamic traffic demands. We formulated this RFMSA problem as a node-arc based Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model and developed Spectrum Window Plane (SWP)-based heuristic algorithms based on different fiber selection strategies, including spectrum usage based (SU), optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) aware, ULL fiber first (UFF), and random strategies. Simulation results show that in the static traffic demand situation, the RFMSA algorithm based on the OSNR-aware (OA) strategy exhibits optimal performance, attaining a performance similar to that of the MILP model regarding the maximum number of frequency slots (FSs) used in the entire network. Moreover, in the dynamic traffic demand scenario, the SU strategy remarkably surpasses the other strategies in terms of the lightpath blocking probability.</description>

      <title>Poster: Could Large Language Models Perform Network Management?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern wireless communication systems have become increasingly complex due to the proliferation of wireless devices, increasing performance standards, and growing security threats. Managing these networks is becoming more challenging, requiring the use of advanced network management methods and tools. AI-driven network management systems such as Self-Optimizing Networks (SONs) are gaining attention. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been demonstrating exceptional zero-shot learning and generalization capabilities across several domains. In this paper, we leverage the potential of LLMs with SONs to enhance future network management systems. Specifically, we benchmark the use of various LLMs such as GPT-4, Llama, and Falcon, in a zero-shot setting based on their real-time network configuration recommendations. Our results indicate promising prospects for integrating LLMs into future network management systems.</description>

      <title>Urban Region Embeddings from Service-Specific Mobile Traffic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of advanced 4G/5G mobile networks, mobile phone data collected by operators now includes detailed, service-specific traffic information with high spatio-temporal resolution. In this paper, we leverage this type of data to explore its potential for generating high-quality representations of urban regions. To achieve this, we present a methodology for creating urban region embeddings from service-specific mobile traffic data, employing a temporal convolutional network-based autoencoder, transformers, and learnable weighted sum models to capture key urban features. In the extensive experimental evaluation conducted using a real-world dataset, we demonstrate that the embeddings generated by our methodology effectively capture urban characteristics. Specifically, our embeddings are compared against those of a state-of-the-art competitor across two downstream tasks. Additionally, through clustering techniques, we investigate how well the embeddings produced by our methodology capture the temporal dynamics and characteristics of the underlying urban regions. Overall, this work highlights the potential of service-specific mobile traffic data for urban research and emphasizes the importance of making such data accessible to support public innovation.</description>

      <title>Editable-DeepSC: Reliable Cross-Modal Semantic Communications for Facial Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time computer vision (CV) plays a crucial role in various real-world applications, whose performance is highly dependent on communication networks. Nonetheless, the data-oriented characteristics of conventional communications often do not align with the special needs of real-time CV tasks. To alleviate this issue, the recently emerged semantic communications only transmit task-related semantic information and exhibit a promising landscape to address this problem. However, the communication challenges associated with Semantic Facial Editing, one of the most important real-time CV applications on social media, still remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing Editable-DeepSC, a novel cross-modal semantic communication approach for facial editing. Firstly, we theoretically discuss different transmission schemes that separately handle communications and editings, and emphasize the necessity of Joint Editing-Channel Coding (JECC) via iterative attributes matching, which integrates editings into the communication chain to preserve more semantic mutual information. To compactly represent the high-dimensional data, we leverage inversion methods via pre-trained StyleGAN priors for semantic coding. To tackle the dynamic channel noise conditions, we propose SNR-aware channel coding via model fine-tuning. Extensive experiments indicate that Editable-DeepSC can achieve superior editings while significantly saving the transmission bandwidth, even under high-resolution and out-of-distribution (OOD) settings.</description>

      <title>SARS: A Resource Selection Algorithm for Autonomous Driving Tasks in Heterogeneous Mobile Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of devices requiring intensive computation, such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices, smart sensors, and wearable technology, the computational demands on individual platforms with limited resources have escalated, necessitating the offloading of the generated tasks by the devices to edge. These tasks are often real-time with strict response time requirements. Among these devices, autonomous vehicles present unique challenges due to their critical need for timely and accurate processing to ensure passenger safety. Selecting suitable servers in a heterogeneous mobile edge computing (MEC) architecture is vital to optimizing real-time task processing rates for such applications. To address this, we present an algorithmic solution to improve the allocation of heterogeneous servers to real-time tasks, aiming to maximize the number of processed tasks. By analyzing task and server characteristics in the MEC architecture, we develop the suitability-based adaptive resource selection (SARS) algorithm, which evaluates server suitability based on factors like time constraints and server capabilities. Additionally, we introduce the proactive on-demand resource allocation (PORA) algorithm, which strategically reserves computational resources to ensure availability for critical real-time tasks. We compare the proposed algorithms with several classical and state-of-the-art algorithms. Computational results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing algorithms, processes more tasks, and effectively prioritizes urgent tasks, particularly in autonomous driving applications.</description>

      <title>Data Processing Efficiency Aware User Association and Resource Allocation in Blockchain Enabled Metaverse over Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of the Metaverse, enhanced by blockchain technology, the efficient processing of data has emerged as a critical challenge, especially in wireless communication systems. Addressing this need, our paper introduces the innovative concept of data processing efficiency (DPE), aiming to maximize processed bits per unit of resource consumption in blockchain-empowered Metaverse environments. To achieve this, we propose the DPE-Aware User Association and Resource Allocation (DAUR) algorithm, a tailored solution for these complex systems. The DAUR algorithm transforms the challenging task of optimizing the sum of DPE ratios into a solvable convex optimization problem. It uniquely alternates the optimization of key variables like user association, work offloading ratios, task-specific computing resource distribution, bandwidth allocation, user power usage ratios, and server computing resource allocation ratios. Our extensive numerical results demonstrate the DAUR algorithm's effectiveness in DPE.</description>

Abstract: In the next generation network, the satellite network will play a fundamental role, in overcoming the limitation of the terrestrial network. Nonetheless, the satellite-terrestrial network integration presents a number of problems due to the time-variant topology of the first. One of the most important is the routing process of such networks. Many solutions have been proposed in the literature since the 1990s, and in recent years, the development of modern technologies such as Software Defined Networking (SDN) led to new possible approaches to the routing of satellite network. In this paper, a graph-based, source routing algorithm is presented. The algorithm exploits reliability and flexibility of the SDN architecture and the simplicity of source routing to tackle the dynamic topology of the network, providing rerouting solutions when necessary.</description>

      <title>Positioning of a Next Generation Mobile Cell to Maximise Aggregate Network Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06098v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In wireless communications, the need to cover operation areas, such as seaports, is at the forefront of discussion, especially regarding network capacity provisioning. Radio network planning typically involves determining the number of fixed cells, considering link budgets and deploying them geometrically centered across targeted areas. This paper proposes a solution to determine the optimal position for a mobile cell, considering 3GPP path loss models. The optimal position for the mobile cell maximises the aggregate network capacity offered to a set of User Equipments (UEs), with gains up to 187% compared to the positioning of the mobile cell at the UEs geometrical center. The proposed solution can be used by network planners and integrated into network optimisation tools. This has the potential to reduce costs associated with the Radio Access Network (RAN) planning by enhancing flexibility for on-demand deployments.</description>

      <title>AI-Native Multi-Access Future Networks -- The REASON Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of the sixth generation of communication networks (6G) has been gaining momentum over the past years, with a target of being introduced by 2030. Several initiatives worldwide are developing innovative solutions and setting the direction for the key features of these networks. Some common emerging themes are the tight integration of AI, the convergence of multiple access technologies and sustainable operation, aiming to meet stringent performance and societal requirements. To that end, we are introducing REASON - Realising Enabling Architectures and Solutions for Open Networks. The REASON project aims to address technical challenges in future network deployments, such as E2E service orchestration, sustainability, security and trust management, and policy management, utilising AI-native principles, considering multiple access technologies and cloud-native solutions.
  This paper presents REASON's architecture and the identified requirements for future networks. The architecture is meticulously designed for modularity, interoperability, scalability, simplified troubleshooting, flexibility, and enhanced security, taking into consideration current and future standardisation efforts, and the ease of implementation and training. It is structured into four horizontal layers: Physical Infrastructure, Network Service, Knowledge, and End-User Application, complemented by two vertical layers: Management and Orchestration, and E2E Security. This layered approach ensures a robust, adaptable framework to support the diverse and evolving requirements of 6G networks, fostering innovation and facilitating seamless integration of advanced technologies.</description>

      <title>Implementing an Optimized and Secured Multimedia Streaming Protocol in a Participatory Sensing Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimedia streaming protocols are becoming increasingly popular in Crowdsensing due to their ability to deliver high-quality video content over the internet in real-time. Streaming multimedia content, as in the context of live video streaming, requires high bandwidth and large storage capacity to ensure a sufficient throughput. Crowdsensing can distribute information about shared video contents among multiple users in network, reducing storage capacity and computational and bandwidth requirements. However, Crowdsensing introduces several security constraints that must be taken into account to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data. In the specific case of video streaming, commonly named as visual crowdsensing (VCS) within this context, data is transmitted over wireless networks, making it vulnerable to security breaches and susceptible to eavesdropping and interception by attackers. Multimedias often contains sensitive user data and may be subject to various privacy laws, including data protection laws and laws related to photography and video recording, based on local GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). For this reason the realization of a secure protocol optimized for a distributed data streaming in real-time becomes increasingly important in crowdsensing and smart-enviroment context. In this article, we will discuss the use of a symmetric AES-CTR encryption based protocol for securing data streaming over a crowd-sensed network.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Review of Echo Chamber Research: Comparative Analysis of Conceptualizations, Operationalizations, and Varying Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This systematic review synthesizes current research on echo chambers and filter bubbles to highlight the reasons for the dissent in echo chamber research on the existence, antecedents, and effects of the phenomenon. The review of 112 studies reveals that the lack of consensus in echo chamber research is based on different conceptualizations and operationalizations of echo chambers. While studies that have conceptualized echo chambers with homophily and utilized data-driven computational social science (CSS) methods have confirmed the echo chamber hypothesis and polarization effects in social media, content exposure studies and surveys that have explored the full spectrum of media exposure have rejected it.
  Most of these studies have been conducted in the United States, and the review emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive understanding of how echo chambers work in systems with more than two parties and outside the Global North. To advance our understanding of this phenomenon, future research should prioritize conducting more cross-platform studies, considering algorithmic filtering changes through continuous auditing, and examining the causal direction of the association between polarization, fragmentation, and the establishment of online echo chambers. The review also provides the advantages and disadvantages of different operationalizations and makes recommendations for studies in the European Union (EU), which will become possible with the upcoming Digital Services Act (DSA). Overall, this systematic review contributes to the ongoing scholarly discussion on the existence, antecedents, and effects of echo chambers and filter bubbles.</description>

      <title>ReDAN: An Empirical Study on Remote DoS Attacks against NAT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21984v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on remote DoS attacks targeting NAT networks. We show that Internet attackers operating outside local NAT networks can remotely identify a NAT device and subsequently terminate TCP connections initiated from the identified NAT device to external servers. Our attack involves two steps. First, we identify NAT devices on the Internet by exploiting inadequacies in the PMTUD mechanism within NAT specifications. This deficiency creates a fundamental side channel that allows Internet attackers to distinguish if a public IPv4 address serves a NAT device or a separate IP host, aiding in the identification of target NAT devices. Second, we launch a remote DoS attack to terminate TCP connections on the identified NAT devices. While recent NAT implementations may include protective measures, such as packet legitimacy validation to prevent malicious manipulations on NAT mappings, we discover that these safeguards are not widely adopted in real world. Consequently, attackers can send crafted packets to deceive NAT devices into erroneously removing innocent TCP connection mappings, thereby disrupting the NATed clients to access remote TCP servers. Our experimental results reveal widespread security vulnerabilities in existing NAT devices. After testing 8 types of router firmware and 30 commercial NAT devices from 14 vendors, we identify vulnerabilities in 6 firmware types and 29 NAT devices. Moreover, our measurements reveal a stark reality: 166 out of 180 (over 92%) tested real-world NAT networks, comprising 90 4G LTE/5G networks, 60 public Wi-Fi networks, and 30 cloud VPS networks, are susceptible to exploitation. We responsibly disclosed the vulnerabilities to affected vendors and received a significant number of acknowledgments. Finally, we propose our countermeasures against the identified DoS attack.</description>
