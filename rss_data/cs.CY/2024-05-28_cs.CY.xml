      <title>Modes of Analyzing Disinformation Narratives With AI/ML/Text Mining to Assist in Mitigating the Weaponization of Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper highlights the developing need for quantitative modes for capturing and monitoring malicious communication in social media. There has been a deliberate "weaponization" of messaging through the use of social networks including by politically oriented entities both state sponsored and privately run. The article identifies a use of AI/ML characterization of generalized "mal-info," a broad term which includes deliberate malicious narratives similar with hate speech, which adversely impact society. A key point of the discussion is that this mal-info will dramatically increase in volume, and it will become essential for sharable quantifying tools to provide support for human expert intervention. Despite attempts to introduce moderation on major platforms like Facebook and X/Twitter, there are now established alternative social networks that offer completely unmoderated spaces. The paper presents an introduction to these platforms and the initial results of a qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of characteristic mal-info posts. The authors perform a rudimentary text mining function for a preliminary characterization in order to evaluate the modes for better-automated monitoring. The action examines several inflammatory terms using text analysis and, importantly, discusses the use of generative algorithms by one political agent in particular, providing some examples of the potential risks to society. This latter is of grave concern, and monitoring tools must be established. This paper presents a preliminary step to selecting relevant sources and to setting a foundation for characterizing the mal-info, which must be monitored. The AI/ML methods provide a means for semi-quantitative signature capture. The impending use of "mal-GenAI" is presented.</description>

      <title>Ethics Pathways: A Design Activity for Reflecting on Ethics Engagement in HCI Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Ethics Pathways, a design activity aimed at understanding HCI and design researchers' ethics engagements and flows during their research process. Despite a strong ethical commitment in these fields, challenges persist in grasping the complexity of researchers' engagement with ethics -- practices conducted to operationalize ethics -- in situated institutional contexts. Ethics Pathways, developed through six playtesting sessions, offers a design approach to understanding the complexities of researchers' past ethics engagements in their work. This activity involves four main tasks: recalling ethical incidents; describing stakeholders involved in the situation; recounting their actions or speculative alternatives; and reflection and emotion walk-through. The paper reflects on the role of design decisions and facilitation strategies in achieving these goals. The design activity contributes to the discourse on ethical HCI research by conceptualizing ethics engagement as a part of ongoing research processing, highlighting connections between individual affective experiences, social interactions across power differences, and institutional goals.</description>

      <title>Addressing Discretization-Induced Bias in Demographic Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Racial and other demographic imputation is necessary for many applications, especially in auditing disparities and outreach targeting in political campaigns. The canonical approach is to construct continuous predictions -- e.g., based on name and geography -- and then to $\textit{discretize}$ the predictions by selecting the most likely class (argmax). We study how this practice produces $\textit{discretization bias}$. In particular, we show that argmax labeling, as used by a prominent commercial voter file vendor to impute race/ethnicity, results in a substantial under-count of African-American voters, e.g., by 28.2% points in North Carolina. This bias can have substantial implications in downstream tasks that use such labels.
  We then introduce a $\textit{joint optimization}$ approach -- and a tractable $\textit{data-driven thresholding}$ heuristic -- that can eliminate this bias, with negligible individual-level accuracy loss. Finally, we theoretically analyze discretization bias, show that calibrated continuous models are insufficient to eliminate it, and that an approach such as ours is necessary. Broadly, we warn researchers and practitioners against discretizing continuous demographic predictions without considering downstream consequences.</description>

      <title>Is Cambodia the World's Largest Cashew Producer?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cambodia's agricultural landscape is rapidly transforming, particularly in the cashew sector. Despite the country's rapid emergence and ambition to become the largest cashew producer, comprehensive data on plantation areas and the environmental impacts of this expansion are lacking. This study addresses the gap in detailed land use data for cashew plantations in Cambodia and assesses the implications of agricultural advancements. We collected over 80,000 training polygons across Cambodia to train a convolutional neural network using high-resolution optical and SAR satellite data for precise cashew plantation mapping. Our findings indicate that Cambodia ranks among the top five in terms of cultivated area and the top three in global cashew production, driven by high yields. Significant cultivated areas are located in Kampong Thom, Kratie, and Ratanak Kiri provinces. Balancing rapid agricultural expansion with environmental stewardship, particularly forest conservation, is crucial. Cambodia's cashew production is poised for further growth, driven by high-yielding trees and premium nuts. However, sustainable expansion requires integrating agricultural practices with economic and environmental strategies to enhance local value and protect forested areas. Advanced mapping technologies offer comprehensive tools to support these objectives and ensure the sustainable development of Cambodia's cashew industry.</description>

      <title>The Impact and Opportunities of Generative AI in Fact-Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI appears poised to transform white collar professions, with more than 90% of Fortune 500 companies using OpenAI's flagship GPT models, which have been characterized as "general purpose technologies" capable of effecting epochal changes in the economy. But how will such technologies impact organizations whose job is to verify and report factual information, and to ensure the health of the information ecosystem? To investigate this question, we conducted 30 interviews with N=38 participants working at 29 fact-checking organizations across six continents, asking about how they use generative AI and the opportunities and challenges they see in the technology. We found that uses of generative AI envisioned by fact-checkers differ based on organizational infrastructure, with applications for quality assurance in Editing, for trend analysis in Investigation, and for information literacy in Advocacy. We used the TOE framework to describe participant concerns ranging from the Technological (lack of transparency), to the Organizational (resource constraints), to the Environmental (uncertain and evolving policy). Building on the insights of our participants, we describe value tensions between fact-checking and generative AI, and propose a novel Verification dimension to the design space of generative models for information verification work. Finally, we outline an agenda for fairness, accountability, and transparency research to support the responsible use of generative AI in fact-checking. Throughout, we highlight the importance of human infrastructure and labor in producing verified information in collaboration with AI. We expect that this work will inform not only the scientific literature on fact-checking, but also contribute to understanding of organizational adaptation to a powerful but unreliable new technology.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Heterogeneous Knowledge Concept Embedding for Cognitive Diagnosis on Untested Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cognitive diagnosis is a fundamental and critical task in learning assessment, which aims to infer students' proficiency on knowledge concepts from their response logs. Current works assume each knowledge concept will certainly be tested and covered by multiple exercises. However, whether online or offline courses, it's hardly feasible to completely cover all knowledge concepts in several exercises. Restricted tests lead to undiscovered knowledge deficits, especially untested knowledge concepts(UKCs). In this paper, we propose a novel \underline{Dis}entangling Heterogeneous \underline{K}nowledge \underline{C}ognitive \underline{D}iagnosis framework on untested knowledge(DisKCD). Specifically, we leverage course grades, exercise questions, and resources to learn the potential representations of students, exercises, and knowledge concepts. In particular, knowledge concepts are disentangled into tested and untested based on the limiting actual exercises. We construct a heterogeneous relation graph network via students, exercises, tested knowledge concepts(TKCs), and UKCs. Then, through a hierarchical heterogeneous message-passing mechanism, the fine-grained relations are incorporated into the embeddings of the entities. Finally, the embeddings will be applied to multiple existing cognitive diagnosis models to infer students' proficiency on UKCs. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that the proposed model can effectively improve the performance of the task of diagnosing students' proficiency on UKCs.

      <title>LDPKiT: Recovering Utility in LDP Schemes by Training with Noise^2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adoption of large cloud-based models for inference has been hampered by concerns about the privacy leakage of end-user data. One method to mitigate this leakage is to add local differentially private noise to queries before sending them to the cloud, but this degrades utility as a side effect. Our key insight is that knowledge available in the noisy labels returned from performing inference on noisy inputs can be aggregated and used to recover the correct labels. We implement this insight in LDPKiT, which stands for Local Differentially-Private and Utility-Preserving Inference via Knowledge Transfer. LDPKiT uses the noisy labels returned from querying a set of noised inputs to train a local model (noise^2), which is then used to perform inference on the original set of inputs. Our experiments on CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST, SVHN, and CARER NLP datasets demonstrate that LDPKiT can improve utility without compromising privacy. For instance, on CIFAR-10, compared to a standard $\epsilon$-LDP scheme with $\epsilon=15$, which provides a weak privacy guarantee, LDPKiT can achieve nearly the same accuracy (within 1% drop) with $\epsilon=7$, offering an enhanced privacy guarantee. Moreover, the benefits of using LDPKiT increase at higher, more privacy-protective noise levels. For Fashion-MNIST and CARER, LDPKiT's accuracy on the sensitive dataset with $\epsilon=7$ not only exceeds the average accuracy of the standard $\epsilon$-LDP scheme with $\epsilon=7$ by roughly 20% and 9% but also outperforms the standard $\epsilon$-LDP scheme with $\epsilon=15$, a scenario with less noise and minimal privacy protection. We also perform Zest distance measurements to demonstrate that the type of distillation performed by LDPKiT is different from a model extraction attack.</description>

      <title>Development of a Virtual Reality Application for Oculomotor Examination Education Based on Student-Centered Pedagogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work-in-progress paper discusses the use of student-centered pedagogy to teach clinical oculomotor examination via Virtual Reality (VR). Traditional methods, such as PowerPoint slides and lab activities, are often insufficient for providing hands-on experience due to the high cost of clinical equipment. To address this, a VR-based application was developed using Unity and the HTC Vive Pro headset, offering a cost-effective solution for practical learning. The VR app allows students to engage in oculomotor examinations at their own pace, accommodating diverse backgrounds and learning preferences. This application enables students to collect and analyze data, providing a realistic simulation of clinical practice. The user study results from Doctor of Physical Therapy students indicate a high preference for the flexibility offered by the VR app, suggesting its potential as a valuable educational tool. Additionally, the paper explores the broader implications of using VR in engineering and computing education, highlighting the benefits of immersive, interactive learning environments.</description>

      <title>CPsyCoun: A Report-based Multi-turn Dialogue Reconstruction and Evaluation Framework for Chinese Psychological Counseling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using large language models (LLMs) to assist psychological counseling is a significant but challenging task at present. Attempts have been made on improving empathetic conversations or acting as effective assistants in the treatment with LLMs. However, the existing datasets lack consulting knowledge, resulting in LLMs lacking professional consulting competence. Moreover, how to automatically evaluate multi-turn dialogues within the counseling process remains an understudied area. To bridge the gap, we propose CPsyCoun, a report-based multi-turn dialogue reconstruction and evaluation framework for Chinese psychological counseling. To fully exploit psychological counseling reports, a two-phase approach is devised to construct high-quality dialogues while a comprehensive evaluation benchmark is developed for the effective automatic evaluation of multi-turn psychological consultations. Competitive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in psychological counseling. We open-source the datasets and model for future research at https://github.com/CAS-SIAT-XinHai/CPsyCoun</description>

      <title>Past, Present, and Future of Citation Practices in HCI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Science is a complex system comprised of many scientists who individually make collective decisions that, due to the size and nature of the academic system, largely do not affect the system as a whole. However, certain decisions at the meso-level of research communities, such as the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community, may result in deep and long-lasting behavioral changes in scientists. In this article, we provide evidence on how a change in editorial policies introduced at the ACM CHI Conference in 2016 launched the CHI community on an expansive path, denoted by a year-by-year increase in the mean number of references included in CHI articles. If this near-linear trend continues undisrupted, an article in CHI 2030 will include on average almost 130 references. Our meta-research provides insights into how the nature and meaning of citation practices in HCI have changed, influenced by factors such as digital accessibility of resources and academic pressures. The observed trend towards more citations reflects a citation culture where quantity is prioritized over quality, contributing to both author and peer reviewer fatigue. This article underscores the value of meta-research for research communities and the profound impact that meso-level policy adjustments have on the evolution of scientific fields and disciplines, urging stakeholders to carefully consider the broader implications of such changes.</description>

      <title>Mamba4KT:An Efficient and Effective Mamba-based Knowledge Tracing Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge tracing (KT) enhances student learning by leveraging past performance to predict future performance. Current research utilizes models based on attention mechanisms and recurrent neural network structures to capture long-term dependencies and correlations between exercises, aiming to improve model accuracy. Due to the growing amount of data in smart education scenarios, this poses a challenge in terms of time and space consumption for knowledge tracing models. However, existing research often overlooks the efficiency of model training and inference and the constraints of training resources. Recognizing the significance of prioritizing model efficiency and resource usage in knowledge tracing, we introduce Mamba4KT. This novel model is the first to explore enhanced efficiency and resource utilization in knowledge tracing. We also examine the interpretability of the Mamba structure both sequence-level and exercise-level to enhance model interpretability. Experimental findings across three public datasets demonstrate that Mamba4KT achieves comparable prediction accuracy to state-of-the-art models while significantly improving training and inference efficiency and resource utilization. As educational data continues to grow, our work suggests a promising research direction for knowledge tracing that improves model prediction accuracy, model efficiency, resource utilization, and interpretability simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Let Silence Speak: Enhancing Fake News Detection with Generated Comments from Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fake news detection plays a crucial role in protecting social media users and maintaining a healthy news ecosystem. Among existing works, comment-based fake news detection methods are empirically shown as promising because comments could reflect users' opinions, stances, and emotions and deepen models' understanding of fake news. Unfortunately, due to exposure bias and users' different willingness to comment, it is not easy to obtain diverse comments in reality, especially for early detection scenarios. Without obtaining the comments from the ``silent'' users, the perceived opinions may be incomplete, subsequently affecting news veracity judgment. In this paper, we explore the possibility of finding an alternative source of comments to guarantee the availability of diverse comments, especially those from silent users. Specifically, we propose to adopt large language models (LLMs) as a user simulator and comment generator, and design GenFEND, a generated feedback-enhanced detection framework, which generates comments by prompting LLMs with diverse user profiles and aggregating generated comments from multiple subpopulation groups. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GenFEND and further analysis shows that the generated comments cover more diverse users and could even be more effective than actual comments.</description>

      <title>Predicting Likely-Vulnerable Code Changes: Machine Learning-based Vulnerability Protections for Android Open Source Project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a framework that selectively triggers security reviews for incoming source code changes. Functioning as a review bot within a code review service, the framework can automatically request additional security reviews at pre-submit time before the code changes are submitted to a source code repository. Because performing such secure code reviews add cost, the framework employs a classifier trained to identify code changes with a high likelihood of vulnerabilities. The online classifier leverages various types of input features to analyze the review patterns, track the software engineering process, and mine specific text patterns within given code changes. The classifier and its features are meticulously chosen and optimized using data from the submitted code changes and reported vulnerabilities in Android Open Source Project (AOSP). The evaluation results demonstrate that our Vulnerability Prevention (VP) framework identifies approximately 80% of the vulnerability-inducing code changes in the dataset with a precision ratio of around 98% and a false positive rate of around 1.7%. We discuss the implications of deploying the VP framework in multi-project settings and future directions for Android security research. This paper explores and validates our approach to code change-granularity vulnerability prediction, offering a preventive technique for software security by preemptively detecting vulnerable code changes before submission.</description>

Abstract: Facial Recognition is a technique, based on machine learning technology that can recognize a human being analyzing his facial profile, and is applied in solving various types of realworld problems nowadays. In this paper, a common real-world problem, finding a missing person has been solved in a secure and effective way with the help of facial recognition technology. Although there exist a few works on solving the problem, the proposed work is unique with respect to its security, design, and feasibility. Impeding intruders in participating in the processes and giving importance to both finders and family members of a missing person are two of the major features of this work. The proofs of the works of our system in finding a missing person have been described in the result section of the paper. The advantages that our system provides over the other existing systems can be realized from the comparisons, described in the result summary section of the paper. The work is capable of providing a worthy solution to find a missing person on the digital platform.</description>

      <title>Laboratory-Scale AI: Open-Weight Models are Competitive with ChatGPT Even in Low-Resource Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of generative AI has raised questions about the competitiveness of lower-parameter, locally tunable, open-weight models relative to high-parameter, API-guarded, closed-weight models in terms of performance, domain adaptation, cost, and generalization. Centering under-resourced yet risk-intolerant settings in government, research, and healthcare, we see for-profit closed-weight models as incompatible with requirements for transparency, privacy, adaptability, and standards of evidence. Yet the performance penalty in using open-weight models, especially in low-data and low-resource settings, is unclear.
  We assess the feasibility of using smaller, open-weight models to replace GPT-4-Turbo in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned regimes, assuming access to only a single, low-cost GPU. We assess value-sensitive issues around bias, privacy, and abstention on three additional tasks relevant to those topics. We find that with relatively low effort, very low absolute monetary cost, and relatively little data for fine-tuning, small open-weight models can achieve competitive performance in domain-adapted tasks without sacrificing generality. We then run experiments considering practical issues in bias, privacy, and hallucination risk, finding that open models offer several benefits over closed models. We intend this work as a case study in understanding the opportunity cost of reproducibility and transparency over for-profit state-of-the-art zero shot performance, finding this cost to be marginal under realistic settings.</description>

      <title>Stop! In the Name of Flaws: Disentangling Personal Names and Sociodemographic Attributes in NLP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personal names simultaneously differentiate individuals and categorize them in ways that are important in a given society. While the natural language processing community has thus associated personal names with sociodemographic characteristics in a variety of tasks, researchers have engaged to varying degrees with the established methodological problems in doing so. To guide future work, we present an interdisciplinary background on names and naming. We then survey the issues inherent to associating names with sociodemographic attributes, covering problems of validity (e.g., systematic error, construct validity), as well as ethical concerns (e.g., harms, differential impact, cultural insensitivity). Finally, we provide guiding questions along with normative recommendations to avoid validity and ethical pitfalls when dealing with names and sociodemographic characteristics in natural language processing.</description>

      <title>The Peripatetic Hater: Predicting Movement Among Hate Subreddits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many online hate groups exist to disparage others based on race, gender identity, sex, or other characteristics. The accessibility of these communities allows users to join multiple types of hate groups (e.g., a racist community and misogynistic community), which calls into question whether these peripatetic users could be further radicalized compared to users that stay in one type of hate group. However, little is known about the dynamics of joining multiple types of hate groups, nor the effect of these groups on peripatetic users. In this paper, we develop a new method to classify hate subreddits, and the identities they disparage, which we use to better understand how users become peripatetic (join different types of hate subreddits). The hate classification technique utilizes human-validated LLMs to extract the protected identities attacked, if any, across 168 subreddits. We then cluster identity-attacking subreddits to discover three broad categories of hate: racist, anti-LGBTQ, and misogynistic. We show that becoming active in a user's first hate subreddit can cause them to become active in additional hate subreddits of a different category. We also find that users who join additional hate subreddits, especially of a different category, become more active in hate subreddits as a whole and develop a wider hate group lexicon. We are therefore motivated to train an AI model that we find usefully predicts the hate categories users will become active in based on post text read and written. The accuracy of this model may be partly driven by peripatetic users often using the language of hate subreddits they eventually join. Overall, these results highlight the unique risks associated with hate communities on a social media platform, as discussion of alternative targets of hate may lead users to target more protected identities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1811.09539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning is becoming an ever present part in our lives as many decisions, e.g. to lend a credit, are no longer made by humans but by machine learning algorithms. However those decisions are often unfair and discriminating individuals belonging to protected groups based on race or gender. With the recent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) coming into effect, new awareness has been raised for such issues and with computer scientists having such a large impact on peoples lives it is necessary that actions are taken to discover and prevent discrimination. This work aims to give an introduction into discrimination, legislative foundations to counter it and strategies to detect and prevent machine learning algorithms from showing such behavior.</description>

      <title>Decoding Social Sentiment in DAO: A Comparative Analysis of Blockchain Governance Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14676v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blockchain technology is leading a revolutionary transformation across diverse industries, with effective governance being critical for the success and sustainability of blockchain projects. Community forums, pivotal in engaging decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), significantly impact blockchain governance decisions. Concurrently, Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly sentiment analysis, provides powerful insights from textual data. While prior research has explored the potential of NLP tools in social media sentiment analysis, there is a gap in understanding the sentiment landscape of blockchain governance communities. The evolving discourse and sentiment dynamics on the forums of top DAOs remain largely unknown. This paper delves deep into the evolving discourse and sentiment dynamics on the public forums of leading DeFi projects: Aave, Uniswap, Curve DAO, Yearn.finance, Merit Circle, and Balancer, focusing primarily on discussions related to governance issues. Our study shows that participants in decentralized communities generally express positive sentiments during Discord discussions. Furthermore, there is a potential interaction between discussion intensity and sentiment dynamics; higher discussion volume may contribute to a more stable sentiment from code analysis. The insights gained from this study are valuable for decision-makers in blockchain governance, underscoring the pivotal role of sentiment analysis in interpreting community emotions and its evolving impact on the landscape of blockchain governance. This research significantly contributes to the interdisciplinary exploration of the intersection of blockchain and society, specifically emphasizing the decentralized blockchain governance ecosystem. We provide our data and code for replicability as open access on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Distributed agency in second language learning and teaching through generative AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20216v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative AI offers significant opportunities for language learning. Tools like ChatGPT can provide informal second language practice through chats in written or voice forms, with the learner specifying through prompts conversational parameters such as proficiency level, language register, and discussion topics. AI can be instructed to give corrective feedback, create practice exercises, or develop an extended study plan. Instructors can use AI to build learning and assessment materials in a variety of media. AI is likely to make immersive technologies more powerful and versatile, moving away from scripted interactions. For both learners and teachers, it is important to understand the limitations of AI systems that arise from their purely statistical model of human language, which limits their ability to deal with nuanced social and cultural aspects of language use. Additionally, there are ethical concerns over how AI systems are created as well as practical constraints in their use, especially for less privileged populations. The power and versatility of AI tools are likely to turn them into valuable and constant companions in many peoples lives (akin to smartphones), creating a close connection that goes beyond simple tool use. Ecological theories such as sociomaterialism are helpful in examining the shared agency that develops through close user-AI interactions, as are the perspectives on human-object relations from Indigenous cultures.</description>

      <title>Beyond static AI evaluations: advancing human interaction evaluations for LLM harms and risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model evaluations are central to understanding the safety, risks, and societal impacts of AI systems. While most real-world AI applications involve human-AI interaction, most current evaluations (e.g., common benchmarks) of AI models do not. Instead, they incorporate human factors in limited ways, assessing the safety of models in isolation, thereby falling short of capturing the complexity of human-model interactions. In this paper, we discuss and operationalize a definition of an emerging category of evaluations -- "human interaction evaluations" (HIEs) -- which focus on the assessment of human-model interactions or the process and the outcomes of humans using models. First, we argue that HIEs can be used to increase the validity of safety evaluations, assess direct human impact and interaction-specific harms, and guide future assessments of models' societal impact. Second, we propose a safety-focused HIE design framework -- containing a human-LLM interaction taxonomy -- with three stages: (1) identifying the risk or harm area, (2) characterizing the use context, and (3) choosing the evaluation parameters. Third, we apply our framework to two potential evaluations for overreliance and persuasion risks. Finally, we conclude with tangible recommendations for addressing concerns over costs, replicability, and unrepresentativeness of HIEs.</description>

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into military capabilities has become a norm for major military power across the globe. Understanding how these AI models operate is essential for maintaining strategic advantages and ensuring security. This paper demonstrates an open-source methodology for analyzing military AI models through a detailed examination of the Zhousidun dataset, a Chinese-originated dataset that exhaustively labels critical components on American and Allied destroyers. By demonstrating the replication of a state-of-the-art computer vision model on this dataset, we illustrate how open-source tools can be leveraged to assess and understand key military AI capabilities. This methodology offers a robust framework for evaluating the performance and potential of AI-enabled military capabilities, thus enhancing the accuracy and reliability of strategic assessments.</description>

      <title>Learning Personalized Decision Support Policies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Individual human decision-makers may benefit from different forms of support to improve decision outcomes, but when each form of support will yield better outcomes? In this work, we posit that personalizing access to decision support tools can be an effective mechanism for instantiating the appropriate use of AI assistance. Specifically, we propose the general problem of learning a decision support policy that, for a given input, chooses which form of support to provide to decision-makers for whom we initially have no prior information. We develop $\texttt{Modiste}$, an interactive tool to learn personalized decision support policies. $\texttt{Modiste}$ leverages stochastic contextual bandit techniques to personalize a decision support policy for each decision-maker and supports extensions to the multi-objective setting to account for auxiliary objectives like the cost of support. We find that personalized policies outperform offline policies, and, in the cost-aware setting, reduce the incurred cost with minimal degradation to performance. Our experiments include various realistic forms of support (e.g., expert consensus and predictions from a large language model) on vision and language tasks. Our human subject experiments validate our computational experiments, demonstrating that personalization can yield benefits in practice for real users, who interact with $\texttt{Modiste}$.</description>

      <title>Towards Weakly-Supervised Hate Speech Classification Across Datasets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As pointed out by several scholars, current research on hate speech (HS) recognition is characterized by unsystematic data creation strategies and diverging annotation schemata. Subsequently, supervised-learning models tend to generalize poorly to datasets they were not trained on, and the performance of the models trained on datasets labeled using different HS taxonomies cannot be compared. To ease this problem, we propose applying extremely weak supervision that only relies on the class name rather than on class samples from the annotated data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of a state-of-the-art weakly-supervised text classification model in various in-dataset and cross-dataset settings. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth quantitative and qualitative analysis of the source of poor generalizability of HS classification models.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by privacy concerns in long-term longitudinal studies in medical and social science research, we study the problem of continually releasing differentially private synthetic data from longitudinal data collections. We introduce a model where, in every time step, each individual reports a new data element, and the goal of the synthesizer is to incrementally update a synthetic dataset in a consistent way to capture a rich class of statistical properties. We give continual synthetic data generation algorithms that preserve two basic types of queries: fixed time window queries and cumulative time queries. We show nearly tight upper bounds on the error rates of these algorithms and demonstrate their empirical performance on realistically sized datasets from the U.S. Census Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10050v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Today's online platforms heavily lean on algorithmic recommendations for bolstering user engagement and driving revenue. However, these recommendations can impact multiple stakeholders simultaneously -- the platform, items (sellers), and users (customers) -- each with their unique objectives, making it difficult to find the right middle ground that accommodates all stakeholders. To address this, we introduce a novel fair recommendation framework, Problem (FAIR), that flexibly balances multi-stakeholder interests via a constrained optimization formulation. We next explore Problem (FAIR) in a dynamic online setting where data uncertainty further adds complexity, and propose a low-regret algorithm FORM that concurrently performs real-time learning and fair recommendations, two tasks that are often at odds. Via both theoretical analysis and a numerical case study on real-world data, we demonstrate the efficacy of our framework and method in maintaining platform revenue while ensuring desired levels of fairness for both items and users.</description>

      <title>Adapting Static Fairness to Sequential Decision-Making: Bias Mitigation Strategies towards Equal Long-term Benefit Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decisions made by machine learning models can have lasting impacts, making long-term fairness a critical consideration. It has been observed that ignoring the long-term effect and directly applying fairness criterion in static settings can actually worsen bias over time. To address biases in sequential decision-making, we introduce a long-term fairness concept named Equal Long-term Benefit Rate (ELBERT). This concept is seamlessly integrated into a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to consider the future effects of actions on long-term fairness, thus providing a unified framework for fair sequential decision-making problems. ELBERT effectively addresses the temporal discrimination issues found in previous long-term fairness notions. Additionally, we demonstrate that the policy gradient of Long-term Benefit Rate can be analytically simplified to standard policy gradients. This simplification makes conventional policy optimization methods viable for reducing bias, leading to our bias mitigation approach ELBERT-PO. Extensive experiments across various diverse sequential decision-making environments consistently reveal that ELBERT-PO significantly diminishes bias while maintaining high utility. Code is available at https://github.com/umd-huang-lab/ELBERT.</description>

      <title>Exploring Collaboration Mechanisms for LLM Agents: A Social Psychology View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02124v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems are increasingly employed in intricate social environments, a pressing query emerges: Can these NLP systems mirror human-esque collaborative intelligence, in a multi-agent society consisting of multiple large language models (LLMs)? This paper probes the collaboration mechanisms among contemporary NLP systems by melding practical experiments with theoretical insights. We fabricate four unique `societies' comprised of LLM agents, where each agent is characterized by a specific `trait' (easy-going or overconfident) and engages in collaboration with a distinct `thinking pattern' (debate or reflection). Through evaluating these multi-agent societies on three benchmark datasets, we discern that certain collaborative strategies not only outshine previous top-tier approaches, but also optimize efficiency (using fewer API tokens). Moreover, our results further illustrate that LLM agents manifest human-like social behaviors, such as conformity and consensus reaching, mirroring foundational social psychology theories. In conclusion, we integrate insights from social psychology to contextualize the collaboration of LLM agents, inspiring further investigations into the collaboration mechanism for LLMs. We commit to sharing our code and datasets\footnote{\url{https://github.com/zjunlp/MachineSoM}.}, hoping to catalyze further research in this promising avenue.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models used in prediction and classification tasks may display performance disparities across population groups determined by sensitive attributes (e.g., race, sex, age). We consider the problem of evaluating the performance of a fixed ML model across population groups defined by multiple sensitive attributes (e.g., race and sex and age). Here, the sample complexity for estimating the worst-case performance gap across groups (e.g., the largest difference in error rates) increases exponentially with the number of group-denoting sensitive attributes. To address this issue, we propose an approach to test for performance disparities based on Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). By allowing a small probabilistic slack on the groups over which a model has approximately equal performance, we show that the sample complexity required for discovering performance violations is reduced exponentially to be at most upper bounded by the square root of the number of groups. As a byproduct of our analysis, when the groups are weighted by a specific prior distribution, we show that R\'enyi entropy of order 2/3 of the prior distribution captures the sample complexity of the proposed CVaR test algorithm. Finally, we also show that there exists a non-i.i.d. data collection strategy that results in a sample complexity independent of the number of groups.</description>

      <title>GPT-HateCheck: Can LLMs Write Better Functional Tests for Hate Speech Detection?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online hate detection suffers from biases incurred in data sampling, annotation, and model pre-training. Therefore, measuring the averaged performance over all examples in held-out test data is inadequate. Instead, we must identify specific model weaknesses and be informed when it is more likely to fail. A recent proposal in this direction is HateCheck, a suite for testing fine-grained model functionalities on synthesized data generated using templates of the kind "You are just a [slur] to me." However, despite enabling more detailed diagnostic insights, the HateCheck test cases are often generic and have simplistic sentence structures that do not match the real-world data. To address this limitation, we propose GPT-HateCheck, a framework to generate more diverse and realistic functional tests from scratch by instructing large language models (LLMs). We employ an additional natural language inference (NLI) model to verify the generations. Crowd-sourced annotation demonstrates that the generated test cases are of high quality. Using the new functional tests, we can uncover model weaknesses that would be overlooked using the original HateCheck dataset.</description>

      <title>Prejudice and Volatility: A Statistical Framework for Measuring Social Discrimination in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15481v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates why and how inconsistency in the generation of Large Language Models (LLMs) might induce or exacerbate societal injustice. For instance, LLMs frequently exhibit contrasting gender stereotypes regarding the same career depending on varied contexts, highlighting the arguably harmful unpredictability of LLMs' behavioral patterns. To augment the existing discrimination assessment with the capability to account for variation in LLM generation, we formulate the Prejudice-Volatility Framework (PVF) that precisely defines behavioral metrics for assessing LLMs, which delineate the probability distribution of LLMs' stereotypes from the perspective of token prediction probability. Specifically, we employ a data-mining approach to approximate the possible applied contexts of LLMs and devise statistical metrics to evaluate the corresponding contextualized societal discrimination risk. Further, we mathematically dissect the aggregated discrimination risk of LLMs into prejudice risk, originating from their system bias, and volatility risk, stemming from their generation inconsistency. While initially intended for assessing discrimination in LLMs, our proposed PVF facilitates the comprehensive and flexible measurement of any inductive biases, including knowledge alongside prejudice, across various modality models.
  We apply PVF to 12 most commonly adopted LLMs and compare their risk levels. Our findings reveal that: i) prejudice risk is the primary cause of discrimination risk in LLMs, indicating that inherent biases in these models lead to stereotypical outputs; ii) most LLMs exhibit significant pro-male stereotypes across nearly all careers; iii) alignment with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback lowers discrimination by reducing prejudice, but increases volatility; iv) discrimination risk in LLMs correlates with socio-economic factors like profession salaries.</description>

      <title>Fair Recommendations with Limited Sensitive Attributes: A Distributionally Robust Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As recommender systems are indispensable in various domains such as job searching and e-commerce, providing equitable recommendations to users with different sensitive attributes becomes an imperative requirement. Prior approaches for enhancing fairness in recommender systems presume the availability of all sensitive attributes, which can be difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns or inadequate means of capturing these attributes. In practice, the efficacy of these approaches is limited, pushing us to investigate ways of promoting fairness with limited sensitive attribute information.
  Toward this goal, it is important to reconstruct missing sensitive attributes. Nevertheless, reconstruction errors are inevitable due to the complexity of real-world sensitive attribute reconstruction problems and legal regulations. Thus, we pursue fair learning methods that are robust to reconstruction errors. To this end, we propose Distributionally Robust Fair Optimization (DRFO), which minimizes the worst-case unfairness over all potential probability distributions of missing sensitive attributes instead of the reconstructed one to account for the impact of the reconstruction errors. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence to demonstrate that our method can effectively ensure fairness in recommender systems when only limited sensitive attributes are accessible.</description>

      <title>Explainable Few-shot Knowledge Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge tracing (KT), aiming to mine students' mastery of knowledge by their exercise records and predict their performance on future test questions, is a critical task in educational assessment. While researchers achieved tremendous success with the rapid development of deep learning techniques, current knowledge tracing tasks fall into the cracks from real-world teaching scenarios. Relying heavily on extensive student data and solely predicting numerical performances differs from the settings where teachers assess students' knowledge state from limited practices and provide explanatory feedback. To fill this gap, we explore a new task formulation: Explainable Few-shot Knowledge Tracing. By leveraging the powerful reasoning and generation abilities of large language models (LLMs), we then propose a cognition-guided framework that can track the student knowledge from a few student records while providing natural language explanations. Experimental results from three widely used datasets show that LLMs can perform comparable or superior to competitive deep knowledge tracing methods. We also discuss potential directions and call for future improvements in relevant topics.</description>

      <title>Subtle Biases Need Subtler Measures: Dual Metrics for Evaluating Representative and Affinity Bias in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research on Large Language Models (LLMs) has often neglected subtle biases that, although less apparent, can significantly influence the models' outputs toward particular social narratives. This study addresses two such biases within LLMs: representative bias, which denotes a tendency of LLMs to generate outputs that mirror the experiences of certain identity groups, and affinity bias, reflecting the models' evaluative preferences for specific narratives or viewpoints. We introduce two novel metrics to measure these biases: the Representative Bias Score (RBS) and the Affinity Bias Score (ABS), and present the Creativity-Oriented Generation Suite (CoGS), a collection of open-ended tasks such as short story writing and poetry composition, designed with customized rubrics to detect these subtle biases. Our analysis uncovers marked representative biases in prominent LLMs, with a preference for identities associated with being white, straight, and men. Furthermore, our investigation of affinity bias reveals distinctive evaluative patterns within each model, akin to `bias fingerprints'. This trend is also seen in human evaluators, highlighting a complex interplay between human and machine bias perceptions.</description>
