      <title>LangSAT: A Novel Framework Combining NLP and Reinforcement Learning for SAT Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our work presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to optimize heuristic selection within the conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL) process, improving the efficiency of Boolean satisfia- bility (SAT) solving. The proposed system, LangSAT, bridges the gap between natural language inputs and propositional logic by converting English descriptions into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) expressions and solving them using an RL-enhanced CDCL SAT solver. Unlike existing SAT-solving platforms that require CNF as input, LangSAT enables users to input standard English descriptions, making SAT-solving more accessible. The framework comprises two key components: Lang2Logic, which translates English sentences into CNF expressions, and SmartSAT, an RL-based SAT solver. SmartSAT encodes clause-variable relationships as structured graph representations and extracts global features specific to the SAT problem. This implementation provides the RL agent with deeper contextual information, enabling SAT problems to be solved more efficiently. Lang2Logic was evaluated on diverse natural language inputs, processing descriptions up to 450 words. The generated CNFs were solved by SmartSAT, which demonstrated comparable performance to traditional CDCL heuristics with respect to solving time. The combined LangSAT framework offers a more accessible and scalable solution for SAT-solving tasks across reasoning, formal verification, and debugging.</description>

      <title>Bounded treewidth, multiple context-free grammars, and downward closures</title>

Abstract: The reachability problem in multi-pushdown automata (MPDA) has many applications in static analysis of recursive programs. An example is safety verification of multi-threaded recursive programs with shared memory. Since these problems are undecidable, the literature contains many decidable (and efficient) underapproximations of MPDA.
  A uniform framework that captures many of these underapproximations is that of bounded treewidth (tw): To each execution of the MPDA, we associate a graph; then we consider the subset of all graphs that have a wt at most $k$, for some constant $k$. In fact, bounding tw is a generic approach to obtain classes of systems with decidable reachability, even beyond MPDA underapproximations. The resulting systems are also called MSO-definable bounded-tw systems.
  While bounded tw is a powerful tool for reachability and similar types of analysis, the word languages (i.e. action sequences corresponding to executions) of these systems remain far from understood.
  For the slight restriction of bounded special tw, or "bounded-stw" (which is equivalent to bounded tw on MPDA, and even includes all bounded-tw systems studied in the literature), this work reveals a connection with multiple context-free languages (MCFL), a concept from computational linguistics. We show that the word languages of MSO-definable bounded-stw systems are exactly the MCFL.
  We exploit this connection to provide an optimal algorithm for computing downward closures (dcl) for MSO-definable bounded-stw systems. Computing dcl is a notoriously difficult task that has many applications in the verification of complex systems: As an example application, we show that in programs with dynamic spawning of MSO-definable bounded-stw processes, safety verification has the same complexity as in the case of processes with sequential recursive processes.</description>

      <title>Cobham's theorem for the Gaussian integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assuming the four exponentials conjecture, Hansel and Safer showed that if a subset $S$ of the Gaussian integers is both $\alpha=-m+i $- and $\beta=-n+i$-recognizable, then it is syndetic, and they conjectured that $S$ must be eventually periodic. Without assuming the four exponentials conjecture, we show that if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are multiplicatively independent Gaussian integers, and at least one of $\alpha$, $\beta$ is not an $n$-th root of an integer, then any $\alpha$- and $\beta$-automatic configuration is eventually periodic; in particular we prove Hansel and Safer's conjecture. Otherwise, there exist non-eventually periodic configurations which are $\alpha$-automatic for any root of an integer $\alpha$. Our work generalises the Cobham-Semenov theorem to Gaussian numerations.</description>
