      <title>Stochastic Fractional Navier-Stokes Equations: Finite-Time Blow-up for Vortex Stretch Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the first finite-time blow-up results for generalized 3D stochastic fractional Navier-Stokes equations \[ \Caputo \mathbf{u} = -(\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{u} - \nabla p + \nu \fLaplacian \mathbf{u} + I^{1-\beta}[\sigma(\mathbf{u}) \dot{W}], \quad \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0, \] with dissipation $(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}$ for $\alpha \in (1, 3/2)$, Caputo time-memory $\partial_t^\beta$, and superlinear noise $|\mathbf{u}|^{1+\gamma}$, proving that for a critical window of memory, $\beta \in (\frac{\alpha}{\alpha+3}, \beta_c(\alpha,\gamma))$, the second moment of the vorticity supremum explodes due to a vortex-stretching-driven renewal inequality. This work reveals that when a fluid's temporal memory, governed by $\partial_t^\beta$, is short enough to permit instability but long enough for that instability to mature, the relentless self-amplification from vortex stretching, when coupled with explosive stochastic kicks from the $|\mathbf{u}|^{1+\gamma}$ noise, guarantees the vorticity will spin up to infinity in finite time.</description>

      <title>Annealed almost periodic entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies certain notions of entropy that can be associated to (i) a representation of a separable, unital C*-algebra $\mathfrak{A}$ and (ii) an auxiliary random sequence $(\pi_n)_{n\ge 1}$ of finite-dimensional representations of $\mathfrak{A}$. This continues a previous research program into the properties of these entropy notions when each $\pi_n$ is deterministic, which uncovered a range of analogies with entropy in ergodic theory and also with non-commutative generalizations of Szeg\H{o}'s limit theorems.
  We associate two new notions of entropy to data as in (i) and (ii) above: `annealed' AP entropy, which is roughly a kind of first-moment average of deterministic AP entropies; and `zeroth-order' AP entropy, which controls the large deviations probabilities that certain positive definite functions appear in the representations $\pi_n$ at all.
  After developing some of this general theory, we then focus on the special case in which $\mathfrak{A}$ is the group C*-algebra of a finitely-generated free group and each $\pi_n$ is generated by choosing a tuple of $n$-by-$n$ unitary matrices independently at random from Haar measure. In that case, explicit formulas can be derived for some of our notions of entropy, and new large deviations principles in random matrix theory are obtained as a consequence.</description>

      <title>Chemical distance in graphs of polynomial growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an Antal-Pisztora type theorem for transitive graphs of polynomial growth. That is, we show that if $G$ is a transitive graph of polynomial growth and $p &gt; p_c(G)$, then for any two sites $x, y$ of $G$ which are connected by a $p$-open path, the chemical distance from $x$ to $y$ is at most a constant times the original graph distance, except with probability exponentially small in the distance from $x$ to $y$. We also prove a similar theorem for general Cayley graphs of finitely presented groups, for $p$ sufficiently close to 1. Lastly, we show that all time constants for the chemical distance on the infinite supercritical cluster of a transitive graph of polynomial growth are Lipschitz continuous as a function of $p$ away from $p_c$.</description>

      <title>Convergence Rate of the Solution of Multi-marginal Schrodinger Bridge Problem with Marginal Constraints from SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the multi-marginal Schrodinger bridge (MSB) problem whose marginal constraints are marginal distributions of a stochastic differential equation (SDE) with a constant diffusion coefficient, and with time dependent drift term. As the number $m$ of marginal constraints increases, we prove that the solution of the corresponding MSB problem converges to the law of the solution of the SDE at the rate of $O(m^{-1})$, in the sense of KL divergence. Our result extends the work of~\cite{agarwal2024iterated} to the case where the drift of the underlying stochastic process is time-dependent.</description>

      <title>Discrete reaction-diffusion system with stochastic dynamical boundary conditions: convergence results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A space discrete approximation to a highly nonlinear reaction-diffusion system endowed with a stochastic dynamical boundary condition is analyzed and the convergence of the discrete scheme to the solution to the corresponding continuum random system is established. A splitting strategy allows us to decompose the random system into a space-discrete heat equation with a stochastic boundary condition, and a nonlinear and nonlocal space-discrete differential system coupled with the first one and with deterministic initial and boundary conditions. The convergence result is obtained by first establishing some a priori estimates for both space-discrete splitted variables and then exploiting compact embedding theorems for time-space Besov spaces on the positive lattice. The convergence of a fully discrete approximation of the random system is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a convex body $C \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. Let $X$ be a random point with uniform distribution in $[0,1]^d$. Define $X_C$ as the number of lattice points in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ inside the translated body $C + X$. It is well known that $\mathbb{E} X_C = \mathrm{vol}(C)$. A natural question arises: What can be said about the distribution of $X_C$ in general? In this work, we study this question when $C$ is a polyhedron with vertices at integer points.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Chemical Reaction Networks in Stochastic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic reaction networks are mathematical models frequently used in, but not limited to, biochemistry. These models are continuous-time Markov chains whose transition rates depend on certain parameters called rate constants, which despite the name may not be constant in real-world applications. In this paper we study how random switching between different stochastic reaction networks with linear transition rates affects the stability of the process. We give matrix conditions for both positive recurrence (indeed, exponentially ergodicity) and transience (indeed, evanescence) in both the regime with high switching rates and the regime with low switching rates. We then make use of these conditions to provide examples of processes whose stability behavior changes as the switching rate varies. We also explore what happens in the middle regime where the switching rates are neither high nor low and our theorems do not apply. Specifically, we show by examples that there can be arbitrarily many phase transitions between exponentially ergodicity and evanescence as the switching rate increases.</description>

      <title>Revisit on the convergence rate of normal extremes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X_i)_{1 \le i \le n}$ be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) standard Gaussian random variables, and denote by $X_{(n)} = \max_{1 \le i \le n} X_i$ the maximum order statistic. It is well-known in extreme value theory that the linearly normalized maximum $
Y_n = a_n(X_{(n)} - b_n), $
converges weakly to the standard Gumbel distribution $\Lambda$ as $n \to \infty$, where $a_n &gt; 0$ and $b_n$ are appropriate scaling and centering constants. In this note, choosing $$a_n=\sqrt{2\log n}\quad \text{and}\quad b_n = \sqrt{2 \log n} - \frac{\log \log n + \log (4\pi)}{2 \sqrt{2 \log n}},$$ we provide the exact order of this convergence under several distances including Berry-Esseen bound, $W_1$ distance, total variation distance, Kullback-Leibler divergence and Fisher information. We also show how the orders of these convergence are influenced by the choice of
  $b_n$ and $a_n.$</description>

      <title>Positive Markov processes in Laplace duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article develops a general framework for Laplace duality between positive Markov processes in which the one-dimensional Laplace transform of one process can be represented through that of another. We show that a process admits a Laplace dual if and only if it satisfies a certain complete monotonicity condition. Moreover, we analyse how the conventions adopted for the values of $0 \cdot \infty$ and $\infty \cdot 0$ are reflected in the weak continuity/absorptivity properties of the processes in duality at the boundaries $0$ and $\infty$. A broad class of generators admitting Laplace duals is identified, and we provide sufficient conditions under which the associated martingale problems are well-posed, the solutions being in duality at the level of their semigroups. Laplace duality is shown to unify several generalizations of continuous-state branching processes, e.g. those with immigration or evolving in random environments. Along the way, a theorem originally due to Ethier and Kurtz -- connecting duality of generators to that of the associated semigroups -- is refined, and we provide a concise proof of the Courr\`ege form for the generators of positive Markov processes whose pointwise domain includes the exponential functions. The latter leads naturally to the notion of the Laplace symbol, which is a parsimonious encoding of the infinitesimal dynamics of the process.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper deals with the problem of large-time behaviour of trajectories for discrete-time dynamical systems driven by a random noise. Assuming that the phase space is finite-dimensional and compact, and the noise is a Markov process with a transition probability satisfying some regularity hypotheses, we prove that all the trajectories converge to a unique measure in the total variation metric. The proof is based on the Markovian reduction of the system in question and a result on mixing for Markov processes. Then we present an extension of this result to the case of systems driven by stationary noises.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a matrix branching random walk on the semi-group of nonnegative matrices, where we are able to derive, under general assumptions, an analogue of Biggins' martingale convergence theorem for the additive martingale $W_n$, a spinal decomposition theorem, convergence of the derivative martingale $D_n$, and finally, the Seneta-Heyde scaling stating that in the boundary case $c \sqrt{n} W_n \to D_\infty$ a.s., where $D_\infty$ is the limit of the derivative martingale and $c$ is a positive constant.
  As an important tool that is of interest in its own right, we provide explicit duality results for the renewal measure of centered Markov random walks, relating the renewal measure of the process, killed when the random walk component becomes negative, to the renewal measure of the ascending ladder process.</description>

      <title>An infinitesimal generator approach on weak convergence of regulated multi-class matching systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a regulated multi-class instantaneous matching system with reneging, in which each event requires $K \geq 2$ distinct impatient agents who wait in their respective queues. Each agent class is subject to a buffer capacity, allowing for the special case without buffers. Due to the instantaneous matching behavior, at any give time, at least one category has an empty queue. Under the Markovian assumption, the system dynamics are described by a Markov chain with innovative rate matrices that capture all possible queue configurations across all classes. To effectively circumvent the structural challenges introduced by instantaneous matching, we establish a non-trivial yet tractable diffusion approximation under heavy traffic conditions by leveraging the infinitesimal generator in conjunction with appropriate regulation and boundary conditions. This asymptotic analysis offers a direct explanation of the dynamics of the regulated coupled heavy-traffic limiting process. Furthermore, we demonstrate the connection between the diffusion-scaled limit derived from the generator approach and the one established in the literature. The latter is typically described by a regulated coupled stochastic integral equation.</description>

We prove that diffusion in velocity emerges in a suitable scaling limit of the noise, and also discuss the physical relevance of this result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a gas whose each particle is characterised by a pair $(x,v_x)$ with the position $x\in \mathbb R^d$ and the velocity $v_x\in \mathbb R^d_0= \mathbb R^d\setminus \{0\}$. We define Gibbs measures on the cone of vector-valued measures and aim to prove their existence. We introduce the family of probability measures $\mu_\lambda$ on the cone $\mathbb K(\mathbb R^d)$. We define local Hamiltonian and partition functions for a positive, symmetric, bounded and measurable pair potential. Using those above, we define Gibbs's measure as a solution to the Dobrushin-Lanford-Ruelle equation. In particular, we focus on the subset of tempered Gibbs measures. To prove the existence of the Gibbs measure, we show that the subset of tempered Gibbs measures is non-empty and relatively compact.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that geometric functionals (e.g., excursion area, boundary length) evaluated on excursion sets of sphere-cross-time long memory random fields can exhibit fractional cointegration, meaning that some of their linear combinations have shorter memory than the original vector. These results prove the existence of long-run equilibrium relationships between functionals evaluated at different threshold values; as a statistical application, we discuss a frequency-domain estimator for the Adler-Taylor metric factor, i.e., the variance of the field's gradient. Our results are illustrated also by Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a one-time single shelf shuffle by establishing the position matrix explicitly. In some cases, we prove a no-feedback optimal guessing strategy. A general no-feedback strategy is conjectured, and asymptotics for the expected reward are given. For the complete-feedback case, we give a guessing strategy, prove that it is optimal and unique, and find the expected reward. Our results prove a conjecture of Diaconis, Fulman, and Holmes in a special case.</description>

      <title>L\'evy Langevin Monte Carlo for sampling from heavy-tailed target distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the L\'evy Langevin Monte Carlo method studied by Oechsler in 2024 to the setting of a target distribution with heavy tails: Choosing a target distribution from the class of subexponential distributions we prove convergence of a solution of a stochastic differential equation to this target. Hereby, the stochastic differential equation is driven by a compound Poisson process - unlike in the case of a classical Langevin diffusion. The method allows one to sample from non-smooth targets and distributions with separated modes with exponential convergence to the invariant distribution, which in general cannot be guaranteed by the classical Langevin diffusion in presence of heavy tails. The method is promising due to the possibility of a simple implementation because of the compound Poisson noise term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega_1, \ldots, \Omega_m$ be probability spaces, let $\Omega=\Omega_1 \times \cdots \times \Omega_m$ be their product and let $A_1, \ldots, A_n \subset \Omega$ be events. Suppose that each event $A_i$ depends on $r_i$ coordinates of a point $x \in \Omega$, $x=\left(\xi_1, \ldots, \xi_m\right)$, and that for each event $A_i$ there are $\Delta_i$ of other events $A_j$ that depend on some of the coordinates that $A_i$ depends on. Let $\Delta=\max\{5,\ \Delta_i: i=1, \ldots, n\}$ and let $\mu_i=\min\{r_i,\ \Delta_i+1\}$ for $i=1, \ldots, n$. We prove that if $P(A_i) &lt; (3\Delta)^{-3\mu_i}$ for all $I$, then for any $0 &lt; \epsilon &lt; 1$, the probability $P\left( \bigcap_{i=1}^n \overline{A}_i\right)$ of the intersection of the complements of all $A_i$ can be computed within relative error $\epsilon$ in polynomial time from the probabilities $P\left(A_{i_1} \cap \ldots \cap A_{i_k}\right)$ of $k$-wise intersections of the events $A_i$ for $k = e^{O(\Delta)} \ln (n/\epsilon)$.</description>

      <title>Enhanced noise sensitivity, 2D directed polymers and Stochastic Heat Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate noise sensitivity beyond the classical setting of binary random variables, extending the celebrated result by Benjamini, Kalai, and Schramm to a wide class of functions of general random variables. Our approach yields improved bounds with optimal rates. We also consider an enhanced form of noise sensitivity which yields asymptotic independence, rather than mere decorrelation.
  We apply these result to establish enhanced noise sensitivity for the partition functions of 2D directed polymers, in the critical regime where they converge to the critical 2D Stochastic Heat Flow. As a consequence, we prove that the Stochastic Heat Flow is independent of the white noise arising from the disorder.</description>

      <title>Existence of a plane without edge crossings in projections of the random geometric graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a random geometric graph $G$ on on a convex body $W\subset \mathbb{R}^3$ with a vertex set defined by a Poisson point process with intensity $t&gt;0$. Then $G$ can be drawn on a plane $L$ by projecting all vertices onto $L$ and connecting each pair of vertices by a line segment whenever there is exists and edge between them. Rotations of the plane $L$ lead to different drawings. In this paper, we prove that the probability that there exists a plane such that there are no edge crossings in the projection tends to one if the connection radius is smaller than $\left(c^* \frac{\log t}{t^4}\right)^{1/8}$ for some $c^*&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of the zero temperature Edwards-Anderson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An Ising model with random couplings on a graph is a model of a spin glass. While the mean field case of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model is very well studied, the more realistic lattice setting, known as the Edwards-Anderson (EA) model, has witnessed rather limited progress. In (Chatterjee,'23) chaotic properties of the ground state in the EA model were established via the study of the Fourier spectrum of the two-point spin correlation. A natural direction of research concerns fractal properties of the Fourier spectrum in analogy with critical percolation. In particular, numerical findings (Bray, Moore,'87) seem to support the belief that the fractal dimension of the associated spectral sample drawn according to the Fourier spectrum is strictly bigger than one. Towards this, in this note we introduce a percolation-type argument, relying on the construction of ``barriers'', to obtain new probabilistic lower bounds on the size of the spectral sample.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the long-time behaviour of binary branching Brownian motion (BBM) where the branching rate depends on a periodic spatial heterogeneity. We prove that almost surely as $t\to\infty$, the heterogeneous BBM at time $t$, normalized by $t$, approaches a deterministic convex shape with respect to Hausdorff distance. Our approach relies on establishing tail bounds on the probability of existence of BBM particles lying in half-spaces, which in particular yields the asymptotic speed of propagation of projections of the BBM in every direction. Our arguments are primarily probabilistic in nature, but additionally exploit the existence of a "front speed" (or minimal speed of a pulsating traveling front solution) for the Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion equation naturally associated to the BBM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the scaling limit of a class of boundary random walks to Brownian-type processes on the half-line. By solving the associated martingale problem and employing weak convergence techniques, we prove that under appropriate scaling, the process converges to the general Brownian motion in the $J_1$-Skorokhod topology. The limiting process exhibits both diffusion and boundary behavior characterized by parameters $(\alpha, \beta, A, B)$, which govern the transition rates at the origin. Our results provide a discrete approximation to generalized Brownian motions with mixed boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Quantitative central limit theorems for exponential random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are nonlinear exponential tilts of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi models, under which the presence of certain subgraphs such as triangles may be emphasized. These models are mixtures of metastable wells which each behave macroscopically like new Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi models themselves, exhibiting the same laws of large numbers for the overall edge count as well as all subgraph counts. However, the microscopic fluctuations of these quantities remained elusive for some time. Building on a recent breakthrough by Fang, Liu, Shao and Zhao [FLSZ24] driven by Stein's method, we prove quantitative central limit theorems (CLTs) for these quantities and more in metastable wells under ferromagnetic ERGMs. One main novelty of our results is that they apply also in the supercritical (low temperature) regime of parameters, which has previously been relatively unexplored. To accomplish this, we develop a novel probabilistic technique based on the careful analysis of the evolution of relevant quantities under the ERGM Glauber dynamics. Our technique allows us to deliver the main input to the method developed by [FLSZ24], which is the fact that the fluctuations of subgraph counts are driven by those of the overall edge count. This was first shown for the triangle count by Sambale and Sinulis [SS20] in the Dobrushin (very high temperature) regime via functional-analytic methods. We feel our technique clarifies the underlying mechanisms at play, and it also supplies improved bounds on the Wasserstein and Kolmogorov distances between the observables at hand and the limiting Gaussians, as compared to the results of [FLSZ24] in the subcritical (high temperature) regime beyond the Dobrushin regime. Moreover, our technique is flexible enough to also yield quantitative CLTs for vertex degrees and local subgraph counts, which have not appeared before in any parameter regime.</description>

Abstract: We study a class of nonlinear Ginzburg-Landau SPDEs in infinite-volume. We show that under a weakly asymmetric scaling, their solutions converge to that of the KPZ equation. The key technical innovation is the analysis of a stochastic heat kernel for the SPDE of interest, which allows for a multi-scale "localization" to the compact setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a problem in parametric estimation: given $n$ samples from an unknown distribution, we want to estimate which distribution, from a given one-parameter family, produced the data. Following Schulman and Vazirani, we evaluate an estimator in terms of the chance of being within a specified tolerance of the correct answer, in the worst case. We provide optimal estimators for several families of distributions on $\mathbb{R}$. We prove that for distributions on a compact space, there is always an optimal estimator that is translation-invariant, and we conjecture that this conclusion also holds for any distribution on $\mathbb{R}$. By contrast, we give an example showing it does not hold for a certain distribution on an infinite tree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme volatility, nonlinear dependencies, and systemic fragility are characteristics of cryptocurrency markets. The assumptions of normality and centralized control in traditional financial risk models frequently cause them to miss these changes. Four components-volatility stress testing, stablecoin hedging, contagion modeling, and Monte Carlo simulation-are integrated into this paper's modular simulation framework for crypto portfolio risk analysis. Every module is based on mathematical finance theory, which includes stochastic price path generation, correlation-based contagion propagation, and mean-variance optimization. The robustness and practical relevance of the framework are demonstrated through empirical validation utilizing 2020-2024 USDT, ETH, and BTC data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An inferential model (IM) is a model describing the construction of provably reliable, data-driven uncertainty quantification and inference about relevant unknowns. IMs and Fisher's fiducial argument have similar objectives, but a fundamental distinction between the two is that the former doesn't require that uncertainty quantification be probabilistic, offering greater flexibility and allowing for a proof of its reliability. Important recent developments have been made thanks in part to newfound connections with the imprecise probability literature, in particular, possibility theory. The brand of possibilistic IMs studied here are straightforward to construct, have very strong frequentist-like reliability properties, and offer fully conditional, Bayesian-like (imprecise) probabilistic reasoning. This paper reviews these key recent developments, describing the new theory, methods, and computational tools. A generalization of the basic possibilistic IM is also presented, making new and unexpected connections with ideas in modern statistics and machine learning, e.g., bootstrap and conformal prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generalized version of Orlicz premia, based on possibly non-convex loss functions. We show that this generalized definition covers a variety of relevant examples, such as the geometric mean and the expectiles, while at the same time retaining a number of relevant properties. We establish that cash-additivity leads to $L^p$-quantiles, extending a classical result on 'collapse to the mean' for convex Orlicz premia.
  We then focus on the geometrically convex case, discussing the dual representation of generalized Orlicz premia and comparing it with a multiplicative form of the standard dual representation for the convex case. Finally, we show that generalized Orlicz premia arise naturally as the only elicitable, positively homogeneous, monotone and normalized functionals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how environmental stochasticity influences the long-term population size in certain one- and two-species models. The difficulty is that even when one can prove that there is persistence, it is usually impossible to say anything about the invariant probability measure which describes the persistent species. We are able to circumvent this problem for some important ecological models by noticing that the per-capita growth rates at stationarity are zero, something which can sometimes yield information about the invariant probability measure. For more complicated models we use a recent result by Cuello to explore how small noise influences the population size. We are able to show that environmental fluctuations can decrease, increase, or leave unchanged the expected population size. The results change according to the dynamical model and, within a fixed model, also according to which parameters (growth rate, carrying capacity, etc) are affected by environmental fluctuations. Moreover, we show that not only do things change if we introduce noise differently in a model, but it also matters what one takes as the deterministic `no-noise' baseline for comparison.</description>

However for the reader convenience, the formulas from the first paper that are cited here are collected in a special addendum at the end of the paper with their original numbers.
  At this paper two new local foliations are investigated: minor pockets and rectangles. The appearance of such local foliations is illustrated by the further investigation of the examples with the boundary functions being the polynomials of the third degree.</description>

      <title>Correlations in random cluster model at $q=1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mu$ be a measure that samples a subset of a finite ground set, and let $\mathcal{A}_e$ be the event that element $e$ is sampled. The measure $\mu$ is negatively correlated if for any pair of elements $e, f$ one has $\mu(\mathcal{A}_e \cap \mathcal{A}_f) - \mu(\mathcal{A}_e) \mu(\mathcal{A}_f) \leq 0$. A measure is positively correlated if the direction of the inequality is reversed. For the random cluster model on graphs positive correlation between edges is known for $q \geq 1$ due to the FKG inequality, while the negative correlation is only conjectured for $0 \leq q \leq 1$. The main result of this paper is to give a combinatorial formula for the difference in question at $q=1$. Previously, such a formula was known in the uniform spanning tree case, which is a limit of the random cluster model at $q=0$.</description>

      <title>Edgeworth corrections for the spiked eigenvalues of non-Gaussian sample covariance matrices with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Yang and Johnstone (2018) established an Edgeworth correction for the largest sample eigenvalue in a spiked covariance model under the assumption of Gaussian observations, leaving the extension to non-Gaussian settings as an open problem. In this paper, we address this issue by establishing first-order Edgeworth expansions for spiked eigenvalues in both single-spike and multi-spike scenarios with non-Gaussian data. Leveraging these expansions, we construct more accurate confidence intervals for the population spiked eigenvalues and propose a novel estimator for the number of spikes. Simulation studies demonstrate that our proposed methodology outperforms existing approaches in both robustness and accuracy across a wide range of settings, particularly in low-dimensional cases.</description>

      <title>Legendre Polynomials and Their Use for Karhunen-Lo\`eve Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper makes two main contributions. First, we present a pedagogical review of the derivation of the three-term recurrence relation for Legendre polynomials, without relying on the classical Legendre differential equation, Rodrigues' formula, or generating functions. This exposition is designed to be accessible to undergraduate students.
  Second, we develop a computational framework for Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansions of isotropic Gaussian random fields on hyper-rectangular domains. The framework leverages Legendre polynomials and their associated Gaussian quadrature, and it remains efficient even in higher spatial dimensions.
  A covariance kernel is first approximated by a non-negative mixture of squared-exponentials, obtained via a Newton-optimized fit with a theoretically informed initialization. The resulting separable kernel enables a Legendre-Galerkin discretization in the form of a Kronecker product over single dimensions, with submatrices that exhibit even/odd parity structure. For assembly, we introduce a Duffy-type transformation followed by quadrature. These structural properties significantly reduce both memory usage and arithmetic cost compared to naive approaches. All algorithms and numerical experiments are provided in an open-source repository that reproduces every figure and table in this work.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Operator Network: A Stochastic Maximum Principle Based Approach to Operator Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel framework for uncertainty quantification in operator learning, the Stochastic Operator Network (SON). SON combines the stochastic optimal control concepts of the Stochastic Neural Network (SNN) with the DeepONet. By formulating the branch net as an SDE and backpropagating through the adjoint BSDE, we replace the gradient of the loss function with the gradient of the Hamiltonian from Stohastic Maximum Principle in the SGD update. This allows SON to learn the uncertainty present in operators through its diffusion parameters. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of SON when replicating several noisy operators in 2D and 3D.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations for Empirical Measures of Self-Interacting Markov Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Delta^o$ be a finite set and, for each probability measure $m$ on $\Delta^o$, let $G(m)$ be a transition probability kernel on $\Delta^o$. Fix $x_0 \in \Delta^o$ and consider the chain $\{X_n, \; n \in \mathbb{N}_0\}$ of $\Delta^o$-valued random variables such that $X_0=x$, and given $X_0, \ldots , X_n$, the conditional distribution of $X_{n+1}$ is $G(L^{n+1})(X_n, \cdot)$, where $L^{n+1} = \frac{1}{n+1} \sum_{i=0}^{n} \delta_{X_i}$ is the empirical measure at instant $n$. Under conditions on $G$ we establish a large deviation principle for the empirical measure sequence $\{L^n, \; n \in \mathbb{N}\}$. As one application of this result we obtain large deviation asymptotics for the Aldous-Flannery-Palacios (1988) approximation scheme for quasistationary distributions of irreducible finite state Markov chains. The conditions on $G$ cover various other models of reinforced stochastic evolutions as well, including certain vertex reinforced and edge reinforced random walks and a variant of the PageRank algorithm. The particular case where $G(m)$ does not depend on $m$ corresponds to the classical results of Donsker and Varadhan (1975) on large deviations of empirical measures of Markov processes. However, unlike this classical setting, for the general self-interacting models considered here, the rate function takes a very different form; it is typically non-convex and is given through a dynamical variational formula with an infinite horizon discounted objective function.</description>

Abstract: We prove the existence of local stable, unstable, and center manifolds for stochastic semiflows induced by rough differential equations driven by rough paths valued stochastic processes around random fixed points of the equation. Examples include stochastic differential equations driven by a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H &gt; \frac{1}{4}$. In case the top Lyapunov exponent is negative, we derive almost sure exponential stability of the solution.</description>

Abstract: A soft random graph $G(n,r,p)$ can be obtained from the random geometric graph $G(n,r)$ by keeping every edge in $G(n,r)$ with probability $p$. The soft random simplicial complexes is a model for random simplicial complexes built over the soft random graph $G(n,r,p)$. This new model depends on a probability vector $\rho$ which allows the simplicial complexes to present randomness in all dimensions. In this article, we use a normal approximation theorem to prove central limit theorems for the number of $k$-faces and for the Euler's characteristic for soft random simplicial complexes.</description>

Abstract: What is the analogue of L\'evy processes for random surfaces? Motivated by scaling limits of random planar maps in random geometry, we introduce and study L\'evy looptrees and L\'evy maps. They are defined using excursions of general L\'evy processes with no negative jump and extend the known stable looptrees and stable maps, associated with stable processes. We compute in particular their fractal dimensions in terms of the upper and lower Blumenthal--Getoor exponents of the coding L\'evy process. The case where the L\'evy process is a stable process with a drift naturally appears in the context of stable-Boltzmann planar maps conditioned on having a fixed number of vertices and edges in a near-critical regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04180v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a class of positive discrete random variables extending the Conway--Maxwell-Poisson distribution. This class emerges in a natural way from an application in queueing theory and contains distributions exhibiting quite different features. Some of these distributions are characterized by the presence of Bernstein and inverse Bernstein functions. As a byproduct, we give some results on these inverses for which the existing literature is limited. Moreover, we investigate dispersion properties for these count data models, giving necessary and/or sufficient conditions to obtain both over and underdispersion. We also provide neat expressions for the factorial moments of any order. This furnishes us with a compact form also in the case of the Conway--Maxwell-Poisson.</description>

      <title>Malliavin Calculus for the one-dimensional Stochastic Stefan Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20389v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the one-dimensional outer stochastic Stefan problem with reflection. The problem admits maximal solutions as long as the velocity of the moving boundary remains bounded, [3,9,10]. We apply Malliavin calculus to the transformed equation and first prove that its maximal solution u has continuous paths a.s. In the case of the unreflected problem, the previous enables the localization of a proper approximating sequence of the maximal solution. Then, we derive there locally the differentiability of maximal u in the Malliavin sense. The novelty of this work, apart from the derivation of continuity of the paths for the maximal solution with reflection, is that for the unreflected case we introduce a localization argument on maximal solutions and define efficiently the relevant sample space. More precisely, we prove the local (in the sample space) existence of the Malliavin derivative and, under a non-degeneracy condition on the noise coefficient, the absolute continuity of the law of the solution with respect to the Lebesgue measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new ``Percolation with Clustering'' (PWC) model is introduced, where (the probabilities of) site percolation configurations on the leaf set of a binary tree are rewarded exponentially according to a generic function, which measures the degree of clustering in the configuration. Conditions on such ``clustering function'' are given for the existence of a limiting free energy and a wetting transition, namely the existence of a non-trivial percolation parameter threshold above and only above which the set of ``dry'' (open) sites have an asymptotic density. Several examples of clustering functions are given and studied using the general theory. The results here will be used in a sequel paper to study the wetting transition for the discrete Gaussian free field on the tree subject to a hard wall constraint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R:(0,\infty) \to [0,\infty)$ be a measurable function. Consider coalescing Brownian motions started from every point in the subset $\{ (0,x) : x \in \mathbb{R} \}$ of $[0,\infty) \times \mathbb{R}$ (with $[0,\infty)$ denoting time and $\mathbb{R}$ denoting space) and proceeding according to the following rule: the interval $\{t\} \times [L_t,U_t]$ between two consecutive Brownian motions instantaneously fragments' at rate $R(U_t - L_t)$. At a fragmentation event at a time $t$, we initiate new coalescing Brownian motions from each of the points $\{ (t,x) : x \in [L_t,U_t]\}$. The resulting process, which we call the $R$-marble, is easily constructed when $R$ is bounded, and may be considered a random subset of the Brownian web.
  Under mild conditions, we show that it is possible to construct the $R$-marble when $R$ is unbounded as a limit as $n \to \infty$ of $R_n$-marbles where $R_n(g) = R(g) \wedge n$. The behaviour of this limiting process is mainly determined by the shape of $R$ near zero. The most interesting case occurs when the limit $\lim_{g \downarrow 0} g^2 R(g) = \lambda$ exists in $(0,\infty)$, in which case we find a phase transition. For $\lambda \geq 6$, the limiting object is indistinguishable from the Brownian web, whereas if $\lambda &lt; 6$, then the limiting object is a nontrivial stochastic process with large gaps.
  When $R(g) = \lambda/g^2$, the $R$-marble is a self-similar stochastic process which we refer to as the \emph{Brownian marble with parameter $\lambda &gt; 0$}. We give an explicit description of the spacetime correlations of the Brownian marble, which can be described in terms of an object we call the Brownian vein; a spatial version of a recurrent extension of a killed Bessel-$3$ process.</description>

      <title>CIR bridge for modeling of fish migration on sub-hourly scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07094v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bridges, which are stochastic processes with pinned initial and terminal conditions, have recently been applied to various problems. We show that a bridge based on the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process, called a CIR bridge in this paper, reasonably models the intraday number of migrating fish at an observation point in a river. The studied fish migrates between sunrise and sunset each day, which are considered the initial and terminal times, respectively. The CIR bridge is well-defined as a unique pathwise continuous solution to a stochastic differential equation with unbounded drift and diffusion coefficients and potentially represents the on-off intermittency of the fish count data. Our bridge is theoretically novel in that it admits closed-form time-dependent averages and variances, with which the model parameters can be identified efficiently, and is computable by a recently-developed one-step numerical method. The CIR bridge is applied to the sub-hourly migration data of the diadromous fish Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis in the Nagara River, Japan, from February to June.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from strongly log-concave distributions over $\mathbb{R}^d$ using the Poisson midpoint discretization (a variant of the randomized midpoint method) for overdamped/underdamped Langevin dynamics. We prove its convergence in the 2-Wasserstein distance ($W_2$), achieving a cubic speedup in dependence on the target accuracy ($\epsilon$) over the Euler-Maruyama discretization, surpassing existing bounds for randomized midpoint methods. Notably, in the case of underdamped Langevin dynamics, we demonstrate the complexity of $W_2$ convergence is much smaller than the complexity lower bounds for convergence in $L^2$ strong error established in the literature.</description>

      <title>On Limiting Probability Distributions of Higher Order Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The limiting probability distribution is one of the key characteristics of a Markov chain since it shows its long-term behavior. In this paper, for a higher order Markov chain, we establish some properties related to its exact limiting probability distribution, including a sufficient condition for the existence of such a distribution. Our results extend the corresponding conclusions on first order chains. Besides, they complement the existing results concerning higher order chains which rely on approximation schemes or two-phase power iterations. Several illustrative example are also given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.11593v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we find an integer $h=h(n)$ such that the minimum number of variables of a first order sentence that distinguishes between two independent uniformly distributed random graphs of size $n$ with the asymptotically largest possible probability $\frac{1}{4}-o(1)$ belongs to $\{h,h+1,h+2,h+3\}$. We also prove that the minimum (random) $k$ such that two independent random graphs are distinguishable by a first order sentence with $k$ variables belongs to $\{h,h+1,h+2\}$ with probability $1-o(1)$.</description>

      <title>Transformers Can Solve Non-Linear and Non-Markovian Filtering Problems in Continuous Time For Conditionally Gaussian Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19603v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of attention-based deep learning models in stochastic filtering, e.g. transformers and deep Kalman filters, has recently come into focus; however, the potential for these models to solve stochastic filtering problems remains largely unknown. The paper provides an affirmative answer to this open problem in the theoretical foundations of machine learning by showing that a class of continuous-time transformer models, called \textit{filterformers}, can approximately implement the conditional law of a broad class of non-Markovian and conditionally Gaussian signal processes given noisy continuous-time (possibly non-Gaussian) measurements. Our approximation guarantees hold uniformly over sufficiently regular compact subsets of continuous-time paths, where the worst-case 2-Wasserstein distance between the true optimal filter and our deep learning model quantifies the approximation error. Our construction relies on two new customizations of the standard attention mechanism: The first can losslessly adapt to the characteristics of a broad range of paths since we show that the attention mechanism implements bi-Lipschitz embeddings of sufficiently regular sets of paths into low-dimensional Euclidean spaces; thus, it incurs no ``dimension reduction error''. The latter attention mechanism is tailored to the geometry of Gaussian measures in the $2$-Wasserstein space. Our analysis relies on new stability estimates of robust optimal filters in the conditionally Gaussian setting.</description>

      <title>Stochastic-Periodic Homogenization of a Class of Minimization Problems in Orlicz-Sobolev Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The current investigation is devoted to the stochastic-periodic homogenization theory in Orlicz-Sobolev's spaces. It focuses on the concept of stochastic two-scale convergence in this type of spaces, which is a combination of both well-known periodic two-scale convergence [\textit{Acta Appl. Math. (2012)} \textbf{121}, 175-196] and stochastic two-scale convergence in the mean schemes [\textit{Asympt. Anal. (2025)} \textbf{142}, 291-320]. One fundamental in this topic is to extend the classical compactness results of the stochastic two-scale convergence method to the Orlicz-Sobolev's spaces. Moreover, it is shown that the sequence of minimizers of a class of highly oscillatory minimizations problems involving integral functionals with convex and nonstandard growth integrands, converges to the minimizer of a homogenized problem.</description>

      <title>Effective quenched linear response for random dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove ``effective'' linear response for certain classes of non-uniformly expanding random dynamical systems which are not necessarily composed in an i.i.d manner. In applications, the results are obtained for base maps with a sufficient amount of mixing. The fact that the rates are effective is then applied to obtain the differentiability of the variance in the CLT as a function of the parameter, as well as the annealed linear response. These two applications are beyond the reach of the linear response obtained in the general case, when all the random variables appearing in the bounds are only tempered. We also provide several wide examples of one-dimensional maps satisfying our conditions, as well as some higher-dimensional examples.</description>

      <title>The Kneser--Poulsen phenomena for entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kneser--Poulsen conjecture asserts that the volume of a union of balls in Euclidean space cannot be increased by bringing their centres pairwise closer. We prove that its natural information-theoretic counterpart is true. This follows from a complete answer to a question asked in arXiv:2210.12842 about Gaussian convolutions, namely that the R\'enyi entropy comparisons between a probability measure and its contractive image are preserved when both undergo simultaneous heat flow. An inequality that unifies Costa's result on the concavity of entropy power with the entropic Kneser--Poulsen theorem is also presented.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic regularity of a generalised stochastic Halpern scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide abstract, general and highly uniform rates of asymptotic regularity for a generalized stochastic Halpern-style iteration, which incorporates a second mapping in the style of a Krasnoselskii-Mann iteration. This iteration is general in two ways: First, it incorporates stochasticity in a completely abstract way rather than fixing a sampling method; secondly, it includes as special cases stochastic versions of various schemes from the optimization literature, including Halpern's iteration as well as a Krasnoselskii-Mann iteration with Tikhonov regularization terms in the sense of Bo\c{t}, Csetnek and Meier. For these specific cases, we in particular obtain linear rates of asymptotic regularity, matching (or improving) the currently best known rates for these iterations in stochastic optimization, and quadratic rates of asymptotic regularity are obtained in the context of inner product spaces for the general iteration. At the end, we briefly sketch how the schemes presented here can be instantiated in the context of reinforcement learning to yield novel methods for Q-learning.</description>

      <title>Convergence of non-reversible Markov processes via lifting and flow Poincar\'e inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general approach for quantitative convergence analysis of non-reversible Markov processes, based on the concept of second-order lifts and a variational approach to hypocoercivity. To this end, we introduce the flow Poincar\'e inequality, a space-time Poincar\'e inequality along trajectories of the semigroup, and a general divergence lemma based only on the Dirichlet form of an underlying reversible diffusion. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach by applying it to a pair of run-and-tumble particles with jamming, a model from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, and several piecewise deterministic Markov processes used in sampling applications, in particular including general stochastic jump kernels.</description>

      <title>On the asymptotic behaviour of stochastic processes, with applications to supermartingale convergence, Dvoretzky's approximation theorem, and stochastic quasi-Fej\'er monotonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a novel and general result on the asymptotic behavior of stochastic processes which conform to a certain relaxed supermartingale condition. Our result provides quantitative information in the form of an explicit and effective construction of a rate of convergence for this process, both in mean and almost surely, that is moreover highly uniform in that it only depends on very few data of the surrounding objects involved in the iteration. We then apply this result to derive new quantitative versions of well-known concepts and theorems from stochastic approximation, in particular providing effective rates for a variant of the Robbins-Siegmund theorem, Dvoretzky's convergence theorem, as well as the convergence of stochastic quasi-Fej\'er monotone sequences, the latter of which formulated in a novel and highly general metric context. We utilize the classic and widely studied Robbins-Monro procedure as a template to evaluate our quantitative results and their applicability in greater detail. We conclude by illustrating the breadth of potential further applications with a brief discussion on a variety of other well-known iterative procedures from stochastic approximation. Throughout, we isolate and discuss special cases of our results which allow for the construction of fast, and in particular linear, rates.</description>

      <title>Agency Problems and Adversarial Bilevel Optimization under Uncertainty and Cyber Threats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08989v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an agency problem between a holding company and its subsidiary, exposed to cyber threats that affect the overall value of the subsidiary. The holding company seeks to design an optimal incentive scheme to mitigate these losses. In response, the subsidiary selects an optimal cybersecurity investment strategy, modeled through a stochastic epidemiological SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) framework. The cyber threat landscape is captured through an L-hop risk framework with two primary sources of risk: (i) internal risk propagation via the contagion parameters in the SIR model, and (ii) external cyberattacks from a malicious external hacker. The uncertainty and adversarial nature of the hacking lead to consider a robust stochastic control approach that allows for increased volatility and ambiguity induced by cyber incidents. The agency problem is formulated as a max-min bilevel stochastic control problem with accidents. First, we derive the incentive compatibility condition by reducing the subsidiary's optimal response to the solution of a second-order backward stochastic differential equation with jumps. Next, we demonstrate that the principal's problem can be equivalently reformulated as an integro-partial Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs (HJBI) equation. By extending the stochastic Perron's method to our setting, we show that the value function of the problem is the unique viscosity solution to the resulting integro-partial HJBI equation.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Constrained Sampling: A Large Deviations Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of sampling a target probability distribution on a constrained domain arises in many applications including machine learning. For constrained sampling, various Langevin algorithms such as projected Langevin Monte Carlo (PLMC) based on the discretization of reflected Langevin dynamics (RLD) and more generally skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin Monte Carlo (SRNLMC) based on the discretization of skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin dynamics (SRNLD) have been proposed and studied in the literature. This work focuses on the long-time behavior of SRNLD, where a skew-symmetric matrix is added to RLD. Although acceleration for SRNLD has been studied, it is not clear how one should design the skew-symmetric matrix in the dynamics to achieve good performance in practice. We establish a large deviation principle (LDP) for the empirical measure of SRNLD when the skew-symmetric matrix is chosen such that its product with the inward unit normal vector field on the boundary is zero. By explicitly characterizing the rate functions, we show that this choice of the skew-symmetric matrix accelerates the convergence to the target distribution compared to RLD and reduces the asymptotic variance. Numerical experiments for SRNLMC based on the proposed skew-symmetric matrix show superior performance, which validate the theoretical findings from the large deviations theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18370v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we introduce a unified analytic framework that connects simple varieties of trees, Bienayme-Galton-Watson processes and Khinchin families. Using Lagrange's inversion formula, we derive new coefficient-based expressions for extinction probabilities and reinterpret them as boundary phenomena tied to the domain of the inverse of the solution to Lagrange's equation. This perspective reveals a structural bridge between combinatorial and probabilistic models, simplifying classical arguments and yielding new results. It also leads to a computationally efficient method for simulating Galton-Watson processes via power series coefficients.</description>

      <title>The Strong Law of Large Numbers for random semigroups on uniformly smooth Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider random linear continuous operators $\Omega \to \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{X})$ on a Banach space $\mathcal{X}$. For example, such random operators may be random quantum channels. The Law of Large Numbers is known when $\mathcal{X}$ is a Hilbert space, in the form of the usual Law of Large Numbers for random operators, and in some other particular cases. Instead of the sum of i.i.d. variables, there may be considered the composition of random semigroups $e^{A_it/n}$. We obtain the Strong Law of Large Numbers in Strong Operator Topology for random semigroups of bounded linear operators on a uniformly smooth Banach space. We also develop another approach giving the SLLN in Weak Operator Topology for all Banach spaces.</description>
