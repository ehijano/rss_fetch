      <title>Simplified Morse-Bott-Smale chain complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Banyaga and Hurtubise defined the Morse-Bott-Smale chain complex as a quotient of a large chain complex by introducing five degeneracy relations. In this paper, we unify the five conditions into only one degeneracy condition. This allows for a simpler definition of Morse-Bott homology and more computable examples. Moreover, we show that our chain complex for a Morse-Smale function is quasi-isomorphic to the Morse-Smale-Witten chain complex. As a result, we obtain another proof of the Morse Homology Theorem.</description>

      <title>Formal Manifold Structures on Positive Characteristic Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his ICM report, Sullivan proposes the program of l-adic formalization of the concept of manifolds. In this program, he claims that smooth positive characteristic varieties should carry l-adic formal manifold structures. He also claims the existence of an abelianized Galois symmetry on l-adic formal manifold structures. This paper carries out this program, establishes the claims, and relates the abelianized Galois symmetry on l-adic formal manifold structures to the Galois symmetry of varieties. Meanwhile, we prove that simply-connected varieties are homotopically finite CW complexes in the l-adic sense.</description>

      <title>Higher Koszul duality and $n$-affineness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $\mathbb{E}_n$-Koszul duality for pairs of algebras of the form $\mathrm{C}_{\bullet}(\Omega^{n}_*X;\Bbbk) \leftrightarrow \mathrm{C}^{\bullet}(X;\Bbbk)$, and the closely related question of $n$-affineness for Betti stacks. It was expected, but not known, that $\mathbb{E}_n$-Koszul duality should induce a kind of Morita equivalence between categories of iterated modules. We establish this rigorously by proving that the $(\infty,n)$-category of iterated modules over $\mathrm{C}_{\bullet}(\Omega_*^{n+1}X;\Bbbk)$ is equivalent to the $(\infty,n)$-category of quasi-coherent sheaves of $(\infty,n-1)$-categories on $\mathrm{cSpec}(\mathrm{C}^{\bullet}(X;\Bbbk))$, where $\mathrm{cSpec}(\mathrm{C}^{\bullet}(X;\Bbbk))$ is the cospectrum of $\mathrm{C}^{\bullet}(X;\Bbbk)$. By the monodromy equivalence, these categories are also equivalent to the category of higher local systems on $X$, $n\mathbf{LocSysCat}^{n-1}(X;\Bbbk)$. Our result is new already in the classical case $n=1$, although it can be seen to recover well known formulations of $\mathbb{E}_1$-Koszul duality as a Morita equivalence of module categories (up to appropriate completions of the $t$-structures). We also investigate (higher) affineness properties of Betti stacks. We give a complete characterization of $n$-affine Betti stacks, in terms of the $0$-affineness of their iterated loop space. As a consequence, we prove that $n$-truncated Betti stacks are $n$-affine; and that $\pi_{n+1}(X)$ is an obstruction to $n$-affineness.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Modeling of Protein Structures: A Cohomology-Based Approach to the Flagellar Motor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel mathematical model derived from cohomology, leveraging the KEEL-proven theorem that establishes cohomology as tautological, generated by boundary classes of curves with fixed dual graphs. Simplicial complexes are constructed using skew-commutative graded algebra, and the structure theorem is applied to connect distinct homologies, enabling precise interpretations of the resulting geometric forms. The proposed model is utilized for protein structure analysis and prediction, with a specific application to the Flagellar Motor structure. This approach offers new insights into the geometric and algebraic foundations of biological macromolecular modeling, highlighting its potential for advancement in structural biology.</description>

      <title>Conley-Morse persistence barcode: a homological signature of a combinatorial bifurcation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bifurcation is one of the major topics in the theory of dynamical systems. It characterizes the nature of qualitative changes in parametrized dynamical systems. In this work, we study combinatorial bifurcations within the framework of combinatorial multivector field theory--a young but already well-established theory providing a combinatorial model for continuous-time dynamical systems (or simply, flows). We introduce Conley-Morse persistence barcode, a compact algebraic descriptor of combinatorial bifurcations. The barcode captures structural changes in a dynamical system at the level of Morse decompositions and provides a characterization of the nature of observed transitions in terms of the Conley index. The construction of Conley-Morse persistence barcode builds upon ideas from topological data analysis (TDA). Specifically, we consider a persistence module obtained from a zigzag filtration of topological pairs (formed by index pairs defining the Conley index) over a poset. Using gentle algebras, we prove that this module decomposes into simple intervals (bars) and compute them with algorithms from TDA known for processing zigzag filtrations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show the existence of odd fake $\mathbb{Q}$-homology quadrics, namely of minimal surfaces $S$ of general type which have the same $\mathbb{Q}$-homology as a smooth quadric $Q \cong (\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C}))^2$, but have an odd intersection form on $ H^2(S, \mathbb{Z})/Tors(S)$, where $Tors(S)$ is the Torsion subgroup.
  Our examples are provided by a special 1-dimensional family of surfaces isogenous to a product of unmixed type.</description>

      <title>Applied Sheaf Theory For Multi-agent Artificial Intelligence (Reinforcement Learning) Systems: A Prospectus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a pedagogical introduction to classical sheaf theory and sheaf cohomology, followed by a research prospectus exploring potential applications to multi-agent artificial intelligence systems. The first section offers a comprehensive overview of fundamental sheaf-theoretic concepts-presheaves, sheaves, stalks, and cohomology-aimed at researchers in computer science and AI who may not have extensive background in algebraic topology. The second section presents a detailed research prospectus that outlines a roadmap for developing sheaf-theoretic approaches to model and analyze complex systems of interacting agents. We propose that sheaf theory's inherent local-to-global perspective may provide valuable mathematical tools for reasoning about how local agent behaviors collectively determine emergent system properties. The third section contains a literature review connecting sheaf theory with existing research in multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning, and economic modeling. This paper does not present a completed model but rather lays theoretical groundwork and identifies promising research directions that could bridge abstract mathematics with practical AI applications, potentially revealing new approaches to coordination and emergence in multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Analysing Multiscale Clusterings with Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04281v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In data clustering, it is often desirable to find not just a single partition into clusters but a sequence of partitions that describes the data at different scales (or levels of coarseness). A natural problem then is to analyse and compare the (not necessarily hierarchical) sequences of partitions that underpin such multiscale descriptions. Here, we use tools from topological data analysis and introduce the Multiscale Clustering Filtration (MCF), a well-defined and stable filtration of abstract simplicial complexes that encodes arbitrary cluster assignments in a sequence of partitions across scales of increasing coarseness. We show that the zero-dimensional persistent homology of the MCF measures the degree of hierarchy of this sequence, and the higher-dimensional persistent homology tracks the emergence and resolution of conflicts between cluster assignments across the sequence of partitions. To broaden the theoretical foundations of the MCF, we provide an equivalent construction via a nerve complex filtration, and we show that, in the hierarchical case, the MCF reduces to a Vietoris-Rips filtration of an ultrametric space. Using synthetic data, we then illustrate how the persistence diagram of the MCF provides a feature map that can serve to characterise and classify multiscale clusterings.</description>

      <title>On sequential versions of distributional topological complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17218v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a (non-decreasing) sequence $\{\mathsf{dTC}_m(X)\}_{m\ge 2}$ of higher versions of distributional topological complexity ($\mathsf{dTC}$) of a space $X$ introduced by Dranishnikov and Jauhari. This sequence generalizes $\mathsf{dTC}(X)$ in the sense that $\mathsf{dTC}_2(X) = \mathsf{dTC}(X)$, and is a direct analog to the classical sequence $\{\mathsf{TC}_m(X)\}_{m\ge 2}$. We show that like $\mathsf{TC}_m$ and $\mathsf{dTC}$, the sequential versions $\mathsf{dTC}_m$ are also homotopy invariants. Also, $\mathsf{dTC}_m(X)$ relates with the distributional LS-category ($\mathsf{dcat}$) of products of $X$ in the same way as $\mathsf{TC}_m(X)$ relates with the classical LS-category ($\mathsf{cat}$) of products of $X$. On one hand, we show that in general, $\mathsf{dTC}_m$ is a different concept than $\mathsf{TC}_m$ for each $m \ge 2$. On the other hand, by finding sharp cohomological lower bounds to $\mathsf{dTC}_m(X)$, we provide various examples of closed manifolds $X$ for which the sequences $\{\mathsf{TC}_m(X)\}_{m\ge 2}$ and $\{\mathsf{dTC}_m(X)\}_{m\ge 2}$ coincide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12265v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the theory of the intertwining distributional versions of the LS-category and the sequential topological complexities of a space $X$, denoted by $\mathsf{icat}(X)$ and $\mathsf{iTC}_m(X)$, respectively. We prove that they satisfy most of the nice properties as their respective distributional counterparts $\mathsf{dcat}(X)$ and $\mathsf{dTC}_m(X)$, and their classical counterparts $\mathsf{cat}(X)$ and $\mathsf{TC}_m(X)$, such as homotopy invariance and special behavior on topological groups. We show that the notions of $\mathsf{iTC}_m$ and $\mathsf{dTC}_m$ are different for each $m \ge 2$ by proving that $\mathsf{iTC}_m(\mathcal{H})=1$ for all $m \ge 2$ for Higman's group $\mathcal{H}$. Using cohomological lower bounds, we also provide various examples of locally finite CW complexes $X$ for which $\mathsf{icat}(X) &gt; 1$, $\mathsf{iTC}_m(X) &gt; 1$, $\mathsf{icat}(X) = \mathsf{dcat}(X) = \mathsf{cat}(X)$, and $\mathsf{iTC}(X) = \mathsf{dTC}(X) = \mathsf{TC}(X)$.</description>

Abstract: We study unital $\infty$-operads by their arity restrictions. Given $k \geq 1$, we develop a model for unital $k$-restricted $\infty$-operads, which are variants of $\infty$-operads which has only $(\leq k)$-arity morphisms, as complete Segal presheaves on closed $k$-dendroidal trees, which are closed trees build from corollas with valences $\leq k$. Furthermore, we prove that the restriction functors from unital $\infty$-operads to unital $k$-restricted $\infty$-operads admit fully faithful left and right adjoints by showing that the left and right Kan extensions preserve complete Segal objects. Varying $k$, the left and right adjoints give a filtration and a co-filtration for any unital $\infty$-operads by $k$-restricted $\infty$-operads.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We adapt algorithms for resolving the singularities of complex algebraic varieties to prove that the natural map of homology theories from complex bordism to the bordism theory of complex derived orbifolds splits. In equivariant stable homotopy theory, our techniques yield a splitting of homology theories for the map from bordism to the equivariant bordism theory of a finite group $\Gamma$, given by assigning to a manifold its product with $\Gamma$. In symplectic topology, and using recent work of Abouzaid-McLean-Smith and Hirschi-Swaminathan, we conclude that one can define complex cobordism-valued Gromov-Witten invariant for arbitrary (closed) symplectic manifolds. We apply our results to constrain the topology of the space of Hamiltonian fibrations over $S^2$. The methods we develop apply to normally complex orbifolds, and will hence lead to applications in symplectic topology that rely on moduli spaces of holomorphic curves with Lagrangian boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Four dimensional almost complex torus manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In dimension 4, we extend the correspondence between compact nonsingular toric varieties and regular fans to a correspondence between almost complex torus manifolds and families of multi-fans in a geometric way, where an (almost) complex torus manifold is a $2n$-dimensional compact connected (almost) complex manifold equipped with an effective action of a real $n$-dimensional torus $T^n$ that has fixed points.
  Let $M$ be a 4-dimensional almost complex torus manifold. To $M$, we associate two equivalent combinatorial objects, a family $\Delta$ of multi-fans and a graph $\Gamma$, which encode the data on the fixed point set. We find a necessary and sufficient condition for each of $\Delta$ and $\Gamma$.
  Moreover, we provide a minimal model and operations for each of $\Delta$ and $\Gamma$. We introduce operations on a multi-fan and a graph that correspond to blow up and down of a manifold, and show that we can blow up and down $M$ to a minimal manifold $M'$ whose weights at the fixed points are unit vectors in $\mathbb{Z}^2$, $\Delta$ to a family of minimal multi-fans that has unit vectors only, and $\Gamma$ to a minimal graph whose edges all have unit vectors as labels.
  As an application, if $M$ is complex, $\Delta$ is a fan and determines $M$, $\Gamma$ encodes the equivariant cohomology of $M$, and $M'$ is $\mathbb{CP}^1 \times \mathbb{CP}^1$. This implies that any two 4-dimensional complex torus manifolds are obtained from each other by equivariant blow up and down.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that in matroids the difference between the chromatic number and the fractional chromatic number is smaller than 1, and that the list chromatic number is equal to the chromatic number. We investigate the gap within these pairs of parameters for hypergraphs that are the intersection of a given number k of matroids. We prove that in such hypergraphs the list chromatic number is at most k times the chromatic number and at most 2k-1 times the maximum chromatic number among the k matroids. We study the relationship between three polytopes associated with k-sets of matroids, and connect them to bounds on the fractional chromatic number of the intersection of the members of the k-set. This also connects to bounds on the matroidal matching and covering number of the intersection of the members of the k-set. The tools used are in part topological.</description>

      <title>Coloring the intersection of two matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A result [The intersection of a matroid and a simplicial complex, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 358] from 2006 of Aharoni and the first author of this paper states that for any two positive integers $p,q$, where $p$ divides $q$, if a matroid $\mathcal{M}$ is $p$-colorable and a matroid $\mathcal{N}$ is $q$-colorable then $\mathcal{M} \cap \mathcal{N}$ is $(p+q)$-colorable. In this paper we show that the assumption that $p$ divides $q$ is in fact redundant, and we also prove that $\mathcal{M} \cap \mathcal{N}$ is even $p+q$ list-colorable.
  The result uses topology and relies on a new parameter yielding a lower bound for the topological connectivity of the intersection of two matroids.</description>

      <title>Distributional category of manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a new homotopy invariant of metric spaces, called the distributional LS-category, was defined, which provides a lower bound to the classical LS-category. In this paper, we obtain several sufficient conditions for the distributional LS-category (dcat) of a closed manifold to be maximum, i.e., equal to its classical LS-category (cat). These give us many new computations of dcat, especially for some essential manifolds and (generalized) connected sums. In the process, we also determine the cat of closed 3-manifolds having torsion-free fundamental groups and some closed geometrically decomposable 4-manifolds. Finally, we extend some of our results to closed Alexandrov spaces with curvature bounded below and discuss their cat and dcat in dimension 3.</description>

      <title>Fast Directed $q$-Analysis for Brain Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04596v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent innovations in reconstructing large scale, full-precision, neuron-synapse-scale connectomes demand subsequent improvements to graph analysis methods to keep up with the growing complexity and size of the data. One such tool is the recently introduced directed $q$-analysis. We present numerous improvements, theoretical and applied, to this technique: on the theoretical side, we introduce modified definitions for key elements of directed $q$-analysis, which remedy a well-hidden and previously undetected bias. This also leads to new, beneficial perspectives to the associated computational challenges. Most importantly, we present a high-speed, publicly available, low-level implementation that provides speed-ups of several orders of magnitude on C. Elegans. Furthermore, the speed gains grow with the size of the considered graph. This is made possible due to the mathematical and algorithmic improvements as well as a carefully crafted implementation. These speed-ups enable, for the first time, the analysis of full-sized connectomes such as those obtained by recent reconstructive methods. Additionally, the speed-ups allow comparative analysis to corresponding null models, appropriately designed randomly structured artificial graphs that do not correspond to actual brains. This, in turn, allows for assessing the efficacy and usefulness of directed $q$-analysis for studying the brain. We report on the results in this paper.</description>
