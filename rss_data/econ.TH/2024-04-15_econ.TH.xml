      <title>Competition for Budget-Constrained Buyers: Exploring All-Pay Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note pursues two primary objectives. First, we analyze the outcomes of an all-pay auction within a store where buyers with and without financial constraints arrive at varying rates, and where buyer types are private information. Second, we investigate the selection of an auction format (comprising first-price, second-price, and all-pay formats) in a competitive search setting, where sellers try to attract customers. Our results indicate that if the budget constraint is not too restrictive, the all-pay rule emerges as the preferred selling format in the unique symmetric equilibrium. This is thanks to its ability to prompt buyers to submit lower bids, thereby generally avoiding budget constraints, while allowing the seller to collect all bids.</description>

      <title>Long run consequence of p-hacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the theoretical consequence of p-hacking on the accumulation of knowledge under the framework of mis-specified Bayesian learning. A sequence of researchers, in turn, choose projects that generate noisy information in a field. In choosing projects, researchers need to carefully balance as projects generates big information are less likely to succeed. In doing the project, a researcher p-hacks at intensity $\varepsilon$ so that the success probability of a chosen project increases (unduly) by a constant $\varepsilon$. In interpreting previous results, researcher behaves as if there is no p-hacking because the intensity $\varepsilon$ is unknown and presumably small. We show that over-incentivizing information provision leads to the failure of learning as long as $\varepsilon\neq 0$. If the incentives of information provision is properly provided, learning is correct almost surely as long as $\varepsilon$ is small.</description>

      <title>More, better or different? Trade-offs between group size and competence development in jury theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many circumstances there is a trade off between the number of voters and the time they can be given before having to make a decision since both aspects are costly. An example is the hiring of a committee with a fixed salary budget: more people but a shorter time for each to develop their competence about the issue at hand or less people with a longer time for competence development? In this paper we investigate the interaction between the number of voters, the development of their competence over time and the final probability for an optimal majority decision. Among other things we consider how different learning profiles, or rates of relevant competence increase, for the members of a committee affects the optimal committee size.
  To the best of our knowledge, our model is the first that includes the potentially positive effects of having a heterogeneous group of voters on majority decisions in a satisfactory way. We also discuss how some earlier attempts fail to capture the effect of heterogeneity correctly.</description>

      <title>A note on heterogeneity, trade integration and spatial inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of economic integration on spatial development in a model where all consumers are inter-regionally mobile and have heterogeneous preferences regarding their residential location choices. This heterogeneity is the unique dispersion force in the model. We show that, under reasonable values for the elasticity of substitution among varieties of consumption goods, a higher trade integration always promotes more symmetric patterns, irrespective of the functional form of the dispersion force. We also show that an increase in the degree of heterogeneity in preferences for location leads to less spatial inequality.</description>

      <title>Monotone Function Intervals: Theory and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03135v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A monotone function interval is the set of monotone functions that lie pointwise between two fixed monotone functions. We characterize the set of extreme points of monotone function intervals and apply this to a number of economic settings. First, we leverage the main result to characterize the set of distributions of posterior quantiles that can be induced by a signal, with applications to political economy, Bayesian persuasion, and the psychology of judgment. Second, we combine our characterization with properties of convex optimization problems to unify and generalize seminal results in the literature on security design under adverse selection and moral hazard.</description>

      <title>Implementations of Cooperative Games Under Non-Cooperative Solution Concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooperative games can be distinguished as non-cooperative games in which players can freely sign binding agreements to form coalitions. These coalitions inherit a joint strategy set and seek to maximize collective payoffs. When the payoffs to each coalition under some non-cooperative solution concept coincide with their value in the cooperative game, the cooperative game is said to be implementable and the non-cooperative game its implementation. This paper proves that all strictly superadditive partition function form games are implementable under Nash equilibrium and rationalizability; that all weakly superadditive characteristic function form games are implementable under Nash equilibrium; and that all weakly superadditive partition function form games are implementable under trembling hand perfect equilibrium. Discussion then proceeds on the appropriate choice of non-cooperative solution concept for the implementation.</description>

      <title>The Limits of Identification in Discrete Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study identification and linear independence in random utility models. We characterize the dimension of the random utility model as the cyclomatic complexity of a specific graphical representation of stochastic choice data. We show that, as the number of alternatives grows, any linearly independent set of preferences is a vanishingly small subset of the set of all preferences. We introduce a new condition on sets of preferences which is sufficient for linear independence. We demonstrate by example that the condition is not necessary, but is strictly weaker than other existing sufficient conditions.</description>

      <title>Information Elicitation in Agency Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid progress in scalable, commoditized tools for data collection and data processing has made it possible for firms and policymakers to employ ever more complex metrics as guides for decision-making. These developments have highlighted a prevailing challenge -- deciding *which* metrics to compute. In particular, a firm's ability to compute a wider range of existing metrics does not address the problem of *unknown unknowns*, which reflects informational limitations on the part of the firm. To guide the choice of metrics in the face of this informational problem, we turn to the evaluated agents themselves, who may have more information than a principal about how to measure outcomes effectively. We model this interaction as a simple agency game, where we ask: *When does an agent have an incentive to reveal the observability of a cost-correlated variable to the principal?* There are two effects: better information reduces the agent's information rents but also makes some projects go forward that otherwise would fail. We show that the agent prefers to reveal information that exposes a strong enough differentiation between high and low costs. Expanding the agent's action space to include the ability to *garble* their information, we show that the agent often prefers to garble over full revelation. Still, giving the agent the ability to garble can lead to higher total welfare. Our model has analogies with price discrimination, and we leverage some of these synergies to analyze total welfare.</description>
