      <title>Mating parabolic rational maps with Hecke groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that any degree $d$ rational map having a parabolic fixed point of multiplier $1$ with a fully invariant and simply connected immediate basin of attraction is mateable with the Hecke group $H_{d+1}$, with the mating realized by an algebraic correspondence. This solves the parabolic version of the Bullett-Freiberger Conjecture from 2003 on mateability between rational maps and Hecke groups. The proof is in two steps. The first is the construction of a pinched polynomial-like map which is a mating between a parabolic rational map and a parabolic circle map associated to the Hecke group. The second is lifting this pinched polynomial-like map to an algebraic correspondence via a suitable branched covering.</description>

In this paper, we establish some conditional variational principles for the upper and lower Bowen/packing metric mean dimension with potential of multifractal level set $K_\alpha:=\{x\in X:\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\dfrac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n-1}\varphi(f^ix)=\alpha\}.$</description>

      <title>Singular perturbation in heavy ball dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a $C^{1,1}_\mathrm{loc}$ lower bounded function $f:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ definable in an o-minimal structure on the real field, we show that the singular perturbation $\epsilon \searrow 0$ in the heavy ball system \begin{equation} \label{eq:P_eps} \tag{$P_\epsilon$}
  \epsilon\ddot{x}_\epsilon(t) + \gamma\dot{x}_\epsilon(t) + \nabla f(x_\epsilon(t)) = 0, ~~~ \forall t \geqslant 0, ~~~ x_\epsilon(0) = x_0, ~~~ \dot{x}_\epsilon(0) = \dot{x}_0, \end{equation} preserves boundedness of solutions, where $\gamma&gt;0$ is the friction and $(x_0,\dot{x}_0) \in \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n$ is the initial condition. This complements the work of Attouch, Goudou, and Redont which deals with finite time horizons. In other words, this work studies the asymptotic behavior of a ball rolling on a surface subject to gravitation and friction, without assuming convexity nor coercivity.</description>

      <title>Mapping classes of Real Rational Surface Automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\{F_n, n\ge 8\}$ be a family of diffeomorphisms on real rational surfaces that are birationally equivalent to birational maps on $\mathbf{P}^2(\mathbb{R})$. In this article, we investigate the mapping classes of the diffeomorphisms $F_n, n\ge 8$. These diffeomorphisms are reducible with unique invariant irreducible curves, and we determine the mapping classes of their restrictions, $\hat F_n, n \ge 8$, on the cut surfaces, showing that they are pseudo-Anosov and do not arise from Penner's construction. For $n=8$, Lehmer's number is realized as the stretch factor of $\hat F_8$, a pseudo-Anosov map on a once-punctured genus $5$ orientable surface. The diffeomorphism $\hat F_8$ is a new geometric realization of a Lehmer's number.</description>

      <title>Stationary Solitons in discrete NLS with non-nearest neighbour interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to provide a construction of stationary discrete solitons in an extended one-dimensional Discrete NLS model with non-nearest neighbour interactions. These models, models of the type with long-range interactions were studied in various other contexts. In particular, it was shown that, if the interaction strength decays sufficiently slowly as a function of distance, it gives rise to bistability of solitons, which may find applications in their controllable switching. Dynamical lattices with long-range interactions also serve as models for energy and charge transport in biological molecules. Using a dynamical systems method we are able to construct, with great accuracy, stationary discrete solitons for our model, for a large region of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Local models for smooth vector fields of the line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the local classification of singularities of smooth vector fields on the line, with respect to the equivalence relation of $C^1$--conjugacy. Along the way, we recall the analogous classification, up to $C^0$ and $C^{\infty}$ conjugacy. We also give the transversal unfoldings of the corresponding normal forms and treat the case where the changes of coordinates are tangent to the identity. Thus, a fairly complete description of the $1$--d case is achieved.</description>

      <title>Limit cycles of piecewise smooth differential systems with nilpotent center and linear saddle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the number of limit cycles of a piecewise smooth differential system separated by one or two parallel straight lines or rays formed by a nilpotent center or degenerate center and linear saddle. Piecewise linear differential systems separated by one or two parallel straight lines with one of the subsystems of type nilpotent center and other subsystems of type linear saddle can have at most two limit cycles and there are systems in these classes having one limit cycle. The limit cycle in particular consists of saddle separatrices of the subsystem.</description>

      <title>Iteration of Exponentials with Sign Changes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the iteration of infinitely many signed exponentials with the same base but the signs may vary. We show that for every base in an explicit interval this iteration converges for any sequence of signs and all the real numbers are possible limits. We give some more results for a base outside this interval.</description>

      <title>Saddle-node bifurcations for concave in measure and d-concave in measure skewproduct flows with applications to population dynamics and circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concave in measure and d-concave in measure nonautonomous scalar ordinary differential equations given by coercive and time-compactible maps have similar properties to equations satisfying considerably more restrictive hypotheses. This paper describes the generalized simple or double saddle-node bifurcation diagrams for one-parametric families of equations of these types, from which the dynamical possibilities for each of the equations follow. This new framework allows the analysis of ``almost stochastic" equations, whose coefficients vary in very large chaotic sets. The results also apply to the analysis of the occurrence of critical transitions for a range of models much larger than in previous approaches.</description>

      <title>Correspondences on Riemann surfaces and non-uniform hyperbolicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider certain analytic correspondences on a Riemann surface, and show that they admit a weak form of expansion. In terms of their algebraic encoding by bisets, this translates to contraction of group elements along sequences arising from iterated lifting.
  As an application, we show that for every non-exceptional rational map on $\mathbb{P}^1$ with $4$ post-critical points, there is a finite collection of isotopy classes of curves into which every curve eventually lands under iterated lifting.</description>

      <title>Metric mean dimension, H\"older regularity and Assouad spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metric mean dimension is a geometric invariant of dynamical systems with infinite topological entropy. We relate this concept with the fractal structure of the phase space and the H\"older regularity of the map. Afterwards we improve our general estimates in a family of interval maps by computing the metric mean dimension in a way similar to the Misiurewicz formula for the entropy, which in particular shows that our bounds are sharp. Of independent interest, we develop a dynamical analogue of Minkowski-Bouligand dimension for maps acting on Ahlfors regular spaces.</description>

      <title>On the Shapes of Rational Lemniscates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A rational lemniscate is a level set of $|r|$ where $r: \hat{\mathbb{C}} \rightarrow \hat{\mathbb{C}}$ is rational. We prove that any planar Euler graph can be approximated, in a strong sense, by a homeomorphic rational lemniscate. This generalizes Hilbert's lemniscate theorem; he proved that any Jordan curve can be approximated (in the same strong sense) by a polynomial lemniscate that is also a Jordan curve. As consequences, we obtain a sharp quantitative version of the classical Runge's theorem on rational approximation, and we give a new result on the approximation of planar continua by Julia sets of rational maps.</description>

      <title>Sum of the exponential and a polynomial: Singular values and Baker wandering domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article studies the singular values of entire functions of the form $E^k (z)+P(z)$ where $E^k$ denotes the $k-$times composition of $e^z$ with itself and $P$ is any non-constant polynomial. It is proved that the full preimage of each neighborhood of $\infty$ is an infinitely connected domain without having any unbounded boundary component. Following the literature, the point at $\infty$ is called a Baker omitted value for the function in such a situation. More importantly, there are infinitely many critical values and no finite asymptotic value and in fact, the set of all critical values is found to be unbounded for these functions. We also investigate the iteration of three examples of entire functions with Baker omitted value and prove that these do not have any Baker wandering domain. There is a conjecture stating that the number of completely invariant domains of a transcendental entire function is at most one. How some of these maps are right candidates to work upon in view of this conjecture is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Exponential mixing for random nonlinear wave equations: weak dissipation and localized control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a new criterion for exponential mixing of random dynamical systems. Our criterion is applicable to a wide range of systems, including in particular dispersive equations. Its verification is in nature related to several topics, i.e., asymptotic compactness in dynamical systems, global stability of evolution equations, and localized control problems.
  As an initial application, we exploit the exponential mixing of random nonlinear wave equations with degenerate damping, critical nonlinearity, and physically localized noise. The essential challenge lies in the fact that the weak dissipation and randomness interact in the evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $s(n)$ denote the number of "$1$"s in the dyadic representation of a positive integer $n$ and sequence $S(n) = s(1)+s(2)+\dots+s(n-1)$. The Trollope-Delange formula is a classic result that represents the sequence $S$ in terms of the Takagi function. In this work, we extend this result by introducing a weighted analog of $s(n)$, deriving a variant of the Trollope-Delange formula for this generalization.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Salvo Guidance over Leader-Follower Network with Free-Will Arbitrary Time Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A cooperative salvo strategy is proposed in this paper which achieves consensus among the interceptors within a pre-defined arbitrary settling time. Considering non-linear engagement kinematics and a system lag to capture the effect of interceptor autopilot as present in realistic interception scenarios, the guidance schemes use the time-to-go estimates of the interceptors in order to achieve simultaneous interception of a stationary target at a pre-determined impact time. The guidance scheme ensures that consensus among the time-to-go estimates of the interceptors is achieved within a settling time whose upper bound can be pre-specified arbitrarily independent of the initial conditions or design parameters. The efficacy of the proposed guidance strategy is demonstrated using numerical simulations with varied conditions of initial position, velocities and heading angle errors of the interceptors as well as different desired impact times.</description>

We prove that $\mu$ is exponentially mixing of all orders for all (not necessarily bounded) plurisubharmonic observables, and that all plurisubharmonic functions satisfy the central limit theorem with respect to $\mu$. Our results hold more generally for every H\'enon-Sibony map on $\mathbb{C}^k$.</description>

      <title>Quantum three-rotor problem in the identity representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum three-rotor problem concerns the dynamics of three equally massive particles moving on a circle subject to pairwise attractive cosine potentials and can model coupled Josephson junctions. Classically, it displays order-chaos-order behavior with increasing energy. The quantum system admits a dimensionless coupling with semiclassical behavior at strong coupling. We study stationary states with periodic `relative' wave functions. Perturbative and harmonic approximations capture the spectrum at weak coupling and that of low-lying states at strong coupling. More generally, the cumulative distribution of energy levels obtained by numerical diagonalization is well-described by a Weyl-like semiclassical estimate. However, the system has an $S_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry that is obscured when working with relative angles. By exploiting a basis for invariant states, we obtain the purified spectrum in the identity representation. To uncover universal quantum hallmarks of chaos, we partition the spectrum into energy windows where the classical motion is regular, mixed or chaotic and unfold each separately. At strong coupling, we find striking signatures of transitions between regularity and chaos: spacing distributions morph from Poisson to Wigner-Dyson while the number variance shifts from linear to logarithmic behavior at small lengths. Some nonuniversal features are also examined. For instance, the number variance saturates and oscillates at large lengths for strong coupling while deviations from Poisson spacings at asymptotically low and high energies are well-explained by purified quantum harmonic and free-rotor spectra at strong and weak coupling. Interestingly, the degeneracy of free-rotor levels admits an elegant formula that we deduce using properties of Eisenstein primes.</description>

      <title>Singularities of 3d vector fields preserving the form of Martinet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03619v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the local structure of vector fields on $\mathbb{R}^3$ which preserve the Martinet $1$-form $\alpha=(1+x)dy\pm zdz$. We present the classification of their singularities, up to diffeomorphisms preserving the form $\alpha$, as well as their transversal unfoldings. We are thus able to provide a fairly complete list of the bifurcations such vector fields undergo.</description>

      <title>Purely periodic continued fractions and graph-directed iterated function systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe Gauss-type maps as geometric realizations of certain codes in the monoid of nonnegative matrices in the extended modular group. Each such code, together with an appropriate choice of unimodular intervals in P^1R, determines a dual pair of graph-directed iterated function systems, whose attractors contain intervals and constitute the domains of a dual pair of Gauss-type maps. Our framework covers many continued fraction algorithms (such as Farey fractions, Ceiling, Even and Odd, Nearest Integer, ...) and provides explicit dual algorithms and characterizations of those quadratic irrationals having a purely periodic expansion.</description>

Abstract: In this paper I introduce the property CD which is a more convenient variant of the UC property and show one of the possible relationships between them, I also extend the concept of a fixed point, introducing the concept of a weak fixation of a point about a sequence. I introduce contraction map sets with an external factor and formulate a theorem for them, on which the main focus of this article falls.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16671v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the work of An, Guan and Kleinbock on bounded orbits of diagonalizable flows on $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})/\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{Z})$ to $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})/\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{K}})$, where $\mathbb{K}$ is an imaginary quadratic field. To achieve this, we first prove a complex analogue of Minkowski's Linear Forms Theorem. We then set up an appropriate Schmidt game in $\mathbb{C}^3$ such that bounded orbits correspond to a hyperplane-absolute-winning set consisting of certain vectors in $\mathbb{C}^3$ relative to an approximation by imaginary quadratic rationals in $\mathbb{K}$.</description>

      <title>Backward bifurcation arising from decline of immunity against emerging infectious diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decline of immunity is a phenomenon characterized by immunocompromised host and plays a crucial role in the epidemiology of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) such as COVID-19. In this paper, we propose an age-structured model with vaccination and reinfection of immune individuals. We prove that the disease-free equilibrium of the model undergoes backward and forward transcritical bifurcations at the critical value of the basic reproduction number for different values of parameters. We illustrate the results by numerical computations, and also find that the endemic equilibrium exhibits a saddle-node bifurcation on the extended branch of the forward transcritical bifurcation. These results allow us to understand the interplay between the decline of immunity and EIDs, and are able to provide strategies for mitigating the impact of EIDs on global health.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In connection with the results of Tim Austin, and Wen Huang, Song Shao, Xiangdong Ye we present the following assertion: there are infinite automorphisms $S,T$, some set $A$ of positive finite measure and a sequence $N_m$ with $|N_{m+1}|/|N_m|\ \to\infty$ such that $T^iA\cap S^iA=\phi$ for $i\in [N_{4k}, N_{4k+1}]$ and $T^iA=S^iA$ for $i\in [N_{4k+2}, N_{2k+3}]$. For the corresponding deterministic Gaussian and Poisson suspensions $S_\circ,T_\circ$ over $S,T$ for some $f\in L_\infty$ there is no limit of $ \frac 1 N \sum_{n=1}^N T_\circ^nf\,S_\circ^nf$ in $ L_2$.</description>

      <title>Online Optimization and Ambiguity-based Learning of Distributionally Uncertain Dynamic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.09111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to construct data-driven online solutions to optimization problems (P) subject to a class of distributionally uncertain dynamical systems. The introduced framework allows for the simultaneous learning of distributional system uncertainty via a parameterized, control-dependent ambiguity set using a finite historical data set, and its use to make online decisions with probabilistic regret function bounds. Leveraging the merits of Machine Learning, the main technical approach relies on the theory of Distributional Robust Optimization (DRO), to hedge against uncertainty and provide less conservative results than standard Robust Optimization approaches. Starting from recent results that describe ambiguity sets via parameterized, and control-dependent empirical distributions as well as ambiguity radii, we first present a tractable reformulation of the corresponding optimization problem while maintaining the probabilistic guarantees. We then specialize these problems to the cases of 1) optimal one-stage control of distributionally uncertain nonlinear systems, and 2) resource allocation under distributional uncertainty. A novelty of this work is that it extends DRO to online optimization problems subject to a distributionally uncertain dynamical system constraint, handled via a control-dependent ambiguity set that leads to online-tractable optimization with probabilistic guarantees on regret bounds. Further, we introduce an online version of Nesterov's accelerated-gradient algorithm, and analyze its performance to solve this class of problems via dissipativity theory.</description>

      <title>Ammann Bars for Octagonal Tilings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.13973v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ammann bars are formed by segments (decorations) on the tiles of a tiling such that forming straight lines with them while tiling forces non-periodicity. Only a few cases are known, starting with Robert Ammann's observations on Penrose tiles, but there is no general explanation or construction. In this article we propose a general method for cut and project tilings based on the notion of subperiods and we illustrate it with an aperiodic set of 36 decorated prototiles related to what we called Cyrenaic tilings.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of buyer populations in fresh product markets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on empirical evidences and previous studies, we introduce and mathematically study a perception-driven model for the dynamics of buyer populations in markets of perishable goods. Buyer behaviours are driven partly by some loyalty to the sellers that they previously purchased at, and partly by the sensitivity to the intrinsic attractiveness of each seller in the market. On the other hand, the sellers update they attractiveness in time according to the difference between the volume of their clientele and the mean volume of buyers in the market, optimising either their profit when this difference is favourable or their competitiveness otherwise. While this negative feedback mechanism is a source of instability that promotes oscillatory behaviour, our analysis identifies the critical features of the dynamics that are responsible for the asymptotic stability of the stationary states, both in their immediate neighbourhood and globally in phase space. Altogether, this study provides mathematical insights into the consequences of introducing feedback into buyer-seller interactions in such markets, with emphasis on identifying conditions for long term constancy of clientele volumes.</description>

      <title>A Payne-Whitham model of urban traffic networks in the presence of traffic lights and its application to traffic optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urban road transport is a major civilisational and economic challenge, affecting the quality of life and economic activity. Addressing these challenges requires a multidisciplinary approach and sustainable urban planning strategies to mitigate the negative effects of traffic in cities. In this paper, we introduce an extension of one of the most popular macroscopic traffic simulation models, the Payne-Whitham model. We investigate how this model, originally designed to model highway traffic on straight road segments, can be adapted to more realistic conditions with arbitrary road network graphs and multiple intersections with traffic signals. Furthermore, we showcase the practical application of this extension in experiments aimed at optimising traffic signal settings. For computational reasons, these experiments involve the adoption of surrogate models for approximating our extended Payne-Whitham model, and subsequently, we utilise the Differential Evolution optimization algorithm, resulting in the identification of traffic signal settings that enhance the average speed of cars and decrease the total length of queues, thereby facilitating smoother traffic flow.</description>

      <title>Bayesian identification of nonseparable Hamiltonians with multiplicative noise using deep learning and reduced-order modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12476v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a structure-preserving Bayesian approach for learning nonseparable Hamiltonian systems using stochastic dynamic models allowing for statistically-dependent, vector-valued additive and multiplicative measurement noise. The approach is comprised of three main facets. First, we derive a Gaussian filter for a statistically-dependent, vector-valued, additive and multiplicative noise model that is needed to evaluate the likelihood within the Bayesian posterior. Second, we develop a novel algorithm for cost-effective application of Bayesian system identification to high-dimensional systems. Third, we demonstrate how structure-preserving methods can be incorporated into the proposed framework, using nonseparable Hamiltonians as an illustrative system class. We assess the method's performance based on the forecasting accuracy of a model estimated from single-trajectory data. We compare the Bayesian method to a state-of-the-art machine learning method on a canonical nonseparable Hamiltonian model and a chaotic double pendulum model with small, noisy training datasets. The results show that using the Bayesian posterior as a training objective can yield upwards of 724 times improvement in Hamiltonian mean squared error using training data with up to 10% multiplicative noise compared to a standard training objective. Lastly, we demonstrate the utility of the novel algorithm for parameter estimation of a 64-dimensional model of the spatially-discretized nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with data corrupted by up to 20% multiplicative noise.</description>

      <title>On potentials whose level sets are orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A level orbit of a mechanical Hamiltonian system is a solution of Newton equation that is contained in a level set of the potential energy. In 2003, Mark Levi asked for a characterization of the smooth potential energy functions on the plane with the property that any point on the plane lies on a level orbit; we call such functions Levi potentials. The basic examples are the radial monotone increasing smooth functions. In this paper we show that any Levi potential that is analytic or has totally path-disconnected critical set must be radial. Nevertheless, we show that every compact convex subset of the plane is the critical set of a Levi potential. A crucial observation for these theorems is that, outside the critical set, the family of level sets of a Levi potential forms a solution of the inverse curvature flow.</description>

      <title>On Strong Bounds for Trotter and Zeno Product Formulas with Bosonic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01422v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Trotter product formula and the quantum Zeno effect are both indispensable tools for constructing time-evolutions using experimentally feasible building blocks. In this work, we discuss assumptions under which quantitative bounds can be proven in the strong operator topology on Banach spaces and provide natural bosonic examples. Specially, we assume the existence of a continuously embedded Banach space, which relatively bounds the involved generators and creates an invariant subspace of the limiting semigroup with a stable restriction. The slightly stronger assumption of admissible subspaces is well-recognized in the realm of hyperbolic evolution systems (time-dependent semigroups), to which the results are extended. By assuming access to a hierarchy of continuously embedded Banach spaces, Suzuki-higher-order bounds can be demonstrated. In bosonic applications, these embedded Banach spaces naturally arise through the number operator, leading to a diverse set of examples encompassing notable instances such as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup and multi-photon driven dissipation used in bosonic error correction.</description>
