      <title>Comb-referenced Doppler-free spectrometry of the $^{200}$Hg and $^{202}$Hg intercombination line at 254 nm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on precision spectroscopy of the 6s$^2$ $^1$S$_0\to$6s6p $^3$P$_1$ intercombination line of mercury in the deep ultraviolet, by means of a frequency-comb referenced, wavelength-modulated, saturated absorption technique. This method allowed us to perform sub-Doppler investigations with an absolute frequency axis at 254 nm, while ensuring a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio. The absolute line center frequencies of the $^{200}$Hg and $^{202}$Hg bosonic isotopes were measured with a global uncertainty of 8 and 15 kHz (namely, 6.8$\times$10$^{-12}$ and 1.3$\times$10$^{-11}$, in relative terms), respectively, the statistical and systematic components being significantly reduced as compared to past determinations. This remarkable result was achieved also thanks to an in-depth study of the AC stark effect. Furthermore, we found the most accurate $^{200}$Hg-$^{202}$Hg isotope shift ever obtained before, namely, $5295570\pm15_{stat}\pm8_{syst}$ kHz.</description>

      <title>Exact Solvability Of Entanglement For Arbitrary Initial State in an Infinite-Range Floquet System</title>

Abstract: Sharma and Bhosale [\href{https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.014412}{Phys. Rev. B \textbf{109}, 014412 (2024)}; \href{https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.064313}{Phys. Rev. B \textbf{110}, 064313,(2024)}] recently introduced an $N$-spin Floquet model with infinite-range Ising interactions. There, we have shown that the model exhibits the signatures of quantum integrability for specific parameter values $J=1,1/2$ and $\tau=\pi/4$. We have found analytically the eigensystem and the time evolution of the unitary operator for finite values of $N$ up to $12$ qubits. We have calculated the reduced density matrix, its eigensystem, time-evolved linear entropy, and the time-evolved concurrence for the initial states $\ket{0,0}$ and $\ket{\pi/2,-\pi/2}$. For the general case $N&gt;12$, we have provided sufficient numerical evidences for the signatures of quantum integrability, such as the degenerate spectrum, the exact periodic nature of entanglement dynamics, and the time-evolved unitary operator. In this paper, we have extended these calculations to arbitrary initial state $\ket{\theta_0,\phi_0}$, such that $\theta_0 \in [0,\pi]$ and $\phi_0 \in [-\pi,\pi]$. Along with that, we have analytically calculated the expression for the average linear entropy for arbitrary initial states. We numerically find that the average value of time-evolved concurrence for arbitrary initial states decreases with $N$, implying the multipartite nature of entanglement. We numerically show that the values $\langle S\rangle/S_{Max} \rightarrow 1$ for Ising strength ($J\neq1,1/2$), while for $J=1$ and $1/2$, it deviates from $1$ for arbitrary initial states even though the thermodynamic limit does not exist in our model. This deviation is shown to be a signature of integrability in earlier studies where the thermodynamic limit exist.</description>

      <title>Thorium in Kilonova Spectra: Exploring the Heaviest Detectable Element</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kilonova spectra provide us with the direct information of r-process nucleosynthesis in neutron star mergers. In this paper, we study the signatures of elements beyond the third r-process peak expected to be produced in neutron-rich ejecta in the photospheric spectra of kilonova. Ra II, Ac III, and Th III are our candidates because they have a small number of valence electrons and low-lying energy levels, which tend to result in strong absorption features. We systematically calculate the strength of bound-bound transitions of these candidates by constructing the line list based on the available atomic database. We find that Th III is the most promising species showing strong transitions at the NIR wavelengths. By performing radiative transfer simulations, we find that Th III produces broad absorption features at ~18000 A in the spectra when the mass ratio of actinides to lanthanides is larger than the solar r-process ratio and the mass fraction of lanthanides is $\lesssim 6\times10^{-4}$. Our models demonstrate that the Th feature may be detectable if the bulk of the ejecta in the line-forming region is dominated by relatively light r-process elements with the mixture of a small fraction of very neutron-rich material. Such conditions may be realized in the mergers of unequal-mass neutron stars or black hole-neutron star binaries. To detect the Th absorption features, the observations from the space (such as JWST) or high-altitude sites are important as the wavelength region of the Th features is overlapped with that affected by the strong telluric absorption.</description>

      <title>Photonic Spin Hall Effect in a Four-Level Coherent Control Scheme within Cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the manipulation of the photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) using a four-level closed coherent control coupling scheme in cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). The atomic system is configured to function as a combined Tripod and $\Lambda$ (CTL), or $\Lambda$, or $N$ level model by manipulating the control field strengths and their relative phases. The system demonstrates multiple transparency windows in the CTL configuration, allowing the tunable PSHE over the wider range of probe field detuning. At probe field resonance, the $\Lambda$-type system exhibits PSHE similar to the CTL system, showing enhanced PSHE due to zero absorption and dispersion. Control field strengths and atomic density show no influence on PSHE. Our findings reveal that atomic density and strength of control fields significantly influence PSHE in the $N$-type model at resonance, offering additional control parameters for PSHE manipulation. The results are equally valid and applicable to direct $\Lambda$-type and N-type atomic systems, making the findings broadly relevant in cavity QED. The demonstrated tunability via probe field detuning, control fields, and atomic density paves the way for advanced optical control and enhanced precision in cavity QED devices.</description>
