      <title>Cohomology of Lipschitz-valued cocycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the set of H\"older continuous cocycles over a finite shift acting on a group of Lipschitz homeomorphisms Lip(G), where G is a metrisable compact topological group. We establish that two dominated cocycles that coincide over periodic points of the base are cohomologous, with the conjugacy being H\"older continuous. Moreover, we prove that, under an additional condition, the existence of a measurable conjugacy implies the existence of a H\"older continuous conjugacy between the cocycles.</description>

      <title>Strong Lyapunov functions for rough systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a Lyapunov function method to investigate the long term behavior of autonomous ordinary differential equations under a multiplicative noise of H\"older continuity, using rough path calculus and the framework of random dynamical systems. By introducing the concept of {\it strong Lyapunov functions}, we conclude that if such a function exists for the drift then the perturbed system admits the global random pullback attractor which is upper semi-continuous w.r.t. the dyadic approximation of the noise. Several applications are studied, such as the pendulum and the Fitzhugh Nagumo neuro-system. We also prove that strong Lyapunov functions could be approximated in practice by Lyapunov neural networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an example announced in the title. It answers in a strong way a well-known open problem in topological dynamics. In fact our construction is an existence theorem. It is based on a Borsuk-Ulam type theorem whose proof heavily relies on p-adic completions of G-complexes and the equivariant Sullivan conjecture.</description>

      <title>Fourier decay and absolute continuity for typical homogeneous self-similar measures in ${\mathbb R}^d$ for $d\ge 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider iterated function systems (IFS) in ${\mathbb R}^d$ for $d\ge 3$ of the form $\{f_j(x) = \lambda {\mathcal O} x + a_j\}_{j=0}^m$, with $a_0=0$ and $m\ge 1$. Here $\lambda\in (0,1)$ is the contraction ratio and ${\mathcal O}$ is an orthogonal matrix. Given a positive probability vector $p$, there is a unique invariant (stationary) measure for the IFS, called (in this case) a homogeneous self-similar measure, which we denote $\mu(\lambda {\mathcal O}, {\mathcal D}, p)$, where ${\mathcal D} = \{a_0,\ldots,a_m\}$ is the set of ``vector digits''. We obtain two results on Fourier decay for such measures. First we show that if ${\mathcal D}$ spans ${\mathbb R}^d$, then for every fixed ${\mathcal O}$ and $p$ the measure $\mu(\lambda {\mathcal O}, {\mathcal D}, p)$ has power Fourier decay (equivalently, positive Fourier dimension) for all but a zero-Hausdorff dimension set of $\lambda$. In our second result we do not impose any restrictions on ${\mathcal D}$, other than the necessary one of affine irreducibility, and obtain power Fourier decay for almost all homogeneous self-similar measures; however, only for even $d\ge 4$. Combined with recent work of Corso and Shmerkin [arXiv:2409.04608] , these results imply absolute continuity for almost all self-similar measures under the same assumptions, in the super-critical parameter region.</description>

      <title>Real Rational Surface Automorphisms : Positivity and Linearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the real dynamics of a family of rational surface automorphisms obtained from quadratic birational maps of $\pcc$ that preserve a cuspidal cubic and whose critical orbits have lengths $(1,m,n)$ with $1+m+n\ge 10$. Passing to the real locus and cutting along the invariant cubic, we obtain a diffeomorphism of an orientable surface whose fundamental group is free.
  Our key device is a finitely generated invariant, positive semigroup $S_{m,n}$ in the fundamental group on which an iterate of induced action acts by concatenation without cancellation. This positivity yields a nonnegative primitive transition matrix, so Perron-Frobenius theory supplies an explicit exponential growth rate $\lambda&gt;1$ for the induced action on the fundamental group. Consequently, the real map has positive topological entropy. We package the combinatorics of the generators in a ``Core-Tail Induction Principle," which allows us to treat simultaneously seven orbit-data families with only finite base checks. Finally, using Bestvina-Handel and the Dehn-Nielsen-Baer correspondence, we show that the induced outer automorphism with $m+n$ odd is realized by a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism of the cut surface.</description>

      <title>Geometric, topological and dynamical properties of conformally symplectic systems, normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds, and scattering maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformally symplectic diffeomorphisms $f:M \rightarrow M$ transform a symplectic form $\omega$ on a manifold $M$ into a multiple of itself, $f^* \omega = \eta \omega$. We assume $\omega$ is bounded, as some of the results may fail otherwise.
  We show that there are deep interactions between the topological properties of the manifold, the dynamical properties of the map, and the geometry of invariant manifolds.
  We show that, when the symplectic form is not exact, the possible conformal factors $\eta$ are related to topological properties of the manifold. For some manifolds the conformal factors are restricted to be algebraic numbers.
  We also find relations between dynamical properties (relations between growth rate of vectors and $\eta$) and symplectic properties.
  Normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds (NHIM) and their (un)stable manifolds are important landmarks that organize long-term dynamical behaviour. We prove that a NHIM is symplectic if and only if the rates satisfy certain pairing rules and if and only if the rates and the conformal factor satisfy certain (natural) inequalities.
  Homoclinic excursions to NHIMs are quantitatively described by scattering maps. These maps give the trajectory asymptotic in the future as a function of the trajectory asymptotic in the past. We prove that the scattering maps are symplectic even if the dynamics is dissipative. We also show that if the symplectic form is exact, then the scattering maps are exact, even if the dynamics is not exact. We give a variational interpretation of scattering maps in the conformally symplectic setting.
  We also show that similar properties of NHIMs and scattering maps hold in the case when $\omega$ is presymplectic. In dynamical systems with many rates (e.g., quasi-integrable systems near multiple resonances), pre-symplectic geometries appear naturally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this expository paper, we provide an intuition and illustration-driven overview of two recent results that tie the dynamics of certain homeomorphisms of infinite-type surfaces, called end-periodic homeomorphisms, to the geometry of their associated (compactified) mapping tori. These results are analogues of a theorem of Brock in the finite-type setting for mapping tori of pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.04129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the existence of a full spectrum of Lyapunov exponents for memoryless random dynamical systems with absorption. To this end, we crucially embed the process conditioned to never being absorbed, the $Q$-process, into the framework of random dynamical systems, allowing us to study multiplicative ergodic properties. We show that the finite-time Lyapunov exponents converge in conditioned probability and apply our results to iterated function systems and stochastic differential equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08884v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with random $S$-adic systems arising from an i.i.d. sequence of unimodular substitutions. Using equidistribution results of Benoist and Quint, we show in Theorem 3.3 that, under some natural assumptions, if the Lyapunov exponent of the spectral cocycle is strictly less that 1/2 of the Lyapunov exponent of the random walk on $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ driven by the sequence of substitution matrices, then almost surely the spectrum of the $S$-adic $\mathbb{Z}$-action is singular with respect to any (fixed in advance) continuous measure. Finally, the appendix (by Pascal Hubert and Carlos Matheus) discusses the weak-mixing property for random $S$-adic systems associated to the family of substitutions introduced in Example 4.1.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the irregular set of any continuous observable for a class of skew product transformations, which is driven by a uniquely ergodic homeomorphism system $(\Omega,\mathbb{P},\theta)$ and satisfies Anosov and toplogical mixing on fibers property. We prove that if the irregular set of any continuous observable is nonempty on a fiber, then the irregular set must be nonempty, residual, and carry full fiber topological entropy on $\mathbb{P}$-a.e. fibers. The orbit-gluing technique provided by the fiber specification property are utilized.</description>

      <title>On the Lyapunov spectrum of the twisted cocycle for substitutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14308v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to the properties of a complex matrix ``twisted,'' otherwise called ``spectral,'' cocycle, associated with substitution dynamical systems. Following a recent finding of Rajabzadeh and Safaee [arXiv:2501.16824] of an invariant section for the twisted cocycle, we indicate that this implies presence of a zero Lyapunov exponent. This has consequences for the spectral properties of substitution dynamical systems; in particular, this extends the scope and simplifies the proof of singular spectrum for a large class of substitutions on two symbols. We also obtain some results on positivity of the top exponent. In the appendix we compute the Lebesgue almost everywhere local dimension of spectral measures of some ``simple'' test functions, for almost every irrational rotation. This sheds some light on the earlier work of Bufetov and the author, relating the local dimension of spectral measures to pointwise Lyapunov exponents of the twisted cocycle. It should be noted that the paper has some (mutually acknowledged) overlap with [arXiv:2501.16824, Appendix].</description>

      <title>Real-time blow-up and connection graphs of rational vector fields on the Riemann sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by pioneering work of Ky\^uya Masuda in the 1980s, only much more recent PDE studies address global boundedness versus finite-time blow-up in complex time. The two phenomena are related by passage from real to purely imaginary time. As a most simplistic ODE example, we study scalar rational vector fields \begin{equation*} \label{*} \dot{w}=P(w)/Q(w), \tag{*} \end{equation*} for complex polynomials $P,Q$. We impose mild generic nondegeneracy conditions, including simplicity of poles and hyperbolicity of zeros. Generically, the real-time dynamics become gradient-like Morse. Poles play the role of hyperbolic saddle points. At poles, however, solutions may blow up in finite time.
  On the Riemann sphere $w\in\widehat{\mathbb{C}}$, we classify the resulting global dynamics up to $C^0$ orbit equivalence, in real time. This relies on a global description of the connection graph of blow-up orbits, from sources towards saddles/poles, in forward time. Time reversal identifies the dual graph of blow-down orbits. We show that the blow-up and blow-down graphs of (*) realize all finite multi-graphs on $\mathbb{S}^2$, equivalently.
  The purely polynomial case $Q=1$ realizes all planar trees, alias diagrams of non-intersecting circle chords. The anti-holomorphic cousin $P=1$ realizes all noncrossing trees with vertices restricted to circles. This classification provide combinatorial counts for the number of global phase portraits, which only depend on the degrees of $P$ and $Q$, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.05066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the second paper in the series to study the generic dynamics of mean curvature flows. We study the initial perturbation of mean curvature flows, whose first singularity is modeled by an asymptotically conical shrinker. The noncompactness of the limiting shrinker creates essential difficulties. We introduce the Feynman-Kac formula to get precise asymptotic behaviour of the linearized rescaled mean curvature equation along an orbit. We also develop the invariant cone method for the noncompact setting for the local dynamics near the shrinker. As a consequence, we prove that after a generic initial perturbation, the perturbed rescaled mean curvature flow avoids the conical singularity.</description>

      <title>The special concave toric domain for the rotating Kepler problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.04581v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Rotating Kepler Problem (RKP) arises as a fundamental model in celestial mechanics, appearing as a limiting case of the circular restricted three-body problem. It offers a tractable yet rich framework for studying periodic orbits, energy levels, and symplectic structures. In this work, we investigate the RKP for energy values less than or equal to the critical threshold -3/2. Using the Ligon-Schaaf and Levi-Civita symplectic regularizations, we identify a bounded component of the RKP phase space. Within this setting, we construct a special concave toric domain (SCTD) tailored to the RKP, which provides a concrete geometric framework for computing embedded contact homology (ECH) capacities below the critical energy. The SCTD enables a rigorous analysis of symplectic embedding problems and energy constraints in dynamical systems. Furthermore, we introduce a combinatorial tree structure, inspired by the Stern-Brocot tree, that encodes energy data and facilitates the computation of ECH capacities on the bounded component. These results advance the understanding of symplectic embeddings in celestial mechanics and provide new tools for the study of Hamiltonian dynamics in rotating systems.</description>

      <title>The Markoff and Lagrange spectra on the Hecke group H4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.05441v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Markoff spectrum and the Lagrange spectrum on the Hecke group $\mathbf H_4$. They are identical with the Markoff and Lagrange spectra of the unit circle. The Markoff spectrum on $\mathbf H_4$ is also known as the Markoff spectrum of index 2 sublattices by Vulakh and the Markoff spectrum of 2-minimal forms or $C$-minimal forms by Schmidt. They characterized the spectrum up to the first accumulation point, independently. We show that, after the first accumulation point, both spectra have positive Hausdorff dimension. Then we find gaps in the spectra and give a bound on Hall's ray.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of Kleinian groups via self-joinings: measure theoretic criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03552v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $n, m\ge 2$. Let $\Gamma&lt;\text{SO}^\circ(n+1,1)$ be a Zariski dense convex cocompact subgroup and $\Lambda\subset\mathbb{S}^n$ be its limit set. Let $\rho : \Gamma \to \text{SO}^\circ(m+1,1)$ be a Zariski dense convex cocompact faithful representation and $f:\Lambda\to \mathbb{S}^{m}$ the $\rho$-boundary map. Let $$\Lambda_f:= \bigcup \left\{ C \cap \Lambda : \begin{matrix} C \subset \mathbb{S}^n \text{ is a circle such that} \\ f(C \cap \Lambda) \text{ is contained in a proper sphere } \text{in } \mathbb{S}^m \end{matrix} \right\}.$$ When there exists at least one $\Lambda$-doubly stable circle in $\mathbb{S}^n$ (e.g., $\Omega=\mathbb{S}^n-\Lambda$ is disconnected), we prove the following dichotomy: $$\text{either}\quad \Lambda_f= \Lambda \quad \text{ or } \quad \mathcal{H}^{\delta}(\Lambda_f) =0,$$ where $\mathcal{H}^\delta$ is the Hausdorff measure of dimension $\delta=\dim_H \Lambda$. Moreover, in the former case, we have $n=m$ and $\rho$ is a conjugation by a M\"obius transformation on $\mathbb{S}^n$. Our proof uses ergodic theory for directional diagonal flows and conformal measure theory of discrete subgroups of higher rank semisimple Lie groups, applied to the self-joining subgroup $\Gamma_\rho=(\operatorname{id} \times \rho)(\Gamma) &lt; \text{SO}^\circ(n+1,1)\times \text{SO}^\circ(m+1,1)$. We also obtain an analogous theorem for any divergence-type subgroup.</description>

      <title>A lower bound on volumes of end-periodic mapping tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a lower bound on the volume of the compactified mapping torus of a strongly irreducible end-periodic homeomorphism f. This result, together with work of Field, Kim, Leininger, and Loving, shows that the volume of the compactified mapping torus of f is comparable to the translation length of f on a connected component of the pants graph, extending work of Brock in the finite-type setting on volumes of mapping tori of pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic groups satisfy the Boone-Higman conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06224v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 1973 Boone-Higman conjecture predicts that every finitely generated group with solvable word problem embeds in a finitely presented simple group. In this paper, we show that hyperbolic groups satisfy this conjecture, that is, each hyperbolic group embeds in some finitely presented simple group. This shows that the conjecture holds in the "generic" case for finitely presented groups. Our key tool is a new family of groups, which we call "rational similarity groups (RSGs)", that is interesting in its own right. We prove that every hyperbolic group embeds in a full, contracting RSG, and every full, contracting RSG embeds in a finitely presented simple group, thus establishing the result. Another consequence of our work is that all contracting self-similar groups satisfy the Boone-Higman conjecture.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic degree and its application to Zariski dense orbit conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for a dominant rational self-map $f$ on a quasi-projective variety defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, there is a point whose $f$-orbit is well-defined and its arithmetic degree is arbitrarily close to the first dynamical degree of $f$. As an application, we prove that Zariski dense orbit conjecture holds for a birational map defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ whose first dynamical degree is strictly larger than its third dynamical degree. In particular, the conjecture holds for birational maps on threefolds whose first dynamical is degree greater than $1$.</description>

      <title>Time-Scale Coupling Between States and Parameters in Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how gating mechanisms in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) implicitly induce adaptive learning-rate behavior, even when training is carried out with a fixed, global learning rate. This effect arises from the coupling between state-space time scales--parametrized by the gates--and parameter-space dynamics during gradient descent. By deriving exact Jacobians for leaky-integrator and gated RNNs, we obtain a first-order expansion that makes explicit how constant, scalar, and multi-dimensional gates reshape gradient propagation, modulate effective step sizes, and introduce anisotropy in parameter updates. These findings reveal that gates not only control information flow, but also act as data-driven preconditioners that adapt optimization trajectories in parameter space. We further draw formal analogies with learning-rate schedules, momentum, and adaptive methods such as Adam, pointing to possible redundancies. Empirical simulations corroborate these claims: in canonical synthetic sequence tasks (adding, copy) we show that gates induce lag-dependent effective learning rates and directional concentration of gradient flow, with multi-gate models matching or exceeding the anisotropic structure produced by Adam. These results highlight that optimizer-driven and gate-driven adaptivity are complementary but not equivalent mechanisms. Overall, this work provides a unified dynamical-systems perspective on how gating couples state evolution with parameter updates, explaining why gated architectures achieve robust trainability and stability in practice.</description>
