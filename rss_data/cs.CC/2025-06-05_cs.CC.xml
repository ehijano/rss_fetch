      <title>Hive is PSPACE-Hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hive is an abstract strategy game played on a table with hexagonal pieces. First published in 2001, it was and continues to be highly popular among both casual and competitive players. In this paper, we show that for a suitably generalized version of the game, the computational problem of determining whether a given player in an arbitrary position has a winning strategy is PSPACE-hard. We do this by reduction from a variant of Generalized Geography we call Formula Game Geography.</description>

      <title>The Line Traveling Salesman and Repairman Problem with Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider extensions of both the Line Traveling Salesman and Line Traveling Repairman Problem, in which a single server must service a set of clients located along a line segment under the assumption that not only the server, but also the clients can move along the line and seek to collaborate with the server to speed up service times. We analyze the structure of different problem versions and identify hard and easy subproblems by building up on prior results from the literature. Specifically, we investigate problem versions with zero or general processing times, clients that are either slower or faster than the server, as well as different time window restrictions. Collectively, these results map out the complexity landscape of the Line Traveling Salesman and Repairman Problem with collaboration.</description>

      <title>A Linear Kernel for Independent Set Reconfiguration in Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fix a positive integer $r$, and a graph $G$ that is $K_{3,r}$-minor-free. Let $I_s$ and $I_t$ be two independent sets in $G$, each of size $k$. We begin with a ``token'' on each vertex of $I_s$ and seek to move all tokens to $I_t$, by repeated ``token jumping'', removing a single token from one vertex and placing it on another vertex. We require that each intermediate arrangement of tokens again specifies an independent set of size $k$. Given $G$, $I_s$, and $I_t$, we ask whether there exists a sequence of token jumps that transforms $I_s$ into $I_t$. When $k$ is part of the input, this problem is known to be PSPACE-complete. However, it was shown by Ito, Kami\'nski, and Ono (2014) to be fixed-parameter tractable. That is, when $k$ is fixed, the problem can be solved in time polynomial in the order of $G$.
  Here we strengthen the upper bound on the running time in terms of $k$ by showing that the problem has a kernel of size linear in $k$. More precisely, we transform an arbitrary input problem on a $K_{3,r}$-minor-free graph into an equivalent problem on a ($K_{3,r}$-minor-free) graph with order $O(k)$. This answers positively a question of Bousquet, Mouawad, Nishimura, and Siebertz (2024) and improves the recent quadratic kernel of Cranston, M\"{u}hlenthaler, and Peyrille (2024+). For planar graphs, we further strengthen this upper bound to get a kernel of size at most $42k$.</description>

      <title>Computational Complexity of Non-Hermitian Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the computational power of non-Hermitian quantum dynamics, i.e., conditional time evolutions that arise when a quantum system is monitored and one postselects on a particular measurement record. We establish an approximate equivalence between post-selection and arbitrary non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Namely, first we establish hardness in the following sense: Let $U=e^{-iHt}$ be an NH gate on $n$ qubits whose smallest and largest singular values differ by at least $2^{-\text{poly}(n)}$. Together with any universal set of unitary gates, the ability to apply such a gate lets one efficiently emulate postselection. The resulting model decides every language in PostBQP; hence, under standard complexity conjectures, fully scalable NH quantum computers are unlikely to be engineered. Second, we establish upper bounds which show that conversely, any non-Hermitian evolution can be written as a unitary on a system-meter pair followed by postselecting the meter. This ``purification'' is compact -- it introduces only $O(\delta^{2})$ Trotter error per time step $\delta$ -- so any NH model whose purification lies in a strongly simulable unitary family (e.g., Clifford, matchgate, or low-bond-dimension tensor-network circuits) remains efficiently simulable. Thus, non-Hermitian physics neither guarantees a quantum advantage nor precludes efficient classical simulation: its complexity is controlled by the singular-value radius of the evolution operator and by the structure of its unitary purification.</description>

      <title>Minimizing the Arithmetic and Communication Complexity of Jacobi's Method for Eigenvalues and Singular Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze several versions of Jacobi's method for the symmetric eigenvalue problem. Our goal throughout is to reduce the asymptotic cost of the algorithm as much as possible, as measured by the number of arithmetic operations performed and associated (sequential or parallel) communication, i.e., the amount of data moved between slow and fast memory or between processors in a network. In producing rigorous complexity bounds, we allow our algorithms to be built on both classic $O(n^3)$ matrix multiplication and fast, Strassen-like $O(n^{\omega_0})$ alternatives. In the classical setting, we show that a blocked implementation of Jacobi's method attains the communication lower bound for $O(n^3)$ matrix multiplication (and is therefore expected to be communication optimal among $O(n^3)$ methods). In the fast setting, we demonstrate that a recursive version of blocked Jacobi can go even further, reaching essentially optimal complexity in both measures. We also discuss Jacobi-based SVD algorithms and a parallel version of block Jacobi, showing that analogous complexity bounds apply.</description>

      <title>Training Cross-Morphology Embodied AI Agents: From Practical Challenges to Theoretical Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While theory and practice are often seen as separate domains, this article shows that theoretical insight is essential for overcoming real-world engineering barriers. We begin with a practical challenge: training a cross-morphology embodied AI policy that generalizes across diverse robot morphologies. We formalize this as the Heterogeneous Embodied Agent Training (HEAT) problem and prove it reduces to a structured Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) that is PSPACE-complete. This result explains why current reinforcement learning pipelines break down under morphological diversity, due to sequential training constraints, memory-policy coupling, and data incompatibility. We further explore Collective Adaptation, a distributed learning alternative inspired by biological systems. Though NEXP-complete in theory, it offers meaningful scalability and deployment benefits in practice. This work illustrates how computational theory can illuminate system design trade-offs and guide the development of more robust, scalable embodied AI. For practitioners and researchers to explore this problem, the implementation code of this work has been made publicly available at https://github.com/airs-admin/HEAT</description>

      <title>Complexity and Manipulation of International Kidney Exchange Programmes with Country-Specific Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04092v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kidney Exchange Programmes (KEPs) facilitate the exchange of kidneys, and larger pools of recipient-donor pairs tend to yield proportionally more transplants, leading to the proposal of international KEPs (IKEPs). However, as studied by \citet{mincu2021ip}, practical limitations must be considered in IKEPs to ensure that countries remain willing to participate. Thus, we study IKEPs with country-specific parameters, represented by a tuple $\Gamma$, restricting the selected transplants to be feasible for the countries to conduct, e.g., imposing an upper limit on the number of consecutive exchanges within a country's borders. We provide a complete complexity dichotomy for the problem of finding a feasible (according to the constraints given by $\Gamma$) cycle packing with the maximum number of transplants, for every possible $\Gamma$. We also study the potential for countries to misreport their parameters to increase their allocation. As manipulation can harm the total number of transplants, we propose a novel individually rational and incentive compatible mechanism $\mathcal{M}_{\text{order}}$. We first give a theoretical approximation ratio for $\mathcal{M}_{\text{order}}$ in terms of the number of transplants, and show that the approximation ratio of $\mathcal{M}_{\text{order}}$ is asymptotically optimal. We then use simulations which suggest that, in practice, the performance of $\mathcal{M}_{\text{order}}$ is significantly better than this worst-case ratio.</description>

      <title>Pseudorandom bits for non-commutative programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain new explicit pseudorandom generators for several computational models involving groups. Our main results are as follows:
  1. We consider read-once group-products over a finite group $G$, i.e., tests of the form $\prod_{i=1}^n g_i^{x_i}$ where $g_i\in G$, a special case of read-once permutation branching programs. We give generators with optimal seed length $c_G \log(n/\varepsilon)$ over any $p$-group. The proof uses the small-bias plus noise paradigm, but derandomizes the noise to avoid the recursion in previous work. Our generator works when the bits are read in any order. Previously for any non-commutative group the best seed length was $\ge\log n\log(1/\varepsilon)$, even for a fixed order.
  2. We give a reduction that "lifts" suitable generators for group products over $G$ to a generator that fools width-$w$ block products, i.e., tests of the form $\prod g_i^{f_i}$ where the $f_i$ are arbitrary functions on disjoint blocks of $w$ bits. Block products generalize several previously studied classes. The reduction applies to groups that are mixing in a representation-theoretic sense that we identify.
  3. Combining (2) with (1) and other works we obtain new generators for block products over the quaternions or over any commutative group, with nearly optimal seed length. In particular, we obtain generators for read-once polynomials modulo any fixed $m$ with nearly optimal seed length. Previously this was known only for $m=2$.
  4. We give a new generator for products over "mixing groups." The construction departs from previous work and uses representation theory. For constant error, we obtain optimal seed length, improving on previous work (which applied to any group).
  This paper identifies a challenge in the area that is reminiscent of a roadblock in circuit complexity -- handling composite moduli -- and points to several classes of groups to be attacked next.</description>

      <title>On the Unprovability of Circuit Size Bounds in Intuitionistic $\mathsf{S}^1_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11841v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there is a constant $k$ such that Buss's intuitionistic theory $\mathsf{IS}^1_2$ does not prove that SAT requires co-nondeterministic circuits of size at least $n^k$. To our knowledge, this is the first unconditional unprovability result in bounded arithmetic in the context of worst-case fixed-polynomial size circuit lower bounds. We complement this result by showing that the upper bound $\mathsf{NP} \subseteq \mathsf{coNSIZE}[n^k]$ is unprovable in $\mathsf{IS}^1_2$.
  In order to establish our main result, we obtain new unconditional lower bounds against refuters that might be of independent interest. In particular, we show that there is no efficient refuter for the lower bound $\mathsf{NP} \nsubseteq \mathsf{i.o}\text{-}\mathsf{coNP}/\mathsf{poly}$, addressing in part a question raised by Atserias (2006).</description>

      <title>Fermionic Independent Set and Laplacian of an independence complex are QMA-hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Independent Set is a well known NP-hard optimization problem. In this work, we define a fermionic generalization of the Independent Set problem and prove that the optimization problem is QMA-hard in a $k$-particle subspace using perturbative gadgets. We discuss how the Fermionic Independent Set is related to the problem of computing the minimum eigenvalue of the $k^{\text{th}}$-Laplacian of an independence complex of a vertex weighted graph. Consequently, we use the same perturbative gadget to prove QMA-hardness of the later problem resolving an open conjecture from arXiv:2311.17234 and give the first example of a natural topological data analysis problem that is QMA-hard.</description>
