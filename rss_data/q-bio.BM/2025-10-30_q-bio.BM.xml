      <title>Modelling ion channels with a view towards identifiability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aggregated Markov models provide a flexible framework for stochastic dynamics that develops on multiple timescales. For example, Markov models for ion channels often consist of multiple open and closed state to account for "slow" and "fast" openings and closings of the channel. The approach is a popular tool in the construction of mechanistic models of ion channels - instead of viewing model states as generators of sojourn times of a certain characteristic length, each individual model state is interpreted as a representation of a distinct biophysical state. We will review the properties of aggregated Markov models and discuss the implications for mechanistic modelling. First, we show how the aggregated Markov models with a given number of states can be calculated using P\'olya enumeration However, models with $n_O$ open and $n_C$ closed states that exceed the maximum number $2 n_O n_C$ of parameters are non-identifiable. We will present two derivations for this classical result and investigate non-identifiability further via a detailed analysis of the non-identifiable fully connected three-state model. Finally, we will discuss the implications of non-identifiability for mechanistic modelling of ion channels. We will argue that instead of designing models based on assumed transitions between distinct biophysical states which are modulated by ligand binding, it is preferable to build models based on additional sources of data that give more direct insight into the dynamics of conformational changes.</description>

      <title>RNAGenScape: Property-guided Optimization and Interpolation of mRNA Sequences with Manifold Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: mRNA design and optimization are important in synthetic biology and therapeutic development, but remain understudied in machine learning. Systematic optimization of mRNAs is hindered by the scarce and imbalanced data as well as complex sequence-function relationships. We present RNAGenScape, a property-guided manifold Langevin dynamics framework that iteratively updates mRNA sequences within a learned latent manifold. RNAGenScape combines an organized autoencoder, which structures the latent space by target properties for efficient and biologically plausible exploration, with a manifold projector that contracts each step of update back to the manifold. RNAGenScape supports property-guided optimization and smooth interpolation between sequences, while remaining robust under scarce and undersampled data, and ensuring that intermediate products are close to the viable mRNA manifold. Across three real mRNA datasets, RNAGenScape improves the target properties with high success rates and efficiency, outperforming various generative or optimization methods developed for proteins or non-biological data. By providing continuous, data-aligned trajectories that reveal how edits influence function, RNAGenScape establishes a scalable paradigm for controllable mRNA design and latent space exploration in mRNA sequence modeling.</description>

      <title>Integrating Protein Sequence and Expression Level to Analysis Molecular Characterization of Breast Cancer Subtypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01755v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Breast cancer's complexity and variability pose significant challenges in understanding its progression and guiding effective treatment. This study aims to integrate protein sequence data with expression levels to improve the molecular characterization of breast cancer subtypes and predict clinical outcomes. Using ProtGPT2, a language model specifically designed for protein sequences, we generated embeddings that capture the functional and structural properties of proteins. These embeddings were integrated with protein expression levels to form enriched biological representations, which were analyzed using machine learning methods, such as ensemble K-means for clustering and XGBoost for classification. Our approach enabled the successful clustering of patients into biologically distinct groups and accurately predicted clinical outcomes such as survival and biomarker status, achieving high performance metrics, notably an F1 score of 0.88 for survival and 0.87 for biomarker status prediction. Feature importance analysis identified KMT2C, CLASP2, and MYO1B as key proteins involved in hormone signaling, cytoskeletal remodeling, and therapy resistance in hormone receptor-positive and triple-negative breast cancer, with potential influence on breast cancer subtype behavior and progression. Furthermore, protein-protein interaction networks and correlation analyses revealed functional interdependencies among proteins that may influence the behavior and progression of breast cancer subtypes. These findings suggest that integrating protein sequence and expression data provides valuable insights into tumor biology and has significant potential to enhance personalized treatment strategies in breast cancer care.</description>

      <title>UniSite: The First Cross-Structure Dataset and Learning Framework for End-to-End Ligand Binding Site Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of ligand binding sites for proteins is a fundamental step in Structure-Based Drug Design. Despite notable advances in recent years, existing methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics are confronted with several key challenges: (1) current datasets and methods are centered on individual protein-ligand complexes and neglect that diverse binding sites may exist across multiple complexes of the same protein, introducing significant statistical bias; (2) ligand binding site detection is typically modeled as a discontinuous workflow, employing binary segmentation and subsequent clustering algorithms; (3) traditional evaluation metrics do not adequately reflect the actual performance of different binding site prediction methods. To address these issues, we first introduce UniSite-DS, the first UniProt (Unique Protein)-centric ligand binding site dataset, which contains 4.81 times more multi-site data and 2.08 times more overall data compared to the previously most widely used datasets. We then propose UniSite, the first end-to-end ligand binding site detection framework supervised by set prediction loss with bijective matching. In addition, we introduce Average Precision based on Intersection over Union (IoU) as a more accurate evaluation metric for ligand binding site prediction. Extensive experiments on UniSite-DS and several representative benchmark datasets demonstrate that IoU-based Average Precision provides a more accurate reflection of prediction quality, and that UniSite outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in ligand binding site detection. The dataset and codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/quanlin-wu/unisite.</description>

      <title>AANet: Virtual Screening under Structural Uncertainty via Alignment and Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Virtual screening (VS) is a critical component of modern drug discovery, yet most existing methods--whether physics-based or deep learning-based--are developed around holo protein structures with known ligand-bound pockets. Consequently, their performance degrades significantly on apo or predicted structures such as those from AlphaFold2, which are more representative of real-world early-stage drug discovery, where pocket information is often missing. In this paper, we introduce an alignment-and-aggregation framework to enable accurate virtual screening under structural uncertainty. Our method comprises two core components: (1) a tri-modal contrastive learning module that aligns representations of the ligand, the holo pocket, and cavities detected from structures, thereby enhancing robustness to pocket localization error; and (2) a cross-attention based adapter for dynamically aggregating candidate binding sites, enabling the model to learn from activity data even without precise pocket annotations. We evaluated our method on a newly curated benchmark of apo structures, where it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in blind apo setting, improving the early enrichment factor (EF1%) from 11.75 to 37.19. Notably, it also maintains strong performance on holo structures. These results demonstrate the promise of our approach in advancing first-in-class drug discovery, particularly in scenarios lacking experimentally resolved protein-ligand complexes. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/Wiley-Z/AANet.</description>

      <title>GFlowNets for Learning Better Drug-Drug Interaction Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drug-drug interactions pose a significant challenge in clinical pharmacology, with severe class imbalance among interaction types limiting the effectiveness of predictive models. Common interactions dominate datasets, while rare but critical interactions remain underrepresented, leading to poor model performance on infrequent cases. Existing methods often treat DDI prediction as a binary problem, ignoring class-specific nuances and exacerbating bias toward frequent interactions. To address this, we propose a framework combining Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNet) with Variational Graph Autoencoders (VGAE) to generate synthetic samples for rare classes, improving model balance and generate effective and novel DDI pairs. Our approach enhances predictive performance across interaction types, ensuring better clinical reliability.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Growth Kinetics of Model Biomolecular Condensates Under Passive and Active Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Living cells exhibit a complex organization comprising numerous compartments, among which are RNA- and protein-rich membraneless, liquid-like organelles known as biomolecular condensates. Energy-consuming processes regulate their formation and dissolution, with (de-)phosphorylation by specific enzymes being among the most commonly involved reactions. By employing a model system consisting of a phosphorylatable peptide and homopolymeric RNA, we elucidate how enzymatic activity modulates the growth kinetics and alters the local structure of biomolecular condensates. Under passive condition, time-resolved ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering with synchrotron source reveals a nucleation-driven coalescence mechanism maintained over four decades in time, similar to the coarsening of simple binary fluid mixtures. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations show that peptide-decorated RNA chains assembled shortly after mixing constitute the relevant subunits. In contrast, actively-formed condensates initially display a local mass fractal structure, which gradually matures upon enzymatic activity before condensates undergo coalescence. Both types of condensate eventually reach a steady state but fluorescence recovery after photobleaching indicates a peptide diffusivity twice higher in actively-formed condensates consistent with their loosely-packed local structure. We expect multiscale, integrative approaches implemented with model systems to link effectively the functional properties of membraneless organelles to their formation and dissolution kinetics as regulated by cellular active processes.</description>
