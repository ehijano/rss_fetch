      <title>A critical comparison of the implementation of granular pressure gradient term in Euler-Euler simulation of gas-solid flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical solution of Euler-Euler model using different in-house, open source and commercial software can generate significantly different results, even when the governing equations and the initial and boundary conditions are exactly same. Unfortunately, the underlying reasons have not been identified yet. In this article, three methods for calculating the granular pressure gradient term are presented for two-fluid model of gas-solid flows and implemented implicitly or explicitly into the solver in OpenFOAM: Method I assumes that the granular pressure gradient is equal to the elastic modulus plus the solid concentration gradient; Method II directly calculates the gradient using a difference scheme; Method III, which is proposed in this work, calculates the gradient as the sum of two partial derivatives: one related to the solid volume fraction and the other related to the granular energy. Obviously, only Methods II and III are consistent with kinetic theory of granular flow. It was found that the difference between all methods is small for bubbling fluidization. While for circulating fluidization, both methods II and III are capable of capturing non-uniform structures and producing superior results over Method I. The contradictory conclusions made from the simulation of different fluidization regimes is due to the different contribution of the term related to the granular energy gradient. Present study concludes that the implementation method of granular pressure gradient may have a significant impact on hydrodynamics and is probably a key factor contributing to the observed differences between different simulation software.</description>

      <title>Center-to-face momentum interpolation and face-to-center flux reconstruction in Euler-Euler simulation of gas-solid flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to resolve the pressure checkerboard field problem with collocated grid, it is essential to employ the momentum interpolation method when formulating the pressure equation, and the flux reconstruction method when updating the cell-centered velocity fields. In this study, we first derive a momentum interpolation method for Euler-Euler simulation of gas-solid flows, which is independent of the time step, the transient term discretization scheme, the under-relaxation factor and the shape of grid; a complete first-order flux reconstruction method is then proposed to update the cell-centered velocities. Their effectiveness are proved by simulating the hydrodynamics of solids settlement, gas-solid fixed bed, bubbling fluidized bed and circulating fluidized bed riser, and then comparing the simulation results to the theoretically known solutions. Their superiority over the standard solver of OpenFOAM in suppressing the high-frequency oscillations and enhancing the smoothness and accuracy is also proved. Finally, the difficulty in fully eliminating the high-frequency oscillations is attributed to the insufficiency of current methods in handling the situations where the independent variables undergo abrupt change.</description>

      <title>Coating thickness prediction for a viscous film on a rough plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface roughness significantly modifies the liquid film thickness entrained when dip coating a solid surface, particularly at low coating velocity. Using a homogenization approach, we present a predictive model for determining the liquid film thickness coated on a rough plate. A homogenized boundary condition at an equivalent flat surface is used to model the rough boundary, accounting for both flow through the rough texture layer, through an interface permeability term, and slip at the equivalent surface. While the slip term accounts for tangential velocity induced by viscous shear stress, accurately predicting the film thickness requires the interface permeability term to account for additional tangential flow driven by pressure gradients along the interface. We find that a greater degree of slip and interface permeability signifies less viscous stress that would promote deposition, thus reducing the amount of free film coated above the textures. The model is found to be in good agreement with experimental measurements and requires no fitting parameters. Furthermore, our model may be applied to arbitrary periodic roughness patterns, opening the door to flexible characterization of surfaces found in natural and industrial coating processes.</description>

      <title>Linear models of strip-type roughness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prandtl's secondary flows of the second kind generated by laterally-varying roughness are studied in this work using the linearised Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes approach recently proposed. The momentum equations are coupled to the SA transport model for the turbulent viscosity and the surface roughness is captured by adapting established strategies for homogeneous rough walls to spanwise inhomogeneous surfaces. Linearisation of the governing equations and of the roughness model yields a linear framework that elucidates the linear mechanisms that play a role in the generation of secondary flows. In addition, the framework allows exploring the parameter space associated with heterogeneous rough surfaces. Channel flow is considered, with high and low roughness strips arranged symmetrically on the two channel walls. The strip width is varied systematically to ascertain the role played by the length scale characterising the heterogeneity on the size and intensity of secondary flows. It is found that linear mechanisms, i.e. whereby secondary flows are interpreted as the output response of the turbulent mean flow subjected to a forcing localised at the wall, may be sufficient to explain such a role. In fact the model predicts that secondary flows are most intense when the strip width is about 0.7 times the half-channel height, in excellent agreement with available data. Further, a unified framework to analyse combinations of heterogeneous roughness properties and laterally-varying topographies, common in engineering applications, is discussed. This framework yields two separate secondary-flow inducing source mechanisms, i.e. the lateral variation of the virtual origin from which the turbulent structure is allowed to develop and the lateral variation of the streamwise velocity slip, capturing the acceleration/deceleration perceived by the bulk flow over troughs and crests of the topography.</description>

      <title>Optimized reinitialization based level-set method within industrial context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a solver using the Level-Set method for incompressible two phase flows with surface tension. A one fluid approach is adopted where both phases share the same velocity and pressure field. The Level Set method has been coupled with the Ghost Fluid Method. An efficient and pragmatic solution is proposed to avoid interface displacement during the reinitialization of the level-Set fields. A solver called LSFoam has been implemented in the OpenFOAM framework with consistent Rhie &amp; Chow interpolation. This solver has been tested on several test cases covering different scales and flow configurations: rising bubble test case, Rayleigh-Taylor instability simulations, Ogee spillway flow, 3D dambreak simulation with a square cylinder obstacle and KVLCC2 steady resistance calculations. Overall results are in excellent agreement with reference data and the present approach is very promising for moderate free surface deformations.</description>

      <title>Lopsided Rigid Dumbbell Rheology from Langevin Equation: A Graduate Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modelling of symmetric rigid dumbbell particles suspended in a Newtonian fluid, as a model of a rigid-rod polymeric solution, has been accomplished exclusively through the diffusion equation, which has been detailed elegantly by Bird et al. [Chapter 14 of $Dynamics \ of \ Polymeric \ Liquids$, Vol 2, Ed 2, (1987)]. In this tutorial, a straightforward approach for modelling a lopsided rigid dumbbell particle is presented by the Langevin analysis. The connector force between the dumbbell beads is obtained through the rigidity constraint of the center-to-center vector of the dumbbell using its Langevin equation. By directly averaging via the Langevin equation, the evolution of the center-to-center vector, and the configuration tensor are derived. The stress expressions for the dumbbell from the Langevin equation, and the diffusion equation for the orientation distribution function of the center-to-center vector of the dumbbell are also derived, and the final expressions agree with established results from other methods.</description>

      <title>The role of wetting on the flow of two immiscible fluids in porous media</title>

Abstract: We study the role of the capillary number, $Ca$ and of the surface wettability on the dynamics of the interface between an invading and a defending phase in a porous medium by means of numerical simulations. We employ a hybrid phase field-immersed boundary approach to successfully model the contact line dynamics over the solid objects. Using a phase-field method which naturally incorporates dynamic wetting we eliminate the need for empirical contact line models to address contact line singularity. We map the two dominant modes governing the motion of the interface, namely, capillary fingering, and stable penetration, in the ($Ca$-$\theta$) plane, with $\theta$ the static contact angle prescribed at the solid pores. Capillary fingering dominates at lower values of $Ca$ and pores hydrophobic to the invading phase, while a stable penetration is observed on hydrophillic surfaces. We present new measurements and analyses, including curvature probability density functions (pdf) and average curvature. We also show that the pressure needed for the invading phase to advance at constant flow rate decreases with the capillary number, and increases with the contact angle at the capillary numbers considered. The latter is due to a significant increase of the length of the interface in the case of capillary fingering. Finally, we show that it is possible to identify the different interfacial modes by measuring the penetration length and velocity during the medium filling.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity study of resolution and convergence requirements for extended overlap region in wall-bounded turbulence</title>

Abstract: Direct Numerical Simulations (DNSs) are one of the most powerful tools for studying turbulent flows. Even if achievable Reynolds numbers are lower than those obtained with experimental means, there is a clear advantage since the entire velocity field is known, and any desired quantity can be evaluated. This also includes the computation of derivatives of all relevant terms. One such derivative provides the indicator function, which is the product of wall distance by wall-normal derivative of the mean streamwise velocity. This derivative may depend on mesh spacing and distribution. However, it is extremely affected by the convergence of the simulation. The indicator function is a cornerstone to understanding inner and outer interactions in wall-bounded flows and describing the overlap region between them. We find a clear dependence of this indicator function on mesh distributions we examined, raising questions about classical mesh and convergence requirements for DNS and achievable accuracy. Within the framework of the logarithmic plus linear overlap region, coupled with a parametric study of channel flows and some pipe flows, sensitivities of extracted overlap parameters are examined, and a path is revealed to establishing their high-$Re_\tau$ or near-asymptotic values at modest Reynolds numbers accessible by high-quality DNS with reasonable ``cost''.</description>

      <title>Physics-based Machine Learning Discovered Nano-circuitry for Nonlinear Ion Transport in Nanoporous Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.08151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Confined ion transport is involved in nanoporous ionic systems. However, it is challenging to mechanistically predict its electrical characteristics for rational system design and performance evaluation using electrical circuit model due to the gap between the circuit theory and the underlying physical chemistry. Here we demonstrate that machine learning can bridge this gap and produce physics-based nano-circuitry, based on equation discovery from the modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck simulation results where an anomalous constructive diffusion-migration interplay of confined ions is unveiled. This bridging technique allows us to gain physical insights of ion dynamics in nanoporous electrodes, such as the non-ideal cyclic voltammetry.</description>

      <title>Buckling instability in a chain of sticky bubbles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A slender object undergoing an axial compression will buckle to alleviate the stress. Typically the morphology of the deformed object depends on the bending stiffness for solids, or the viscoelastic properties for liquid threads. We study a chain of uniform sticky air bubbles that rise due to buoyancy through an aqueous bath. A buckling instability of the bubble chain with a characteristic wavelength is observed. If a chain of bubbles is produced faster than it is able to rise, the dominance of viscous drag over buoyancy results in a compressive stress that is alleviated by buckling the bubble chain. Using low Reynolds number hydrodynamics, we predict the critical buckling speed, the terminal speed of a buckled chain, and the geometry of the buckles.</description>
