      <title>The MeerKAT Fornax Survey IV. A close look at the cluster physics through the densest rotation measure grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) mid precursor MeerKAT, we acquired broadband spectro-polarimetric data in the context of the MeerKAT Fornax Survey to study the Fornax cluster's magnetic fields in detail by building the densest rotation measure (RM) grid to date. Here, we present the survey, the analysis, and a discussion of the RM grid properties. We analyzed a circular region centered on the Fornax cluster center with a radius of $\sim1.4^\circ$; that is, $\rm\sim 0.73 R_{vir}$. The mosaics have a resolution of 13arcsec and cover the frequencies between 900\,MHz and 1.4\,GHz, reaching an average noise of 16$\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ in total intensity and 3$\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ in the Q and U Stokes images. With these data, we detected 508 polarized sources over an area of $\sim$6.35 deg$^2$ corresponding to a density of $\sim$80 polarized sources/deg$^2$. This is the densest RM grid ever built. Of the polarized sources, five are cluster sources. Excluding the cluster sources, we built the Euclidean-normalized differential source counts in polarization and we went a factor of ten deeper than previous surveys. We tentatively detect for the first time an increment in the differential source counts at low polarized flux densities; that is, $\sim$9\,$\mu$Jy at 1.4\,GHz. The average degree of polarization of about 3--4\% suggests that the sub$-\mu$Jansky population is not dominated by star-forming galaxies, typically showing a degree of polarization lower than 1\%. The majority of the polarized sources are Faraday simple; in other words, their polarization plane rotates linearly with the wavelength squared. The RM shows the typical decrement going from the center to the outskirts of the Fornax cluster. However, interesting features are observed both in the RM grid and in the RM radial profiles across different directions. A combination of the ...</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Hot Spots and Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upon their evaporation via Hawking radiation, primordial black holes (PBHs) may deposit energy in the ambient plasma on scales smaller than the typical distance between two black holes, leading to the formation of hot spots around them. We investigate how the corresponding rise of the local temperature during the evaporation may act as a shield against the release of low-energy photons, affecting PBH's capacity to dissociate light nuclei after Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis through photo-dissociation. We study the different ways PBH hot spots affect the flux of low-energy photons expected from PBH evaporation, and we find that such effects can be particularly relevant to the physics of photo-dissociation during Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis for PBHs with masses between $10^{11}$g and $3\times 10^{12}$g. We emphasize that the magnitude of this effect is highly dependent on the specific shape of the temperature profile around PBHs and its time evolution. This underscores the necessity for a comprehensive study of PBH hot spots and their dynamics in the future.</description>

      <title>A New Approach for Constraining Large-Scale Temperature Fluctuations in the Intergalactic Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reionization of helium is thought to occur at $2.5\lesssim z\lesssim4$, marking the last phase transition and final global heating event of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Since it is driven by rare quasars, helium reionization should give rise to strong temperature fluctuations in the IGM between neutral and recently-ionized regions of order $\sigma (\ln T) \sim \Delta T/T = 20-50\%$. We introduce a novel method to search for reionization-induced temperature fluctuations in the IGM by using the effective optical depths of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest towards a large number of background quasars. Higher IGM temperatures give rise to lower effective optical depths in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, implying that temperature fluctuations will broaden the observed optical depth distribution. We measured the distributions of effective Lyman-$\alpha$ forest optical depths across $71$ X-Shooter spectra from the XQ-100 survey in four redshift bins from $z=3.76$ to $z=4.19$ and compared them to a large-volume cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. A good agreement is found between the observations and the simulation, which does not include temperature fluctuations; therefore, we do not detect a signature of helium reionization. We then post-process the simulations to include an increasing amount of temperature fluctuations until the model becomes inconsistent with the observations. We obtain tight constraints on $\sigma (\ln T) &lt; 0.29 \ (&lt;0.40)$ at $2 \sigma\ (3 \sigma)$ at $z=3.76$ when averaging over scales of $100$ comoving Mpc, and weaker constraints for higher redshifts and smaller scales. Our constraints are the tightest to date, and imply that either the IGM temperature contrast caused by helium reionization is less than $\sim30\%$, or that the process has not yet significantly started at $z=3.76$.</description>

      <title>OpenUniverse2024: A shared, simulated view of the sky for the next generation of cosmological surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The OpenUniverse2024 simulation suite is a cross-collaboration effort to produce matched simulated imaging for multiple surveys as they would observe a common simulated sky. Both the simulated data and associated tools used to produce it are intended to uniquely enable a wide range of studies to maximize the science potential of the next generation of cosmological surveys. We have produced simulated imaging for approximately 70 deg$^2$ of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Wide-Fast-Deep survey and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope High-Latitude Wide-Area Survey, as well as overlapping versions of the ELAIS-S1 Deep-Drilling Field for LSST and the High-Latitude Time-Domain Survey for Roman. OpenUniverse2024 includes i) an early version of the updated extragalactic model called Diffsky, which substantially improves the realism of optical and infrared photometry of objects, compared to previous versions of these models; ii) updated transient models that extend through the wavelength range probed by Roman and Rubin; and iii) improved survey, telescope, and instrument realism based on up-to-date survey plans and known properties of the instruments. It is built on a new and updated suite of simulation tools that improves the ease of consistently simulating multiple observatories viewing the same sky. The approximately 400 TB of synthetic survey imaging and simulated universe catalogs are publicly available, and we preview some scientific uses of the simulations.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Results: Cell-based Coadds and Metadetection Weak Lensing Shape Catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Metadetection weak lensing galaxy shape catalogue from the six-year Dark Energy Survey (DES Y6) imaging data. This dataset is the final release from DES, spanning 4422 deg$^2$ of the southern sky. We describe how the catalogue was constructed, including the two new major processing steps, cell-based image coaddition and shear measurements with Metadetection. The DES Y6 Metadetection weak lensing shape catalogue consists of 151,922,791 galaxies detected over riz bands, with an effective number density of $n_{\rm eff}$ =8.22 galaxies per arcmin$^2$ and shape noise of $\sigma_e$ = 0.29. We carry out a suite of validation tests on the catalogue, including testing for PSF leakage, testing for the impact of PSF modeling errors, and testing the correlation of the shear measurements with galaxy, PSF, and survey properties. In addition to demonstrating that our catalogue is robust for weak lensing science, we use the DES Y6 image simulation suite (Mau, Becker et al. 2025) to estimate the overall multiplicative shear bias of our shear measurement pipeline. We find no detectable multiplicative bias at the roughly half-percent level, with m = (3.4 $\pm$ 6.1) x $10^{-3}$, at 3$\sigma$ uncertainty. This is the first time both cell-based coaddition and Metadetection algorithms are applied to observational data, paving the way to the Stage-IV weak lensing surveys.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Results: Synthetic-source Injection Across the Full Survey Using Balrog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic source injection (SSI), the insertion of sources into pixel-level on-sky images, is a powerful method for characterizing object detection and measurement in wide-field, astronomical imaging surveys. Within the Dark Energy Survey (DES), SSI plays a critical role in characterizing all necessary algorithms used in converting images to catalogs, and in deriving quantities needed for the cosmology analysis, such as object detection rates, galaxy redshift estimation, galaxy magnification, star-galaxy classification, and photometric performance. We present here a source injection catalog of $146$ million injections spanning the entire 5000 deg$^2$ DES footprint, generated using the Balrog SSI pipeline. Through this sample, we demonstrate that the DES Year 6 (Y6) image processing pipeline provides accurate estimates of the object properties, for both galaxies and stars, at the percent-level, and we highlight specific regimes where the accuracy is reduced. We then show the consistency between SSI and data catalogs, for all galaxy samples developed within the weak lensing and galaxy clustering analyses of DES Y6. The consistency between the two catalogs also extends to their correlations with survey observing properties (seeing, airmass, depth, extinction, etc.). Finally, we highlight a number of applications of this catalog to the DES Y6 cosmology analysis. This dataset is the largest SSI catalog produced at this fidelity and will serve as a key testing ground for exploring the utility of SSI catalogs in upcoming surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Results: Photometric Data Set for Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05739v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the photometric data set assembled from the full six years of observations by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) in support of static-sky cosmology analyses. DES Y6 Gold is a curated data set derived from DES Data Release 2 (DR2) that incorporates improved measurement, photometric calibration, object classification and value added information. Y6 Gold comprises nearly $5000~{\rm deg}^2$ of $grizY$ imaging in the south Galactic cap and includes 669 million objects with a depth of $i_{AB} \sim 23.4$ mag at S/N $\sim 10$ for extended objects and a top-of-the-atmosphere photometric uniformity $&lt; 2~{\rm mmag}$. Y6 Gold augments DES DR2 with simultaneous fits to multi-epoch photometry for more robust galaxy shapes, colors, and photometric redshift estimates. Y6 Gold features improved morphological star-galaxy classification with efficiency $98.6\%$ and contamination $0.8\%$ for galaxies with $17.5 &lt; i_{AB} &lt; 22.5$. Additionally, it includes per-object quality information, and accompanying maps of the footprint coverage, masked regions, imaging depth, survey conditions, and astrophysical foregrounds that are used for cosmology analyses. After quality selections, benchmark samples contain 448 million galaxies and 120 million stars. This paper will be complemented by online data access and documentation.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$CDM model against redshift-binned data: A mock analysis based on SNIa and Cosmic Chronometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the broad successes of the flat $\Lambda$CDM model and its fitness to the various cosmological observations, it confronts challenges stemming from anomalies in the measurements of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the amplitude of matter fluctuations ($\sigma_8$). These inconsistencies have necessitated a reassessment of the model parameters, with a particular focus on their potential dependence on redshift. This study pioneers a new investigation to probe this redshift dependency by generating mock data simulated from observational data of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) and cosmic chronometers (CC), thereby increasing the data density in this field. By sorting the data into high-redshift and low-redshift bins, we aim to refine the cosmological constraints on the parameters of the $\Lambda$CDM model and determine whether the noted dependence on redshift is due to a lack of high-redshift observational data or if they signify intrinsic issues within the model itself. Our approach employs the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to minimize the $\chi^2$ function, thus tightening the cosmological constraints. Our findings within the mock analysis reveal discrepancies between the values of $\Omega_{m0}$ and $H_0$ derived from the mock data bins with high redshift and low redshift, indicating the potential deviation of the standard $\Lambda$ CDM cosmology from the high-redshift SNIa and CC data. If this deviation proposes a new physics beyond the standard model, then with better quality future data tracking the new physics, these discrepancies will be statistically significant.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Results: Point-Spread Function Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the point-spread function (PSF) modeling for weak lensing shear measurement using the full six years of the Dark Energy Survey (DES Y6) data. We review the PSF estimation procedure using the PIFF (PSFs In the Full FOV) software package and describe the key improvements made to PIFF and modeling diagnostics since the DES year three (Y3) analysis: (i) use of external Gaia and infrared photometry catalogs to ensure higher purity of the stellar sample used for model fitting, (ii) addition of color-dependent PSF modeling, the first for any weak lensing analysis, and (iii) inclusion of model diagnostics inspecting fourth-order moments, which can bias weak lensing measurements to a similar degree as second-order modeling errors. Through a comprehensive set of diagnostic tests, we demonstrate the improved accuracy of the Y6 models evident in significantly smaller systematic errors than those of the Y3 analysis, in which all $g$ band data were excluded due to insufficiently accurate PSF models. For the Y6 weak lensing analysis, we include $g$ band photometry data in addition to the $riz$ bands, providing a fourth band for photometric redshift estimation. Looking forward to the next generation of wide-field surveys, we describe several ongoing improvements to PIFF, which will be the default PSF modeling software for weak lensing analyses for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</description>

      <title>Modern Bayesian Sampling Methods for Cosmological Inference: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive comparison of different Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods, evaluating their performance on both standard test problems and cosmological parameter estimation. Our analysis includes traditional Metropolis-Hastings MCMC, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), slice sampling, nested sampling as implemented in dynesty, and PolyChord. We examine samplers through multiple metrics including runtime, memory usage, effective sample size, and parameter accuracy, testing their scaling with dimension and response to different probability distributions. While all samplers perform well with simple Gaussian distributions, we find that HMC and nested sampling show advantages for more complex distributions typical of cosmological problems. Traditional MCMC and slice sampling become less efficient in higher dimensions, while nested methods maintain accuracy but at higher computational cost. In cosmological applications using BAO data, we observe similar patterns, with particular challenges arising from parameter degeneracies and poorly constrained parameters.</description>

      <title>SkyReconNet: A Deep Learning Inpainting Approach for Enhanced CMB Map Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel neural network architecture, SkyReconNet, which is tailored to reconstruct missing information in the masked regions of the full-sky Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) map. Inpainting the CMB maps is a particularly formidable challenge when dealing with extensive and irregular masks, such as galactic masks which can obscure substantial fractions of the sky. Our network addresses this challenge by combining the strengths of the dilated convolutional layers, with their expanded receptive fields and standard convolutional layers, to capture both the global and local features in a CMB map. This hybrid design enables our network to accurately predict CMB fluctuations in the masked regions by effectively leveraging the information from the surrounding unmasked areas. The network is trained on simulated CMB maps generated using the Code for Anisotropies in the Microwave Background (CAMB) package. The galactic region of these simulated maps are excluded using the Planck 2018 common mask provided by the Planck CMB mission. During training, the network optimizes its weights by minimizing a composite loss function that combines the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and mean squared error (MSE). SSIM preserves the essential structural features of the CMB, ensuring an accurate and coherent reconstruction of the full-sky CMB map, while MSE minimizes the pixel-wise deviations, enhancing the overall accuracy of the predictions. The predicted CMB maps and their corresponding angular power spectra align closely with the targets, achieving the performance limited only by the fundamental uncertainty of cosmic variance. Our results demonstrate that this approach effectively addresses the challenges posed by large irregular masks, offering a significant inpainting tool in CMB and other cosmological analyses.</description>

      <title>The Massive Flat Space Limit of Cosmological Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying useful flat-space limits for cosmological correlators, where they can be expressed in terms of observables in Minkowski space is nontrivial due to their scale-invariant nature. In recent years, it has been shown that momentum-space correlators encode flat-space amplitudes at specific singularities that emerge in the complex plane of their kinematics after analytical continuation. This flat-space limit is massless in the sense that the amplitude corresponds to the ultraviolet regime of the associated flat-space process, where the masses of the internal propagators are effectively zero. In this paper, we introduce a novel massive flat-space (MFS) limit, in which the internal masses in the corresponding flat-space Feynman graph remain finite. Our proposal applies to arbitrary graphs with light external legs and heavy internal lines, using a double-scaling limit. In this limit, the external energies, treated as independent variables, approach zero in inverse proportion to the propagator masses, which are sent to infinity. We present a general reduction formula that expresses diagrams in this limit in terms of amputated Feynman graphs in flat space. Our findings underscore the deep connections between the rich structure of massive Feynman integrals and the properties of cosmological correlators involving the exchange of heavy fields. Using this reduction formula, we compute sample one-loop contributions from heavy particles to inflationary correlators in the small sound-speed regime, revealing novel bispectrum shapes. The non-Gaussian signals we uncover, which are especially pronounced around the equilateral configuration, cannot be reproduced by adding local terms to the effective field theory of single-field inflation. Instead, they are captured by incorporating prescribed spatially non-local operators into the EFT.</description>

      <title>AstronomyCalc: A python toolkit for teaching Astronomical Calculations and Data Analysis methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding astrophysical and cosmological processes can be challenging due to their complexity and lack of intuitive analogies. To address this, we present \texttt{AstronomyCalc}, a Python package specifically designed to aid university-level teaching by integrating theoretical physics with practical astronomical data analysis methods. The package enables students to solve key cosmological calculations, such as the Friedmann equations, and explore various models while visualizing how parameter variations affect cosmic dynamics. It includes tools for generating synthetic astronomical data, such as Type Ia supernova measurements, and supports analysis of publicly available datasets, including Pantheon+ and the SPARC galaxy database. Simplified implementations of advanced algorithms, such as Monte Carlo Markov Chains, allow students to engage with data analysis techniques used in contemporary research. Additionally, \texttt{AstronomyCalc} will be consistently updated with more tools and user-friendly Jupyter notebooks, making it a continually evolving educational resource for developing conceptual understanding and practical skills in astrophysics and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Piezoelectric Bulk Acoustic Resonators For Dark Photon Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kinetically mixed dark photon is a simple, testable dark matter candidate with strong theoretical motivation. Detecting the feeble electric field dark photon dark matter produces requires extremely sensitive detectors. Bulk acoustic resonators (BARs), with their exceptionally high-quality phonon modes, are capable of achieving incredible sensitivity to gravitational waves in the MHz to GHz frequency range. The BAR phonons are typically read out by detecting the electric field generated by the BAR materials' piezoelectricity. Here we show that this piezoelectricity also rewards such detectors sensitivity to dark photon dark matter, as the dark electric field can resonantly excite BAR phonons. A single 10 g piezoelectric BAR in a large, cold, environment can be orders of magnitude more sensitive to the kinetic mixing parameter than any current experiment, with only a month-long exposure and thermally-limited backgrounds.</description>

      <title>A Bright Future? Prospects for Cosmological Tests of GR with Multimessenger Gravitational Wave Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Further bright sirens - gravitational wave events with electromagnetic counterparts - are keenly awaited, but proving elusive. The exceptional event GW170817 had a profound impact on the landscape of viable cosmological extensions of General Relativity (GR); can we expect this kind of shift to be repeated in the next decade? In this work we will assess the potential constraints from bright sirens in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O5 era and third generation detector era. We set up the statistical formalism for our constraints, and generate and analyse simulated data in the context of general scalar-tensor theories. We highlight the important role that gamma-ray burst detection has in breaking key parameter degeneracies. We find that the next ten bright sirens alone will not competitively constrain cosmological gravity, but that one year of third generation observations could confidently detect mild departures from GR, e.g. the Horndeski parameter $\alpha_{\rm M}\neq 0$ is detected at greater than $3\sigma$. This justifies investment in a broad range of methods for gravitational wave cosmology (dark sirens, bright sirens and cross-correlation with large-scale structure) to ensure tests of cosmological gravity advance in both the short-term and the long-term.</description>

Abstract: We study the energy-momentum tensor of a bubble wall beyond the approximation of an infinitely thin wall. To this end, we discuss the proper decomposition into wall and bulk contributions, and we use a systematic method to calculate the energy-momentum tensor at any order in the wall width. We consider the specific examples of spherical bubbles with different initial configurations, and we compare our approximations with a numerical computation.</description>

      <title>Relativistic magnetohydrodynamics in the early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the conservation laws of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in an expanding homogeneous and isotropic Universe that can be applied to the study of early Universe physics during the epoch of radiation domination. The conservation laws for a conducting perfect fluid with relativistic bulk velocities in an expanding background are presented, extending previous results that apply in the limit of subrelativistic bulk motion. Furthermore, it is shown that the subrelativistic limit presents new corrections that have not been considered in previous work. Imperfect relativistic fluids are briefly described but their detailed study is not included in this work. We review the propagation of sound waves, Alfv\'en waves, and magnetosonic waves, as well as the Boris correction for relativistic Alfv\'en speeds. This review is an extension, including new results, of part of the lectures presented at the minicourse ``Simulations of Early Universe Magnetohydrodynamics'' lectured by A. Roper Pol and J. Schober at EPFL, as part of the six-week program ``Generation, evolution, and observations of cosmological magnetic fields'' at the Bernoulli Center in May 2024.</description>

      <title>Variation of the low-mass end of the stellar initial mass function with redshift and metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the stellar mass functions obtained from 20 radiation hydrodynamical simulations of star cluster formation in 500 M$_\odot$ molecular clouds with metallicities of 3, 1, 1/10 and 1/100 of the solar value, with the clouds subjected to levels of the cosmic microwave background radiation that are appropriate for star formation at redshifts z=0, 3, 5, 7, and 10. The calculations include a thermochemical model of the diffuse interstellar medium and treat dust and gas temperatures separately. We find that the stellar mass distributions obtained become increasingly bottom light as the redshift and/or metallicity are increased. Mass functions that are similar to a typical Galactic initial mass function are obtained for present-day star formation (z=0) independent of metallicity, and also for the lowest-metallicity (1/100 solar) at all redshifts up to z=10, but for higher metallicities there is a larger deficit of brown dwarfs and low-mass stars as the metallicity and redshift are increased. These effects are a result of metal-rich gas being unable to cool to as lower temperatures at higher redshift due to the warmer cosmic microwave background radiation. Based on the numerical results we provide a parameterisation that may be used to vary the stellar initial mass function with redshift and metallicity; this could be used in simulations of galaxy formation. For example, a bottom-light mass function reduces the mass-to-light ratio compared to a typical Galactic stellar initial mass function, which may reduce the estimated masses of high-redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Spectre of Underdetermination in Modern Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scientific status of physical cosmology has been the subject of philosophical debate ever since detailed mathematical models of the Universe emerged from Einstein's general theory of relativity. Such debates revolve around whether and to what extent cosmology meets established demarcation criteria for a discipline to be scientific, as well as determining how to best characterize cosmology as a science, given the unique challenges and limitations faced by a discipline which aims to study the origin, composition, and fate of the Universe itself. The present article revisits, in light of the dramatic progress in cosmology in recent decades, an earlier debate held in the 1950s between Herman Bondi and Gerald Whitrow regarding the scientific status of cosmology. We analyse cosmology's transition from an emerging science to a cornerstone of modern physics, highlighting its empirical successes in establishing the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model and in its delivery of various successful novel predictions. Despite this remarkable scientific success and progress, we argue that modern cosmology faces a further profound challenge: the permanent underdetermination of the microphysical nature of its exotic energy components: inflation, dark matter, and dark energy. Drawing historical parallels with the role of spectroscopy in revealing the microphysical nature of atomic physics, we argue that the epistemic barriers obstructing us from ascertaining the microphysical nature of these exotic energy components are significant, in turn casting doubt upon whether cosmology can ever transcend these particular epistemic challenges. We conclude by reflecting on the prospects for future breakthroughs and/or non-empirical arguments which could decide this issue conclusively.</description>

Abstract: A new degravitation mechanism within the framework of scalar tensor gravity is postulated and included by prescription. The mechanism eliminates all constant contributions from the potential to the Friedmann equation, leaving only the kinematic and the dynamic terms of the potential to drive cosmic acceleration. We explore a scenario involving a density-triggered phase transition in the late-time universe, and argue that the resulting effective energy density and equation of state parameter can explain late-time cosmology when extrapolated to a region of the parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We constrain the redshift dependence of (rest frame) host galaxy dispersion measures of localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) by assuming it to vary as a simple power law ($\propto (1+z)^{\alpha}$). We simultaneously fit $\alpha$ as well as the host dispersion measure to the data of FRBs with known redshifts. We find that \color{black} $\alpha$ between 0 to 1 is preferred depending upon our modelling choices. Current data can constrain $|\alpha|\lesssim 2$ at a 68 percent confidence interval \color{black}. Such constraints have implications for our understanding of galaxy formation and can be used to inform galaxy and large scale simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On large scales, the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest provides insights into the expansion history of the Universe, while on small scales, it imposes strict constraints on the growth history, the nature of dark matter, and the sum of neutrino masses. This work introduces ForestFlow, a novel framework that bridges the gap between large- and small-scale analyses, which have traditionally relied on distinct modeling approaches. Using conditional normalizing flows, ForestFlow predicts the two Lyman-$\alpha$ linear biases ($b_\delta$ and $b_\eta$) and six parameters describing small-scale deviations of the three-dimensional flux power spectrum ($P_\mathrm{3D}$) from linear theory as a function of cosmology and intergalactic medium physics. These are then combined with a Boltzmann solver to make consistent predictions, from arbitrarily large scales down to the nonlinear regime, for $P_\mathrm{3D}$ and any other statistics derived from it. Trained on a suite of 30 fixed-and-paired cosmological hydrodynamical simulations spanning redshifts from $z=2$ to 4.5, ForestFlow achieves 3 and 1.5\% precision in describing $P_\mathrm{3D}$ and the one-dimensional flux power spectrum ($P_\mathrm{1D}$) from linear scales to $k=5\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $k_\parallel=4\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, respectively. Thanks to its conditional parameterization, ForestFlow shows similar performance for ionization histories and two $\Lambda$CDM model extensions $\unicode{x2013}$ massive neutrinos and curvature $\unicode{x2013}$ even though none of these are included in the training set. This framework will enable full-scale cosmological analyses of Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements from the DESI survey.</description>

      <title>Thermal axion production at hard and soft momenta</title>

Abstract: Hot axions, thermally produced in the Early Universe, would contribute to dark radiation and are thus subject to present and future constraints from $N_{\rm eff}$. In this paper we quantify the contribution to $N_{\rm eff}$ and its uncertainty in models with axion-gluon couplings from thermal dynamics above the QCD transition. In more detail, we determine the leading-order thermal axion production rate for axion momenta of the order of the temperature adopting three different schemes for the incorporation of the collective dynamics of soft gluons. We show how these three schemes extrapolate differently into the regime of softer axion production, thus giving us a first quantitative handle on the theory uncertainty of the rate. Upon solving the Boltzmann equation, we find that this theory uncertainty translates to an uncertainty of order 0.002 for the contribution to $N_{\rm eff}$ prior to the QCD crossover. The uncertainty from common momentum-averaged approximations to the Boltzmann equation is smaller. We also discuss how QCD transition dynamics would need to be integrated into our results and we show how existing rate determinations in the literature based on gauge-dependent resummations are problematic.</description>

      <title>Manifestation of antiquark nuggets in collisions with the Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17775</link>

Abstract: Antiquark nuggets are hypothetical compact composite objects conjectured to account for a significant fraction of dark matter in the Universe. In contrast to quark nuggets, these objects consist of antimatter. They may remain undetected if they possess a sufficiently small cross section relative to their mass. In this paper, we investigate the allowed region in the parameter space of this model that is consistent with the observed neutrino flux from the Sun and the Earth, and the non-observation of seismic events with specific signatures of dark matter particles. We found the allowed values of the antibaryon charge number in this model to be in the interval $2\times 10^{24}&lt;A&lt;8\times 10^{25}$, while the probability of nucleon annihilation upon collisions with the antiquark core is constrained by $0.1\lesssim \kappa&lt;0.25$. Although very large values of the antibaryon charge, $A&gt;10^{33}$, are not fully excluded by the present study, we show that they conflict with the non-observation of rare catastrophic explosion-like events on the Earth.</description>

      <title>Signatures of high-redshift galactic outflows in the thermal Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anisotropies of the Sunyaev Zel'dovich (SZ) effect serve as a powerful probe of the thermal history of the universe. At high redshift, hot galactic outflows driven by supernovae (SNe) can inject a significant amount of thermal energy into the intergalactic medium, causing a strong $y$-type distortion of the CMB spectrum through inverse Compton scattering. The resulting anisotropies of the $y$-type distortion are sensitive to key physical properties of high-$z$ galaxies pertaining to the launch of energetic SNe-driven outflows, such as the efficiency and the spatio-temporal clustering of star formation. We develop a simple analytic framework to calculate anisotropies of $y$-type distortion associated with SNe-powered outflows of galaxies at $z&gt;6$. We show that galactic outflows are likely the dominant source of thermal energy injection, compared to contributions from reionized bubbles and gravitational heating. We further show that next-generation CMB experiments such as LiteBIRD are likely to detect the contribution to $y$ anisotropies from high-$z$ galactic outflows through the cross-correlation with surveys of Lyman-break galaxies by e.g. the Roman Space Telescope. Our analysis and forecasts demonstrate that thermal SZ anisotropies can be a promising probe of SN feedback and outflows in early star-forming galaxies.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Particle Production of Scalars: Analytic and Numerical Approaches Including Early Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological gravitational particle production (GPP) is a generic mechanism by which particles are produced during the inflationary epoch. In this work we consider the GPP of massive scalars in an effort to fully understand the spectrum of the produced particles. We consider scalars which are conformally or minimally coupled to gravity, as well as models of both early and late reheating. We numerically calculate the particle production in each scenario and compare the results to analytic approximations from boundary matching, Stokes phenomenon, steepest descent, and inflaton scattering methods. For each method, we describe the regime of validity and show that there is good agreement between the analytic and numerical results.</description>
