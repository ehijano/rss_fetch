      <title>Energy levels of multiscale bound states from QED energy-momentum trace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy levels of QED bound states, which depend on a number of independent mass parameters, can be calculated as matrix elements of the QED energy-momentum trace. As an example of such system we consider muonic hydrogen. The leading one-loop corrections to its energy levels depend on the electron and muon masses. These corrections are calculated as matrix elements of the energy-momentum trace. Respective one-loop trace diagrams are different from the standard Lamb shift diagrams. We explain analytically and diagrammatically why two different sets of diagrams lead to the same results. Similar relationships should also hold beyond the one-loop approximation.</description>

      <title>Calculation of hyperfine structure in Tm II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first measurements of the magnetic dipole hyperfine structure constants A in singly ionized thulium revealed substantial discrepancies with the corresponding calculations [Mansour et al., NIMB 40, 252 (1989)]. More recent measurements [Kebapc{\i} et al., ApJ 970, 23 (2024)] expanded very limited dataset of that work and demonstrated that two of the previously reported experimental A values were incorrect, motivating new theoretical calculations. In this work, we employ the configuration interaction method to calculate the A constants for several low-lying levels in Tm II, with the random-phase-approximation corrections also taken into account. Our results show good agreement with the new experimental data and provide reliable predictions for additional states where measurements are not yet available.</description>

      <title>Quantum feedback control of a two-atom network closed by a semi-infinite waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06373v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study the delay-dependent coherent feedback dynamics by focusing on one typical realization, i.e., a two-atom quantum network whose feedback loop is closed by a semi-infinite waveguide. In this set-up, an initially excited two-level atom can emit a photon into the waveguide, where the propagating photon can be reflected by the terminal mirror of the waveguide or absorbed by the other atom, thus constructing various coherent feedback loops. We show that there can be two-photon, one-photon or zero-photon states in the waveguide, which can be controlled by the feedback loop length and the coupling strengths between the atoms and waveguide. The photonic states in the waveguide are analyzed in both the frequency domain and the spatial domain, and the transient process of photon emissions is better understood based on a comprehensive analysis using both domains. Interestingly, we clarify that this quantum coherent feedback network can be mathematically modeled as a linear control system with multiple delays, which are determined by the distances between atoms and the terminal mirror of the semi-infinite waveguide. Therefore, based on time-delayed linear control system theory, the influence of delays on the stability of the quantum state evolution and the steady-state atomic and photonic states is investigated, for both small and large delays.</description>
