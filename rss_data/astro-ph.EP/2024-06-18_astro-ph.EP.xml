      <title>C/O Ratios and the formation of wide separation exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gas and solid-state C/O ratios provide context to potentially link the atmospheric composition of planets to that of the natal disk. We provide a synthesis of extant estimates of the gaseous C/O and C/H ratios in planet-forming disks obtained primarily through analysis of Atacama Large Millimeter Array observations. These estimates are compared to atmospheric abundances of wide separation (&gt; 10 au) gas giants. The resolved disk gas C/O ratios, from seven systems, generally exhibit C/O &gt; 1 with sub-solar, or depleted, carbon content. In contrast, wide separation gas giants have atmospheric C/O ratios that cluster near or slightly above the presumed stellar value with a range of elemental C/H. From the existing disk composition, we infer that the solid-state mm/cm-sized pebbles have a total C/O ratio (solid cores and ices) that is solar (stellar) in content. We explore simple models that reconstruct the exoplanet atmospheric composition from the disk, while accounting for silicate cloud formation in the planet atmosphere. If wide separate planets formed via the core-accretion mechanism, they must acquire their metals from pebble or planetesimal accretion. Further, the dispersion in giant planet C/H content is best matched by a disk composition with modest and variable factors of carbon depletion. An origin of the wide separation gas giants via gravitational instability cannot be ruled out as stellar C/O ratios should natively form in this scenario. However, the variation in planet metallicity with a stellar C/O ratio potentially presents challenges to these models.</description>

      <title>The Distribution of Planet Radius in Kepler Multiplanet Systems Depends on Gap Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of small planet radius ($&lt;$4 R$_\oplus$) is an indicator of the underlying processes governing planet formation and evolution. We investigate the correlation between the radius distribution of exoplanets in Kepler multiplanet systems and the system-level complexity in orbital period spacing. Utilizing a sample of 234 planetary systems with three or more candidate planets orbiting FGK main-sequence stars, we measure the gap complexity ($C$) to characterize the regularity of planetary spacing and compare it with other measures of period spacing and spacing uniformity. We find that systems with higher gap complexity exhibit a distinct radius distribution compared to systems with lower gap complexity. Specifically, we find that the radius valley, which separates super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, is more pronounced in systems with lower gap complexity ($C$$&lt;$0.165). Planets in high complexity systems ($C$$&gt;$0.35) exhibit a lower frequency of sub-Earths (2.5 times less) and sub-Neptunes (1.3 times less) and a higher frequency of super-Earths (1.4 times more) than planets in low complexity systems. This may suggest that planetary systems with more irregular spacings are more likely to undergo dynamic interactions that influence planet scattering, composition, and atmospheric retention. The gap complexity metric proves to be a valuable tool in linking the physical characteristics of planets to their orbital configurations.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Simulation Study of Hot and Ultra-hot Jupiter Atmospheres using Different Ground-based High-resolution Spectrographs with Cross-correlation Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of state-of-the-art space-borne telescopes, high-resolution ground-based observation has emerged as a crucial method for characterizing exoplanets, providing essential insights into their atmospheric compositions. In the optical and NIR regions, high-resolution spectroscopy has been powerful for hot Jupiters (HJ) and ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJ) during their primary transits, as it can probe molecules with better sensitivity. Here, we focus on a comparative simulation study of WASP-76 b (UHJ) and WASP-77 A b (HJ) for different number of transits, utilizing three ground-based spectrographs (GIANO-B (TNG), CARMENES (CAHA), and ANDES (E-ELT)) with varying instrumental parameters, spectral coverages, and resolutions. We aim to evaluate the feasibility of the upcoming ground-based European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) in probing molecules from planet atmospheres and how it surpasses other ground-based observatories in terms of detectability. With the 1-D model, petitCODE, we have self-consistently simulated the atmospheric pressure-temperature profiles, which are subsequently integrated into the 1-D chemical kinetics model, VULCAN, to evolve the atmospheric chemistry. High-resolution spectra are obtained by performing line-by-line radiative transfer using petitRADTRANS. Finally, we use the resulting spectra to assess the detectability (sigma_det) of molecular bands, employing the ground-based noise simulator SPECTR. Utilizing cross-correlation spectroscopy, we have successfully demonstrated the robust consistency between our simulation study and real-time observations for both planets. ANDES excels overall in molecular detection due to its enhanced instrumental architecture, reinforcing E-ELT's importance for studying exoplanet atmospheres. Additionally, our theoretical simulations predict the detection of CO, NH3, and H2S on WASP-76 b atmosphere with a sigma_det&gt; 3.</description>

      <title>Sequential giant planet formation initiated by disc substructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planet formation models are necessary to understand the origins of diverse planetary systems. Circumstellar disc substructures have been proposed as preferred locations of planet formation but a complete formation scenario has not been covered by a single model so far. We aim to study the formation of giant planets facilitated by disc substructure and starting with sub-micron-sized dust. We connect dust coagulation and drift, planetesimal formation, $N$-body gravity, pebble accretion, planet migration, planetary gas accretion and gap opening in one consistent modelling framework. We find rapid formation of multiple gas giants from the initial disc substructure. The migration trap near the substructure allows the formation of cold gas giants. A new pressure maximum is created at the outer edge of the planetary gap, which triggers the next generation of planet formation resulting in a compact chain of giant planets. A high planet formation efficiency is achieved as the first gas giants are effective in preventing dust from drifting further inwards, which preserves materials for planet formation. Sequential planet formation is a promising framework to explain the formation of chains of gas and ice giants.</description>

      <title>A new lever on exoplanetary B fields: measuring heavy ion velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields connect an array of planetary processes, from atmospheric escape to interior convection. Despite their importance, exoplanet magnetic fields are largely unconstrained by both theory and observation. In this Letter, we propose a novel method for constraining the B field strength of hot gas giants: comparing the velocities of heavy ions and neutral gas with high-resolution spectroscopy. The core concept of this method is that ions are directly deflected by magnetic fields. While neutrals are also affected by B fields via friction with field-accelerated ions, ionic gas should be more strongly coupled to the underlying magnetic field than bulk neutral flow. Hence, measuring the difference between the two velocities yields rough constraints on the B field, provided an estimate of the stellar UV flux is known. We demonstrate that heavy ions are particularly well suited for this technique, because they are less likely to be entrained in complex hydrodynamic outflows than their lighter counterparts. We perform a proof-of-concept calculation with Ba II, an ion whose velocity has been repeatedly measured at high confidence with high-resolution spectroscopy. Our work shows that a 10G magnetic field would produce ~ km/s ion--neutral velocity differences at a microbar, whereas a 50G magnetic field would produce ~20km/s velocity difference. With new leverage on magnetic fields, we will be able to investigate magnetic field generation in the extreme edge cases of hot gas giants, with wide-ranging consequences for planetary interior structure, dynamo theory, and habitability.</description>

      <title>Concurrent Accretion and Migration of Giant Planets in their Natal Disks with Consistent Accretion Torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Migration commonly occurs during the epoch of planet formation. For emerging gas giant planets, it proceeds concurrently with their growth through the accretion of gas from their natal protoplanetary disks. Similar migration process should also be applied to the stellar-mass black holes embedded in active galactic nucleus disks. In this work, we perform high resolution 3D and 2D numerical hydrodynamical simulations to study the migration dynamics for accreting embedded objects over the disk viscous timescales in a self-consistent manner. We find that an accreting planet embedded in a predominantly viscous disk has a tendency to migrate outward, in contrast to the inward orbital decay of non-accreting planets. 3D and 2D simulations find the consistent outward migration results for the accreting planets. Under this circumstance, the accreting planet's outward migration is mainly due to the asymmetric spiral arms feeding from the global disk into the Hill radius. This is analogous to the unsaturated corotation torque although the imbalance is due to material accretion within the libration timescale rather than diffusion onto the inner disk. In a disk with a relatively small viscosity, the accreting planets clear deep gaps near their orbits. The tendency of inward migration is recovered, albeit with suppressed rates. By performing a parameter survey with a range of disks' viscosity, we find that the transition from outward to inward migration occurs with the effective viscous efficiency factor $\alpha\sim 0.003$ for Jupiter-mass planets.</description>

      <title>Windows Into Other Worlds: Pitfalls in the physical interpretation of exoplanet atmospheric spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric spectroscopy provides a window into the properties of exoplanets. However, the physical interpretation of retrieved data and its implications for the internal properties of exoplanets remains nebulous. This letter addresses three misconceptions held by some atmospheric spectroscopists regarding the connection between observed chemical abundances and theory: (1) Whether atmospheric spectroscopy can provide the bulk atmospheric chemistry, (2) whether it can identify if a planet is cloudless, and (3) whether atmospheric evaporation arguments can be used to dismiss certain compositions inferred through spectroscopy. This letter concludes by exploring applications of remote sensing in the quest for the search for life outside of our solar system.</description>

      <title>The Hycean Paradigm in the Search for Life Elsewhere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for habitable conditions and signs of life on exoplanets is a major frontier in modern astronomy. Detecting atmospheric signatures of Earth-like exoplanets is challenging due to their small sizes and relatively thin atmospheres. Recently, a new class of habitable sub-Neptune exoplanets, called Hycean worlds, has been theorized. Hycean worlds are planets with H2-rich atmospheres and planet-wide oceans with thermodynamic conditions similar to those in the Earth's oceans. Their large sizes and extended atmospheres, compared to rocky planets of similar mass, make Hycean worlds significantly more accessible to atmospheric observations. These planets open a new avenue in the search for planetary habitability and life elsewhere using spectroscopic observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We observed the transmission spectrum of a candidate Hycean world, K2-18 b, recently with JWST in its first year of operations. The spectrum reveals multiple spectral features of carbon bearing molecules in the planetary atmosphere, leading to the first detections of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) in a habitable-zone exoplanet. We discuss inferences of the atmospheric chemical composition and its implications for the atmospheric, interior and surface conditions on the planet, along with the possibility of a habitable ocean underneath the atmosphere. We discuss new observational and theoretical developments in this emerging frontier and their implications for exoplanetary habitability and search for life elsewhere.</description>

      <title>The Aligned Orbit of a Hot Jupiter around the M Dwarf TOI-4201</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the obliquities of stars hosting giant planets may shed light on the dynamical history of planetary systems. Significant efforts have been made to measure the obliquities of FGK stars with hot Jupiters, mainly based on observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. In contrast, M dwarfs with hot Jupiters have hardly been explored, because such systems are rare and often not favorable for such precise observations. Here, we report the first detection of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for an M dwarf with a hot Jupiter, TOI-4201, using the Gemini-North/MAROON-X spectrograph. We find TOI-4201 to be well-aligned with its giant planet, with a sky-projected obliquity of $\lambda=-3.0_{-3.2}^{+3.7}\ ^{\circ}$ and a true obliquity of $\psi=21.3_{-12.8}^{+12.5}\ ^{\circ}$ with an upper limit of $40^{\circ}$ at a 95\% confidence level. The result agrees with dynamically quiet formation or tidal obliquity damping that realigned the system. As the first hot Jupiter around an M dwarf with its obliquity measured, TOI-4201b joins the group of aligned giant planets around cool stars ($T_{\rm eff}&lt;6250\ K$), as well as the small but growing sample of planets with relatively high planet-to-star mass ratio ($M_p/M_\ast\gtrsim 3\times 10^{-3}$) that also appear to be mostly aligned.</description>

      <title>Low-mass planets falling into gaps with cyclonic vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the planetary migration of low-mass planets ($M_p\in[1,15]M_\oplus$, here $M_\oplus$ is the Earth mass) in a gaseous disc containing a previously formed gap. We perform high-resolution 3D simulations with the FARGO3D code. To create the gap in the surface density of the disc, we use a radial viscosity profile with a bump, which is maintained during the entire simulation time. We find that when the gap is sufficiently deep, the spiral waves excited by the planet trigger the Rossby wave instability, forming cyclonic (underdense) vortices at the edges of the gap. When the planet approaches the gap, it interacts with the vortices, which produce a complex flow structure around the planet. Remarkably, we find a widening of the horseshoe region of the planet produced by the vortex at the outer edge of the gap, which depending on the mass of the planet differs by at least a factor of two with respect to the standard horseshoe width. This inevitably leads to an increase in the corotation torque on the planet and produces an efficient trap to halt its inward migration. In some cases, the planet becomes locked in corotation with the outer vortex. Under this scenario, our results could explain why low-mass planets do not fall towards the central star within the lifetime of the protoplanetary disc. Lastly, the development of these vortices produces an asymmetric temporal evolution of the gap, which could explain the structures observed in some protoplanetary discs.</description>

      <title>A Dust-Trapping Ring in the Planet-Hosting Disk of Elias 2-24</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rings and gaps are among the most widely observed forms of substructure in protoplanetary disks. A gap-ring pair may be formed when a planet carves a gap in the disk, which produces a local pressure maximum following the gap that traps inwardly drifting dust grains and appears as a bright ring due to the enhanced dust density. A dust-trapping ring would provide a promising environment for solid growth and possibly planetesimal production via the streaming instability. We present evidence of dust trapping in the bright ring of the planet-hosting disk Elias 2-24, from the analysis of 1.3 mm and 3 mm ALMA observations at high spatial resolution (0.029 arcsec, 4.0 au). We leverage the high spatial resolution to demonstrate that larger grains are more efficiently trapped and place constraints on the local turbulence ($8 \times 10^{-4} &lt; \alpha_\mathrm{turb} &lt; 0.03$) and the gas-to-dust ratio ($\Sigma_g / \Sigma_d &lt; 30$) in the ring. Using a scattering-included marginal probability analysis we measure a total dust disk mass of $M_\mathrm{dust} = 13.8^{+0.7}_{-0.5} \times 10^{-4} \ M_\odot$. We also show that at the orbital radius of the proposed perturber, the gap is cleared of material down to a flux contrast of 10$^{-3}$ of the peak flux in the disk.</description>

      <title>Ariel stellar characterisation II. Chemical abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen for 181 planet-host FGK dwarf stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the ultimate goals of the ESA Ariel space mission is to shed light on the formation pathways and evolution of planetary systems in the Solar neighbourhood. Such an endeavour is only possible by performing a large chemical survey of not only the planets, but also their host stars, inasmuch as stellar elemental abundances are the cipher key to decode the planetary compositional signatures. This work aims at providing homogeneous abundances of C, N, and O of a sample of 181 stars belonging to the Tier 1 of the Ariel Mission Candidate Sample. We applied the spectral synthesis and the equivalent width methods to a variety of atomic and molecular indicators (C I lines at 5052 and 5380.3 A, [O I] forbidden line at 6300.3 A, C_2 bands at 5128 and 5165 A, and CN band at 4215 A) using high-resolution and high S/N spectra collected with several spectrographs. We provide carbon abundances for 180 stars, nitrogen abundances for 105 stars, and oxygen abundances for 89 stars. We analyse the results in the light of the Galactic chemical evolution, and in terms of the planetary companions properties. Our sample basically follows the typical trends with metallicity expected for the [C/Fe], [N/Fe], and [O/Fe] abundance ratios. The fraction between C and O abundances, both yields of primary production, is consistent with a constant ratio as [O/H] increases, whereas the abundance of N tends to increase with the increasing of the O abundance, supporting the theoretical assumption of a secondary production of nitrogen. The [C/N], [C/O], and [N/O] ratios are also correlated with [Fe/H], which might introduce biases in the interpretation of the planetary compositions and formation histories if host stars of different metallicity are compared. We provide relations that can be used to qualitatively estimate whether the atmospheric composition of planets is enriched or not with respect to the host stars.</description>

      <title>Planet formation regulated by galactic-scale interstellar turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planet formation occurs over a few Myr within protoplanetary discs of dust and gas, which are often assumed to evolve in isolation. However, extended gaseous structures have been uncovered around many protoplanetary discs, suggestive of late-stage in-fall from the interstellar medium (ISM). To quantify the prevalence of late-stage in-fall, we apply an excursion set formalism to track the local density and relative velocity of the ISM over the disc lifetime. We then combine the theoretical Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion rate with a simple disc evolution model, anchoring stellar accretion time-scales to observational constraints. Disc lifetimes, as well as masses, stellar accretion rates and approximate gas radii as a function of stellar mass and age are remarkably well-reproduced by our simple model that includes only ISM accretion. If BHL accretion is the origin of the initial disc material, then $20{-}70$ percent of discs are mostly composed of material accreted in the most recent half of their lifetime, suggesting that disc properties are not a direct test of isolated evolution models. The ISM also deposits sufficient energy to drive observed turbulence in protoplanetary discs with viscous $\alpha_\mathrm{SS} \sim 10^{-5}- 10^{-1}$, although we emphasise that angular momentum transport may still be driven internal processes. Overall, our findings represent a compelling case for regulation of planet formation by galactic-scale turbulence, with broad consequences for planet formation theory. Our simple approach can be easily applied to semi-analytic models, and our results represent urgent motivation for an unbiased survey to confirm or refute our findings.</description>

Abstract: Aims.We conduct a high-precision differential abundance analysis of the remarkable binary system HD 240429/30 (Krios and Kronos, respectively), whose difference in metallicity is one of the highest detected in systems with similar components to date (approximately 0.20 dex). A condensation temperature TC trend study was performed to search for possible chemical signatures of planet formation. In addition, other potential scenarios have been proposed to explain this disparity. Methods. Fundamental atmospheric parameters (Te f f , log g, [Fe/H], vturb) were calculated using the latest version of the FUNDPAR code employing high resolution MAROON-X spectra. We applied a full line-by-line differential technique to measure the abundances of 26 elements in both stars with equivalent widths and spectral synthesis taking advantage of the non-solar scaled opacities. Results.We found a difference in metallicity of approximately 0.230 dex, being Kronos more metal rich than Krios. The analysis encompassed the examination of the diffusion effect and primordial chemical differences, concluding that the observed chemical discrepancies in the binary system cannot be solely attributed to any of these processes. The results also shown a noticeable excess of Li by approximately 0.56 dex in Kronos, and an enhancement of refractories with respect to Krios. A photometric study with TESS data was carried out, without finding any signal of possible transiting planets around the stars. Several potential planet formation scenarios were also explored to account for the observed excess in both metallicity and lithium in Kronos. Planetary engulfment is a plausible explanation, considering the ingestion of an exceptionally large mass, approximately approximately 27.8M_Earth, but no scenario is definitively ruled out.</description>

      <title>A Collection of German Science Interests in the Next Generation Very Large Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10056</link>

Abstract: The Next Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) is a planned radio interferometer providing unprecedented sensitivity at wavelengths between 21 cm and 3 mm. Its 263 antenna element array will be spatially distributed across North America to enable both superb low surface brightness recovery and sub-milliarcsecond angular resolution imaging. The project was developed by the international astronomy community under the lead of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), and is anticipated to be built between 2027 and 2037. Two workshops have been held in 2022 and 2023 with the goal to discuss and consolidate the scientific interests in the ngVLA within the German astronomical community. This community paper constitutes a collection of 48 science ideas which the German community aims to pursue with the ngVLA in the 2030s. This is not a complete list and the ideas are not developed at the level of a "Science Book", such that the present document is mainly meant provide a basis for further discussion within the community. As such, additional contributions are welcome, and will be considered for inclusion in future revisions.</description>
