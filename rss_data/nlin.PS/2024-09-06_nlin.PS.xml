      <title>Dissipative Nonlinear Thouless Pumping of Temporal Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between topology and soliton is a central topic in nonlinear topological physics. So far, most studies have been confined to conservative settings. Here, we explore Thouless pumping of dissipative temporal solitons in a nonconservative one-dimensional optical system with gain and spectral filtering, described by the paradigmatic complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. Two dissipatively induced nonlinear topological phase transitions are identified. First, when varying dissipative parameters across a threshold, the soliton transitions from being trapped in time to quantized drifting. This quantized temporal drift remains robust, even as the system evolves from a single-soliton state into multi-soliton state. Second, a dynamically emergent phase transition is found: the soliton is arrested until a critical point of its evolution, where a transition to topological drift occurs. Both phenomena uniquely arise from the dynamical interplay of dissipation, nonlinearity and topology.</description>

      <title>Natural convection in a vertical channel. Part 1. Wavenumber interaction and Eckhaus instability in a narrow domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a vertical channel driven by an imposed horizontal temperature gradient, numerical simulations have previously shown steady, time-periodic and chaotic dynamics. We explore the observed dynamics by constructing invariant solutions of the three-dimensional Oberbeck-Boussinesq equations, characterizing the stability of these equilibria and periodic orbits, and following the bifurcation structure of the solution branches under parametric continuation in Rayleigh number. We find that in a narrow vertically-periodic domain of aspect ratio ten, the flow is dominated by the competition between three and four co-rotating rolls. We demonstrate that branches of three and four-roll equilibria are connected and can be understood in terms of their discrete symmetries. Specifically, the D4 symmetry of the four-roll branch dictates the existence of qualitatively different intermediate branches that themselves connect to the three-roll branch in a transcritical bifurcation due to D3 symmetry. The physical appearance, disappearance, merging and splitting of rolls along the connecting branch provide a physical and phenomenological illustration of the equivariant theory of D3-D4 mode interaction. We observe other manifestations of the competition between three and four rolls, in which the symmetry in time or in the transverse direction is broken, leading to limit cycles or wavy rolls, respectively. Our work highlights the interest of combining numerical simulations, bifurcation theory, and group theory, in order to understand the transitions between and origin of flow patterns.</description>
