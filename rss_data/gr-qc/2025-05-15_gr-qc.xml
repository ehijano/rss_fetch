      <title>Regular black holes from Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been recently shown that regular black holes arise as the unique spherically symmetric solutions of broad families of generalizations of Einstein gravity involving infinite towers of higher-curvature corrections in $D\geq 5$ spacetime dimensions. In this paper we argue that such regular black holes arise as the byproduct of the gravitational collapse of pressureless dust stars. We show that, just like for Einstein gravity, the modified junction conditions for these models impose that the dust particles on the star surface follow geodesic trajectories on the corresponding black hole background. Generically, in these models the star collapses until it reaches a minimum size (and a maximum density) inside the inner horizon of the black hole it creates. Then, it bounces back and reappears through a white hole in a different universe, where it eventually reaches its original size and restarts the process. Along the way, we study FLRW cosmologies in the same theories that regularize black hole singularities. We find that the cosmological evolution is completely smooth, with the big bang and big crunch singularities predicted by Einstein gravity replaced by cosmological bounces.</description>

      <title>Cosmological mirror symmetry and gravitational-wave helicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our current understanding of the Universe relies on the hypothesis that, when observed at sufficiently large scales, it looks statistically identical regardless of location or direction of observation. Consequently, the Universe should exhibit mirror-reflection symmetry. In this essay, we show that gravitational-wave astronomy provides a unique, observer-independent test of this hypothesis. In particular, we analyze the average circular polarization emitted by an ensemble of binary black hole mergers detected by LIGO-Virgo, which we compute using a novel geometric and chiral observable in general relativity. We discuss current results and future prospects with upcoming detections and technical advancements. Moreover, we show that this circular polarization and the helicity of the remnant black hole are linearly correlated, drawing a conceptual parallel with Wu experiment in particle physics.</description>

      <title>A fully relativistic treatment of EMRIs in collisionless environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future mHz gravitational wave (GW) interferometers will precisely probe massive black hole environments, such as accretion discs, cold dark matter overdensities, and clouds of ultralight bosons, as long as we can accurately model the dephasing they induce on the waveform of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). Most existing models rely on extrapolations from Newtonian results to model the interaction of the small black hole in an EMRI system with the environment surrounding the massive black hole. Here, we present a fully relativistic formalism to model such interaction with collisionless environments, focusing on the case of cold dark matter overdensities, like 'spikes' and 'mounds'. We implement our new formalism in the FastEMRIWaveforms framework and show that the resulting waveforms are significantly different from those based on a Newtonian treatment of environmental effects. Our results indicate that a fully relativistic treatment is essential to capture the environmental dephasing of GW signals from EMRIs accurately.</description>

      <title>Charged wormholes in (anti-)de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a family of charged, traversable wormhole solutions in the presence of a cosmological constant. In de Sitter spacetime, two types of wormhole throats can exist--referred to as typical and cosmological throat--located at small and large radial values, respectively. In anti-de Sitter spacetime, the throat geometry allows for positive, zero, or negative curvature, enabling the possibility of an infinite throat area. We analyze the flare-out condition, a key requirement for the existence of traversable wormholes, which imposes constraints on the equation of state parameters governing the supporting matter. These solutions are shown to be of Petrov type D. Furthermore, we examine radial geodesics of null and timelike particles. In the de Sitter case, particles traverse the wormhole, passing from one throat to the other. In contrast, in the anti-de Sitter case, particles exhibit recurrent oscillatory motion between two asymptotic regions, cyclically disappearing and reappearing across the throats.</description>

      <title>Resonant DM scattering in the galactic center under the influence of EMRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) search is one of the greatest challenges in physics. If DM consists of particles, it may form a spike around supermassive black holes (BH) prevalent in galaxy centers. This spike could be potentially observed by altering the orbits of Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs), one of LISA's main targets. Meanwhile, the effects of EMRI on the DM spike have also been explored. In this study, we focus on the tidal resonances between DM particles and EMRI secondary. As the EMRI orbit evolves via gravitational wave backreaction, each DM particle experiences a significant number of resonances. Although the effect of each individual resonance is small, their cumulative impact might significantly alter the DM particle's orbit. To examine this possibility, we explicitly derive the interaction Hamiltonian for tidal resonances and conducted numerical calculations.</description>

      <title>Distorted black holes: nonextensivity in the gravitational wave emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interaction between a non-rotating black hole and incoming gravitational waves using the characteristic formulation of the Einstein field equations, framed as a Bondi problem. By adopting retarded time as the null coordinate and recognizing that the final state is invariably a black hole, we show that an apparent horizon forms once sufficient mass accretes onto the black hole. We derive the evolution of the Bondi mass and compute its final value, enabling us to quantify the fraction of the incident mass absorbed by the black hole. Additionally, we establish a nonextensive relation for the absorbed mass as a function of initial parameters, such as the amplitude of the gravitational wave data.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Core of Double Field Theory: Lecture Notes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double Field Theory (DFT) has emerged as a comprehensive framework for gravity, presenting a testable and robust alternative to General Relativity (GR), rooted in the $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$ symmetry principle of string theory. These lecture notes aim to provide an accessible introduction to DFT, structured in a manner similar to traditional GR courses. Key topics include doubled-yet-gauged coordinates, Riemannian versus non-Riemannian parametrisations of fundamental fields, covariant derivatives, curvatures, and the $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$-symmetric augmentation of the Einstein field equation, identified as the unified field equation for the closed string massless sector. By offering a novel perspective, DFT addresses unresolved questions in GR and enables the exploration of diverse physical phenomena, paving the way for significant future research.</description>

      <title>Constraining Dirty Black Holes and pseudo-complex General Relativity with the Gravitational Waves Transient Catalog 3.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use data from the Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog 3.0 to update constraints on parameterized deviations from General Relativity, as encountered in pseudo-complex general relativity (pcGR) theory and models of dirty black holes. The pcGR framework extends Einstein's theory of general relativity by introducing additional parameters that diverge from standard predictions in the strong-field regime, potentially excluding black hole horizons for specific parameter choices. We analyze gravitational wave signals from coalescing compact objects to obtain new bounds on these parameters. Our results modify existing constraints and identify previously unexplored regions of parameter space, exploring the observational viability of dirty black holes and horizonless solutions in pcGR. We confirm the exclusion of 1PN deviations sufficient to avoid a horizon, and for the first time rule out 1.5PN as well. We also discuss implications for current and future gravitational wave observations in refining these constraints</description>

      <title>Spherical trapped surfaces in n-dimensional general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine gravitational collapse of matter fields in $n$-dimensional general relativity. The matter energy-momentum tensor under consideration includes dust, perfect fluids with equations of state and matter admitting bulk and shear viscosity. By adjusting various parameters of the matter energy-momentum tensor, we determine the trapped region and spherical marginally trapped surfaces in homogeneous and inhomogeneous models of collapse. We show that, as expected, the time development of marginally trapped tube is intricately related to the initial velocity and density profiles of the collapsing matter configuration. This study clarifies the role of initial data in the formation of spacetime singularity during gravitational collapse and implies that, under generic conditions on the matter profiles, the central spacetime singularity is always covered by a horizon.</description>

      <title>Density perturbations in nonminimally coupled gravity: symptoms of Lagrangian density ambiguity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of density perturbations is analysed in a modified theory of gravity with a nonminimal coupling between curvature and matter. We consider the broken degeneracy between the choices of matter Lagrangian for a perfect fluid, $\mathcal{L}_m=-\rho$ and $\mathcal{L}_m=p$, and determine the differences between their effects on the effective gravitational constant. We review the result for $\mathcal{L}_m=-\rho$ in the quasistatic approximation and show how it can lead to unphysical singular behaviour for late-time dominating models. This divergent regime can be avoided when considering the fully non-quasistatic perturbative equations, although the higher-order nature of the nonminimally coupled theory and the requirement of a physically viable effective gravitational constant strongly constrains the magnitude of these modifications to the action. We find that both of these issues can be removed when considering $\mathcal{L}_m=p$ at late times due to the pressureless nature of non-relativistic matter and provide predictions for inverse power-law models.</description>

      <title>Curvature corrections to Starobinsky inflation can explain the ACT results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of curvature corrections to Starobinsky inflation in light of the latest observational results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). While the pure Starobinsky model remains a compelling candidate for cosmic inflation, we explore how the higher-order curvature terms $R^3$, $R^{4}$ and $R^{3/2}$ modify the inflationary predictions. Using the scalar-tensor formulation of $f(R)$ gravity, we derive the effective scalar potentials and compute the resulting scalar tilt $n_{s}$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We show that those curvature corrections can shift the predictions to align better with the ACT data, thus providing a possible resolution to a minor discrepancy between the standard Starobinsky model and ACT observations. Our findings suggest that the modified Starobinsky models with the higher-order curvature terms offer a viable pathway to reconciling inflationary predictions with precision cosmological measurements. At the same time, measuring or constraining primordial tensor modes can help to discriminate between these corrections.</description>

      <title>Crystallizing spacetime: a fundamentally classical framework for quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional approaches to quantum gravity regard quantum principles, such as nonlocality and superposition, as fundamental properties of nature and therefore argue that gravity must also be quantized. In contrast, this work introduces a theory of crystallizing spacetime, which offers an alternative perspective: that both gravitational and quantum mechanical observations can be explained within a fundamentally classical framework operating beyond traditional spacetime. The theory proposes a spacetime relaxation mechanism wherein a dynamically evolving four-dimensional spacetime, populated by dynamic worldlines, relaxes as a function of the parameter $\tau$ into a standard spacetime consistent with general relativity. Simulations in the weak-gravity limit illustrate this process of spacetime and worldline relaxation. Additionally, models are developed showing that two hallmark quantum phenomena -- nonlocality in an EPR experiment and double-slit interference of a massive particle -- can be reproduced in this fundamentally classical framework by implementing Costa de Beauregard's concept of zigzag action along worldlines. The resulting crystallizing spacetime framework not only resolves the measurement problem but also provides a compelling basis for a unified theory of matter and gravity. Since this framework is grounded in concepts analogous to realism, locality, and determinism at its foundations, it brings Einstein's long-sought intuitive worldview within reach.</description>

      <title>On the uniqueness of the Kerr-(A)dS metric as a type II(D) solution in six dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the class of six-dimensional $\Lambda$-vacuum spacetimes which admit a non-degenerate multiple Weyl aligned null direction l (thus being of Weyl type~II or more special) with a ``generic'' optical matrix. Subject to an additional assumption on the asymptotic fall-off of the Weyl tensor, we obtain the most general metric of this class, which is specified by one discrete (normalized) and three continuous parameters. All solutions turn out to be Kerr--Schild spacetimes of type~D and, in passing, we comment on their Kerr--Schild double copy. We further show that the obtained family is locally isometric to the general doubly-spinning Kerr-NUT-(A)dS metric with the NUTs parameters switched off. In particular, the Kerr-(A)dS subclass and its extensions (i.e., analytic continuation and ``infinite-rotation'' limit) are recovered when certain polynomial metric functions are assumed to be fully factorized. As a side result, a unified metric form which encompasses all three branches of the extended Kerr-(A)dS family in all even dimensions is presented in an appendix.</description>

      <title>Thawing Dark Energy and Massive Neutrinos in Light of DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00126v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent analyses have shown that a dynamic dark energy modeled by the CPL parameterization of the dark energy equation of state (EoS) can ease constraints on the total neutrino mass compared to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. This helps reconcile cosmological and particle physics measurements of $\sum m_\nu$. In this study, we investigate the robustness of this effect by assessing the extent to which the CPL assumption influences the results. We examine how alternative EoS parameterizations - such as Barboza-Alcaniz (BA), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), and a physically motivated thawing parameterization that reproduces the behavior of various scalar field models - affect estimates of $\sum m_\nu$. Although both the BA and JBP parameterizations relax the constraints similarly to the CPL model, the JBP parameterization still excludes the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy at $\sim 2.1\;\sigma$ with $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.096$~eV. The thawing parameterization excludes the inverted hierarchy at $\sim 3.3\sigma$ and yields tighter constraints, comparable to those of the $\Lambda$CDM model, with $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.071$~eV. Our analysis also reveals that the preference for unphysical negative neutrino masses is significantly reduced in all models considered. Finally, we show that the thawing model can be mapped into the BA and JBP $w_0$-$w_a$ parameter space, with the apparent preference for the phantom regime actually supporting quintessence (non-phantom) models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the probe brane construction of higher derivative effective field theories, extended to higher co-dimensions and curved spaces, we construct galileon and DBI theories on de Sitter space with N fields and an so(N) internal symmetry, non-linearly realizing the symmetries of a higher dimensional de Sitter space. In some cases, the theory admits a non-trivial vacuum that spontaneously breaks the so(N) symmetry, and around this vacuum the Goldstone modes have vanishing kinetic terms and become infinitely strongly coupled. This gives an example of a scalar effective field theory with two de Sitter vacua, one of which appears to have Boulware-Deser-like ghosts, and one of which does not.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate some very special features of the Dirac-Born-Infeld--like (DBI) gravitational counter-term in AdS$_4$ spacetime, in the context of holography with a sharp radial cut-off. We show that the three-sphere partition function is not only independent of a constant radial cut-off, but also remains unchanged under deformations of the cut-off surface. We also consider the renormalized holographic entanglement entropy for an equatorial Ryu-Takayanagi surface with a cut-off with an arbitrary shape and show that it can also be independent of the cut-off under a special condition. We also numerically study the behavior of the renormalized entropy with different counter-terms and relate the results to monotonicity properties under holographic renormalization group flow. The DBI counter-term is always seen to be associated with integrating out fewer degrees of freedom compared to other counter-terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic censorship posits spacetime singularities remain concealed behind event horizons, preserving the determinism of General Relativity. While quantum gravity is expected to resolve singularities, we argue that cosmic censorship remains necessary whenever spacetime has a reliable semi-classical description. Using holography to construct exact solutions to semi-classical gravity, we show backreaction of quantum matter generates horizons -- quantum censors -- to thwart potential violations of censorship. Along with a quantum Penrose inequality, this provides compelling evidence cosmic censorship is robust, even nonperturbatively, in semi-classical gravity.</description>

      <title>Scale without Conformal Invariance in bottom-up Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In holography, the isometry group of the bulk spacetime corresponds to the symmetries of the boundary theory. We thus approach the question of whether (and when) scale invariance in combination with Poincar\'e invariance implies full conformal invariance in quantum field theory from a holographic bulk perspective. To do so, we study bulk spacetimes that include a warped extra dimension and in which the isometry group corresponds to scale without conformal invariance. Firstly, we show that the bulk Weyl tensor plays a pivotal role in distinguishing those metrics exhibiting conformal invariance (Weyl=0) from those merely exhibiting scale invariance (Weyl$\neq$0). Based on this, we then prove the following theorem: For putative boundary theories with $n\geq2$ dimensions, the bulk metric can not exhibit scale without conformal invariance if its warped extra dimension is compact and the null energy condition is required to hold. For $n=1$, we discuss that a more general ansatz for the bulk metric must be made, a detailed analysis of which is left for future research.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Bosons Driving Supermassive Black Hole Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons (ULBs) can form macroscopic superradiant clouds around spinning black holes. We show that for scalar ULB masses $\mu \sim 10^{-22}-10^{-21}$ eV boson cloud dynamical friction drives supermassive black hole (SMBH) final-parsec evolution in $\lesssim 1$ Gyr and suppresses the nanohertz gravitational wave background with turnover. Considering century-monitored OJ287 system, we place novel bounds restricting ULB mass range $\mu \simeq (8.5-22) \times 10^{-22}$ eV independent of any dark matter assumptions and show ULB drag can also efficiently reconcile any future confirmations of the debated orbital decay excess. Forthcoming pulsar timing array data and precise SMBH orbital timings will decisively test this scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this essay, we argue that an observer outside the horizon can reconstruct the geometry of a black hole's interior through external measurements. This procedure builds on recent studies of the holographic duality of timelike entanglement entropy and its connection to spacelike entanglement entropy. Furthermore, we propose that this phenomenon reveals a fundamental correlation between the degrees of freedom inside and outside the black hole at the level of classical spacetime.</description>

      <title>New cosmological constraints on the evolution of dark matter energy density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We constrain the evolution of dark matter energy density over time, specifically focusing on deviation from the standard model represented by the equation $\rho_{m}\propto(1+z)^{3-\varepsilon}$, where $\varepsilon$ is a constant parameter. Utilizing a diverse array of observational datasets, including baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data from the first release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), distance priors derived from cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations by the Planck satellite, Hubble rate data obtained through the cosmic chronometers (CC) method, type Ia supernova (SNIa) data from the Panthon sample, and the data from the redshift space distortion (RSD) measurements ($f\sigma_8$), we derive stringent constraints on the deviation parameter. We find that for the model under consideration, the deviation parameter is constrained to be $\varepsilon = -0.0073^{+0.0029}_{-0.0033}$, indicating a deviation of approximately $2.4\sigma$ from the scenario where dark matter and vacuum dark energy do not interact. When compared with previous studies and alternative analyses, our findings provide corroborative evidence for an interaction between dark matter and vacuum dark energy, particularly in light of the release of BAO data from DESI.</description>

      <title>Probing the Dynamics of Gaussian Dark Energy Equation of State Using DESI BAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an updated reconstruction of the various dark energy equation of state (EoS), $w(a)$, employing the newly released DESI DR2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data. This analysis constrains the cosmological scenarios influenced by these equations through the joint examination of a range of recently available cosmological probes, specifically the Pantheon+ sample and the DESY5 sample of Type Ia Supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, Hubble parameter measurements derived from cosmic chronometers, and cosmic microwave background distance priors based on the Planck 2018 data. Furthermore, we provide a concise perspective on the dynamical evolution of all models and the interrelations among them. A Bayesian inference procedure is adopted to estimate the model parameters that yield the best fit to the data. The EoS remains within the phantom regime at higher redshifts, while favoring the quintessence regime in the current epoch. In this context, we propose a new Gaussian form EoS, termed BellDE, which avoids phantom behavior (\(w \geq -1\)) at higher redshifts while remaining precisely calibrated at lower redshifts. Interestingly, BellDE exhibits a transient phantom nature (\(w &lt; -1\)) only around the transition redshift \(z \sim 0.5\), subsequently evolving into a quintessential regime (\(w &gt; -1\)), as indicated by comparisons with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) and other parameterized EoS forms.</description>

      <title>Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory (SF-QFT): An innovative framework for yielding scale and scheme invariant observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory (SF-QFT), a framework that performs path-integral factorization of ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) momentum modes at a physical scale $Q^*$ before perturbative expansion. This approach yields a UV-finite effective action whose Wilson coefficients $C_i(Q)$ and coupling $a_{\mathrm{eff}}(Q)$ are fixed by matching to experiment. Because the two-loop $\beta$-function is universal in massless QCD, $a_{\mathrm{eff}}(Q)$ evolves with a scheme-independent equation, with higher-order $\beta$-coefficients absorbed into the $C_i$. Applying SF-QFT to the inclusive ratio $R_{e^{+}e^{-}}$ gives $R^{\mathrm{SF-QFT}}(31.6\,\mathrm{GeV}) = 1.04911 \pm 0.00084$, in excellent agreement with experiment ($R^{\mathrm{exp}}(31.6\,\mathrm{GeV})= 1.0527 \pm 0.005$) while requiring orders of magnitude fewer calculations than a conventional four-loop $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ approach. We find universal algebraic recursion relations that generate all higher-order contributions without additional Feynman diagrams, yielding scheme-invariant predictions with remarkable convergence. SF-QFT provides a rigorous proof for the existence of a positive mass gap in Yang-Mills theory, resolving one of the Millennium Prize Problems by demonstrating how non-perturbative effects emerge naturally from the path-integral factorization. For QED, the same formalism integrates out high-energy modes above $Q^*$, producing scheme-independent predictions for the electron anomalous magnetic moment with unprecedented precision ($a_e^{\text{theory}} = 0.001~159~652~183~56(76)$). SF-QFT heralds a paradigm shift in quantum field theory, replacing the pursuit of ever-higher loop orders with a unified framework that handles both perturbative and non-perturbative physics while maintaining manifest gauge invariance and eliminating renormalization ambiguities.</description>

Abstract: We investigate nonradial $f$-mode oscillations of protoneutron stars in full general relativity, employing equations of state described by the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory or the relativistic mean field model, while assuming isentropy and fixed lepton fractions for the internal structure. The validity of various universal relations for cold neutron stars involving $f$-mode characteristics and macroscopic properties of the star is confirmed for those isentropic protoneutron stars. Prospects of observations are also discussed. According to simulation results, we then model details of the thermal and trapping profiles in a PNS with the canonical mass. The corresponding $f$-mode frequencies and gravitational-wave strain amplitudes are presented. The validity of the universal relations during the evolution to the formation of a cold neutron star is confirmed.</description>

      <title>Shared Properties of Merger-driven Long-duration Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent detections of bright optical/infrared kilonova signals following two long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs), GRB 211211A and GRB 230307A, have significantly challenged the traditional classification of GRBs. These merger-driven LGRBs may represent a distinct GRB population. Since traditional GRB classification methods often struggle to distinguish merger-driven LGRBs from traditional merger-driven short-duration GRBs resulting from compact object mergers and collapse-driven LGRBs produced by massive stars, this work aims to explore the shared properties in terms of hardness, energy, and duration among currently observed merger-driven LGRB events, thereby identifying their observed differences from the traditional GRB population. We collect a sample of merger-driven LGRBs with known redshifts, including observed information on their main emission (ME) and whole emission (WE) phases. Treating ME and WE properties as two independent sets of information, we apply several GRB classification methodologies to explore their potential shared properties. Using the phenomenologically defined Energy-Hardness (EH) parameter, we identify a probable universal linear correlation across merger-driven LGRBs, regardless of whether their ME or WE phases are considered. We propose that such shared properties of merger-driven LGRBs are unlikely to arise from the low-redshift selection effect and they become particularly intriguing when compared with the relatively weak correlations or lack of correlation observed in traditional merger-driven short-duration GRBs (with or without extended emissions) and collapse-driven LGRBs. Our newly proposed correlation highlights the necessity for further investigation into the observations of merger-driven LGRBs and the physical mechanisms underlying the empirical correlation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlated time-of-arrival measurements by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have provided a new means of constraining astrophysical or cosmological models that produce a gravitational wave (GW) background. For this work, we discuss the implications of PTA observations for Gauss-Bonnet (GB) inflationary models through the production and propagation of inflationary GWs. We show that our GB inflationary scenario is consistent with present PTA and cosmological data. A blue-tilted tensor power spectrum supported by PTAs can be naturally accommodated in GB inflation. Using observational constraints, we derive general conditions for the inflaton potential and the GB coupling function, suggesting that in GB inflation, the inflaton must climb up the potential before rolling downhill and reaching the end of inflation. We provide two concrete GB inflationary models to demonstrate the viability of this mechanism.</description>

      <title>Potential Reconstruction from ACT Observations Leading to Polynomial $\alpha$-Attractor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) has recently reported updated measurements of the scalar spectral index $n_s$, which exhibit tension with predictions from many conventional inflationary models when combined with other observational data. In this work, we adopt a parameterization of the spectral index of the form $n_s = 1 - p/(N + \alpha)$ and reconstruct an inflationary potential that is consistent with the latest ACT data. The resulting potential takes the form of an inverse-power plateau, $V(\phi)=V_0[1-(M/\phi)^n]$, where the power index is given $n = 2(p-1)/(2-p)$. To match ACT constraints, $n$ can be chosen as $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, or $5$. The corresponding tensor-to-scalar ratio is $r \approx 16(p-1)/[C (N+\alpha)^p]$ with $C= 2^{2p-1} \left[\sqrt{p-1}/(2-p)\right]^{2p-2} /M^{2p-2}$. The reconstructed potential corresponds to the form of the Polynomial $\alpha$-attractor potential. Since the reconstruction is model-independent, any inflationary model yielding predictions of the form $n_s = 1 - p/(N + \alpha)$ and satisfying observational constraints will exhibit a potential profile at the slow-roll region closely resembling that of the Polynomial $\alpha$-attractor.</description>

      <title>Classification of Feynman integral geometries for black-hole scattering at 5PM order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a complete classification of the Feynman integral geometries relevant to the scattering of two black holes at fifth order in the post-Minkowskian (PM) expansion, i.e. at four loops. The analysis includes integrals relevant to both the conservative and dissipative dynamics, as well as to all orders in the self-force (SF) expansion, i.e. the 0SF, 1SF and 2SF orders. By relating the geometries of integrals across different loop orders and integral families, we find that out of the 16,596 potentially contributing integral topologies, only 70 need to be analyzed in detail. By further computing their leading singularities using the loop-by-loop Baikov representation, we show that there only appear two different three-dimensional Calabi-Yau geometries and two different K3 surfaces at this loop order, which together characterize the space of functions beyond polylogarithms to which the 5PM integrals evaluate.</description>

      <title>Resolving Individual Signal in the Presence of Stochastic Background in Future Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent pulsar timing array (PTA) observations have reported evidence of a gravitational wave background (GWB). If supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are indeed the primary source of this signal, future PTA observations, such as those from the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), are expected to simultaneously capture multiple continuous gravitational waves (CGWs) emitted by bright individual SMBH binaries alongside a gravitational wave background (GWB). To address this anticipated scenario in the SKA era, we revisit the F-statistic, a detection method for single source signals in PTA datasets, and introduce a new modeling that accounts for unresolved GWs as a stochastic GWB. Here, we applied this improved F-statistic to the mock datasets that include both CGW and GWB and evaluated how accurately F-statistic can identify the parameters of CGW. As a result, we demonstrate that our approach can successfully improve the estimation of the sky position and the amplitude of CGW, particularly when the GWB is dominant over white noise. This work serves as an initial step toward developing an efficient and robust algorithm based on the F-statistic for future PTA observations.</description>

      <title>Confronting recent light compact star observations with color-flavor locked quark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent analyses on the properties of the central compact object in the HESS J1731-347 remnant and the PSR J1231-1411 pulsar indicated that these two compact objects are characterized by similar (low) masses and possibly different radii. This paper aims at reconciling the aforementioned measurements by utilizing the widely employed color-flavor locked (CFL) MIT bag model. The main objective is related to the examination of the acceptable values for the color superconducting gap $\Delta$ and the bag parameter $B$. Furthermore, our analysis involves two distinct hypotheses for the nature of compact stars. Firstly, we considered the case of absolute stability for strange quark matter and we found that it is possible to explain both measurements, while also respecting the latest astronomical constraints on the masses and radii of compact stars. Secondly, we studied the case of hybrid stellar matter (transition from hadrons to quarks), and concluded that, when early phase transitions are considered, the simultaneous reconciliation of both measurements leads to results that are inconsistent to the existence of massive compact stars. However, we showed that all current constraints may be satisfied under the consideration that the HESS J1731-347 remnant contains a slow stable hybrid star.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that black holes microstates leave an imprint on the gravitational vacuum through their virtual fluctuations. This imprint yields a power law fall off -- rather than an exponential fall off -- for the entanglement of planck scale fluctuations at different points. These entanglements generate an extra energy when space stretches too {\it fast}, since causality prevents a relaxation of these entanglements to their vacuum values. We obtain semiclassical dynamics for slow processes like star formation, but a radical departure from semiclassicality when a black hole horizon forms even though curvatures remain low everywhere. This resolution of the information puzzle also implies an extra energy source at the scale of the cosmological horizon, which may explain the mysteries of dark energy and the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Possibility of Multi-Messenger Observations of Quasi-Periodic Eruptions with X-rays and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent X-ray observations have discovered a class of periodic X-ray flares in galactic nuclei known as quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs). A promising explanation of QPEs is an emission produced when a stellar-mass object orbiting a central supermassive black hole crosses an accretion disk. If the companion is a compact object, such systems would be a prospective multi-messenger target for the space-based observatory LISA and its successors. Here we quantify the prospects for joint X-ray and GW detection of QPEs with orbital frequency in the mHz band using a minimal flare-emission model. Our analysis shows that X-ray observations are most effective at orbital frequencies up to roughly 1 mHz, whereas LISA is sensitive chiefly above about 1 mHz. Because the optimal sensitivity windows overlap only marginally, we predict at most one joint detection during LISA's nominal mission lifetime. Extending GW sensitivity into the sub-millihertz regime (&lt; 0.1 mHz) would raise the possibility of the joint detection by an order of magnitude, enabling QPEs as an interesting multi-messenger target.</description>

Abstract: For a plane gravitational wave whose profile is given, in Brinkmann coordinates, by a $2\times2$ symmetric traceless matrix $K(U)$, the matrix Sturm-Liouville equation $\ddot{P}=KP$ plays a multiple and central r\^ole: (i) it determines the isometries, (ii) it appears as the key tool for switching from Brinkmann to BJR coordinates and vice versa, (iii) it determines the trajectories of particles initially at rest. All trajectories can be obtained from trivial "Carrollian" ones by a suitable action of the (broken) Carrollian isometry group.</description>

Abstract: Kepler's rescaling becomes, when "Eisenhart-Duval lifted" to $5$-dimensional "Bargmann" gravitational wave spacetime, an ordinary spacetime symmetry for motion along null geodesics, which are the lifts of Keplerian trajectories. The lifted rescaling generates a well-behaved conserved Noether charge upstairs, which takes an unconventional form when expressed in conventional terms. This conserved quantity seems to have escaped attention so far. Applications include the Virial Theorem and also Kepler's Third Law. The lifted Kepler rescaling is a Chrono-Projective transformation. The results extend to celestial mechanics and Newtonian Cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.00838v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bialynicki-Birula and Charzynski argued that a gravitational wave emitted during the merger of a black hole binary may be approximated by a circularly polarized wave which may in turn trap particles [1]. In this paper we consider particle motion in a class of gravitational waves which includes, besides circularly polarized periodic waves (CPP) [2], also the one proposed by Lukash [3] to study anisotropic cosmological models. Both waves have a 7-parameter conformal symmetry which contains, in addition to the generic 5-parameter (broken) Carroll group, also a 6th isometry. The Lukash spacetime can be transformed by a conformal rescaling of time to a perturbed CPP problem. Bounded geodesics, found both analytically and numerically, arise when the Lukash wave is of Bianchi type VI. Their symmetries can also be derived from the Lukash-CPP relation. Particle trapping is discussed.</description>

Abstract: We study the stability of theories where the gravitational action has arbitrary algebraic dependence on the three first traces of the Riemann tensor: the Ricci tensor, the co-Ricci tensor, and the homothetic curvature tensor. We collectively call them Ricci-type tensors. We allow arbitrary coupling to matter. We consider the case when the connection is unconstrained, and the cases when either torsion or non-metricity is assumed to vanish. We find which combinations of Ricci-type tensors lead to new degrees of freedom around Minkowski and FLRW space, and when there are ghosts. None of the theories with new degrees of freedom are healthy, except for two previously known cases where there is a single new vector. We find that projective invariance is not a sufficient condition for a theory to be ghost-free.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent treatment of thermal effects in neutron-star post-mergers: observational implications for third-generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We assess the impact of accurate, self-consistent modelling of thermal effects in neutron-star merger remnants in the context of third-generation gravitational-wave detectors. This is done through the usage, in Bayesian model selection experiments, of numerical-relativity simulations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers modelled through: a) nuclear, finite-temperature (or ``tabulated'') equations of state (EoSs), and b) their simplifed piecewise (or ``hybrid'') representation. These cover four different EoSs, namely SLy4, DD2, HShen and LS220. Our analyses make direct use of the Newman-Penrose scalar $\psi_4$ outputted by numerical simulations. Considering a detector network formed by three Cosmic Explorers, we show that differences in the gravitational-wave emission predicted by the two models are detectable with a natural logarithmic Bayes Factor $\log{\cal{B}}\geq 5$ at average distances of $d_L \simeq 50$Mpc, reaching $d_L \simeq 100$Mpc for source inclinations $\iota \leq 0.8$, regardless of the EoS. This impact is most pronounced for the HShen EoS. For low inclinations, only the DD2 EoS prevents the detectability of such modelling differences at $d_L \simeq 150$Mpc. Our results suggest that the usage a self-consistent treatment of thermal effects is crucial for third-generation gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the interaction between the dark sectors from the point of view of a dynamical system analysis. A general setup for interacting dark energy models that incorporates both quintessence and phantom fields through a switch parameter, allowing an interaction in the dark sectors, has been considered. In the first part of our analysis, we have not assumed any specific form of the interaction, and in the second part, we invoked examples in a general framework of the interaction. The potentials of the scalar field are classified into two broad classes of potentials: exponential and non-exponential. We identify the potential late-time attractors of the system, which have a complete dark energy domination. From our analysis, it is evident there could be an interaction between the dark sector. The interaction, if any, weakens over time. We find for the quintessence field the transfer of energy from dark matter to dark energy can flip the direction, and on the contrary, for the phantom field, it is only from dark matter to dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05875v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the dynamics and phase-space behavior of a multi-component dark energy model, where the dark sector consists of a minimally coupled canonical scalar field and the cosmological constant, using a dynamical system analysis setup for various types of potential for which a general parameterization of the scalar field potentials has been considered. Several fixed points with different cosmological behaviors have been identified. A detailed stability analysis has been done and possible late-time attractors have been found. For this multi-component dark energy model, the late-time attractors are either fully dominated by the cosmological constant or represent a scenario where a combination of the scalar field and the cosmological constant dominates the universe. In this type of model, there is a possibility that the scalar field can become dynamical quite early compared to the standard era of dark energy domination. However, our analysis indicates that this early time contribution of the scalar field occurs deep in the matter-dominated era, not before the recombination era.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17247v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons, proposed as candidates for dark matter (DM), are predicted by various new physics models. In the presence of bosons with suitable masses, superradiant (SR) instability can naturally transform a spinning black hole (BH) into a gravitational atom (GA). Here we study the dynamics of intermediate mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs) around a GA formed by ultralight vector field saturated in its SR ground state. We employ a perturbative model at the leading Newtonian order to consistently account for both the conservative effect of cloud gravity and the dissipative effect of cloud ionization. We find the cloud can make a sizable negative contribution to the secular periastron precession at binary separations comparable to the gravitational Bohr radius. Meanwhile, the backreaction of ionization could significantly accelerate the process of orbital decay and circularization. Considering reasonably small vector boson masses, we examine the adiabatic orbital evolution and gravitational waveforms of eccentric inspirals. The results indicate that vector GAs might be detectable through observations of low-frequency IMRIs by the future space-based gravitational-wave detectors, such as LISA and Taiji.</description>

Abstract: Domain walls represent two-dimensional topological defects that emerge from the spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries in various new physics models. In this study, we undertake the first calculation of gravitational waves produced by scalar perturbations generated from the gravitational wave network. Our findings indicate that the gravitational wave spectrum is notably distinct from that of other sources. This opens up a promising avenue for future gravitational wave experiments aimed at exploring the role of domain walls in the early universe.</description>

Retrolensing effects are examined to trace photon emission configurations, while gravitational lensing is investigated through weak and strong deflection limits, with lensing equations and observables applied to Sagittarius A*. The study also includes calculations of time delay, energy deposition rate from neutrino annihilation, phase and probability of neutrino oscillation, and neutrino gravitational lensing.</description>

Abstract: We calculate for the first time the third-order spectrum of gravitational waves sourced by the amplified scalar field perturbations during inflation using the in-in formalism, and discuss the conditions for the third-order spectrum to be smaller than the second-order one. Assuming an exponential growth of the sub-horizon modes of the scalar field perturbations, we find that the third-order spectrum increases faster than the second-order one as the amplification of the field perturbations increases, and thus the third-order spectrum dominates for detectable gravitational waves, which indicates that the perturbation theory breakdowns.</description>

Abstract: We provide a study of the effects of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) generalisation of stochastic inflation on the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) in a model-independent single-field context. We demonstrate how the scalar perturbations' Infra-Red (IR) contributions and the emerging Fokker-Planck equation driving the probability distribution characterise the Langevin equations for the ``soft" modes in the quasi-de Sitter background. Both the classical-drift and quantum-diffusion-dominated regimes undergo a specific analysis of the distribution function using the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism, which helps us to evade a no-go theorem on the PBH mass. Using the EFT-induced alterations, we evaluate the local non-Gaussian parameters in the drift-dominated limit.</description>

Abstract: We derive a coordinate-invariant expression for the photon deflection angle in the strong deflection limit (SDL) of stationary axisymmetric spacetimes. The key logarithmic-divergence coefficient is shown to depend only on quantities locally measurable by a zero-angular-momentum observer -- curvature scalars, the circumferential radius, and the proper angular velocity. The same coefficient governs the damping rate of quasinormal modes (QNMs) in the eikonal limit, establishing a curvature-based, model-independent connection between QNMs and lensing in the SDL near rotating compact objects.</description>

      <title>Resonance of black hole quasinormal modes in coupled systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black hole quasinormal modes (QNMs) can exhibit resonant excitations associated with avoided crossings in their complex frequency spectrum. Such resonance phenomena can serve as novel signatures for probing new physics, where additional degrees of freedom are commonly introduced. Motivated by this possibility, we investigate QNMs in systems where multiple degrees of freedom are coupled with each other, and introduce a definition of excitation factors suitable for such systems. To demonstrate our formulation, we apply it to a black hole in the Einstein-Maxwell-axion theory, where we find that avoided crossings can appear even between longest-lived modes originating from the fundamental modes of different degrees of freedom, in contrast to the Kerr case in General Relativity. We show that the excitation factors are indeed amplified as a manifestation of resonance at parameter values corresponding to the avoided crossings.</description>

Abstract: We identify points of difference between Invariant Set Theory and standard quantum theory, and show that these lead to noticeable differences in predictions between the two theories. We design a number of experiments to test which of these predictions corresponds to our world. If these experiments were undertaken, they would allow us to investigate whether standard quantum theory or invariant set theory best describes reality. These tests can also be deployed on theories sharing similar properties (e.g., Penrose's gravitational collapse theory).</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave model for neutron star merger remnants with supervised learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a time-domain model for the gravitational waves emitted by equal-mass binary neutron star merger remnants for a fixed equation of state. We construct a large set of numerical relativity simulations for a single equation of state consistent with current constraints, totaling 157 equal-mass binary neutron star merger configurations. The gravitational-wave model is constructed using the supervised learning method of K-nearest neighbor regression. As a first step toward developing a general model with supervised learning methods that accounts for the dependencies on equation of state and the binary masses of the system, we explore the impact of the size of the dataset on the model. We assess the accuracy of the model for a varied dataset size and number density in total binary mass. Specifically, we consider five training sets of $\{ 20,40, 60, 80, 100\}$ simulations uniformly distributed in total binary mass. We evaluate the resulting models in terms of faithfulness using a test set of 30 additional simulations that are not used during training and which are equidistantly spaced in total binary mass. The models achieve faithfulness with maximum values in the range of $0.980$ to $0.995$. We assess our models simulating signals observed by the three-detector network of Advanced LIGO-Virgo. We find that all models with training sets of size equal to or larger than $40$ achieve an unbiased measurement of the main gravitational-wave frequency. We confirm that our results do not depend qualitatively on the choice of the (fixed) equation of state. We conclude that training sets, with a minimum size of $40$ simulations, or a number density of approximately $11$ simulations per $0.1\,M_\odot$ of total binary mass, suffice for the construction of faithful templates for the post-merger signal for a single equation of state and equal-mass binaries (abbreviated).</description>

      <title>Dynamical dark energy in the light of DESI 2024 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00634v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The latest findings from the DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) data release 1 (DR1) [1], combined with data from the cosmic microwave background and supernovae, suggest a preference for dynamical dark energy over the cosmological constant. This study has considered the Chevallier-Polarski- Linder (CPL) parameterization for the dark energy equation of state (EoS) and has indicated a possible phantom barrier crossing in the recent past. Despite CPL being the most commonly used parameterization, recent research has pointed out issues with its prior selection and parameter degeneracies. In this paper, we propose an alternative two-parameter parameterization of the dark energy equation of state (EoS). At higher redshifts, it behaves like the cosmological constant. At redshifts z &lt; 1, this parameterization closely approximates the CPL form but deviates from it at lower redshifts. Our findings also indicate that the current value of the EoS of dark energy resembles quintessence, with evidence of a recent crossing of the phantom barrier, supporting the conclusions in [1]. Furthermore, our model significantly reduces the Hubble tension to about 2.8{\sigma} when compared to Hubble Space Telescope and SH0ES data [2], and to 1.6{\sigma} with standardized TRGB and Type Ia supernova data [3]. Bayesian model selection using Bayes factors and Akaike Information Criteria (ACI), shows a strong preference for our parameterization over the {\Lambda} CDM model, aligned with the DESI2024 results and favoring dynamical dark energy.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of Histories: Chaotic Versus Integrable Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15577v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the emergence of decoherent histories in isolated systems based on exact numerical integration of the Schr\"odinger equation for a Heisenberg chain. We reveal that the nature of the system, which we switch from (i) chaotic to (ii) interacting integrable to (iii) non-interacting integrable, strongly impacts decoherence \new{of coarse spin observables}. From a finite size scaling law we infer a strong exponential suppression of coherences for (i), a weak exponential suppression for (ii) and no exponential suppression for (iii) on a relevant short (nonequilibrium) time scale. Moreover, for longer times we find stronger decoherence for (i) but the opposite for (ii), hinting even at a possible power-law decay for (ii) at equilibrium time scales. This behaviour is encoded in the multi-time properties of the quantum histories and it can not be explained by environmentally induced decoherence. Our results suggest that chaoticity plays a crucial role in the emergence of classicality in finite size systems.</description>

      <title>Towards celestial chiral algebras of self-dual black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14324v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we show that several self-dual spacetimes previously studied in the context of celestial and twisted holography arise as limits of a certain Taub-NUT AdS$_4$ metric, the Pedersen metric, in which their Mass, NUT charge and cosmological constant obey a self-duality relation. In particular, self-dual Taub-NUT, a singular double cover of Eguchi-Hanson space, Euclidean AdS$_4$, and non-compact $\mathbb{CP}^2$, which is conformally equivalent to Burns space, arise as special limits of the Pedersen metric. The Pedersen metric can be derived from a curved twistor space which we conjecture to arise from a backreaction of self-dual gravity in the presence of a cosmological constant when coupled to a defect operator wrapping a certain $\mathbb{CP}^1$ at infinity. The curved twistor space gives rise to a $2$-parameter deformation of the celestial symmetry algebra $Lw_\wedge$ which reduces to previously studied algebras in various limits.</description>

      <title>Towards new relativistic doubly $\kappa$-deformed D=4 quantum phase spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose new noncommutative models of quantum phase spaces, containing a pair of $\kappa$-deformed Poincar\'e algebras, with two independent double ($\kappa,\tilde{\kappa}$)-deformations in space-time and four-momenta sectors. The first such quantum phase space can be obtained by contractions $M,R\to \infty$ of recently introduced doubly $\kappa$-deformed $(\kappa,\tilde{\kappa})$-Yang models, with the parameters $M,R$ describing inverse space-time and four-momenta curvatures and constant four-vectors $a_\mu, b_\mu$ determining nine types of $(\kappa,\tilde{\kappa})$-deformations. The second considered model is provided by the nonlinear doubly $\kappa$-deformed TSR algebra spanned by 14 coset $\hat{o}(1,5)/\hat {o}(2)$ generators. The basic algebraic difference between the two models is the following: the first one, described by $\hat{o}(1,5)$ Lie algebra can be supplemented by the Hopf algebra structure, while the second model contains the quantum phase space commutators $[\hat{x}_\mu,\hat{q}_\nu]$, with the standard numerical $i\hbar\eta_{\mu\nu}$ term; therefore it describes the quantum-deformed Heisenberg algebra relations which cannot be equipped with the Hopf algebra.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of tilt sensing using a homodyne quadrature interferometric translational sensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future gravitational wave observation in space will demand improvement in the sensitivity of the local sensor for the drag-free control. This paper presents the proposal, design, and demonstration of a new laser interferometric sensor named Quadrature Interferometric Metrology of Translation and Tilt (QUIMETT) for the drag-free local sensor. QUIMETT enables simultaneous measurements of both translational displacement and tilts of a reflective object with a single interferometer package. QUIMETT offers a characteristic feature where the sensitivity to tilt is independent of the interference condition while maintaining the ability to measure the translational displacement for a range greater than the laser wavelength. The tilt-sensing function has been demonstrated in a prototype experiment. The tilt sensitivity remained unchanged in different interference conditions and stayed at 10 nrad/Hz$^{1/2}$ at 0.1 Hz.</description>

      <title>Accurate muonic interactions in neutron star mergers and impact on heavy-element nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The abundances resulting from $r$-process nucleosynthesis as predicted by simulations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers remain an open question as the current state of the art is still restricted to three-species neutrino transport. We present the first BNS merger simulations employing a moment-based general-relativistic neutrino transport with five neutrino species, thus including (anti)muons and advanced muonic $\beta$-processes, and contrast them with traditional three-neutrino-species simulations. Our results show that a muonic trapped-neutrino equilibrium is established, forming a different trapped-neutrino hierarchy akin to the electronic equilibrium. The formation of (anti)muons and the muonization via muonic $\beta$-processes enhance the neutrino luminosity, leading to rapid cooling in the early postmerger phase. Since muonic processes redirect part of the energy otherwise used for protonization by electronic processes, they yield a cooler remnant and disk, together with neutrino-driven winds that are more neutron-rich. Importantly, the unbound ejected mass is smaller than three-species simulations, and, because of its comparatively smaller temperature and proton fraction, it can enhance lanthanide production and reduce the overproduction of light $r$-process elements for softer equations of state. This finding underlines the importance of muonic interactions and five neutrino species in long-lived BNS remnants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of hybrid metric-Palatini gravity, we incorporate non-localities introduced via the inverse of the d'Alembert operators acting on the scalar curvature. We analyse the dynamical structure of the theory and, adopting a scalar-tensor perspective, assess the stability conditions to ensure the absence of ghost instabilities. Focusing on a special class of well-defined hybrid actions -- where local and non-local contributions are carried by distinct types of curvature -- we investigate the feasibility of inflation within the resulting Einstein-frame multi-field scenario. We examine how the non-minimal kinetic couplings between the fields, reflecting the non-local structure of the original frame, influence the number of e-folds and the field trajectories. To clarify the physical interpretation of our results, we draw analogies with benchmark single-field inflation scenarios that include spectator fields.</description>

      <title>Inferring Black Hole Spin from Interferometric Measurements of the First Photon Ring: A Geometric Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately inferring black hole spin is crucial for understanding black hole dynamics and their astrophysical environments. In this work, we outline a geometric method for spin estimation by using the interferometric shape of the first photon ring ($n=1$) as an approximation to the critical curve, which, given an assumed value of the black hole inclination, is then mapped to a spin value. While future space-based missions will capture a wealth of data on the first photon ring--including the full angle-dependent diameter, angular brightness profile, and astrometric offset from the $n=0$ ring--our analysis is restricted to using only two angle-dependent diameters to compute its shape asymmetry and infer spin. Focusing on low inclinations and moderate-to-high spins, we test the method across various emission models, baselines, and noise sources, including a mock space-based observation. Although the size of the $n=1$ ring depends on the emission model, its interferometric shape remains a robust spin probe at low inclinations. We find that the inferred asymmetry of the $n=1$ image may be biased by the critical curve morphology, and it can be heavily skewed by the presence of noise, whether astrophysical or instrumental. In low-noise limits at low viewing inclination, significant contributions from the $n=0$ image at short baselines may lead to a downward bias in asymmetry estimates. While our method can estimate high spins in noise-free time-averaged images, increasing the noise and astrophysical variability degrades the resulting constraints, providing only lower bounds on the spin when applied to synthetic observed data. Remarkably, even using only the ring's asymmetry, we can establish lower bounds on the spin, underscoring the promise of photon ring-based spin inference in future space-based very long baseline interferometry missions, such as the proposed Black Hole Explorer.</description>

      <title>Identifying intermediate mass binary black hole mergers in AGN disks using LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Laser Interferometer Space Antenna can uniquely identify the sites of intermediate-mass binary black hole (IMBBH) mergers if they occur in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) disks with a gas density $\rho\geq10^{-12} \, {\rm g/cc}$ via measurement of dynamical friction effect in the gravitational waveform. We find that even a single observation of a gravitational wave source with a total mass of $10^3 M_{\odot}$ and a mass ratio of 2 at a luminosity distance of 3 Gpc is sufficient to confidently associate the merger to be in an AGN disk with a density $\sim 10^{-12} \, {\rm g/cc}$, as it allows estimation of the density with an error bar $O(100\%)$. This provides a new way of inferring AGN disk densities that complement traditional X-ray observations. Further, we find that neglecting the presence of environmental effects in the waveform models used for parameter estimation can bias the chirp mass, mass ratio and arrival time of a merger. If not corrected, this can significantly impact our ability to carry out multiband data analysis of IMBBHs that combines information from LISA and ground-based gravitational wave detectors.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we explore a relativistic quantum Otto heat engine with a qutrit as the working substance interacting with a quantum scalar field in curved spacetime. Unlike qubits, which extract work by simply expanding or shrinking a single energy gap, qutrits allow multiple energy gaps to be adjusted independently, enabling more versatile work extraction in the quantum Otto cycle. We derive a general positive work condition in terms of the effective temperature that each pair of energy levels perceives. Moreover, we discuss additional subtleties that are absent when using a qubit, such as the generation of coherence terms in the density matrix due to interactions.</description>

      <title>The CosmoVerse White Paper: Addressing observational tensions in cosmology with systematics and fundamental physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard model of cosmology has provided a good phenomenological description of a wide range of observations both at astrophysical and cosmological scales for several decades. This concordance model is constructed by a universal cosmological constant and supported by a matter sector described by the standard model of particle physics and a cold dark matter contribution, as well as very early-time inflationary physics, and underpinned by gravitation through general relativity. There have always been open questions about the soundness of the foundations of the standard model. However, recent years have shown that there may also be questions from the observational sector with the emergence of differences between certain cosmological probes. In this White Paper, we identify the key objectives that need to be addressed over the coming decade together with the core science projects that aim to meet these challenges. These discordances primarily rest on the divergence in the measurement of core cosmological parameters with varying levels of statistical confidence. These possible statistical tensions may be partially accounted for by systematics in various measurements or cosmological probes but there is also a growing indication of potential new physics beyond the standard model. After reviewing the principal probes used in the measurement of cosmological parameters, as well as potential systematics, we discuss the most promising array of potential new physics that may be observable in upcoming surveys. We also discuss the growing set of novel data analysis approaches that go beyond traditional methods to test physical models. [Abridged]</description>

      <title>Universal Cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03449</link>

Abstract: Universal cosmologies are exact solutions of 10d type IIA supergravity containing a 4d Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker factor, that can also be repackaged as solutions of 4d models, i.e. as 4d consistent truncations. We extend the dynamical system analysis of universal cosmologies, beyond the case of a single exponential potential. For an open universe (negative 3d spatial curvature), these models generally possess many desirable features: parametric control of e-folds, late-time acceleration from potentials with steep exponentials (i.e. in accordance with swampland bounds), small string-loop and $\alpha'$-corrections, scale separation and/or absence of decompactification.</description>
