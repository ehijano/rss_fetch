      <title>The points of space are not points: their wavefunctions remove the ultraviolet divergences of quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The points $p(x)$ of space are observables that obey quantum mechanics with average values $\langle p(x) \rangle$ that obey general relativity. In empty flat 3-space, a point $p(x)$ may be represented as the sum $ \boldsymbol p(x) = \langle \boldsymbol p(x) \rangle+ \boldsymbol \epsilon(x)$ of its average value $\langle \boldsymbol p(x) \rangle = \boldsymbol x$ and its quantum remainder $ \boldsymbol \epsilon(x)$. The ubiquitous Fourier exponential $\exp( i \boldsymbol k \cdot \boldsymbol p(x))$ is then $\exp( i \boldsymbol k \cdot ( \boldsymbol x + \boldsymbol \epsilon))$. If the probability distribution of the quantum remainders $ \boldsymbol \epsilon(x)$ is normal and of width $\sigma$, then the average of the exponential $\langle \exp(i \boldsymbol k ( \boldsymbol x + \boldsymbol \epsilon ) \rangle$ contains a gaussian factor $ \exp( - \sigma^2 \boldsymbol k^2/2 ) $ which makes self-energies, Feynman diagrams and dark energy ultraviolet finite. This complex of ideas requires new bosons and suggests that supersymmetry is softly broken.</description>

      <title>Grover's algorithm on two-way quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-way quantum computing (2WQC) represents a novel approach to quantum computing that introduces a CPT version of state preparation. This paper analyses the influence of this approach on Grover's algorithm and compares the behaviour of typical Grover and its 2WQC version in the presence of noise in the system. Our findings indicate that, in an ideal scenario without noise, the 2WQC Grover algorithm exhibits a constant complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1)$. In the presence of noise, the 2WQC Grover algorithm demonstrates greater resilience to different noise models than the standard Grover's algorithm.</description>

      <title>On the Relative Nature of Quantum Individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we argue against the interpretation that underlies the "Standard" account of Quantum Mechanics (SQM) that was established during the 1930s by Niels Bohr and Paul Dirac. Ever since, following this orthodox narrative, physicists have dogmatically proclaimed -- quite regardless of the deep contradictions and problems -- that the the theory of quanta describes a microscopic realm composed of elementary particles (such as electrons, protons and neutrons) which underly our macroscopic world composed of tables, chairs and dogs. After critically addressing this atomist dogma still present today in contemporary (quantum) physics and philosophy, we present a new understanding of quantum individuals defined as the minimum set of relations within a specific degree of complexity capable to account for all relations within that same degree. In this case, quantum individuality is not conceived in absolute terms but -- instead -- as an objectively relative concept which even though depends of the choice of bases and factorizations remain nonetheless part of the same invariant representation.</description>

      <title>Spin Entanglement -- A Unifying Principle for Superconductors and Molecular Bonding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-statistics theorem is generalized to include quantum entanglement. Specifically, within the context of spin entanglement, we prove that isotropic spin-correlated (ISC) states must occur in pairs. This pairing process can be composed of parallel or anti-parallel states. Consequently, the article proposes using ISC states as a unifying principle to explain better Bose-Einstein condensates, the theory of superconductivity, and molecular and atomic orbitals, all of which involve a pairing process. The theoretical framework is established in sections 1 and 2. The other qualitative sections focus primarily on the experimental evidence to support the theory.</description>
