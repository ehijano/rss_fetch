      <title>Deterministic and Stochastic Models in Enzyme Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enzyme kinetics has historically been described by deterministic models, with the Michaelis-Menten (MM) equation serving as a paradigm. However, recent experimental and theoretical advances have made it clear that stochastic fluctuations, particularly at low copy numbers or single-enzyme levels, can profoundly impact reaction outcomes. In this paper, we present a comprehensive view of enzyme kinetics from both deterministic and stochastic perspectives. We begin by deriving the classical Michaelis-Menten equation under the quasi-steady-state assumption (QSSA) and discuss its validity. We then formulate the corresponding stochastic model via the chemical master equation (CME) and illustrate how the Gillespie algorithm can simulate single-molecule events and briefly use Kampen's system-size expansion to justify our simulation methods. Through extended computational analyses -- including variance calculations, phase-plane exploration, and parameter sensitivity -- we highlight how deterministic and stochastic predictions coincide in certain limits but can diverge in small systems. We further incorporate case studies from single-enzyme turnover experiments and cellular contexts to showcase the real-world implications of noise. Taken together, our results underscore the necessity of a multifaceted modeling strategy, whereby one can switch between deterministic methods and stochastic realism to gain a fuller understanding of enzyme kinetics at different scales.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Modeling Primer: Focus on Chromatin and Epigenetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Essential life processes take place across multiple space and time scales in living organisms but understanding their mechanistic interactions remains an ongoing challenge. Advanced multiscale modeling techniques are providing new opportunities and insights into these complex processes. In cells, meters of chromatin are folded into a nucleus with a diameter on the order of microns. The three-dimensional chromatin structure coupled with biochemical processes that turn genes on or off, specify a given cell type through a complicated set of interactions collectively referred to as epigenetics. Important epigenetic processes include the differential accessibility of genomic loci to transcription factors and chemical modifications to DNA and DNA-binding molecules such as histones. The dynamics of these epigenetic processes span timescales from milliseconds to years. How do chemical modifications consisting of a handful of atoms cooperate to modulate genome folding at the scale of the nucleus and impact organism outcomes? In this review, we highlight the inherently multiscale nature of chromatin organization, with a focus on computational modeling to bridge the gaps in our understanding of biochemical processes across scales. We review relevant chromatin biology, including major types of epigenetic modifications as well as the higher order chromatin structures to present a multiscale view of chromatin. We also review relevant computational methods to simulate chromatin structure, function, and dynamics, as well as experimental techniques that inform and validate said models. Finally, we argue that multiscale modeling provides a path forward towards understanding emergent behavior in this inherently multiscale system.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of conserved and reacting moieties in chemical reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A detailed understanding of biochemical networks at the molecular level is essential for studying complex cellular processes. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive description of biochemical networks by considering individual atoms and chemical bonds. To address combinatorial complexity, we introduce a well-established approach to group similar types of information within biochemical networks. A conserved moiety is a set of atoms whose association is invariant across all reactions in a network. A reacting moiety is a set of bonds that are either broken, formed, or undergo a change in bond order in at least one reaction in the network. By mathematically identifying these moieties, we establish the biological significance of conserved and reacting moieties according to the mathematical properties of the stoichiometric matrix. We also present a novel decomposition of the stoichiometric matrix based on conserved moieties. This approach bridges the gap between graph theory, linear algebra, and biological interpretation, thus opening up new horizons in the study of chemical reaction networks.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional Hierarchical Protein Multi-Modal Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein representation learning is critical for numerous biological tasks. Recently, large transformer-based protein language models (pLMs) pretrained on large scale protein sequences have demonstrated significant success in sequence-based tasks. However, pLMs lack structural information. Conversely, graph neural networks (GNNs) designed to leverage 3D structural information have shown promising generalization in protein-related prediction tasks, but their effectiveness is often constrained by the scarcity of labeled structural data. Recognizing that sequence and structural representations are complementary perspectives of the same protein entity, we propose a multimodal bidirectional hierarchical fusion framework to effectively merge these modalities. Our framework employs attention and gating mechanisms to enable effective interaction between pLMs-generated sequential representations and GNN-extracted structural features, improving information exchange and enhancement across layers of the neural network. Based on the framework, we further introduce local Bi-Hierarchical Fusion with gating and global Bi-Hierarchical Fusion with multihead self-attention approaches. Through extensive experiments on a diverse set of protein-related tasks, our method demonstrates consistent improvements over strong baselines and existing fusion techniques in a variety of protein representation learning benchmarks, including react (enzyme/EC classification), model quality assessment (MQA), protein-ligand binding affinity prediction (LBA), protein-protein binding site prediction (PPBS), and B cell epitopes prediction (BCEs). Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art for multimodal protein representation learning, emphasizing the efficacy of BIHIERARCHICAL FUSION in bridging sequence and structural modalities.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical cell identities emerge from animal gene regulatory mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11336v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hierarchical organisation of cell identity is a fundamental feature of animal development with rich and well-characterized experimental phenomenology, yet the mechanisms driving its emergence remain unknown. The regulation of cell identity genes relies on a distinct mechanism involving higher-order interactions of transcription factors on distant regulatory regions called enhancers. These interactions are mediated by epigenetic regulators that are broadly shared between enhancers. Through the development of a new and predictive mathematical theory on the effects of epigenetic regulator activity on gene network dynamics, we demonstrate that hierarchical identities are essential emergent properties of animal-specific gene regulatory mechanisms. Hierarchical identities arise from the interplay between enhancer competition for epigenetic readers and cooperation through activation of shared transcriptional programs. We show that epigenetic regulatory mechanisms provide the network with self-similar properties that enable multilineage priming and signal-dependent control of progenitor states. The stabilisation of progenitor states is predicted to be controlled by the balance in activities between epigenetic writers and erasers. Our model quantitatively predicts lineage relationships, reconstructs all known blood progenitor states from terminal states, and explains mechanisms of cell identity dysregulation in cancer and the general differentiation effects of histone deacetylase inhibition. We identify non-specific modulation of enhancer competition as a central regulatory axis, with implications for developmental biology, cancer, and differentiation therapy.</description>
