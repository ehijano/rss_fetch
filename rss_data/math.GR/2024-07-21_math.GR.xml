      <description>arXiv:2407.13824v1 Announce Type: new

      <title>Effective conjugacy separability of virtually abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A natural question for groups $H$ is which data can be detected in its finite quotients. A subset $X \subset H$ is called separable if for all $h\in H \setminus X$, there exists an epimorphism $\varphi$ to a finite group $Q$ such that $\varphi(h)\notin\varphi(X)$. More specifically, a group is said to be conjugacy separable if every conjugacy class is separable. It is known that many classes of groups are conjugacy separable, including virtually free and polycyclic groups. The minimal order of the quotient $Q$, in terms of the complexity of the conjugacy classes under consideration, is captured by the conjugacy separability function $\mathrm{Conj}_H: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$. This function is in general ill understood, in fact the only large class of groups for which it is known exactly are the abelian groups. Indeed, in this case $\mathrm{Conj}_H$ is equal to the residual finiteness function, that is the size of quotients needed to separate singletons, and thus logarithmic if the group is infinite.
  Recent work has described the residual finiteness function for the class of virtually abelian groups, which gives a lower bound for the conjugacy separability function. The main result of this paper is a characterization of $\mathrm{Conj}_H$ for every virtually abelian group $H$. If the corresponding extension is associated with an irreducible representation over $\mathbb{Q}$, we demonstrate that we obtain the same function as the residual finiteness function. However, if the representation is not irreducible, we find an expression that is in some cases strictly larger, which we illustrate with several examples.</description>

      <title>On the abelianization of certain groups of formal power series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the abelianization of the Jennings group $\mathcal{J}_k(\mathbb{Z})$ of powers series with constant coefficient $0$, linear coefficent equal to $1$ and vanishing coefficients in orders greater or equal than $2$ and less than $k$, where $k\geqslant2$. This is accomplished by directly dealing with the equivalence classes in the corresponding abelianizations, in contrast with the work of I. K. Babenko and S. A. Bogatyy, who give an explicit abelianization morphism for the case $k=2$.</description>

      <title>Successors of topologies of connected locally compact groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group and $\sigma, \tau$ be topological group topologies on $G$. We say that $\sigma$ is a successor of $\tau$ if $\sigma$ is strictly finer than $\tau$ and there is not a group topology properly between them. In this note, we explore the existence of successor topologies in topological groups, particularly focusing on non-abelian connected locally compact groups. Our main contributions are twofold: for a connected locally compact group $(G, \tau)$, we show that (1) if $(G, \tau)$ is compact, then $\tau$ has a precompact successor if and only if there exists a discontinuous homomorphism from $G$ into a simple connected compact group with dense image, and (2) if $G$ is solvable, then $\tau$ has no successors. Our work relies on the previous characterization of locally compact group topologies on abelian groups processing successors.</description>

      <title>Exponential and weakly exponential subgroups of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sabatini (2024) defined a subgroup $H$ of $G$ to be an exponential subgroup if $x^{|G:H|} \in H$ for all $x \in G$. Exponential subgroups are a generalization of normal (and subnormal) subgroups: all subnormal subgroups are exponential, but not conversely. Sabatini proved that all subgroups of a finite group $G$ are exponential if and only if $G$ is nilpotent. The purpose of this paper is to explore what the analogues of a simple group and a solvable group should be in relation to exponential subgroups. We say that an exponential subgroup $H$ of $G$ is exp-trivial if either $H = G$ or the exponent of $G$, ${\rm exp}(G)$, divides $|G:H|$, and we say that a group $G$ is exp-simple if all exponential subgroups of $G$ are exp-trivial. We classify finite exp-simple groups by proving $G$ is exp-simple if and only if ${\rm exp}(G) = {\rm exp}(G/N)$ for all proper normal subgroups $N$ of $G$, and we illustrate how the class of exp-simple groups differs from the class of simple groups. Furthermore, in an attempt to overcome the obstacle that prevents all subgroups of a generic solvable group from being exponential, we say that a subgroup $H$ of $G$ is weakly exponential if, for all $x \in G$, there exists $g \in G$ such that $x^{|G:H|} \in H^g$. If all subgroups of $G$ are weakly exponential, then $G$ is wexp-solvable. We prove that all solvable groups are wexp-solvable and almost all symmetric and alternating groups are not wexp-solvable. Finally, we completely classify the groups ${\rm PSL}(2,q)$ that are wexp-solvable. We show that if $\pi(n)$ denotes the number of primes less than $n$ and $w(n)$ denotes the number of primes $p$ less than $n$ such that ${\rm PSL}(2,p)$ is wexp-solvable, then $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{w(n)}{\pi(n)} = \frac{1}{4}.$</description>

      <title>Orderability of big mapping class groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the mapping class group of a connected oriented infinite-type surface with a non-empty boundary is left-orderable. Our main strategy involves the inductive construction of an ideal arc system for the surface using a carefully chosen exhaustion by finite-type subsurfaces. In fact, we prove that a generalised ideal arc system for the surface also induces a left-ordering on the big mapping class group. We then prove that two generalised ideal arc systems determine the same left-ordering if and only if they are loosely isotopic. Finally, we prove that the topology on the big mapping class group is the same as the order topology induced by a left-ordering corresponding to an inductively constructed ideal arc system.</description>

      <title>Coincidences of Division Fields of an elliptic curve defined over a number field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For an elliptic curve defined over a number field, the absolute Galois group acts on the group of torsion points of the elliptic curve, giving rise to a Galois representation in $\GL(\hat{\Z})$. The obstructions to the surjectivity of this representation are either local (\emph{i.e.} at a prime), or due to nonsurjectivity on the product of local Galois images. In this article, we study an extreme case: the coincidence \emph{i.e.} the equality of $n$-division fields, generated by the $n$-torsion points, attached to different positive integers~$n$. We give necessary conditions for coincidences, dealing separately with vertical coincidences, at a given prime, and horizontal coincidences, across multiple primes, in particular when the Galois group on the $n$-torsion contains the special linear group. We also give a non-trivial construction for coincidences not occurring over $\Q$.</description>

      <title>A Jordan-Chevalley decomposition beyond algebraic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.02637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a decomposition of definable groups in o-minimal structures generalizing the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition of linear algebraic groups. It follows that any definable linear group G is a semidirect product of its maximal normal definable torsion-free subgroup N(G) and a definable subgroup P, unique up to conjugacy, definably isomorphic to a semialgebraic group.
  Along the way, we establish two other fundamental decompositions of classical groups in arbitrary o-minimal structures: 1) a Levi decomposition and 2) a key decomposition of disconnected groups, relying on a generalization of Frattini's argument to the o-minimal setting. In o-minimal structures, together with p-groups, 0-groups play a crucial role. We give a characterization of both classes and show that definable p-groups are solvable, like finite p-groups, but they are not necessarily nilpotent. Furthermore, we prove that definable p-groups (p=0 or p prime) are definably generated by torsion elements and, in definably connected groups, 0-Sylow subgroups coincide with p-Sylow subgroups for each p prime.</description>

      <title>The Hilden Double Coset Problem in Braid Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02488v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a solution to the double coset problem for the braid group $B_n$ modulo the Hilden subgroup $H_n.$ This result demonstrates that, as in the case of braid closures, the Link Problem for plat closures is "stably equivalent" to a solvable algebraic problem. A particularly interesting feature of the proof is that, like Garside's solutions to the Word and Conjugacy Problems, it too relies on Garside's decomposition of braids in $B_n.$</description>
