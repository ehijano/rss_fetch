      <title>Bayesian and Deterministic Neural Network approaches to Faraday Cup calibration and plasma parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a novel scheme for analyzing particle detector measurements when a well-calibrated, similarly instrumented spacecraft is present in a similar orbit. To prepare ground truth from measurements provided by a reference spacecraft, the method uses dynamic time warping (DTW)--a technique often used for pattern-matching in time series data. An artificial neural network (ANN) is created and trained to reproduce this ground truth from measurements at the target spacecraft. Unlike previous approaches, this procedure is insensitive to calibration errors in the target data stream, as the neural network may be trained from poorly calibrated particle spectra or even directly from low-level data in engineering units. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept by training an ANN to estimate solar wind proton densities, temperatures, and speeds from the DSCOVR PlasMag Faraday Cup, using the \textit{Wind} Solar Wind Experiment as a reference. We present both deterministic and Bayesian neural network approaches. Applications for Parker Solar Probe, HelioSwarm, and other missions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Relation between sunspots and solar EUV irradiance changes during the Gleissberg cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sunspots are the standard measure of solar magnetic activity, which are also used to estimate solar spectral irradiance over centennial time scales. However, because of the lack of homogeneous, century-long spectral measurements, the long-term relation of sunspots and spectral irradiance has not been independently validated.
  Here we aim to study the relation between sunspots and solar extreme ultra-violet (EUV) irradiance during the last 130 years, over the latest Gleissberg cycle, also called the Modern Maximum, when sunspot cycle heights varied by a factor of 2.5.
  We calculate the daily variation of the geomagnetic declination at six reliable, long-running stations, whose amplitude (or range) can be used as a centennial proxy of solar EUV irradiance. We also compare this geomagnetic proxy to the solar MgII index of EUV irradiance over the 40-year interval of overlap.
  We find that sunspot activity dominated over EUV irradiance when cycle heights increased in the early 20th century during the growth and maximum of the Modern Maximum, but EUV irradiance dominated over sunspots during the decay of the MM, when cycle heights decreased in the late 1900s.
  Our results suggest that the spot-facula ratio varies during Gleissberg cycle -type large oscillations of solar/stellar activity. This modifies the estimated stellar evolution of the relation between brightness and chromospheric activity of the Sun and Sun-like stars.</description>

      <title>Parametrisation of the wave-zonal flow interactions taking into account the full Coriolis acceleration. The necessity of going beyond the traditional approximation in the sub-inertial regime and in weakly stratified regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the Earth's atmosphere and oceans to stellar radiation zones, inertia-gravity waves, which are called gravito-inertial waves (hereafter GIWs) in Astrophysics, are transporting momentum and mixing matter when they are damped through heat and viscous diffusions and when they break. Their short-time scale dynamics is governed by the buoyancy force and the Coriolis acceleration. Because of the transport they trigger, they modify the long-term evolution of the large-scale planetary atmospheric (oceanic) circulation and of the structure and rotation of stars. In many state-of-the-art models, the so-called Traditional Approximation of Rotation (hereafter denoted TAR), where the local projection of the rotation vector along the horizontal direction is neglected, is assumed. We aim to identify the applicability regime of this approximation and to propose a non-traditional parametrisation of wave - zonal flow interactions, in which the full Coriolis acceleration is taken into account. We build a prototype local non-traditional Cartesian model in which we take into account the full Coriolis acceleration, buoyancy, and heat and viscous diffusions. On the one hand, the TAR is strongly underestimating GIWs damping in the sub-inertial regime. In this regime a non-traditional modelling must be adopted to predict the correct altitude where momentum is deposited, which is closer to the excitation region of waves than the one predicted using the TAR. On the other hand, non-traditional modellings of GIWs convective and shear-induced breakings are proposed. Taking into account the full Coriolis acceleration leads to a stronger inhibition of the efficiency of the convective and shear-induced overturnings and to a weaker transport than those predicted when assuming the TAR. Finally, a fully non-traditional parametrisation of GIWs - mean zonal flows interaction is derived.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Solar Wind Phenomena with iSAX, HDBSCAN, Human-in-the-loop and PSP Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar wind is a dynamic plasma outflow that shapes heliospheric conditions and drives space weather. Identifying its large-scale phenomena is crucial, yet the increasing volume of high-cadence Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations poses challenges for scalable, interpretable analysis. We present a pipeline combining symbolic compression, density-based clustering, and human-in-the-loop validation. Applied to 2018-2024 PSP data, it efficiently processes over 150 GB of magnetic and plasma measurements, recovering known structures, detecting uncatalogued CMEs and transient events, and demonstrating robustness across multiple time scales. A key outcome is the systematic use of the magnetic deflection angle ($\theta_B$) as a unifying metric across solar wind phenomena. This framework provides a scalable, interpretable, expert-validated approach to solar wind analysis, producing expanded event catalogs and supporting improved space weather forecasting. The code and configuration files used in this study are publicly available to support reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Photospheric Chemical Depletion in Post-AGB/Post-RGB Binaries with Second-Generation Protoplanetary Discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin and evolution of chemical elements in the Universe are governed not only by nucleosynthesis processes in stars, but also by mechanisms that alter observed photospheric compositions. Among these, chemical depletion (underabundance of refractory elements in stellar photospheres) presents a key puzzle in understanding the full chemical lifecycle. This PhD thesis explores the role of disc-binary interaction in shaping chemical abundances in evolved low- and intermediate-mass binary stars, focusing on systems that have undergone the red giant branch (RGB) or asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. In this thesis, we investigate binary systems containing post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB, $L_{\rm post-AGB}\,\gtrsim\,2\,500\,L_\odot$) and post-red giant branch (post-RGB, $L_{\rm post-RGB}\,\lesssim\,2\,500\,L_\odot$) binaries as key tracers of AGB/RGB nucleosynthesis. Although the effects of these interactions remain poorly understood, they are known to drive photospheric chemical depletion. This depletion closely resembles that observed in young planet-hosting stars with protoplanetary discs. Combined with other structural and dynamical similarities in disc properties, this suggests a potential link to second-generation planet formation in post-AGB/RGB binaries with circumbinary discs. Although direct imaging of such planets is not feasible, studying signatures such as photospheric depletion provides an indirect means of exploring their possible presence within these systems.</description>

      <title>Backmapping of the High- and Low-latitude Solar Wind under Multiple Heliospheric and Coronal Magnetic Field Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar wind backmapping is a critical technique for analyzing the origin of the solar wind and space weather events by correlating in situ measurements with solar remote-sensing observations. This technique typically traces magnetic field lines using a heliospheric magnetic field (HMF) model coupled with a coronal magnetic field (CMF). However, the impact of different HMF and CMF configurations on backmapping uncentainty-particularly regarding high-latitude solar wind-remains inadequately quantified. This study comprehensively evaluates solar wind backmapping by combining two HMF models (Parker spiral, Fisk-type) with three CMF models (Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS), Potential Field Current Sheet (PFCS), Current Sheet Source Surface (CSSS)). Our analysis primarily uses in situ measurements from Ulysses and remote-sensing data from STEREO-A. Key findings are that: (1) while both Fisk and Parker HMF models show comparable consistency with measured magnetic field strength and polarity, they produce certain longitudinal displacements in their back-mapped footpoints on the source surface (2.5$R_{\odot}$); (2) For CMF models (PFSS, PFCS, CSSS), predicted photospheric footpoints exhibit minor variations for high/mid-latitude solar wind but some divergences for ecliptic/low-latitude wind; (3) All three CMF models link high/mid-latitude wind to active regions or coronal holes, yet associate a fraction of ecliptic/low-latitude wind with quiet-Sun regions; (4) Ecliptic/low-latitude sources show significantly stronger dependence on the PFSS source surface height compared to high-latitude wind. These results demonstrate that simpler models (PFSS + Parker) appear reasonably adequate for polar coronal hole wind studies, while low-latitude/ecliptic solar wind exhibits the heightened sensitivity to model choices.</description>

      <title>Surface activity of a Rossby sequence of cool Hyades stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. The Hyades cluster is key for the study of rotational, activity, and chemical evolution of solar-like low-mass stars. Here we present quantitative surface-activity information for a sequence of 21 Hyades dwarf stars. Conclusions. We conclude that the Rossby-number dependencies of the surface activity tracers A(Li), R(IRT), and B on our Hyades dwarf sequence primarily originate from convective motions, expressed by its turnover time, and only to a smaller and sometimes inverse extent from surface rotation and its related extra mixing.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Configuration of a Quiescent Prominence Revealed by Large-amplitude Longitudinal Oscillations in End-view Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prominence seismology, applied to the large-amplitude longitudinal oscillation, is used to indirectly diagnose the geometry and strength of the magnetic fields inside the prominence. In this paper, combining imaging and spectroscopic data, the magnetic field configuration of a quiescent prominence is revealed by large-amplitude longitudinal oscillations observed in end view on 2023 December 4. Particularly, the prominence oscillation involved blueshift velocities in Dopplergrams and horizontal motions in extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) images. Originally, the prominence oscillation was triggered by the collision and heating of an adjoining hot structure associated with two coronal jets. The oscillation involved two groups of signals with similar oscillatory parameters, a three-dimensional (3D) initial amplitude of 40 Mm and a 3D velocity amplitude of 48 km/s, both lasting for 4 cycles with a period of 77 minutes, with a phase difference of pi/4. While the angle between 3D velocities and the prominence axis ranges from 10 to 30. Two methods, utilizing time-distance diagrams and velocity fields, are employed to calculate the curvature radius of magnetic dips supporting the prominence materials. Both methods yield similar value ranges and trends from the bottom to the top of magnetic dips, with the curvature radius increasing from 90 Mm to 220 Mm, then decreasing to 10 Mm, with transverse magnetic field strength 25 Gauss. From this, the realistic 3D geometry of the prominence magnetic dips is determined to be sinusoidal. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first accurate calculation of the 3D curvature radius and geometry of the prominence magnetic dips based on longitudinal oscillatory motions.</description>

      <title>An observational study of rotation and binarity of Galactic O-type runaway stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaia DR3 data have revealed new massive runaway stars, while spectroscopic surveys enable detailed characterization. The relative contributions of binary supernova (BSS) and dynamical ejection (DES) scenarios to explain their runaway origin remain poorly constrained, particularly in the Milky Way. We aim to characterize the largest sample of Galactic O-type runaway stars ever investigated through their kinematics, rotation, and binarity to shed light into their origins. We use the GOSC-Gaia DR3 catalog, and IACOB spectroscopic information to build a sample with 214 O-type stars with projected rotational velocities ($v \sin{i}$), and a subsample of 168 O-type stars with additional information about their likely single (LS) or single-lined (SB1) spectroscopic binary nature. We also consider an additional sample of 65 double-lined (SB2) spectroscopic binaries. We find that among our sample of Galactic O-type runaways, most (74%) have $v \sin{i}&lt;200$ km/s, whereas for normal stars this fraction is slightly higher (82%). There are no fast-moving runaways being fast rotators, except for HD 124 979. Runaways show lower SB1 fractions than normal stars, with no runaway SB1 fast-rotating systems; on average, runaways rotate faster than normal stars; and their runaway fraction is higher among fast rotators (44%) vs. the slow rotators (34%). This is consistent with BSS dominance for fast rotators. We also found that SB2 systems hardly reach runaway velocities with a low runaway fraction (10%). Runaways with 2D velocities &gt; 60 km/s are mostly single and interpreted as DES products, while runaways with 2D velocities &gt; 85 km/s are also interpreted as two-step products. Three of 12 runaway SB1 systems are HMXBs. Our study reveals that most Galactic O-type runaways are slow rotators, suggests a dominance of BSS among fast-rotating runaways, and of DES and two-step among the high-velocity ones.

      <title>3D Synthetic Convective Velocity Fields to Initialise Core-Collapse Supernova Simulations from 1D Progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are among the most energetic and complex astrophysical phenomena, requiring threedimensional (3D) simulations to capture their intricate explosion mechanisms. One of the key ingredients for such simulations is the 3D pre-collapse structure, which can impact the development and geometry of the subsequent explosion. While stellar convection simulations can provide such 3D initial conditions, these remain too expensive and demanding for widespread use. In this work, we present a method to generate synthetic 3D velocity fields for convective zones from 1D initial conditions, creating initial conditions for CCSN simulations using a vector spherical harmonics expansion without the need for expensive hydrodynamic progenitor simulations. The synthetic velocity field is designed to capture the typical scales and velocities of the convective flow as the most relevant parameters for the subsequent explosions. In addition, it respects relevant physical constraints such as the near-anelasticity of flow, vanishing radial vorticity, and zero net angular momentum in the convective zones. A Python implementation of this method is publicly available, offering the CCSN community a practical tool for generating synthetic velocity fields for multi-dimensional simulations to study the impact of 3D progenitor asymmetries on the CCSN mechanism.</description>

      <title>Peakbagging the K2 KEYSTONE sample with PBjam: characterising the individual mode frequencies in solar-like oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pattern of individual mode frequencies in solar-like oscillators provides valuable insight into their properties and interior structures. The identification and characterisation of these modes requires high signal-to-noise and frequency resolution. The KEYSTONE project unlocks the asteroseismic potential of the K2 mission by providing individually reduced, high-quality time series data, global asteroseismic parameters, and spectroscopic analysis for 173 solar-like oscillators. In this work, we build on the KEYSTONE project and present the first analysis of the pattern of individual modes in the oscillation spectra for the K2 KEYSTONE stars. We perform a robust identification and characterisation of the modes through peakbagging methods in the open-source analysis tool PBjam. We present over 6000 mode frequencies, widths, and heights for 168 stars in the sample, covering the HR diagram from FGK dwarfs to sub-giants and the lower red giant branch, providing a significant increase in the number of individual mode frequency detections for main sequence and sub-giant oscillators. This study also presents sample-wide trends of oscillation patterns as a function of the fundamental stellar properties, and improves the precision of the global asteroseismic parameters. These measurements are part of the legacy of the K2 mission, and can be used to perform detailed modelling to improve the precision of fundamental properties of these stars. The results of this analysis provides evidence for the validity of using PBjam to identify and characterise the modes resulting from the observations of the future PLATO mission.</description>

      <title>Predicted observational effects of rapid rotation for Be stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a systematic study on the effects of rapid rotation on predicted Be star observables. We use the three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, \textsc{hdust}, to model a comprehensive range of Be star subtypes at varying rotation rates. Using these models, we predict $V$ magnitude and photometric color, H$\alpha$ line profiles, and polarization at UV wavelengths as well as in the $V$-band for Be stars from B0 to B8. For each spectral subtype, we investigate the effects of disk density on the produced observables. We find that reddening and brightening effects of gravity darkening may cause rapidly-rotating stars to appear more evolved than they truly are. Rotational effects on the H$\alpha$ line profile shape may reduce line intensity for Be stars viewed at low inclinations and increase line intensity for those viewed at high inclinations. Additionally, rapid rotation can significantly impact the measured equivalent width of the line produced by a star with a moderate to high density disk, especially at high inclinations. When the star-disk system is viewed near edge-on, gravity darkening can result in stronger H$\alpha$ emission than would otherwise be expected for a disk of a given density. We also find that the competing effects of rapid rotation and H\,\textsc{i} opacity cause the slope of the polarized continuum (the polarization color) to be very sensitive to changes in the stellar rotation rate. This quantity offers a strong diagnostic for the rotation rate of Be stars.</description>

      <title>Magnetic clumping of charged dust in the dense interstellar medium</title>

Abstract: Context: Dust grains undergo significant growth in star-forming environments, especially in dense regions prone to gravitational collapse. Although dust is generally assumed to represent $1 \%$ of the gas mass, dust density variations are expected on small scales due to differential dynamics with the gas, leading to enhanced coagulation rates in regions of dust enrichment. Aims: We aim to investigate the clumping of charged dust in the turbulent magnetized dense regions of the interstellar medium. Methods: We develop a dusty model that goes beyond the standard non-ideal MHD and use the code {\ttfamily shark} to perform multifluid 1D simulations of a single size charged dust species and neutral gas with large scale driven turbulence and including ion-neutral friction. Results: We identify a mechanism similar to the parametric instability that efficiently forms dust clumps even in presence of dissipative processes. Such strong clumping survives and is sustained when driving turbulence, and thus high levels of dust concentration are produced due to compressive magnetic effects in regions of shocks. Dust density enhancements are favored by a high transverse-to-longitudinal magnetic ratio which is controlled by: transverse Mach number and plasma parameter. We find that a substantial fraction of dust experiences a density increase of more than a factor of 10 under reasonable conditions, thus promoting dust growth. Conclusion: Our novel dusty non-ideal MHD model shows that dust grains (main charge carriers) are subject to small-scale compressive magnetic effects driven by a parametric instability - like mechanism in regions of shocks, and consequently experience high density enhancements in turbulent environments that go beyond those permitted by pure hydrodynamical processes, making in-situ formation of large grains (sub-mm) in protostellar envelopes a plausible scenario.</description>

      <title>It's always the quiet ones: Single Degenerate Double Detonation Type Ia Supernova from Quiescent Helium Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a sub-Chandrasekhar mass double detonation pathway for Type Ia supernovae arising from single degenerate helium accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarfs. Building on our previous one dimensional study of recurrent helium novae (Hillman et al. 2025), we evolve a 0.7 solar mass white dwarf through steady accretion at 10^-8 Msun yr^-1 until it reaches 1.1 solar mass, yielding realistic, time evolved helium rich profiles. These profiles are mapped into FLASH simulations, incorporating nuclear burning for helium and carbon-oxygen detonation, in multi-dimensional hydrodynamic runs. A localized, modest temperature perturbation near the base of the helium shell robustly triggers an outward helium-shell detonation. The ensuing inward propagating shock converges in the carbon-oxygen core, igniting a secondary detonation that unbinds the star. We obtain a Ni56 yield of ~0.64 solar mass, an intermediate-mass element (Si-Ca) mass of ~0.41 solar mass, and maximum ejecta velocities approaching 22,000 km/s, values consistent with normal Type Ia supernovae. Our results demonstrate that recurrent helium accretors, typically quiescent over long timescales, can evolve under subtle, "quiet" conditions to trigger robust double detonations, supporting their role as viable progenitors of sub-Chandrasekhar mass Type Ia supernovae.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength view of circumstellar interaction in supernovae</title>

Abstract: The interaction of post-explosion supernova ejecta with the surrounding circumstellar medium creates emission across the electromagnetic spectrum. Since the circumstellar medium is created by the mass lost from the progenitor star, it carries tell-tale signatures of the progenitor. Consequently, observations and modeling of radiation produced by the interaction in various types of supernovae have provided valuable insights into their progenitors. Detailed studies have shown that the interaction in supernovae begins and sustains over various timescales and lengthscales, with differing mass-loss rates in distinct sub-classes. This reveals diverse progenitor histories for these stellar explosions. This review paper summarizes various supernova subtypes, linking them to stellar death pathways, and presents an updated supernova classification diagram. We then present a multi-wavelength study of circumstellar interaction in different supernova classes. We also present unpublished Chandra X-ray as well as radio observations of a type IIn supernova, SN 2010jl, which allow us to extend its circumstellar interaction studies to about 7 years post-explosion. The new data indicates that the extreme mass-loss rate 0.1 Msun/yr in SN 2010jl, reported by Chandra et al. (2015), commenced within the last 300 years before the explosion. We summarize the current status of the field and argue that via detailed studies of the circumstellar interaction, a.k.a. Time Machine technique, one of the big mysteries of stellar evolution, i.e., mapping supernovae progenitors to their explosive outcomes can be solved.</description>

      <title>SPHEREx: Aromatics, Aliphatics and PAH Size across the Iris Nebula</title>

Abstract: Observations by the SpectroPhotometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx) are combined with Spitzer spectral map data to study the aromatic, aliphatic, and PAH size evolution across the northwest photo-dissociation region (PDR) of the Iris Nebula (NGC7023). The 3.3-3.4 $\mu$m complex (I$_{3.3}$) and 11.2 $\mu$m (I$_{11.2}$) PAH band strength are determined through direct integration. In addition, the former is decomposed into a 3.3 (I'$_{3.3}$) and 3.4 $\mu$m (I'$_{3.4}$) sub-feature by fitting SPHEREx bandpass-integrated photometry using a modeled, highly sampled, multi-component spectrum. I$_{3.3}$, I$_{11.2}$, I'$_{3.3}$, and I'$_{3.4}$ all peak at the PDR. The NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database is used to obtain the average number of carbon atoms ($\overline{\rm N_{C}}$) and small PAH fraction ($f_{\rm small}$) by fitting the isolated PAH component of the Spitzer segment; $70\lesssim\overline{N_{C}}\lesssim76$ and $0.24\lesssim\text{f}_{\rm small}\lesssim0.36$. I'$_{3.4}$/I'$_{3.4}$, I$_{11.2}$/I$_{3.3}$, $\overline{\rm N_{C}}$, and $f_{\rm small}$ all show a demarcation that matches the large-scale morphology of the region. For I'$_{3.3}$ and I'$_{3.4}$ this is reflected by two distinct trends when plotted against each other, one associated with the dense, the other with the diffuse medium; $[N_{\rm H,ali}/N_{\rm H,aro}]_{\rm dense}$ = 0.49$\pm$0.01 and $[N_{\rm H,ali}/N_{\rm H,aro}]_{\rm diffuse}$ = 0.090$\pm$0.005. $\overline{\rm N_{C}}$ and $f_{\rm small}$ are tentatively correlated with I$_{11.2}$/I$_{3.3}$ (R=0.53$\pm$0.04 and -0.45$\pm$0.04, respectively). A wider variety of large(r) extended interstellar medium objects is required to tighten the correlations, turn them into quantitative calibrators for PAH size, and pin down the discrepancy of correlations with I'$_{3.3}$ involved.</description>

      <title>CIPHER: Scalable Time Series Analysis for Physical Sciences with Application to Solar Wind Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Labeling or classifying time series is a persistent challenge in the physical sciences, where expert annotations are scarce, costly, and often inconsistent. Yet robust labeling is essential to enable machine learning models for understanding, prediction, and forecasting. We present the \textit{Clustering and Indexation Pipeline with Human Evaluation for Recognition} (CIPHER), a framework designed to accelerate large-scale labeling of complex time series in physics. CIPHER integrates \textit{indexable Symbolic Aggregate approXimation} (iSAX) for interpretable compression and indexing, density-based clustering (HDBSCAN) to group recurring phenomena, and a human-in-the-loop step for efficient expert validation. Representative samples are labeled by domain scientists, and these annotations are propagated across clusters to yield systematic, scalable classifications. We evaluate CIPHER on the task of classifying solar wind phenomena in OMNI data, a central challenge in space weather research, showing that the framework recovers meaningful phenomena such as coronal mass ejections and stream interaction regions. Beyond this case study, CIPHER highlights a general strategy for combining symbolic representations, unsupervised learning, and expert knowledge to address label scarcity in time series across the physical sciences. The code and configuration files used in this study are publicly available to support reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Scalable Machine Learning Analysis of Parker Solar Probe Solar Wind Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a scalable machine learning framework for analyzing Parker Solar Probe (PSP) solar wind data using distributed processing and the quantum-inspired Kernel Density Matrices (KDM) method. The PSP dataset (2018--2024) exceeds 150 GB, challenging conventional analysis approaches. Our framework leverages Dask for large-scale statistical computations and KDM to estimate univariate and bivariate distributions of key solar wind parameters, including solar wind speed, proton density, and proton thermal speed, as well as anomaly thresholds for each parameter. We reveal characteristic trends in the inner heliosphere, including increasing solar wind speed with distance from the Sun, decreasing proton density, and the inverse relationship between speed and density. Solar wind structures play a critical role in enhancing and mediating extreme space weather phenomena and can trigger geomagnetic storms; our analyses provide quantitative insights into these processes. This approach offers a tractable, interpretable, and distributed methodology for exploring complex physical datasets and facilitates reproducible analysis of large-scale in situ measurements. Processed data products and analysis tools are made publicly available to advance future studies of solar wind dynamics and space weather forecasting. The code and configuration files used in this study are publicly available to support reproducibility.</description>

      <title>AGN STORM 2. XI. Spectroscopic reverberation mapping of the hot dust in Mrk 817</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The AGN Space Telescope and Optical Reverberation Mapping 2 (STORM 2) campaign targeted Mrk 817 with intensive multi-wavelength monitoring and found its soft X-ray emission to be strongly absorbed. We present results from 157 near-IR spectra with an average cadence of a few days. Whereas the hot dust reverberation signal as tracked by the continuum flux does not have a clear response, we recover a dust reverberation radius of $\sim 90$ light-days from the blackbody dust temperature light-curve. This radius is consistent with previous photometric reverberation mapping results when Mrk 817 was in an unobscured state. The heating/cooling process we observe indicates that the inner limit of the dusty torus is set by a process other than sublimation, rendering it a luminosity-invariant `dusty wall' of a carbonaceous composition. Assuming thermal equilibrium for dust optically thick to the incident radiation, we derive a luminosity of $\sim 6 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for the source heating it. This luminosity is similar to that of the obscured spectral energy distribution, assuming a disk with an Eddington accretion rate of $\dot{m} \sim 0.2$. Alternatively, the dust is illuminated by an unobscured lower luminosity disk with $\dot{m} \sim 0.1$, which permits the UV/optical continuum lags in the high-obscuration state to be dominated by diffuse emission from the broad-line region. Finally, we find hot dust extended on scales $&gt; 140-350$ pc, associated with the rotating disk of ionised gas we observe in spatially-resolved [SIII] $\lambda 9531$ images. Its likely origin is in the compact bulge of the barred spiral host galaxy, where it is heated by a nuclear starburst.</description>

      <title>EBOP MAVEN: A machine learning model to estimate the input parameters for analytic fitting of detached eclipsing binary light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detached eclipsing binary stars (dEBs) are a key source of data on fundamental stellar parameters. Within the light curve databases of survey missions such as Kepler and TESS are a wealth of new systems awaiting characterisation. We aim to improve the scalability of efforts to process these data by developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) machine learning model to assist in the automation of their analysis. From a phase-folded and binned dEB light curve the model predicts system parameters relating to stellar fractional radii, orbital inclination and eccentricity, and the stellar brightness ratio, for use as input values in subsequent formal analysis with the established JKTEBOP analytic code. We find the model able to predict these parameters for a previously unseen test dataset of 20000 synthetic dEB systems with a mean error of 14.1% when compared with the label values, improving to 8.6% against a subset representative of real systems. When tested with the TESS light curves of a set of real well-characterised systems, the model's predictions yield a mean error of $8.7\pm0.7\%$ when compared with label values derived from existing published analyses. Subsequent fitting of the TESS light curves with the JKTEBOP analytic code while using the model predictions as input values finds 27 of the 28 systems achieving a good fit. On the strength of these results, we plan to build a new characterisation pipeline based on the machine learning model and JKTEBOP code with the intention of producing a target catalogue of dEB systems for potential observation with the forthcoming PLATO mission.</description>

      <title>HOLISMOKES XIX: SN 2025wny at $z=2$, the first strongly lensed superluminous supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present imaging and spectroscopic observations of supernova SN 2025wny, associated with the lens candidate PS1 J0716+3821. Photometric monitoring from the Lulin and Maidanak observatories confirms multiple point-like images, consistent with SN 2025wny being strongly lensed by two foreground galaxies. Optical spectroscopy of the brightest image with the Nordic Optical Telescope and the University of Hawaii 88-inch Telescope allows us to determine the redshift to be z_s = 2.008 +- 0.001, based on narrow absorption lines originating in the interstellar medium of the supernova host galaxy. At this redshift, the spectra of SN 2025wny are consistent with those of superluminous supernovae of Type I. We find a high ejecta temperature and depressed spectral lines compared to other similar objects. We also measure, for the first time, the redshift of the fainter of the two lens galaxies (the "perturber") to be z_p = 0.375 +- 0.001, fully consistent with the DESI spectroscopic redshift of the main deflector at z_d = 0.3754. SN 2025wny thus represents the first confirmed galaxy-scale strongly lensed supernova with time delays likely in the range of days to weeks, as judged from the image separations. This makes SN 2025wny suitable for cosmography, offering a promising new system for independent measurements of the Hubble constant. Following a tradition in the field of strongly-lensed SNe, we give SN 2025wny the nickname SN Winny.</description>

      <title>An H{\alpha} Transit of HD 189733b to Assess Stellar Activity Across the Transit Chord Close to JWST Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transmission spectroscopy allows us to detect molecules in planetary atmospheres, but is subject to contamination from inhomogeneities on the stellar surface. Quantifying the extent of this contamination is essential for accurate measurements of atmospheric composition, as stellar activity can manifest as false atmospheric signals in planetary transmission spectra. We present a study of hot Jupiter HD 189733b, which has over 50 hours of JWST observations scheduled or taken, to measure the activity level of the host star at the current epoch. We utilize high-resolution spectra of the H${\alpha}$ line from the MEGARA spectrograph on the 10-m GTC to examine the activity level of HD 189733 during a transit. We measure H${\alpha}$ becoming shallower mid-transit by an H${\alpha}$ index of ${\delta}$ = 0.00156 ${\pm}$ 0.00026, which suggests that HD 189733b crosses an active region as it transits. We posit this deviation is likely caused by a spot along the transit chord with an approximate radius of $R_{spot}$ = 3.47 ${\pm}$ 0.30R${\oplus}$ becoming occulted during transit. Including an approximation for unocculted spots, we estimate that this spot could result in transit depth variations of ${\sim}$17 ppm at the 4.3 micron CO2 feature. Since this is comparable to JWST NIRCam Grism mode's noise floor of ${\sim}$20 ppm, it could bias atmospheric studies by altering the inferred depths of the planet's features. Thus, we suggest ground-based high-resolution monitoring of activity indicator species concurrently taken with JWST data when feasible to disentangle stellar activity signals from planetary atmospheric signals during transit.</description>

Abstract: The paper demonstrates the spectroscopic and photometric capabilities of the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) to study T-Tauri stars (TTSs). We present the first UVIT/Far-UV spectrum of a TTS, TW Hya. Based on C IV line luminosity, we estimated accretion luminosity (0.1 $L_\odot$) and mass accretion rate (2.2 $\times$ $10^{-8} M_\odot /yr$) of TW Hya, and compared these values with the accretion luminosity (0.03 $L_\odot$) and mass accretion rate (0.6 $\times$ $10^{-8} M_\odot /yr$) derived from spectral energy distribution (SED). From the SED, we derive best-fitted parameters for TW Hya: $T_{eff}$ = 3900$\pm$50 K, radius = 1.2$\pm$0.03 $R_\odot$, $\mathrm{log}\, g = 4.0$ and equivalent black-body temperatures corresponding to accretion luminosity as 14100$\pm$25 K. The parameters of TW Hya derived from UVIT observations were found to be matched well with the literature. Comparison with IUE spectra also suggests that UVIT can be used to study the spectroscopic variability of young stars. This study proposes leveraging the FUV spectroscopic capabilities of UVIT to contribute to the advancement of upcoming UV spectroscopic missions, including the Indian Spectroscopic Imaging Space Telescope (INSIST).</description>

      <title>An on-the-fly line-driven-wind iterative mass-loss estimator (LIME) for hot, massive stars of arbitrary chemical compositions</title>

Abstract: Mass-loss rates from hot, massive stars are important for a range of astrophysical applications. We present \href{https://lime.ster.kuleuven.be/}{LIME}, a fast, efficient, and easy-to-use real-time mass-loss calculator for line-driven winds from hot, massive stars with given stellar parameters and arbitrary chemical compositions. The tool is publicly available online. We compute the line force on-the-fly from excitation and ionization balance calculations using a large atomic data base containing more than four million spectral lines. We then derive mass-loss rates from line-driven wind theory, including effects of a finite stellar disk and gas sound speed. For a given set of stellar parameters and chemical composition, we obtain predictions for mass-loss rates and for the three line-force parameters at the wind critical point. A comparison of our predicted mass-loss rates with a large sample of recent, state-of-the-art, homogeneously derived empirical mass-loss rates obtained from the XshootU collaboration project demonstrates that the simple calculator presented here performs on average as well as, or even better than, other available mass-loss recipes based on fits to restricted model grids computed from more sophisticated but less flexible methods. In addition to its speed and simplicity, a strength of our mass-loss calculator is that it avoids uncertainties related to applying fit formulae to underlying model grids calculated for more restricted parameter ranges. In particular, individual chemical abundances can be easily modified, and their effects on predicted mass-loss rates can be readily explored. This enables direct applications also to stars that are significantly chemically modified at the surface.</description>

      <title>Orbital and Pulsation Analysis of 42 Heartbeat Stars Discovered in TESS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heartbeat stars (HBSs) are ideal laboratories for studying the formation and evolution of binary stars in eccentric orbits and their mutual tidal interactions. We present 42 new HBSs discovered based on TESS-SPOC and QLP data. Their physical parameters have been obtained through modeling with appropriate models. Subsequently, Tidally excited oscillations (TEOs) are detected in ten systems, and their pulsation phases and modes are identified. Most pulsation phases can be explained by the dominant being spherical harmonic degree $l=2$ and azimuthal order $m=0$ or $\pm2$. For TIC 156846634, the harmonic with large deviation ($&gt;3\sigma$) from the expected adiabatic phase can be expected to be a traveling wave or significantly nonadiabatic. The harmonic numbers $n$ = 16 in TIC 184413651 may not be considered as a TEO candidate due to its large deviation ($&gt;2\sigma$) from the adiabatic expectation. Moreover, TIC 92828790 shows no TEOs but exhibits a significant $\gamma$\,Dor-type pulsation. The eccentricity-period ($e-P$) relation also shows a positive correlation between eccentricity and period, as well as the existence of orbital circularization. The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram shows that TESS HBSs have higher temperatures and greater luminosities than Kepler HBSs, possibly due to selection effects. This significantly enhances the detectability of massive HBSs and those containing TEOs.</description>

      <title>SolarZip: An Efficient and Adaptive Compression Framework for Solar EUV Imaging Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13504v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context: With the advancement of solar physics research, next-generation solar space missions and ground-based telescopes face significant challenges in efficiently transmitting and/or storing large-scale observational data. Aims: We develop an efficient compression and evaluation framework for solar EUV data, specifically optimized for Solar Orbiter Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) data, significantly reducing data volume while preserving scientific usability. Methods: We systematically evaluated four error-bounded lossy compressors across two EUI datasets. However, the existing methods cannot perfectly handle the EUI datasets (with continuously changing distance and significant resolution differences). Motivated by this, we develop an adaptive hybrid compression strategy with optimized interpolation predictors. Moreover, we designed a two-stage evaluation framework integrating distortion analysis with downstream scientific workflows, ensuring that observational analysis is not affected at high compression ratios. Results: Our framework SolarZip achieved up to 800x reduction for Full Sun Imager (FSI) data and 500x for High Resolution Imager (HRI$_{\text{EUV}}$) data. It significantly outperformed both traditional and advanced algorithms, achieving 3-50x higher compression ratios than traditional algorithms, surpassing the second-best algorithm by up to 30%. Simulation experiments verified that SolarZip can reduce data transmission time by up to 270x while ensuring the preservation of scientific usability. Conclusions: The SolarZip framework significantly enhances solar observational data compression efficiency while preserving scientific usability by dynamically selecting optimal compression methods based on observational scenarios and user requirements. This provides a promising data management solution for deep space missions like Solar Orbiter.</description>
