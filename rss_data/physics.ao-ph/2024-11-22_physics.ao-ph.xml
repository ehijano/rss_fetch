      <title>Adjoint-based online learning of two-layer quasi-geostrophic baroclinic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For reasons of computational constraint, most global ocean circulation models used for Earth System Modeling still rely on parameterizations of sub-grid processes, and limitations in these parameterizations affect the modeled ocean circulation and impact on predictive skill. An increasingly popular approach is to leverage machine learning approaches for parameterizations, regressing for a map between the resolved state and missing feedbacks in a fluid system as a supervised learning task. However, the learning is often performed in an `offline' fashion, without involving the underlying fluid dynamical model during the training stage. Here, we explore the `online' approach that involves the fluid dynamical model during the training stage for the learning of baroclinic turbulence and its parameterization, with reference to ocean eddy parameterization. Two online approaches are considered: a full adjoint-based online approach, related to traditional adjoint optimization approaches that require a `differentiable' dynamical model, and an approximately online approach that approximates the adjoint calculation and does not require a differentiable dynamical model. The online approaches are found to be generally more skillful and numerically stable than offline approaches. Others details relating to online training, such as window size, machine learning model set up and designs of the loss functions are detailed to aid in further explorations of the online training methodology for Earth System Modeling.</description>

      <title>Origin and Limits of Invariant Warming Patterns in Climate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate models exhibit an approximately invariant surface warming pattern in typical end-of-century projections. This observation has been used extensively in climate impact assessments for fast calculations of local temperature anomalies, with a linear procedure known as pattern scaling. At the same time, emerging research has also shown that time-varying warming patterns are necessary to explain the time evolution of effective climate sensitivity in coupled models, a mechanism that is known as the pattern effect and that seemingly challenges the pattern scaling understanding. Here we present a simple theory based on local energy balance arguments to reconcile this apparent contradiction. Specifically, we show that the pattern invariance is an inherent feature of exponential forcing, linear feedbacks, a constant forcing pattern and diffusive dynamics. These conditions are approximately met in most CMIP6 Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP), except in the Arctic where nonlinear feedbacks are important and in regions where aerosols considerably alter the forcing pattern. In idealized experiments where concentrations of CO2 are abruptly increased, such as those used to study the pattern effect, the warming pattern can change considerably over time because of spatially inhomogeneous ocean heat uptake, even in the absence of nonlinear feedbacks. Our results illustrate why typical future projections are amenable to pattern scaling, and provide a plausible explanation of why more complicated approaches, such as nonlinear emulators, have only shown marginal improvements in accuracy over simple linear calculations.</description>

      <title>Distribution of plastics of various sizes and densities in the global ocean from a 3D Eulerian model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a 3D Eulerian model to study the transport and distribution of microplastics in the global ocean. Among other benefits that will be discussed in the paper, one unique feature of our model is that it takes into consideration the effect of properties of particles (size and density, the former for the first time) to their vertical terminal velocity. With ocean current velocity taken from ECCOv4r4, a dataset generated from a data-assimilated MITgcm reanalysis, our model is integrated for 26 years for particles of different properties with their stationary patterns studied. We find that only low-density particles with sufficient size (e.g. density $900kg/m^3$ with size $\gtrsim 10 \mu m$) aggregate in the five subtropical gyres observed in previous studies. In contrast, particles of smaller size ($\sim 1 \mu m$), irrespective of their density, behave like neutrally buoyant particles with a weaker pattern on the surface and a deeper penetration into depth (up to about 1km deep). In addition, we observe seasonal variations of floating particle concentration on the ocean surface, which reasonably agree with the satellite observation by Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) in terms of the phase of the variation. We find that the seasonal variation of the surface particle concentration correlates well with the variation of the mixing layer (ML) depth globally, due to an almost uniform vertical distribution of particles in the ML with total amount of particles conserved.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear internal waves breaking in stellar radiation zones. Parametrisation for the transport of angular momentum: bridging geophysical to stellar fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Internal gravity waves (hereafter IGWs) are one of the mechanisms that can play a key role to redistribute efficiently angular momentum in stars along their evolution. The study of IGWs is thus of major importance since space-based asteroseismology reveals a transport of angular momentum in stars, which is stronger by two orders of magnitude than the one predicted by stellar models ignoring their action or those of magnetic fields. IGWs trigger angular momentum transport when they are damped by heat or viscous diffusion, when they meet a critical layer or when they break. Theoretical prescriptions have been derived for the transport of angular momentum induced by IGWs because of their radiative and viscous dampings and of the critical layers they encounter along their propagation. However, none has been proposed for the transport triggered by their nonlinear breaking. In this work, we aim to derive such a physical and robust prescription, which can be implemented in stellar structure and evolution codes. We adapt an analytical saturation model, which has been developed for IGWs nonlinear convective breaking in the Earth atmosphere and has been successfully compared to in-situ measurements in the stratosphere, to the case of deep spherical stellar interiors. In a first step, we neglect the modification of IGWs by the Coriolis acceleration and the Lorentz force, which are discussed and taken into account in a second step. We derive a complete semi-analytical prescription for the transport of angular momentum by IGWs, which takes into account both their radiative damping and their potential nonlinear breaking because of their convective and vertical shear instabilities. This allows us to bring the physical prescription for the interactions between IGWs and the differential rotation to the same level of realism that the one used in global circulation models for the atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Information-sharing Convolutional Neural Network for the Prediction of Arctic Sea Ice Concentration and Velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Forecasting sea ice concentration (SIC) and sea ice velocity (SIV) in the Arctic Ocean is of great significance as the Arctic environment has been changed by the recent warming climate. Given that physical sea ice models require high computational costs with complex parameterization, deep learning techniques can effectively replace the physical model and improve the performance of sea ice prediction. This study proposes a novel multi-task fully conventional network architecture named hierarchical information-sharing U-net (HIS-Unet) to predict daily SIC and SIV. Instead of learning SIC and SIV separately at each branch, we allow the SIC and SIV layers to share their information and assist each other's prediction through the weighting attention modules (WAMs). Consequently, our HIS-Unet outperforms other statistical approaches, sea ice physical models, and neural networks without such information-sharing units. The improvement of HIS-Unet is more significant to when and where SIC changes seasonally, which implies that the information sharing between SIC and SIV through WAMs helps learn the dynamic changes of SIC and SIV. The weight values of the WAMs imply that SIC information plays a more critical role in SIV prediction, compared to that of SIV information in SIC prediction, and information sharing is more active in marginal ice zones (e.g., East Greenland and Hudson/Baffin Bays) than in the central Arctic.</description>
