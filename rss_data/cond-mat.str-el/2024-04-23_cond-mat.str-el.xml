      <title>Optimally scrambling chiral spin-chain with effective black hole geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is currently significant interest in emulating the essential characteristics of black holes, such as their Hawking radiation or their optimal scrambling behavior, using condensed matter models. In this article, we investigate a chiral spin-chain, whose mean field theory effectively captures the behavior of Dirac fermions in the curved spacetime geometry of a black hole. We find that within the region of the chain that describe the interior of the black hole, strong correlations prevail giving rise to many-body chaotic dynamics. Employing out-of-time-order correlations as a diagnostic tool, we numerically compute the associated Lyapunov exponent. Intriguingly, we observe a linear increase in the Lyapunov exponent with temperature within the black hole's interior at low temperatures, indicative of optimal scrambling behavior. This contrasts with the quadratic temperature dependence exhibited by the spin-chain on the region outside the black hole. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the interplay between black hole geometry and quantum chaos, offering insights into fundamental aspects of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Shot noise in coupled electron-boson systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of charge carriers in strange metals has become a topic of intense current investigation. Recent shot noise measurements in the quantum critical heavy fermion metal YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ revealed a suppression of the Fano factor that cannot be understood from electron-phonon scattering or strong electron correlations in a Fermi liquid, indicating loss of quasiparticles. The experiment motivates the consideration of shot noise in a variety of theoretical models in which quasiparticles may be lost. Here we study shot noise in systems with co-existing itinerant electrons and dispersive bosons, going beyond the regime where the bosons are on their own in thermal equilibrium. We construct the Boltzmann-Langevin equations for the coupled system, and show that adequate electron-boson couplings restore the Fano factor to its Fermi liquid value. Our findings point to the beyond-Landau form of quantum criticality as underlying the suppressed shot noise of strange metals in heavy fermion metals and beyond.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Studies on Geometrically Confined Skyrmions in Nanodots: Stability and Morphology under Radial Stresses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically study the stability and morphology of geometrically confined skyrmions in nanodots using Finsler geometry (FG) modeling technique. The FG model dynamically implements anisotropies in ferromagnetic interaction, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and magneto-elastic coupling in response to mechanical stresses. Without the stresses, there exists a geometrically confined effect originating from the surface effect of small nanodots, in which skyrmions are stabilized under a low external magnetic field. This surface effect is enhanced by radial stresses, which significantly reduce the surface DMI compared to the bulk DMI. The radial stresses also alter the interactions to be anisotropic. Owing to these position- and direction-dependent interactions, incomplete skyrmions emerge at the center of the nanodots under the tensile stress. In addition to the incomplete skyrmions, target skyrmions are observed under the compressive stress. Our numerical results indicate that the strain-enhanced surface effect and the strain-induced interaction anisotropies suitably explain the skyrmion stability in nanodots with zero magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Numerical demonstration of Abelian fractional statistics of composite fermions in the spherical geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) fluids host quasiparticle excitations that carry a fraction of the electronic charge. Moreover, in contrast to bosons and fermions that carry exchange statistics of $0$ and $\pi$ respectively, these quasiparticles of FQH fluids, when braided around one another, can accumulate a Berry phase, which is a fractional multiple of $\pi$. Deploying the spherical geometry, we numerically demonstrate that composite fermion particle (CFP) excitations in the Jain FQH states carry Abelian fractional statistics. Previously, the exchange statistics of CFPs were studied in the disk geometry, where the statistics get obscured due to a shift in the phase arising from the addition of another CFP, making its determination cumbersome without prior knowledge of the shift. We show that on the sphere this technical issue can be circumvented and the statistics of CFPs can be obtained more transparently. The ideas we present can be extended to determine the statistics of quasiparticles arising in certain non-Abelian partonic FQH states.</description>

      <title>Tensor network analysis of the maple-leaf antiferromagnet spangolite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spangolite (Cu$_6$Al(SO$_4$)(OH)$_{12}$Cl$\cdot$3H$_2$O) is a hydrated layered copper sulfate mineral whose crystal structure is well described by a depleted triangular lattice of Cu$^{2+}$ ions in each layer. Experimental measurements reveal a non-magnetic ground state at $T \sim 8\, \text{K}$ with magnetization properties dominated by dimerisation. We propose a concrete model of Cu$^{2+}$ spin-$1/2$ degrees of freedom on this geometrically frustrated and effectively two-dimensional maple-leaf lattice. The distorted geometry of the depleted triangular lattice layers results in a spatially anisotropic Heisenberg model featuring five symmetry inequivalent couplings with ferromagnetic bonds on hexagons and antiferromagnetic triangular bonds. The validity of the proposed Hamiltonian is demonstrated by state-of-the-art tensor network calculations which can assess both the nature of the ground state as well as low-temperature thermodynamics, including effects of a magnetic field. We provide theoretical support for a dimerized ground state by calculating the static spin structure factor as well as the magnetic susceptibility, the latter is shown to be in good agreement with experiment. We further predict the emergence of magnetisation plateaus at high values of an external magnetic field and study their melting with increasing temperature.</description>

      <title>Higher-magnesium-doping effects on the singlet ground state of the Shastry-Sutherland SrCu2(BO3)2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doping of quantum antiferromagnets is an established approach to investigate the robustness of their ground state against the competing phases. Predictions of doping effects on the ground state of the Shastry-Sutherland dimer model are here verified experimentally on Mg-doped SrCu2(BO3)2. A partial incorporation of Mg2+ on the Cu2+-site in the SrCu2(BO3)2 structure leads to a subtle but systematic lattice expansion with the increasing Mg-doping concentration, which is accompanied by a concomitant decrease in the spin gap, the Curie-Weiss temperature and the peak temperature of the susceptibility. These findings indicate a doping-induced breaking of Cu2+ spin-1/2 dimers which is also corroborated by X-band EPR spectroscopy that points to a systematic increase in intensity of free Cu2+ sites with increasing Mg-doping concentration. Extending the Mg-doping up to nominal x = 0.10 or SrCu1.9Mg0.1(BO3)2, in the magnetisation measurements taken up to 35 T, a suppression of the pseudo-1/8 plateau is found along with a clear presence of an anomaly at an onset critical field H'C0 ~ 9 T. The latter, absent in pure SrCu2(BO3)2, emerges due to the coupling of liberated Cu2+ spin-1/2 entities in the vicinity of Mg-doping induced impurities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Maxwell theory on a non-spin manifold. Depending on the choice of statistics for line operators, there are three non-anomalous theories and one anomalous theory with different symmetry fractionalizations. We establish the gauging maps that connect the non-anomalous theories by coupling them to a discrete gauge theory. We also construct topological interfaces associated with $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ duality and gauging of electric and magnetic one-form symmetries. Finally, by stacking the topological interfaces, we compose various kinds of duality defects, which lead to non-invertible symmetries of non-spin Maxwell theories.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing homolytic versus heterolytic bond dissociation of phenyl sulfonium cations with localized active space methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling chemical reactions with quantum chemical methods is challenging when the electronic structure varies significantly throughout the reaction, as well as when electronic excited states are involved. Multireference methods such as complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) can handle these multiconfigurational situations. However, even if the size of needed active space is affordable, in many cases the active space does not change consistently from reactant to product, causing discontinuities in the potential energy surface. The localized active space SCF (LASSCF) is a cheaper alternative to CASSCF for strongly correlated systems with weakly correlated fragments. The method is used for the first time to study a chemical reaction, namely the bond dissociation of a mono-, di-, and triphenylsulfonium cation. LASSCF calculations generate smooth potential energy scans more easily than the corresponding, more computationally expensive, CASSCF calculations, while predicting similar bond dissociation energies. Our calculations suggest a homolytic bond cleavage for di- and triphenylsulfonium, and a heterolytic pathway for monophenylsulfonium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how fermionic statistics can be naturally incorporated in tensor networks on arbitrary graphs through the use of graded Hilbert spaces. This formalism allows to use tensor network methods for fermionic lattice systems in a local way, avoiding the need of a Jordan-Wigner transformation or the explicit tracking of leg crossings by swap gates in 2D tensor networks. The graded Hilbert spaces can be readily integrated with other internal and lattice symmetries in tensor networks, and only require minor extensions to an existing tensor network software package. We review and benchmark the fermionic versions of common algorithms for matrix product states and projected entangled-pair states.</description>

      <title>Competing anisotropies in the chiral cubic magnet Co$_8$Zn$_8$Mn$_4$ unveiled by resonant x-ray magnetic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cubic $\beta$-Mn-type alloy Co$_8$Zn$_8$Mn$_4$ is a chiral helimagnet that exhibits a peculiar temperature-dependent behavior in the spiral pitch, which decreases from 130 nm at room temperature to 70 nm below 20 K. Notably, this shortening is also accompanied by a structural transition of the metastable skyrmion texture, transforming from a hexagonal lattice to a square lattice of elongated skyrmions. The underlying mechanism of these transformations remain unknown, with interactions potentially involved including temperature-dependent Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, magnetocrystalline anisotropy, and exchange anisotropy. Here, x-ray resonant magnetic small-angle scattering in vectorial magnetic fields was employed to investigate the temperature dependence of the anisotropic properties of the helical phase in Co$_8$Zn$_8$Mn$_4$. Our results reveal quantitatively that the magnitude of the anisotropic exchange interaction increases by a factor of 4 on cooling from room temperature to 20 K, leading to a 5% variation in the helical pitch within the (001) plane at 20 K. While anisotropic exchange interaction contributes to the shortening of the spiral pitch, its magnitude is insufficient to explain the variation in the spiral periodicity from room to low temperatures. Finally, we demonstrate that magnetocrystalline and exchange anisotropies compete, favoring different orientations of the helical vector in the ground state.</description>

      <title>Digital Quantum Simulation for Spectroscopy of Schwinger Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note discusses a method for computing the energy spectra of quantum field theory utilizing digital quantum simulation. A quantum algorithm, called coherent imaging spectroscopy, quenches the vacuum with a time-oscillating perturbation and then reads off the excited energy levels from the loss in the vacuum-to-vacuum probability following the quench. As a practical demonstration, we apply this algorithm to the (1+1)-dimensional quantum electrodynamics with a topological term known as the Schwinger model, where the conventional Monte Carlo approach is practically inaccessible. In particular, on a classical simulator, we prepare the vacuum of the Schwinger model on a lattice by adiabatic state preparation and then apply various types of quenches to the approximate vacuum through Suzuki-Trotter time evolution. We discuss the dependence of the simulation results on the specific types of quenches and introduce various consistency checks, including the exact diagonalization and the continuum limit extrapolation. The estimation of the computational complexity required to obtain physically reasonable results implies that the method is likely efficient in the coming era of early fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a high-resolution single crystal x-ray diffraction study of Kagome superconductor \cvs, exploring its response to variations in pressure and temperature. We discover that at low temperatures, the structural modulations of the electronic superlattice, commonly associated with charge density wave order, undergo a transformation around $p \sim$ 0.7 GPa from the familiar $2\times2$ pattern to a long-range ordered modulation at wavevector $q=(0, 3/8, 1/2)$. Our observations align with inferred changes in the CDW pattern from prior transport and nuclear magnetic resonance studies, providing new insights into these transitions. Interestingly, the pressure-induced variations in the electronic superlattice correlate with two peaks in the superconducting transition temperature as pressure changes, hinting that fluctuations within the electronic superlattice could be key to stabilizing superconductivity. However, our findings contrast with the minimal pressure dependency anticipated by ab initio calculations of the electronic structure. They also challenge prevailing scenarios based on a Peierls-like nesting mechanism involving van Hove singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By implementing a charge pumping scheme for one-dimensional aperiodic chains, we confirm the existence of topological phases in these systems whenever their finite-size realizations admit inversion symmetry. These phases are usually characterized by an anomalous edge response as a result of the bulk-boundary correspondence. We show that these signatures are all present in various chains, each representing a different class of structural aperiodicity: the Fibonacci quasicrystal, the Tribonacci quasicrystal, and the Thue-Morse chain. More specifically, we calculate three quantities: the Berry phase of the crystalline approximation of the finite-size systems, the polarization response to an inifintesimal static and constant electric field in systems with open boundary conditions, and the degeneracy of the entanglement spectrum. We find that all of them provide signatures of a topologically nontrivial phase.</description>

      <title>Achieving the volume-law entropy regime with random-sign Dicke states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manipulating entanglement, which reflects non-local correlations in a quantum system and defines the complexity of describing its wave function, represents the extremely tough challenge in the fields of quantum computing, quantum information, and condensed matter physics. In this work, by the example of the well-structured Dicke states we demonstrate that the complexity of these real-valued wave functions can be accurately tuned by introducing a random-sign structure, which allows us to explore the regime of the volume-law entanglement. Importantly, setting nontrivial sign structure one can increase the entanglement entropy of the Dicke state to the values that are close to Page's estimates for Haar-random states. The practical realization of these random-sign Dicke states is possible on different physical platforms with shallow quantum circuits. On the level of the measurements the change in the quantum state complexity due to sign structure can be traced out with the dissimilarity measure that estimates multi-scale variety of patterns in bit-string arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral engineering of TeraHertz (THz) light fields and the use of the handedness of light in THz light-matter interactions promise many novel opportunities for advanced sensing and control of matter in this frequency range. Unlike previously explored methods, this is achieved here by leveraging the chiral properties of highly confined THz surface plasmon modes. More specifically, we design ultrasmall surface plasmonic-based THz cavities and THz metasurfaces that display significant and adjustable chiral behavior under modest magnetic fields. For such a prototypical example of non-hermitian and dispersive photonic system, we demonstrate the capacity to magnetic field-tune both the poles and zeros of cavity resonances, the two fundamental parameters governing their resonance properties. Alongside the observed handedness-dependent cavity frequencies, this highlights the remarkable ability to engineer chiral and tunable radiative couplings for THz resonators and metasurfaces. The extensive tunability offered by the surface plasmonic approach paves the way for the development of agile and multifunctional THz metasurfaces as well as the realization of ultrastrong chiral light-matter interactions at low energy in matter with potential far-reaching applications for the design of material properties.</description>

      <title>Raman response and shear viscosity in the non-Fermi liquid phase of Luttinger semimetals</title>

Abstract: Luttinger semimetals represent materials with strong spin-orbit coupling, harbouring doubly-degenerate quadratic band touchings at the Brillouin zone center. In the presence of Coulomb interactions, such a system exhibits a non-Fermi liquid phase [dubbed as the Luttinger-Abrikosov-Beneslavskii (LAB) phase], at low temperatures and zero doping. However, a clear experimental evidence of this emergent state remains elusive to this date. Hence, we focus on extracting the Raman response as a complementary experimental signature. At frequencies much larger than the temperature, the Raman response exhibits a power-law behavior, which can be verified experimentally. On the other hand, at lower frequencies, the Raman response displays a quasi-elastic peak. We also compute the ratio of the shear viscosity and the entropy density, and the value obtained is a consequence of the hyperscaling violation that emerges in the LAB phase.</description>

      <title>3D Heisenberg universality in the Van der Waals antiferromagnet NiPS$_3$</title>

Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials are comprised of layers of atomically thin sheets, making them ideal platforms for studying magnetism at the two-dimensional (2D) limit. These materials are at the center of a host of novel types of experiments, however, there are notably few pathways to directly probe their magnetic structure. We report the magnetic order within a single crystal of NiPS$_3$ and show it can be accessed with resonant elastic X-ray diffraction along the edge of the vdW planes in a carefully grown crystal by detecting structurally forbidden resonant magnetic X-ray scattering. We find the magnetic order parameter has a critical exponent of $\beta\sim0.36$, indicating that the magnetism of these vdW crystals is more adequately characterized by the three-dimensional (3D) Heisenberg universality class. We verify these findings with first-principle density functional theory, Monte-Carlo simulations, and density matrix renormalization group calculations.</description>

      <title>Structural complexity of snapshots of 2D Fermi-Hubbard systems</title>

Abstract: The development of quantum gas microscopy for two-dimensional optical lattices has provided an unparalleled tool to study the Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) with ultracold atoms. Spin-resolved projective measurements, or snapshots, have played a significant role in quantifying correlation functions which uncover underlying physical phenomena such as antiferromagnetism at commensurate filling on bipartite lattices, and other charge and spin correlations, as well as dynamical properties at various densities. However, in order to interpret these results and to establish temperature scales, comparison against theory is generally needed. Here, we employ a recent concept, the {\em multi-scale structural complexity}, and show that when computed for the snapshots (of either single spin species, local moments, or total density) it can provide a theory-free property, immediately accessible to experiments. Specifically, after benchmarking results for Ising and XY models, we study the structural complexity of snapshots of the repulsive FHM in the two-dimensional square lattice as a function of doping and temperature. We generate projective measurements using determinant quantum Monte Carlo and compare their complexities against those from the experiment. We demonstrate that these complexities are linked to relevant physical observables such as the entropy and double occupancy. Their behaviors capture the development of correlations and relevant length scales in the system. We provide an open-source code in Python which can be implemented into data analysis routines in experimental settings for the square lattice.</description>

      <title>Kondo breakdown in multi-orbital Anderson lattices induced by destructive hybridization interference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04540v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a multi band extension to the periodic Anderson model. We use a single site DMFT(NRG) in order to study the impact of the conduction band mediated effective hopping of the correlated electrons between the correlated orbitals onto the heavy Fermi liquid formation. Whereas the hybridization of a single impurity model with two distinct conduction bands always adds up constructively, $T_{K}\propto \exp(-\mathrm{const}\, U/(\Gamma_1+\Gamma_2))$, we show that this does not have to be the case in lattice models, where, in remarkable contrast, also an low-energy Fermi liquid scale $T_0\propto \exp(-\mathrm{const}\, U/(\Gamma_1-\Gamma_2))$ can emerge due to quantum interference effects in multi band models, where $U$ denotes the local Coulomb matrix element of the correlated orbitals and $\Gamma_i$ the local hybridization strength of band $i$. At high symmetry points, heavy Fermi liquid formation is suppressed which is associated with a breakdown of the Kondo effect. This results in an asymptotically scale-invariant (i.e., power-law) spectrum of the correlated orbitals $\propto|\omega|^{1/3}$, indicating non-Fermi liquid properties of the quantum critical point, and a small Fermi surface including only the light quasi-particles. This orbital selective Mott phase demonstrates the possibility of metallic local criticality within the general framework of ordinary single site DMFT.</description>

      <title>Density-Matrix Mean-Field Theory</title>

Abstract: Mean-field theories have proven to be efficient tools for exploring various phases of matter, complementing alternative methods that are more precise but also more computationally demanding. Conventional mean-field theories often fall short in capturing quantum fluctuations, which restricts their applicability to systems characterized by strong quantum fluctuations. In this article, we propose a novel mean-field theory, density-matrix mean-field theory (DMMFT). DMMFT constructs effective Hamiltonians, incorporating quantum environments shaped by entanglements quantified by the reduced density matrices. Therefore, it offers a systematic and unbiased approach to account for effects of fluctuations and entanglements in quantum ordered phases. As demonstrative examples, we show that DMMFT can not only quantitatively evaluate the renormalization of order parameters induced by quantum fluctuations but can even detect the topological order of quantum phases. Additionally, we discuss the extensions of DMMFT for systems at finite temperatures and those with disorders. Our work provides a novel and efficient approach to explore phases exhibiting unconventional quantum orders, which can be particularly beneficial for investigating frustrated spin systems in high spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>Stable non-Fermi liquid fixed point at the onset of incommensurate $2k_F$ charge density wave order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the emergence of a non-Fermi liquid fixed point in two-dimensional metals at the onset of a quantum phase transition from a Fermi liquid state to an incommensurate charge density wave (CDW) ordered phase. The momentum of the CDW boson is centred at the wavevector $ \boldsymbol{ \mathcal Q} $, which connects a single pair of antipodal points on the Fermi surface with antiparallel tangent vectors. We employ the dimensional regularization technique in which the co-dimension of the Fermi surface is extended to a generic value, while keeping the dimension of Fermi surface itself fixed at one. Although the system is strongly coupled at dimension $d=2$, the interactions become marginal at the upper critical dimension $d=d_c$, whose value is found to be $ 5/2$. Using a controlled perturbative expansion in the parameter $\epsilon = d_c - d $, we compute the critical exponents of the stable infrared fixed point characterizing the quantum critical point. The scalings of the original theory are determined by setting $\epsilon =1/2$, where the fermion self-energy is seen to scale with the frequency with a fractional power law of $2/3$, which is the undisputed signature of a typical non-Fermi liquid phase.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the RKKY interactions derived from ab initio calculations for the intermetallic compound CeCoSi exhibiting the hidden nonmagnetic order at $T_0$ and examine the instability towards possible multipole orders within the random phase approximation. All 36 multipole interactions up to rank 5 are investigated, and the maximum susceptibility exhibits an antiferro order with $\boldsymbol{q}=\boldsymbol{0}$ for nonmagnetic multipoles of monopole $I$ and hexadecapole $H_{0}$, yielding a charge imbalance of $f$ electrons at two Ce atoms in the unit cell. The obtained order can explain some experiments.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Tunneling Spectroscopy of Fractional Quantum Hall States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong interaction among electrons in two-dimensional systems in the presence of high magnetic fields gives rise to fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states that host quasi-particles with fractional charge and statistics. We perform high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy of FQH states in ultra-clean Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG) devices. Spectroscopy of FQH states shows sharp excitations in tunneling experiments that have been predicted for electron fractionalizing into bound states of quasi-particles. From our measurements and their comparison to theoretical calculations, we find energy gaps for candidate non-abelian FQH states that are larger by a factor of 5 than other related systems, making BLG an ideal setting for the manipulation of these novel quasi-particles and for the creation of a topological quantum bit. Our STM experiment also reveals previously undiscovered states in such ultra-clean samples.</description>

      <title>Beyond $N=\infty$ in Large $N$ Conformal Vector Models at Finite Temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate finite-temperature observables in three-dimensional large $N$ critical vector models taking into account the effects suppressed by $1\over N$. Such subleading contributions are captured by the fluctuations of the Hubbard-Stratonovich auxiliary field which need to be handled with care due to a subtle divergence structure which we clarify. The examples we consider include the scalar $O(N)$ model, the Gross-Neveu model, the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model and the massless Chern-Simons Quantum Electrodynamics. We present explicit results for the free energy density to the subleading order in $1\over N$, which captures the thermal one-point function of the stress-energy tensor to this order. We also include the dependence on a chemical potential. We determine the Wilson coefficient in the thermal effective action that is sensitive to global symmetry for the first time directly in interacting CFTs, which produces a symmetry-resolved asymptotic density of states. We further provide a formula from diagrammatics for the one-point functions of general single-trace higher-spin currents. We observe that in most cases considered, these subleading effects lift the apparent degeneracies between observables in different models at infinite $N$, while in special cases the discrepancies only start to appear at the next-to-subleading order.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the spin ordering in magic-angle graphene via edge state equilibration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the symmetry breaking order of correlated quantum phases is essential for understanding the microscopic interactions in their host systems. The flat bands in magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) provide an especially rich arena to investigate such interaction-driven ground states, and while progress has been made in identifying the correlated insulators and their excitations at commensurate moire filling factors, the spin-valley polarizations of the topological states that emerge at high magnetic field remain unknown. Here we introduce a new technique based on twist-decoupled van der Waals layers that enables measurements of their electronic band structure and, by studying the backscattering between counter-propagating edge states, determination of relative spin polarization of the their edge modes. Applying this method to twist-decoupled MATBG and monolayer graphene, we find that the broken-symmetry quantum Hall states that extend from the charge neutrality point in MATBG are spin-unpolarized at even integer filling factors. The measurements also indicate that the correlated Chern insulator emerging from half filling of the flat valence band is spin-unpolarized, but suggest that its conduction band counterpart may be spin-polarized. Our results constrain models of spin-valley ordering in MATBG and establish a versatile approach to study the electronic properties of van der Waals systems.</description>

      <title>Molecular Pairing in Twisted Bilayer Graphene Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a theory for how the weak phonon-mediated interaction ($J_{\rm A}\!=\!1\!\sim\!4$meV) wins over the prohibitive Coulomb repulsion ($U\!=\!30\!\sim\!60$meV) and leads to a nematic superconductor in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG). We find the pairing mechanism akin to that in the A$_3$C$_{60}$ family of molecular superconductors: Each AA stacking region of MATBG resembles a C$_{60}$ molecule, in that optical phonons can dynamically lift the degeneracy of the moir\'e orbitals, in analogy to the dynamical Jahn-Teller effect. Such induced $J_{\rm A}$ has the form of an inter-valley anti-Hund's coupling and is less suppressed than $U$ by the Kondo screening near a Mott insulator. Additionally, we also considered an intra-orbital Hund's coupling $J_{\rm H}$ that originates from the on-site repulsion of a carbon atom. Under a reasonable approximation of the realistic model, we prove that the renormalized local interaction between quasi-particles must have a pairing (negative) channel in a doped correlated insulator at $\nu=\pm(2+\delta\nu)$, albeit the bare interaction is positive definite. The proof is non-perturbative and based on $exact$ asymptotic behaviors of the vertex function imposed by Ward identities. Existence of an optimal $U$ for superconductivity is predicted. We also analyzed the pairing symmetry. In a large area of the parameter space of $J_{\rm A}$, $J_{\rm H}$, the ground state has a nematic $d$-wave singlet pairing, which, however, can lead to a $p$-wave-like nodal structure due to the Berry's phase on Fermi surfaces (or Euler obstruction). A fully gapped $s$-wave pairing is also possible but spans a smaller phase space in the phase diagram.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider electron pairing in a two-dimensional thermally disordered itinerant anti-ferromagnet. It is shown that transverse spin fluctuations in such a state can give rise to superconductivity with a sizeable critical temperature $T_c$. Below $T_c$ there is quasi-long-range spin-singlet and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ superconducting order, together with fluctuating triplet order at momentum $(\pi,\pi)$. The singlet pairs we find are tightly bound together, and the pair wavefunction has a purely inter-sublattice structure due to the U(1) spin rotation symmetry of the anti-ferromagnet.</description>

      <title>Spin-1 Haldane chains of superconductor-semiconductor hybrids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically explore the possibility of realizing the symmetry-protected topological Haldane phase of spin-1 chains in a tunable hybrid platform of superconducting islands (SIs) and quantum dots (QDs). Inspired by recent findings suggesting that an appropriately tuned QD-SI-QD block may behave as a robust spin-1 unit, we study the behavior of many such units tunnel-coupled into linear chains. Our efficient and fully microscopic modeling of long chains with several tens of units is enabled by the use of the surrogate model solver [Phys. Rev. B 108, L220506 (2023); arXiv:2402.18357]. Our numerical findings indicate that the QD-SI-QD chains exhibit emblematic features of the Haldane phase, such as fractional spin-1/2 edge states and non-vanishing string order parameters, and that these persist over a sizeable region of parameter space.</description>
