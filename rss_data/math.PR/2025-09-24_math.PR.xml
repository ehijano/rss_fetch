      <title>Large and moderate deviation for rough slow-fast system with level 3 geometric rough path</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is to give the large deviation for a slow-fast system with level 3 random geometric rough path. Different from that driver rough path is of level 2, now the driver path comes from an anisotropic rough path that is lifted from the mixed fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter in $(1/4,1/3)$. Unlike the situation of level 2, it requires showing that the translation of mixed FBM in the direction of Cameron-Martin space can still be lifted to a geometric rough path. Firstly, we give the large deviation for the single-time scale system with level 3 random geometric rough path. We still utilize the variational representation and weak convergence method. However, the existence of third-level rough paths still makes the weak convergence analysis more complicated, where more elaborate controlled rough path calculations are needed. Besides, we also give the moderate deviation within more necessary assumptions. Different from large deviation, some boundedness result of the deviation component is required. Then, we extend the large deviation for the slow-fast system with level 3 random geometric rough path. To this end, we show that the controlled slow component weakly converges to the solution to the skeleton equation by averaging to the invariant measure of the fast equation and exploiting the continuity of the solution mapping. Here, the solution to the skeleton equation still could be well-defined in the Young sense within a variational setting.</description>

      <title>An Entropy Regularized BSDE Approach to Bermudan Options and Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate optimal stopping problems in a continuous-time framework where only a discrete set of stopping dates is admissible, corresponding to the Bermudan option, within the so-called exploratory formulation. We introduce an associated control problem for the value function, represented as a non-c\`adl\`ag reflected backward stochastic differential equation (RBSDE) with an entropy regulariser that promotes exploration, and we establish existence and uniqueness results for this entropy-regularised RBSDE. We then compare the entropy-regularised RBSDE with the theoretical value of a Bermudan option and propose a reinforcement learning algorithm based on a policy improvement scheme, for which we prove both monotone improvement and convergence. This methodology is further extended to Bermudan game options, where we obtain analogous results. Finally, drawing on the preceding analysis, we present two numerical approximation schemes - a BSDE solver based on a temporal-difference scheme and neural networks and the policy improvement algorithm - to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>The bunkbed problem and the random cluster model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well known bunkbed conjecture about percolation on finite graphs is now resolved; Gladkov, Pak and Zimin, building upon work of Hollom, have constructed a counterexample. We revisit this conjecture and study it in the broader context of the class of random cluster measures. We show that the major partial (positive) results on the bunkbed conjecture can also be proved for all random cluster measures, including the results for complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, and the case when $p \uparrow 1$.
  The arboreal gas measure for forests is another limit of the random cluster measure for which we conjecture the inequality to be true and provide proofs in special cases. We identify a setting where the conjecture does hold, that of ``almost spanning tree measures''. A further analysis leads to intriguing correlation inequalities that complement Rayleigh's inequalities for spanning tree measures.</description>

      <title>Local limits of conditioned marked Galton Watson trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Galton-Watson tree where each node is marked independently of each others with a probability depending on its outdegree. We give a complete picture of the local convergence of critical or sub-critical marked Galton-Watson trees conditioned on having a large number of marks. In the critical and sub-critical generic case, the limit is a random marked tree with an infinite spine, named marked Kesten's tree. We focus also on the non-generic case, where the local limit is a random marked tree with a node with infinite out-degree. This case corresponds to the so-called marked condensation phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Direct Paths in the Temporal Hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the $n$-dimensional random temporal hypercube, i.e., the $n$-dimensional hypercube graph with its edges endowed with i.i.d. continuous random weights. We say that a vertex $w$ is accessible from another vertex $v$ if and only if there is a path from $v$ to $w$ with increasing edge weights. We study accessible "direct" paths from a fixed vertex to its antipodal point and show that as $n \to \infty$, the number of such paths converges in distribution to a mixed Poisson law with mixture given by the product of two independent exponentials with rate $1$. Our proof makes use of the Chen-Stein method, coupling arguments, as well as combinatorial arguments which show that typical pairs of accessible paths have small overlap.</description>

      <title>On the failure of weak convergence for Rademacher random multiplicative functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\cP$ be the set of prime numbers, and $X_p,\, p\in\cP$ be a sequence of independent random variables such that $\bbP(X_p=\pm 1)=1/2$. Let $(\te_j)_{j=1}^{\infty}$ the corresponding random multiplicative functions of Radamacher type, namely, $\te_j=\prod_{p|j}X_p$ if $j$ is square free and $\te_j=0$ otherwise. The motivation behind considering these variables comes from the Riemann Hypothesis since $(\te_\ell)$ can be viewed as the random counterpart of the M\"obius function $\mu(\ell)$ and the RH is equivalent to $\sum_{\ell\leq n}\mu(\ell)=o(n^{1/2+\varepsilon}), \forall \varepsilon&gt;0$. Denote $S_n=\sum_{\ell=1}^n\te_\ell$. It is a natural guiding conjecture that $S_n/\sqrt n$ obeys the central limit theorem (CLT). However,
  S. Chatterjee conjectured (as expressed in \cite{[25]}) that the CLT should not hold. Chatterjee's conjecture was proved by Harper \cite{[17]}, and by now it is a direct consequence of a more recent breakthrough by Harper \cite{Har20} that $\frac{S_n}{\sqrt n}\to 0$ in distribution. Nevertheless, the question whether there exists a sequence $a_n=o(\sqrt n)$ such that $S_n/a_n$ converges to some limit remains a mystery. In this paper we, in particular, show that the answer is negative. Our proof is based on trigonometric identities, Levi's continuity theorem, the prime numbers theorem and the growth rates of the prime omega function $\om(n)$. Combining these tools we show that if a weak limit exists then the characteristic function of $S_n/a_n$ must converge to $0$ at any nonzero point. As a byproduct of our method we are also able to provide essentially optimal upper bounds on high order moments similar to \cite{Har19}, using different methods and for more general $X_p$'s.</description>

      <title>Sharp Large Deviations and Gibbs Conditioning for Threshold Models in Portfolio Credit Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain sharp large deviation estimates for exceedance probabilities in dependent triangular array threshold models with a diverging number of latent factors. The prefactors quantify how latent-factor dependence and tail geometry enter at leading order, yielding three regimes: Gaussian or exponential-power tails produce polylogarithmic refinements of the Bahadur-Rao $n^{-1/2}$ law; regularly varying tails yield index-driven polynomial scaling; and bounded-support (endpoint) cases lead to an $n^{-3/2}$ prefactor. We derive these results through Laplace-Olver asymptotics for exponential integrals and conditional Bahadur-Rao estimates for the triangular arrays. Using these estimates, we establish a Gibbs conditioning principle in total variation: conditioned on a large exceedance event, the default indicators become asymptotically i.i.d., and the loss-given-default distribution is exponentially tilted (with the boundary case handled by an endpoint analysis). As illustrations, we obtain second-order approximations for Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall, clarifying when portfolios operate in the genuine large-deviation regime. The results provide a transferable set of techniques-localization, curvature, and tilt identification-for sharp rare-event analysis in dependent threshold systems.</description>

      <title>Correlation decay for U(1) lattice Higgs theory: the case of small mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the lattice Yang-Mills-Higgs model with inverse gauge coupling $\beta&gt;0$ and Higgs length $\alpha&gt;0$, in the ``complete breakdown of symmetry" regime. For lattice dimension $d\ge 2$ and (abelian) gauge group U(1), we prove that for any $m&gt;0$, if $\alpha= m\beta$ and $\beta$ is large enough, the model exhibits exponential decay of correlations. This extends the classical result of Osterwalder and Seiler (1978), who required in addition that $m$ be sufficiently large. Our result also verifies a phase diagram from the physics literature, predicted by Fradkin and Shenker (1979). The proof is based on the Glimm-Jaffe-Spencer cluster expansion around a massive Gaussian field, following the approach of Balaban et al. (1984).</description>

      <title>The square summability of the CLE complementary component diameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the sum of the squares of the diameters of the complementary connected components of the CLE$_\kappa$ carpet/gasket is almost surely finite for $\kappa \in (8/3, 4) \cup (4, 8)$. This is a prerequisite for the application of a result of Ntalampekos which allows the CLE$_\kappa$ carpet/gasket to be uniformized to a round Sierpi\'nski packing, in analogy with the classical Koebe uniformization theorem for finitely connected domains. Our result is new in the case that $\kappa \in (4,8)$ and we provide a new proof for $\kappa \in (8/3, 4)$. In both cases we use the link between CLE and space-filling SLE. The square-summability of diameters has been proved for $\kappa \in (8/3, 4]$ in unpublished work by Rohde and Werness using a different method. Our work completes the proof that this property holds for all $\kappa$ for which CLE$_\kappa$ is defined.</description>

      <title>On Kemeny's Constant for Markov Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mean time taken by an irreducible Markov chain on a finite state space to hit a target chosen at random according to the stationary distribution does not depend on the initial state of the chain. This mean time is known as Kemeny's constant. I present a new approach, based on time reversal and a mean occupation time formula.
  The method is used to prove a similar result for continuous-time Markov processes. In this generality, the constancy holds only almost surely with respect to the stationary distribution of the process, but with extra effort the exceptional set can be made to disappear in certain situations. Some examples are provided.</description>

      <title>Random coverage of a manifold with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a compact $d$-dimensional $C^2$ Riemannian manifold with boundary, embedded in ${\bf R}^m$ where $m \geq d \geq 2$, and let $B$ be a nice subset of $A$ (possibly $B=A$). Let $X_1,X_2, \ldots $ be independent random uniform points in $A$. Define the {\em coverage threshold} $R_n$ to be the smallest $r$ such that $B$ is covered by the geodetic balls of radius $r$ centred on $X_1,\ldots,X_n$. We obtain the limiting distribution of $R_n$ and also a strong law of large numbers for $R_n$ in the large-$n$ limit. For example, if $A$ has Riemannian volume 1 and its boundary has surface measure $|\partial A|$, and $B=A$, then if $d=3$ then ${\bf P}[n\pi R_n^3 - \log n - 2 \log (\log n) \leq x]$ converges to $\exp(-2^{-4}\pi^{5/3} |\partial A| e^{-2 x/3})$ and $(n \pi R_n^3)/(\log n) \to 1$ almost surely, while if $d=2$ then ${\bf P}[n \pi R_n^2 - \log n - \log (\log n) \leq x]$ converges to $\exp(- e^{-x}- |\partial A|\pi^{-1/2} e^{-x/2})$.
  We generalize to allow for multiple coverage. For the strong laws of large numbers, we can relax the requirement that the underlying density on $A$ be uniform. For the limiting distribution, we have a similar result for Poisson samples. Our results still hold if we use Euclidean rather than geodetic balls.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel zeroth-order optimization algorithm based on an efficient sampling strategy. Under mild global regularity conditions on the objective function, we establish non-asymptotic convergence rates for the proposed method. Comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness, highlighting three key attributes: (i) Scalability: consistent performance in high-dimensional settings (exceeding 100 dimensions); (ii) Versatility: robust convergence across a diverse suite of benchmark functions, including Schwefel, Rosenbrock, Ackley, Griewank, L\'evy, Rastrigin, and Weierstrass; and (iii) Robustness to discontinuities: reliable performance on non-smooth and discontinuous landscapes. These results illustrate the method's strong potential for black-box optimization in complex, real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Sequential Testing Problem with Signal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a controlled version of the Bayesian sequential testing problem for the drift of a Wiener process, in which the observer exercises discretion over the signal intensity. This control incurs a running cost that reflects the resource demands of information acquisition. The objective is to minimize the total expected cost, combining both the expenditure on control and the loss from misclassifying the unknown drift. By allowing for a general class of loss functions and any measurable cost of control, our analysis captures a broad range of sequential inference problems. We show that when a function, determined by the cost structure, admits a global minimizer, the optimal control is constant and explicitly computable, thereby reducing our setting to a solvable optimal stopping problem. If no such minimizer exists, an optimal control does not exist either, yet the value function remains explicit. Our results thus demonstrate that full tractability can be retained even when extending sequential inference to include endogenous control over the information flow.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the Electron MHD with random diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18640</link>

Abstract: We investigate the three-dimensional Electron Magnetohydrodynamics (EMHD) equations in the absence of resistivity, a regime that is generally ill-posed in Sobolev and Gevrey spaces due to the system's quasilinear structure. Motivated by the recent work of one of the authors on the inviscid primitive equations (R.~Hu, Q.~Lin, and R.~Liu, \emph{Journal of Nonlinear Science}, 35:84, 2025), we introduce a random diffusion term and demonstrate that it restores local well-posedness almost surely in appropriate Gevrey classes. Furthermore, under slightly stronger diffusion and small initial data, we establish global well-posedness with high probability. These results extend the scope of stochastic regularization techniques to a broader class of quasilinear magnetic systems relevant to plasma physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study sequences of perfect t-embeddings of a uniformly weighted family of graphs we call generalized tower graphs. We show that the embeddings of these graphs satisfy certain technical assumptions, in particular, the rigidity assumption of Berggren-Nicoletti-Russkikh. As a result, we confirm the convergence of the gradients of the height function fluctuations of these graphs to those of the Gaussian free field.</description>

      <title>Short, Quantitative Construction of the IIC in Planar Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is standard to construct the Infinite Incipient Cluster as the limit of the critical percolation measure conditioned on 0 being connected to radius n, as n tends to infinity. We provide a short proof of that convergence in the planar setting. A key step in the proof is to introduce an unbiased percolation configuration above which are coupled two percolations conditioned on 0 being connected to different radii. It implies a speed of convergence in total variation distance to the IIC measure upper-bounded by the dual one-arm probability, which is the first occurrence of an explicit upperbound.</description>

Abstract: We derive a vector generalization of the square root embedding-based curvature-corrected Cram\'er--Rao bound (CRB) previously considered by the same author in \cite{srk} with scalar parameters. A \emph{directional} curvature correction is established first, and sufficient conditions for a conservative matrix-level CRB refinement are formulated using a simple semidefinite program. The directional correction theorem is rigorously illustrated with a Gaussian example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the generalized gradient-flow framework of Peletier, Rossi, Savar\'e, and Tse to singular jump processes on abstract metric spaces, moving beyond the translation-invariant kernels considered in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\mathbb{T}^d$ in previous contributions. To address the analytical challenges posed by singularities, we introduce reflecting solutions, a new solution concept inspired by reflected Dirichlet forms, which ensures the validity of a chain rule and restores uniqueness. We establish existence, stability, and compactness results for these solutions by approximating singular kernels with regularized ones, and we show their robustness under such approximations. The framework encompasses dissipative and balanced solutions, clarifies their relations, and highlights the role of density properties of Lipschitz functions in upgrading weak formulations to reflecting solutions. As an application, we demonstrate the versatility of our theory to nonlocal stochastic evolutions on configuration spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by observations in sequence data of herpesviruses, we introduce a multi-locus model for the joint evolution of different genotypes in a virus population that is distributed across a population of hosts. In the model, virus particles replicate, recombine, and mutate within their hosts at rates that act on different time scales. Furthermore, virus particles are exchanged between hosts at reinfection events and hosts are replaced by primary infected hosts when they die. We determine the asymptotic type distribution observed in a single host in the limit of large host and virus populations under asymptotic rate assumptions by tracing back the ancestry of the sample. The proposed model may serve as a null model for the evolution of virus populations that are capable of persistence and can be used to estimate the strengths of different evolutionary forces driving genetic diversity, see also [4].</description>

      <title>Maximum Entropy Random Walks: the Infinite Setting and the Example of Spider Networks with their Scaling Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.05274v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we establish solid foundations for the study of Maximal Entropy Random Walks (MERWs) on infinite graphs. We introduce a generalized definition that extends the original concept, along with rigorous tools for handling this generalization. Unlike conventional simple random walks, which maximize entropy locally, MERWs maximize entropy globally along their paths, marking a significant paradigm shift and presenting substantial computational challenges. Originally introduced by physicists and computer scientists in [1], MERWs have connections to concepts such as Parry measures and Doob h-transforms. Our approach addresses the challenges of existence, uniqueness, and approximation, illustrated through examples and counterexamples. Even in the infinite setting, MERWs continue to maximize the entropy rate, albeit in a less direct manner. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of weighted spider networks, including scaling limits, revealing various phenomena characteristic of the infinite framework, notably a phase transition. A unified proof of scaling limits based on submartingale problems is presented. Furthermore, we consider some extended models, where the spider lattice provides valuable insights, highlighting the complexity of studying these walks for general infinite weighted graphs.</description>

Abstract: We provide a class of examples of interacting particle systems on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, for $d\in\{1,2\}$, that admit a unique translation-invariant stationary measure, which is not the long-time limit of all translation-invariant starting measures, due to the existence of time-periodic orbits in the associated measure-valued dynamics. This is the first such example and shows that even in low dimensions, not every limit point of the measure-valued dynamics needs to be a time-stationary measure.</description>

      <title>TASEP with a general initial condition and a deterministically moving wall</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03370v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) on $\mathbb{Z}$ with a general initial condition and a deterministically moving wall in front of the particles. Using colour-position symmetry, we express the one-point distributions in terms of particle positions in a TASEP with step initial condition along a space-like path.
  Based on this formula, we analyse the large-time asymptotics of the model under various scenarios. For initial conditions other than the step initial condition, we identify a distinct asymptotic behaviour at the boundary of the region influenced by the wall, differing from the observations made in [Borodin-Bufetov-Ferrari'24] and [Ferrari-Gernholt'24]. Furthermore, we demonstrate that product limit distributions are associated with shocks in the macroscopic empirical density.
  As a special case of our starting formula, we derive a variational expression for the one-point distributions of TASEP with arbitrary initial data. Focusing on non-random initial conditions, such as periodic ones with an arbitrary density, we leverage our analytical tools to characterise the limit distribution within the framework of particle positions.</description>

Abstract: The variance of the first-passage percolation is bounded by the $L^2$-norms of the derivatives with respect to the environment. In this paper we prove that the environment derivatives of orders $k\in\{2,3,4\}$ are bounded below by $-\binom{k-2}{\lceil\frac{k-2}2\rceil}$ and above by $\binom{k-2}{\lceil\frac{k-2}2\rceil}$. We believe that these are the bounds for all $k$. We provide examples of environments that show that these extreme values can be attained.</description>

      <title>The Feller diffusion conditioned on a single ancestral founder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19428v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the distributional properties of a Feller diffusion $(X(\tau))_{\tau \in [0, t]}$ conditioned on the current population $X(t)$ having a single ancestor at time zero. The approach is novel and is based on an interpretation of Feller's original solution according to which the current population is comprised of a Poisson number of exponentially distributed families, each descended from a single ancestor. The distribution of the number of ancestors at intermediate times and the joint density of coalescent times is determined under assumptions of initiation of the process from a single ancestor at a specified time in the past, including infinitely far in the past, and for the case of a uniform prior on the time since initiation. Also calculated are the joint distribution of the time since the most recent common ancestor of the current population and the contemporaneous population size at that time under different assumptions on the time since initiation. In each case exact solutions are given for supercritical, critical and subcritical diffusions. For supercritical diffusions asymptotic forms of distributions are also given in the limit of unbounded exponential growth.</description>

      <title>SDEs with critical general distributional drifts: sharp solvability and blow-ups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09244v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish weak well-posedness for SDEs having discontinuous diffusion coefficients and general distributional drifts that may introduce blow up effects. Our drifts satisfy minimal assumptions, i.e.\,we assume only that the Cauchy problem for the Kolmogorov backward equation is well-posed in the standard Hilbert triple $W^{1,2} \hookrightarrow L^2 \hookrightarrow W^{-1,2}$. By a result of Mazya and Verbitsky, these assumptions are precisely those drifts that can be represented as the sum of a form-bounded component (encompassing, for example, Morrey or Chang-Wilson-Wolff drifts) and a divergence-free distributional component in the ${\rm BMO}^{-1}$ space of Koch and Tataru.
  We apply our results to finite particle systems with strong attracting interactions immersed in a turbulent flow. This includes particle systems of Keller-Segel type. Crucially, in dimensions $d \geq 3$, we cover almost the entire admissible range of attraction strengths, reaching nearly to the blow-up threshold.
  As a further application of our results for SDEs and of the theory of Bessel processes, we obtain an improved upper bound on the constant in the many-particle Hardy inequality. Consequently, the lower bound previously derived by Hoffmann-Ostenhof, Hoffmann-Ostenhof, Laptev, and Tidblom is shown to be close to optimal.</description>

      <title>Non-exchangeable mean-field theory for adaptive weights: propagation of chaos and graphon sampling lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a mean-field theory for large, non-exchangeable particle (agent) systems where the states and interaction weights co-evolve in a coupled system of SDEs. A first main result is a generalization of the propagation of chaos. The weight adaptation in the SDEs makes the classical approach of using a static probability space as the continuum limit for the agent labels inadequate. We address this by introducing a label space endowed with a filtration that captures the stochasticity. While this yields a well-posed McKean-Vlasov SDE, its limit is not easily described by a Vlasov-type PDE. This difficulty, in turn, motivates the introduction of a unified metric that naturally combines the Wasserstein distance for states and the cut norm for weights. In this metric space, we establish the convergence of finite systems to their continuum limit. This result, analogous to the classical convergence of empirical measures, is a subtle consequence of a deep result from dense graph theory, namely the Sampling Lemma.</description>

Abstract: We obtain the explicit rate of convergence $N^{-1/2 + \epsilon}$ for the gaps of generalized Wigner matrices in the bulk of the spectrum, for distributions of matrix entries possibly atomic and supported on enough points. The proof proceeds by a Green function comparison, coupled with the relaxation estimate from [5]. In particular, we extend the 4 moment matching method [33] to arbitrary moments, allowing to compare resolvents down to the submicroscopic scale $N^{-3/2 + \epsilon}$. This method also gives universality of the smallest gaps between eigenvalues for the Hermitian symmetry class, providing a universal, optimal separation of eigenvalues for discrete random matrices with entries supported on $\Omega(1)$ points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main objective of this study is fractionally integrated fractional Brownian noise, I(t/a,H) where a&gt;0 is the multiplicity(not necessarily an integer) of integration, and H is the Hurst parameter . The subject of the analysis is the persistence exponent e(a,H) that determines the power-law asymptotic of probability that the process will not exceed a fixit positive level in a growing time interval (0,T). In the important cases (a=1,H) and (a=2,H=1/2) these exponents are well known. To understand the problematic exponents e(2,H), we consider the (a,H) parameters from the maximum (for the task) area G= (a+H&gt;1,0&lt;H&lt;1) ). We prove the decrease of the exponents with increasing 'a' and describe their behavior near the boundary of G, including infinity. The discovered identity of the exponents with the parameters (a,H) and (a+2H-1,1-H) actually refutes the long-standing hypothesis that e(2,H)=H(1-H). Our results are based on well known the continuity lemma for the persistence exponents and on a generalization of Slepian's lemma for a family of Gaussian processes smoothly dependent on a parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the large $N$ limit of the Langevin dynamics for the spin $O(N)$ model is given by a mean-field stochastic differential equation (SDE) in both finite and infinite volumes. We establish uniform in $N$ bounds for the dynamics, which enable us to demonstrate convergence to the mean-field SDE with polynomial interactions. Furthermore, the mean-field SDE is shown to be globally well-posed for suitable initial distributions. We also prove the existence of stationary measures for the mean-field SDE. For small inverse temperatures, we characterize the large $N$ limit of the spin $O(N)$ model through stationary coupling.

      <title>Stability criteria for rough systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07842v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantitative direct method to prove the local stability of a stationary solution for a rough differential equation and its regular discretization scheme. Using Doss-Sussmann technique and stopping time analysis, we provide stability criteria for a stationary solution of the continuous system to be exponentially stable, provided the diffusion term is bounded and its derivatives exhibit small growth. The same conclusions hold for the regular discretization scheme with a sufficiently small step size, but one needs to apply the sewing lemma and stopping times for the discrete time set. Our stability criteria are based on the linearization of the drift and require only information about the bound and growth rates of the diffusion, making them data-driven criteria.</description>

      <title>Homophily Within and Across Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07901v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Homophily -- the tendency of individuals to interact with similar others -- shapes how networks form and function. Yet existing approaches typically collapse homophily to a single scale, either one parameter for the whole network or one per community, thereby detaching it from other structural features. Here, we introduce a maximum-entropy random graph model that moves beyond these limits, capturing homophily across all social scales in the network, with parameters for each group size. The framework decomposes homophily into within- and across-group contributions, recovering the stochastic block model as a special case. As an exponential-family model, it fits empirical data and enables inference of group-level variation of homophily that aggregate metrics miss. The group-dependence of homophily substantially impacts network percolation thresholds, altering predictions for epidemic spread, information diffusion, and the effectiveness of interventions. Ignoring such heterogeneity risks systematically misjudging connectivity and dynamics in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Representative Action Selection for Large Action Space Meta-Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18269v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of selecting a subset from a large action space shared by a family of bandits, with the goal of achieving performance nearly matching that of using the full action space. We assume that similar actions tend to have related payoffs, modeled by a Gaussian process. To exploit this structure, we propose a simple epsilon-net algorithm to select a representative subset. We provide theoretical guarantees for its performance and compare it empirically to Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound.</description>

      <title>Finite $N$ precursors of the free cumulants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $\mathrm{U}(N)$ invariant polynomials on the space of $N\times N$ matrices first introduced by Capitaine and Casalis, that are precursors of free cumulants in various respects. First, they are polynomials of deterministic matrices, that are not yet evaluated over some probability law, contrary to what is usually meant by cumulants. Secondly, they converge towards the algebraic expression of free cumulants in terms of moments as $N\to \infty$, with $1/N^2$ corrections expressed in terms of monotone Hurwitz numbers. Their most crucial property is their additivity with respect to averaging over sums of $\mathrm{U}(N)$ conjugacy orbits, providing a finite $N$ version of the well-known additivity of free cumulants in free probability. Finally, they extend several properties of free cumulants at finite $N$, including a Wick rule for their average over a Gaussian weight and their appearance in various matrix integrals. Building on the additivity property of these precursors, we also define and compute a coproduct describing the behaviour of general invariant polynomials with respect to the addition of $\mathrm{U}(N)$ conjugacy orbits, as well as their expectation values on sums of $\mathrm{U}(N)$-invariant random matrices. In our construction, a central role is played by the so-called HCIZ integral, both for the definition of the precursors and for the derivation of their properties.</description>

      <title>Spectrum and local weak convergence of sparse random uniform hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of local weak convergence, or Benjamini--Schramm convergence, was introduced by Benjamini and Schramm. The local weak limit of sparse Erd\H os--R\'enyi graphs is the Galton--Watson measure with Poisson offspring almost surely. Recently, Adhikari, Kumar, and Saha showed that the line graph of sparse Linial--Meshulam complexes converges to the $d$-block Galton--Watson measure. We study a unified model: weighted line graphs of sparse $k$-uniform random hypergraphs on $n$ vertices. Let $H(n,k,p)$ be the $k$-uniform random hypergraph where each $k$-subset of $[n]$ is included as a hyperedge independently with probability $p$. For a $k$-uniform hypergraph $H=(V,E)$ and $1\le r\le k-1$, define the $r$-set weighted line graph $G_r(H)=(\mathcal V_r,\mathcal E_r,w_H)$ by $$ \mathcal V_r=\bigl[\tbinom{n}{r}\bigr],\quad \mathcal E_r=\bigl\{\{\tau_1,\tau_2\}:\tau_1,\tau_2\in\mathcal V_r,\ \exists e\in E\text{ s.t. }\tau_1,\tau_2\subset e\bigr\}, $$ with weight $w_H(\{\tau_1,\tau_2\})=\bigl|\{e\in E:\tau_1,\tau_2\subset e\}\bigr|$. In particular, $G_1(H_n)$ generalizes Erd\H os--R\'enyi graphs and $G_{k-1}(H_n)$ is the line graph of the Linial--Meshulam complex. We show that if $\tbinom{n-r}{k-r}\to \lambda$ as $n\to\infty$, then $G_r(H_n)$ converges locally to the $(\tbinom{k}{r}-1)$-block Galton--Watson measure with $\operatorname{Poisson}(\lambda)$ offspring almost surely. As a consequence, we obtain the limiting spectral distribution of the adjacency matrices of $G_r(H_n)$.</description>
