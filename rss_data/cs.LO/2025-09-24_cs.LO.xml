      <title>L-Mosaics and Bounded Join-Semilattices in Isabelle/HOL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete formalization in Isabelle/HOL of the object part of an equivalence between L-mosaics and bounded join-semilattices, employing an AI-assisted methodology that integrates large language models as reasoning assistants throughout the proof development process. The equivalence was originally established by Cangiotti, Linzi, and Talotti in their study of hypercompositional structures related to orthomodular lattices and quantum logic. Our formalization rigorously verifies the main theoretical result and demonstrates the mutual inverse property of the transformations establishing this equivalence. The development showcases both the mathematical depth of multivalued algebraic operations and the potential for AI-enhanced interactive theorem proving in tackling complex formalization projects.</description>

      <title>From Zonotopes to Proof Certificates: A Formal Pipeline for Safe Control Envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthesizing controllers that enforce both safety and actuator constraints is a central challenge in the design of cyber-physical systems. State-of-the-art reachability methods based on zonotopes deliver impressive scalability, yet no zonotope reachability tool has been formally verified and the lack of end-to-end correctness undermines the confidence in their use for safety-critical systems. Although deductive verification with the hybrid system prover KeYmaera X could, in principle, resolve this assurance gap, the high-dimensional set representations required for realistic control envelopes overwhelm its reasoning based on quantifier elimination. To address this gap, we formalize how control-invariant sets serve as sound safety certificates. Building on that foundation, we develop a verification pipeline for control envelopes that unites scalability and formal rigor. First, we compute control envelopes with high-performance reachability algorithms. Second, we certify every intermediate result using provably correct logical principles. To accelerate this certification, we offload computationally intensive zonotope containment tasks to efficient numerical backends, which return compact witnesses that KeYmaera X validates rapidly. We show the practical utility of our approach through representative case studies.</description>

      <title>About the Multi-Head Linear Restricted Chase Termination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chase is a ubiquitous algorithm in database theory. However, for existential rules (aka tuple-generating dependencies), its termination is not guaranteed, and even undecidable in general. The problem of termination becomes particularly difficult for the restricted (or standard) chase, for which the order of rule application matters. Thus, decidability of restricted chase termination is still open for many well-behaved classes such as linear or guarded multi-headed rules. We make a step forward by showing that all-instances restricted chase termination is decidable in the linear multi-headed case.</description>

      <title>Formalization of Harder-Narasimhan theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Harder-Narasimhan theory provides a canonical filtration of a vector bundle on a projective curve whose successive quotients are semistable with strictly decreasing slopes. In this article, we present the formalization of Harder-Narasimhan theory in the proof assistant Lean 4 with Mathlib. This formalization is based on a recent approach of Harder-Narasimhan theory by Chen and Jeannin, which reinterprets the theory in order-theoretic terms and avoids the classical dependence on algebraic geometry. As an application, we formalize the uniqueness of coprimary filtration of a finitely generated module over a noetherian ring, and the existence of the Jordan-H\"older filtration of a semistable Harder-Narasimhan game.

      <title>Effective bases and notions of effective second countability in computable analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate different notions of "computable topological base" for represented spaces. We show that several non-equivalent notions of bases become equivalent when we consider computably enumerable bases. This indicates the existence of a robust notion of computably second countable represented space. These spaces are precisely those introduced by Grubba and Weihrauch under the name "computable topological spaces". The present work thus clarifies the articulation between Schr\"oder's approach to computable topology based on the Sierpinski representation and other approaches based on notions of computable bases. These other approaches turn out to be compatible with the Sierpinski representation approach, but also strictly less general. We revisit Schr\"oder's Effective Metrization Theorem, by showing that it characterizes those represented spaces that embed into computable metric spaces: those are the computably second countable strongly computably regular represented spaces. Finally, we study different forms of open choice problems. We show that having a computable open choice is equivalent to being computably separable, but that the "non-total open choice problem", i.e., open choice restricted to open sets that have non-empty complement, interacts with effective second countability in a satisfying way.</description>

      <title>Compact Rule-Based Classifier Learning via Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rule-based models are essential for high-stakes decision-making due to their transparency and interpretability, but their discrete nature creates challenges for optimization and scalability. In this work, we present the Fuzzy Rule-based Reasoner (FRR), a novel gradient-based rule learning system that supports strict user constraints over rule-based complexity while achieving competitive performance. To maximize interpretability, the FRR uses semantically meaningful fuzzy logic partitions, unattainable with existing neuro-fuzzy approaches, and sufficient (single-rule) decision-making, which avoids the combinatorial complexity of additive rule ensembles. Through extensive evaluation across 40 datasets, FRR demonstrates: (1) superior performance to traditional rule-based methods (e.g., $5\%$ average accuracy over RIPPER); (2) comparable accuracy to tree-based models (e.g., CART) using rule bases $90\%$ more compact; and (3) achieves $96\%$ of the accuracy of state-of-the-art additive rule-based models while using only sufficient rules and requiring only $3\%$ of their rule base size.</description>

      <title>Factorised Representations of Join Queries: Tight Bounds and a New Dichotomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A common theme in factorised databases and knowledge compilation is the representation of solution sets in a useful yet succinct data structure. In this paper, we study the representation of the result of join queries (or, equivalently, the set of homomorphisms between two relational structures). We focus on the very general format of $\{\cup, \times\}$-circuits -- also known as d-representations or DNNF circuits -- and aim to find the limits of this approach.
  In prior work, it has been shown that there always exists a $\{\cup, \times\}$-circuits-circuit of size $N^{O(subw)}$ representing the query result, where N is the size of the database and subw the submodular width of the query. If the arity of all relations is bounded by a constant, then subw is linear in the treewidth tw of the query. In this setting, the authors of this paper proved a lower bound of $N^{\Omega(tw^{\varepsilon})}$ on the circuit size (ICALP 2023), where $\varepsilon&gt;0$ depends on the excluded grid theorem.
  Our first main contribution is to improve this lower bound to $N^{\Omega(tw)}$, which is tight up to a constant factor in the exponent. Our second contribution is a $N^{\Omega(subw^{1/4})}$ lower bound on the circuit size for join queries over relations of unbounded arity. Both lower bounds are unconditional lower bounds on the circuit size for well-chosen database instances. Their proofs use a combination of structural (hyper)graph theory with communication complexity in a simple yet novel way. While the second lower bound is asymptotically equivalent to Marx's conditional bound on the decision complexity (JACM 2013), our $N^{\Theta(tw)}$ bound in the bounded-arity setting is tight, while the best conditional bound on the decision complexity is $N^{\Omega(tw/\log tw)}$. Note that, removing this logarithmic factor in the decision setting is a major open problem.</description>

      <title>Functoriality of Enriched Data Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous work, categories of algebras of endofunctors were shown to be enriched in categories of coalgebras of the same endofunctor, and the extra structure of that enrichment was used to define a generalization of inductive data types. These generalized inductive data types are parametrized by a coalgebra $C$, so we call them $C$-inductive data types; we call the morphisms induced by their universal property $C$-inductive functions. We extend that work by incorporating natural transformations into the theory: given a suitable natural transformation between endofunctors, we show that this induces enriched functors between their categories of algebras which preserve $C$-inductive data types and $C$-inductive functions. Such $C$-inductive data types are often finite versions of the corresponding inductive data type, and we show how our framework can extend classical initial algebra semantics to these types. For instance, we show that our theory naturally produces partially inductive functions on lists, changes in list element types, and tree pruning functions.</description>

      <title>Smaller Circuits for Bit Addition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bit addition arises virtually everywhere in digital circuits: arithmetic operations, increment/decrement operators, computing addresses and table indices, and so on. Since bit addition is such a basic task in Boolean circuit synthesis, a lot of research has been done on constructing efficient circuits for various special cases of it. A vast majority of these results are devoted to optimizing the circuit depth (also known as delay).
  In this paper, we investigate the circuit size (also known as area) over the full binary basis of bit addition. Though most of the known circuits are built from Half Adders and Full Adders, we show that, in many interesting scenarios, these circuits have suboptimal size. Namely, we improve an upper bound $5n-3m$ to $4.5n-2m$, where $n$ is the number of input bits and $m$ is the number of output bits. In the regimes where $m$ is small compared to $n$ (for example, for computing the sum of $n$ bits or multiplying two $n$-bit integers), this leads to $10\%$ improvement.
  We complement our theoretical result by an open-source implementation of generators producing circuits for bit addition and multiplication. The generators allow one to produce the corresponding circuits in two lines of code and to compare them to existing designs.</description>
