      <title>The contact process on Scale-Free Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the contact process on scale-free percolation, a spatial random graph model where the degree distribution of the vertices follows a power law with exponent $\beta$. We study the extinction time $\tau_{G_n}$ of the contact process on the graph restricted to a d-dimensional box of volume n, starting from full occupancy. In the regime $\beta \in (2, 3)$, where the degrees have finite mean but infinite variance and the graph exhibits the ultra-small world behaviour, we adapt the techniques of [Linker et al., 2021] to show that $\tau_{G_n}$ is exponential in n. Our main contribution, though, deals with the case $\beta \geq 3$, where the degrees have finite variance and the graph is small-world. We prove that also in this case $\tau_{G_n}$ grows exponentially, at least up to a logarithmic correction reflecting the sparser graph structure. The proof requires the generalization of a result from [Mountford et al., 2016] and combines a multi-scale analysis of the graph, the study of the chemical distance between vertices and percolation arguments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study law of large numbers, central limit theorem, large and moderate deviations for INAR($\infty$) processes, which as a special case, includes both discrete-time linear Hawkes process and INAR(1) process in the literature. Our results recover existing results on large and moderate deviations for the discrete-time Hawkes process as studied in \cite{Wang2} and for the INAR(1) process as in \cite{Yu}.</description>

      <title>The strong law of large numbers and a functional central limit theorem for general Markov additive processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we re-visit the fundamental question of the strong law of large numbers and central limit theorem for processes in continuous time with conditional stationary and independent increments. For convenience we refer to them as Markov additive processes, or MAPs for short. Historically used in the setting of queuing theory, MAPs have often been written about when the underlying modulating process is an ergodic Markov chain on a finite state space. Recent works have addressed the strong law of large numbers when the underlying modulating process is a general Markov processes. We add to the latter with a different approach based on an ergodic theorem for additive functionals and on the semi-martingale structure of the additive part. This approach also allows us to deal with the setting that the modulator of the MAP is either positive or null recurrent. The methodology additionally inspires a CLT-type result.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic limit for some gradient and attractive spin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamic limit for three gradient spin models: generalized Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti (KMP), its discrete version and a family of harmonic models, under symmetric and nearest-neighbor interactions. These three models share some universal properties: occupation variables are unbounded, all these processes are of gradient type, their invariant measures are product with spatially homogeneous weights, and, notably, they are all attractive, meaning that the process preserves the partial order of measures along the dynamics. In view of hydrodynamics of large-scale interacting systems, dealing with processes taking values in unbounded configuration spaces is known to be a challenging problem. In the present paper, we show the hydrodynamic limit for all three models listed above in a comprehensive way, and show as a main result, that, under the diffusive time scaling, the hydrodynamic equation is given by the heat equation with model-dependent diffusion coefficient. Our novelty is showing the attractiveness for each model, which is crucial for the proof of hydrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates an insurance model with a finite number of major clients and a large number of small clients, where the dynamics of the latter group are modeled by a spectrally positive L\'evy process. We begin by analyzing this general model, in which the inter-arrival times are exponentially distributed (though not identically), and derive the closed-form Laplace transform of the ruin probability. Next, we examine a simplified version of the model involving only the major clients, and explore the tail asymptotics of the ruin probability, focusing on the cases where the claim sizes follow phase-type or regularly varying distributions. Finally, we derive the distribution of the overshoot over an exponentially distributed initial reserve, expressed in terms of its Laplace-Stieltjes transform.</description>

      <title>Metastability for the Curie-Weiss-Potts model with unbounded random interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the metastable behaviour of the disordered Curie-Weiss-Potts (DCWP) model subject to a Glauber dynamics. The model is a randomly disordered version of the mean-field $q$-spin Potts model (CWP), where the interaction coefficients between spins are general independent random variables. These random variables are chosen to have fixed mean (for simplicity taken to be $1$) and well defined cumulant generating function, with a fixed distribution not depending on the number of particles. The system evolves as a discrete-time Markov chain with single spin flip Metropolis dynamics at finite inverse temperature $\beta$. We provide a comparison of the metastable behaviour of the CWP and DCWP models, when $N \to \infty$. First, we establish the metastability of the CWP model and, using this result, prove metastability for the DCWP model (with high probability). We then determine the ratio between the metastable transition time for the DCWP model and the corresponding time for the CWP model. Specifically, we derive the asymptotic tail behavior and moments of this ratio. Our proof combines the potential-theoretic approach to metastability with concentration of measure techniques, the latter adapted to our specific context.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity of the Anderson $\Phi_2^4$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the parabolic stochastic quantization equation associated to the $\Phi_2^4$ model on the torus in a spatial white noise environment. We study the long time behavior of this heat equation with independent multiplicative white noise and additive spacetime white noise, which is a singular SPDE in a singular environement and requires two different renormalization procedures. We prove that the solution is global in time with a strong a priori $L^p$ bound independent of the initial data in $C^{-\varepsilon}$ for large $p$. The quenched solution given the environment is shown to be an infinite dimensional Markov process which satisfies the strong Feller property. We prove exponential convergence to a unique invariant measure using a Doeblin criterion for the transition semigroup. In particular, our work is a generalization of a previous work by Tsatsoulis and Weber in a case which is not translation invariant hence the method makes no use of the reversibility of the dynamics or the explicit knowledge of the invariant measure and it is therefore in principle applicable to situations where these are not available such as the vector-valued case.</description>

      <title>Upper moderate deviation probabilities for the maximum of branching Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known from~\cite{Bramson1983} that the maximum of branching Brownian motion at time $t$ is asymptotically around an explicit function $m_t$, which involves a first ballistic order and a logarithmic correction. In this paper, we give an asymptotic equivalent for its upper moderate deviation probability, that is, the probability that the maximum achieves $m_t + x_t$ at time $t$, where $1 \ll x_t \ll t$. We adopt a probabilistic approach that employs a modified version of the second moment method.</description>

      <title>The Poisson Multiplication Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish necessary and sufficient conditions implying that the product of $m\geq 2$ Poisson functionals, living in a finite sum of Wiener chaoses, is square-integrable. Our conditions are expressed in terms of iterated add-one cost operators, and are obtained through the use of a novel family of Poincar\'e inequalities for almost surely finite random variables, generalizing the recent findings by Trauthwein (2024). When specialized to the case of multiple Wiener-It\^o integrals, our results yield general multiplication formulae on the Poisson space under minimal conditions, naturally expressed in terms of partitions and diagrams. Our work addresses several questions left open in a seminal work by Surgailis (1984), and completes a line of research initiated in D\"obler and Peccati (2018).</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness for small data in a 3D temperature-velocity model with Dirichlet boundary noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse a Boussinesq coupled temperature-velocity system on a bounded, open, smooth domain $\mathcal{D} \subset \mathbb{R}^3$. The fluid velocity $u^\varepsilon$ evolves according to the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations, while the temperature $\theta^\varepsilon$ is subject to Dirichlet boundary noise of intensity $\sqrt{\varepsilon}$. Given a finite time $T&gt;0$, under natural assumptions on the stochastic forcing and for sufficiently small initial data, we show that there exists a unique mild solution $(u^\varepsilon, \theta^\varepsilon)$ up to a random stopping time $\tau^\varepsilon \leq T$. Moreover, $\mathbb{P}(\tau^\varepsilon = T) \geq 1 - C \varepsilon$, and the solution trajectories lie in the optimal regularity class $ (u^\varepsilon, \theta^\varepsilon) \in \left( H^{1,p}_t(H_x^{-\tfrac{1}{2} - \delta}) \cap L^p_t(H_x^{\tfrac{3}{2} - \delta}) \right) \times C_t(H_x^{-\tfrac{1}{2} - \delta}) $ for all sufficiently small $\delta &gt; 0$ and all $p &gt; \tfrac{2}{1 - \delta}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the event that there is a $+$ crossing from left to right in a box for the Ising model on the triangular lattice. We show that this event is noise sensitive under Glauber dynamics $t \mapsto \sigma_t$ in the subcritical regime $\beta&lt;\beta_c$. We rely on the non-spectral approach from our previous work [TV23]. An important aspect in this more general setup is the study of the pair $(\sigma_0,\sigma_t)$ and in particular the establishment of properties such as finite-energy and spatial mixing.</description>

      <title>A central limit theorem for a generalization of the Ewens measure to random tuples of commuting permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a central limit theorem (CLT) for the number of joint orbits of random tuples of commuting permutations. In the uniform sampling case this generalizes the classic CLT of Goncharov for the number of cycles of a single random permutation. We also consider the case where tuples are weighted by a factor other than one, per joint orbit. We view this as an analogue of the Ewens measure, for tuples of commuting permutations, where our CLT generalizes the CLT by Hansen. Our proof uses saddle point analysis, in a context related to the Hardy-Ramanujan asymptotics and the theorem of Meinardus, but concerns a multiple pole situation. The proof is written in a self-contained manner, and hopefully in a manner accessible to a wider audience. We also indicate several open directions of further study related to probability, combinatorics, number theory, an elusive theory of random commuting matrices, and perhaps also geometric group theory.</description>

      <title>M|D|$\infty$ Queue Busy Period and Busy Cycle Distributions Computational Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the busy period and busy cycle major importance in queuing systems, it is crucial the knowledge of the respective distribution functions that is what allows the calculation of the important probabilities. For the M|G|$\infty$ queue system, there are no round form formulae for those distribution functions. But, for the M|D|$\infty$ queue, due the fact that its busy period and busy cycle have both Laplace transform expression round forms, what does not happen for any other M|G|$\infty$ queue system, with an algorithm created by Platzman, Ammons and Bartholdi III, that allows the tail probabilities computation since the correspondent Laplace transform in round form is known, those distribution functions calculations are possible. Here, we will implement the algorithm through a FORTRAN program.</description>

      <title>An Exponential Averaging Process with Strong Convergence Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Averaging, or smoothing, is a fundamental approach to obtain stable, de-noised estimates from noisy observations. In certain scenarios, observations made along trajectories of random dynamical systems are of particular interest. One popular smoothing technique for such a scenario is exponential moving averaging (EMA), which assigns observations a weight that decreases exponentially in their age, thus giving younger observations a larger weight. However, EMA fails to enjoy strong stochastic convergence properties, which stems from the fact that the weight assigned to the youngest observation is constant over time, preventing the noise in the averaged quantity from decreasing to zero. In this work, we consider an adaptation to EMA, which we call $p$-EMA, where the weights assigned to the last observations decrease to zero at a subharmonic rate. We provide stochastic convergence guarantees for this kind of averaging under mild assumptions on the autocorrelations of the underlying random dynamical system. We further discuss the implications of our results for a recently introduced adaptive step size control for Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), which uses $p$-EMA for averaging noisy observations.</description>

      <title>Minimax learning rates for estimating binary classifiers under margin conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study classification problems using binary estimators where the decision boundary is described by horizon functions and where the data distribution satisfies a geometric margin condition. We establish upper and lower bounds for the minimax learning rate over broad function classes with bounded Kolmogorov entropy in Lebesgue norms. A key novelty of our work is the derivation of lower bounds on the worst-case learning rates under a geometric margin condition -- a setting that is almost universally satisfied in practice but remains theoretically challenging. Moreover, our results deal with the noiseless setting, where lower bounds are particularly hard to establish. We apply our general results to classification problems with decision boundaries belonging to several function classes: for Barron-regular functions, and for H\"older-continuous functions with strong margins, we identify optimal rates close to the fast learning rates of $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1})$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ samples. Also for merely convex decision boundaries, in a strong margin case optimal rates near $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/2})$ can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Tracking Brownian fluid particles in large eddy simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a numerical method for simulation of wall-bounded incompressible turbulent flows by integrating the technology of random vortex method with the core idea of Large Eddy Simulation (LES). Specifically, we utilize the filtering function in LES, interpreted as spatial averaging, along with the integral representation theorem for parabolic equations,to achieve a closure numerical scheme which may be used for calculating solutions of Navier-Stokes equations. This approach circumvents the challenge associated with handling the non-locally integrable 3-dimensional integral kernel in the random vortex method and facilitates the computation of numerical solutions for flow systems via Monte-Carlo method. Comprehensive numerical simulations are carried out for turbulent and laminar flows in full space and wall-bounded space, considering both two-dimensional and three-dimensional cases, thereby demonstrating the validity and effectiveness of the method.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of Constrained Quantization for Compactly Supported Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the asymptotics of high-rate constrained quantization errors for a compactly supported probability measure P on Euclidean spaces whose quantizers are confined to a closed set S. The key tool is the metric projection of K onto S that assigns each source point to its nearest neighbor in S, allowing the errors to be transferred to the projection, where K = supp P. For the upper estimate, we establish a projection pull-back inequality that bounds the errors by the classical covering radius of the projection. For the lower estimate, a weighted distance function enables us to perturb any quantizer element lying on the projection slightly into the complement in S without enlarging the error, provided the projection is nowhere dense (automatically true when S and K are disjoint). Under mild conditions on the pushforward measure of P by T, obtained via a measurable selector T, we derive a uniform lower bound. If this set is Ahlfors regular of dimension d, the error decays like the reciprocal of the d-th root of n and every constrained quantization dimension equals d. The two estimates coincide, giving the first complete dimension comparison formula for constrained quantization and closing the gap left by earlier self-similar examples by Pandey-Roychowdhury while extending classical unconstrained theory to closed constraints under mild geometric assumptions.</description>

      <title>On Pseudospectral Concentration for Rank-1 Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pseudospectral analysis serves as a powerful tool in matrix computation and the study of both linear and nonlinear dynamical systems. Among various numerical strategies, random sampling, especially in the form of rank-$1$ perturbations, offers a practical and computationally efficient approach. Moreover, due to invariance under unitary similarity, any complex matrix can be reduced to its upper triangular form, thereby simplifying the analysis. In this study. we develop a quantitative concentration theory for the pseudospectra of complex matrices under rank-$1$ random sampling perturbations, establishing a rigorous probabilistic framework for spectral characterization. First, for normal matrices, we derive a regular concentration inequality and demonstrate that the separation radius scales with the dimension as $\delta_d \sim 1/\sqrt{d}$. Next, for the equivalence class of nilpotent Jordan blocks, we exploit classical probabilistic tools, specifically, the Hanson-Wright concentration inequality and the Carbery-Wright anti-concentration inequality, to obtain singular concentration bounds, and demonstrate that the separation radius exhibits the same dimension-dependent scaling. This yields a singular pseudospectral concentration framework. Finally, observing that upper triangular Toeplitz matrices can be represented via the symbolic polynomials of nilpotent Jordan blocks, we employ partial fraction decomposition of rational functions to extend the singular framework to the equivalence class of upper triangular Toeplitz matrices.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Average Impulse Control with Mean Field Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes and provides explicit solutions for a long-term average impulse control problem with a specific mean-field interaction. The underlying process is a general one-dimensional diffusion with appropriate boundary behavior. The model is motivated by applications such the optimal long-term management of renewable natural resources and financial portfolio management. Each individual agent seeks to maximize the long-term average reward, which consists of a running reward and incomes from discrete impulses, where the unit intervention price depends on the market through a stationary supply rate. In a competitive market setting, we establish the existence of and explicitly characterize an equilibrium strategy within a large class of policies under mild conditions. Additionally, we formulate and solve the mean field control problem, in which agents cooperate with each other, aiming to realize a common maximal long-term average profit. To illustrate the theoretical results, we examine a stochastic logistic growth model and a population growth model in a stochastic environment with impulse control.</description>

Abstract: We consider the $d$-neighbor bootstrap percolation process on the $d$-dimensional torus, with vertex set $V=\{1,\cdots,n\}^d$ and edge set $\{xy:\sum_{i=1}^d|x_i-y_i (\text{mod} \; n)|=1\}$. We determine the percolation time up to a constant factor with high probability when the initial infection probability is in a certain range and the infection threshold is $d$, extending one of the two main theorems from Balister,Bollob{\'a}s, and Smith (2016) about the percolation time with the infection threshold equal to $2$ on the two-dimensional torus.</description>

      <title>Controlling the Flow: Stability and Convergence for Stochastic Gradient Descent with Decaying Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present article studies the minimization of convex, L-smooth functions defined on a separable real Hilbert space. We analyze regularized stochastic gradient descent (reg-SGD), a variant of stochastic gradient descent that uses a Tikhonov regularization with time-dependent, vanishing regularization parameter. We prove strong convergence of reg-SGD to the minimum-norm solution of the original problem without additional boundedness assumptions. Moreover, we quantify the rate of convergence and optimize the interplay between step-sizes and regularization decay. Our analysis reveals how vanishing Tikhonov regularization controls the flow of SGD and yields stable learning dynamics, offering new insights into the design of iterative algorithms for convex problems, including those that arise in ill-posed inverse problems. We validate our theoretical findings through numerical experiments on image reconstruction and ODE-based inverse problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14902v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show weak existence and uniqueness in law for a general class of stochastic differential equations in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\ge 1$, with prescribed sub-invariant measure $\widehat{\mu}$. The dispersion and drift coefficients of the stochastic differential equation are allowed to be degenerate and discontinuous, and locally unbounded, respectively. Uniqueness in law is obtained via $L^1(\mathbb{R}^d,\widehat{\mu})$-uniqueness in a subclass of continuous Markov processes, namely right processes that have $\widehat{\mu}$ as sub-invariant measure and have continuous paths for $\widehat{\mu}$-almost every starting point. Weak existence is obtained for a broader class via the martingale problem.</description>

      <title>Viscous shock fluctuations in KPZ</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study ``V-shaped'' solutions to the KPZ equation, those having opposite asymptotic slopes $\theta$ and $-\theta$, with $\theta&gt;0$, at positive and negative infinity, respectively. Answering a question of Janjigian, Rassoul-Agha, and Sepp\"al\"ainen, we show that the spatial increments of V-shaped solutions cannot be statistically stationary in time. This completes the classification of statistically time-stationary spatial increments for the KPZ equation by ruling out the last case left by those authors.
  To show that these V-shaped time-stationary measures do not exist, we study the location of the corresponding ``viscous shock,'' which, roughly speaking, is the location of the bottom of the V. We describe the limiting rescaled fluctuations, and in particular show that the fluctuations of the shock location are not tight, for both stationary and flat initial data. We also show that if the KPZ equation is started with V-shaped initial data, then the long-time limits of the time-averaged laws of the spatial increments of the solution are mixtures of the laws of the spatial increments of $x\mapsto B(x)+\theta x$ and $x\mapsto B(x)-\theta x$, where $B$ is a standard two-sided Brownian motion.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we compute the expected logarithmic energy of solutions to the polynomial eigenvalue problem for random matrices. We generalize some known results for the Shub-Smale polynomials, and the spherical ensemble. These two processes are the two extremal particular cases of the polynomial eigenvalue problem, and we prove that the logarithmic energy lies between these two cases. In particular, the roots of the Shub-Smale polynomials are the ones with the lowest logarithmic energy of the family.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that a suitably de-biased version of Chatterjee's rank correlation based on i.i.d. copies of a random vector $(X,Y)$ is asymptotically normal whenever $Y$ is not almost surely constant. No further conditions on the joint distribution of $X$ and $Y$ are required. We establish several results which allow us to extend convergence of the empirical process from one function class to larger function classes. These results are of independent interest, and can be used to investigate $V$-statistics and $V$-processes -- or, closely related, $U$-statistics and $U$-processes -- with dependent sample data. As an example, we use these results to prove weak convergence of $V$- and $U$-processes based on strongly mixing data. This implies a new limit theorem for $V$- and $U$-statistics of strongly mixing data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12944v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate stability of travelling wave solutions to a class of reaction-diffusion equations perturbed by infinite-dimensional additive noise with H\"older continuous paths, covering in particular fractional Brownian motion with general Hurst index. We obtain long- and short time asymptotic error bounds on the maximal distance from the solution of the stochastic reaction-diffusion equation to the orbit of travelling wave fronts. These bounds, in terms of Hurst index and H\"older exponent, apply to a large class of infinite-dimensional self-similar drivers with H\"older continuous paths, such as linear fractional stable motion. We find that for short times, higher Hurst indices imply higher stability, while for large times, a smaller gap between Hurst index and H\"older exponent implies stability for larger noise amplitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish three sets of approximation results: (a) bounds on the proximity of Poisson mixtures with infinitely divisible mixing distributions, (b) central limit theorems with explicit error bounds for sums of associated or negatively associated random variables which do not require boundedness of the underlying distributions, and (c) a Gaussian approximation theorem under a vanishing third moment condition. Each of these make use of the observation that size-biasing or zero-biasing an infinitely divisible random variable may be achieved by adding an independent increment, combined with tools from Stein's method for compound Poisson and Gaussian approximations. Applications include a Dickman-type limit theorem, simple random sampling and urn models with overflow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2011.06343v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The celebrated invariance property states that particles entering a bounded domain, with isotropic and uniform incidence, spend on average $\langle \ell \rangle=4V/S$ length inside, no matter how they scatter. We show that this remarkable property is merely the infinite-length limit of an even broader law: for any curves randomly placed and oriented in space -- stochastic or deterministic, generated by ballistic or diffusive dynamics, with possible stopping or branching, in two or more dimensions -- $ \displaystyle \frac{1}{\langle \ell \rangle}= \frac{1}{\langle L\rangle}+ \frac{1}{\langle \sigma \rangle} $, with $\langle\ell\rangle$ its mean in-domain path, $\langle L\rangle$ its mean total length, and $\langle\sigma\rangle$ the mean chord of the domain, a known geometric quantity related to the volume-to-surface ratio. Derived solely from the kinematic formula of integral geometry, the result is independent of step-length statistics, memory, absorption, and branching, making it equally relevant to photons in turbid tissue, active bacteria in micro-channels, cosmic rays in molecular clouds, or neutron chains in nuclear reactors. Monte-Carlo simulations spanning straight needles, Y-shapes, and isotropic random walks in 2D and 3D confirm the universality and demonstrate how a local measurement of $\langle \ell \rangle$ yields $\langle L\rangle$ without ever tracking the full trajectory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We rigorously study the relation between the training dynamics via stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and the spectra of empirical Hessian and gradient matrices. We prove that in two canonical classification tasks for multi-class high-dimensional mixtures and either 1 or 2-layer neural networks, both the SGD trajectory and emergent outlier eigenspaces of the Hessian and gradient matrices align with a common low-dimensional subspace. Moreover, in multi-layer settings this alignment occurs per layer, with the final layer's outlier eigenspace evolving over the course of training, and exhibiting rank deficiency when the SGD converges to sub-optimal classifiers. This establishes some of the rich predictions that have arisen from extensive numerical studies in the last decade about the spectra of Hessian and information matrices over the course of training in overparametrized networks.</description>

      <title>Finding planted cliques using gradient descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The planted clique problem is a paradigmatic model of statistical-to-computational gaps: the planted clique is information-theoretically detectable if its size $k\ge 2\log_2 n$ but polynomial-time algorithms only exist for the recovery task when $k= \Omega(\sqrt{n})$. By now, there are many algorithms that succeed as soon as $k = \Omega(\sqrt{n})$. Glaringly, however, no black-box optimization method, e.g., gradient descent or the Metropolis process, has been shown to work. In fact, Chen, Mossel, and Zadik recently showed that any Metropolis process whose state space is the set of cliques fails to find any sub-linear sized planted clique in polynomial time if initialized naturally from the empty set. We show that using the method of Lagrange multipliers, namely optimizing the Hamiltonian given by the sum of the objective function and the clique constraint over the space of all subgraphs, succeeds. In particular, we prove that Markov chains which minimize this Hamiltonian (gradient descent and a low-temperature relaxation of it) succeed at recovering planted cliques of size $k = \Omega(\sqrt{n})$ if initialized from the full graph. Importantly, initialized from the empty set, the relaxation still does not help the gradient descent find sub-linear planted cliques. We also demonstrate robustness of these Markov chain approaches under a natural contamination model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse a notion of $C^*$-independence for $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded $C^*$-algebras. We provide other notions of statistical independence for $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded von Neumann algebras and prove some relationships between them. We provide a characterization for the graded nuclearity property.</description>

      <title>On the Nonconvexity of Push-Forward Constraints and Its Consequences in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The push-forward operation enables one to redistribute a probability measure through a deterministic map. It plays a key role in statistics and optimization: many learning problems (notably from optimal transport, generative modeling, and algorithmic fairness) include constraints or penalties framed as push-forward conditions on the model. However, the literature lacks general theoretical insights on the (non)convexity of such constraints and its consequences on the associated learning problems. This paper aims at filling this gap. In the first part, we provide a range of sufficient and necessary conditions for the (non)convexity of two sets of functions: the maps transporting one probability measure to another and the maps inducing equal output distributions across distinct probability measures. This highlights that for most probability measures, these push-forward constraints are not convex. In the second part, we show how this result implies critical limitations on the design of convex optimization problems for learning generative models or groupwise fair predictors. This work will hopefully help researchers and practitioners have a better understanding of the critical impact of push-forward conditions onto convexity.</description>

      <title>IID Prophet Inequality with Random Horizon: Going Beyond Increasing Hazard Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11752v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prophet inequalities are a central object of study in optimal stopping theory. In the iid model, a gambler sees values in an online fashion, sampled independently from a given distribution. Upon observing each value, the gambler either accepts it as a reward or irrevocably rejects it and proceeds to observe the next value. The goal of the gambler, who cannot see the future, is maximising the expected value of the reward while competing against the expectation of a prophet (the offline maximum). In other words, one seeks to maximise the gambler-to-prophet ratio of the expectations.
  This model has been studied with infinite, finite and unknown number of values. When the gambler faces a random number of values, the model is said to have random horizon. We consider the model in which the gambler is given a priori knowledge of the horizon's distribution. Alijani et al. (2020) designed a single-threshold algorithm achieving a ratio of $1/2$ when the random horizon has an increasing hazard rate and is independent of the values. We prove that with a single threshold, a ratio of $1/2$ is actually achievable for several larger classes of horizon distributions, with the largest being known as the $\mathcal{G}$ class in reliability theory. Moreover, we show that this does not extend to its dual, the $\overline{\mathcal{G}}$ class (which includes the decreasing hazard rate class), while it can be extended to low-variance horizons. Finally, we construct the first example of a family of horizons, for which multiple thresholds are necessary to achieve a nonzero ratio. We establish that the Secretary Problem optimal stopping rule provides one such algorithm, paving the way towards the study of the model beyond single-threshold algorithms.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic modeling of car traffic accidents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00446v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a counting process to model the random occurrence in time of car traffic accidents, taking into account some aspects of the self-excitation typical of this phenomenon. By combining methods from probability and differential equations, we study this stochastic process in terms of its statistical moments and large-time trend. Moreover, we derive analytically the probability density functions of the times of occurrence of traffic accidents and of the time elapsing between two consecutive accidents. Finally, we demonstrate the suitability of our modelling approach by means of numerical simulations, which address also a comparison with real data of weekly trends of traffic accidents.</description>

      <title>Local geometry of high-dimensional mixture models: Effective spectral theory and dynamical transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the local geometry of empirical risks in high dimensions via the spectral theory of their Hessian and information matrices. We focus on settings where the data, $(Y_\ell)_{\ell =1}^n\in \mathbb R^d$, are i.i.d. draws of a $k$-component Gaussian mixture model, and the loss depends on the projection of the data into a fixed number of vectors, namely $\mathbf{x}^\top Y$, where $\mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^{d\times C}$ are the parameters, and $C$ need not equal $k$. This setting captures a broad class of problems such as classification by one and two-layer networks and regression on multi-index models. We prove exact formulas for the limits of the empirical spectral distribution and outlier eigenvalues and eigenvectors of such matrices in the proportional asymptotics limit, where the number of samples and dimension $n,d\to\infty$ and $n/d=\phi \in (0,\infty)$. These limits depend on the parameters $\mathbf{x}$ only through the summary statistic of the $(C+k)\times (C+k)$ Gram matrix of the parameters and class means, $\mathbf{G} = (\mathbf{x},\mathbf{\mu})^\top(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{\mu})$. It is known that under general conditions, when $\mathbf{x}$ is trained by stochastic gradient descent, the evolution of these same summary statistics along training converges to the solution of an autonomous system of ODEs, called the effective dynamics. This enables us to connect the spectral theory to the training dynamics. We demonstrate our general results by analyzing the effective spectrum along the effective dynamics in the case of multi-class logistic regression. In this setting, the empirical Hessian and information matrices have substantially different spectra, each with their own static and even dynamical spectral transitions.</description>

      <title>Random Variables, Conditional Independence and Categories of Abstract Sample Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two high-level "pictures" of probability theory have emerged: one that takes as central the notion of random variable, and one that focuses on distributions and probability channels (Markov kernels). While the channel-based picture has been successfully axiomatized, and widely generalized, using the notion of Markov category, the categorical semantics of the random variable picture remain less clear. Simpson's probability sheaves are a recent approach, in which probabilistic concepts like random variables are allowed vary over a site of sample spaces. Simpson has identified rich structure on these sites, most notably an abstract notion of conditional independence, and given examples ranging from probability over databases to nominal sets. We aim bring this development together with the generality and abstraction of Markov categories: We show that for any suitable Markov category, a category of sample spaces can be defined which satisfies Simpson's axioms, and that a theory of probability sheaves can be developed purely synthetically in this setting. We recover Simpson's examples in a uniform fashion from well-known Markov categories, and consider further generalizations.</description>

      <title>Community Detection on Noisy Stochastic Block Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of community recovery in geometrically-noised stochastic block models (SBM). This work presents two primary contributions: (1) Motif--Attention Spectral Operator (MASO), an attention-based spectral operator that improves upon traditional spectral methods; and (2) Iterative Geometric Denoising (GeoDe), a configurable denoising algorithm that boosts spectral clustering performance. We demonstrate that the fusion of GeoDe+MASO significantly outperforms existing community detection methods on noisy SBMs. Furthermore, we show that using GeoDe+MASO as a denoising step improves belief propagation's community recovery by 79.7% on the Amazon Metadata dataset.</description>
