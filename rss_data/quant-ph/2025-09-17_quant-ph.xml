      <title>Entanglement Suppression in Quantum Field Theories: Holography, Chaos, and Mixed-State Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has revealed that entanglement entropy growth in conformal field theories (CFTs) can be suppressed when a local operator quench interacts with a mixed-state excitation, providing a dual interpretation in terms of black hole scattering in AdS. This phenomenon, termed \emph{entanglement suppression}, opens several promising directions for exploration. In this proposal, I outline five distinct yet interconnected research trajectories: generalization to higher dimensions, the role of quantum chaos via out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), the absence of suppression in integrable models, the extension to entanglement negativity as a probe of mixedness, and a geometric interpretation based on scattering cross sections in AdS. Each direction offers new insights into the interplay between holography, non-equilibrium dynamics, and quantum information.</description>

      <title>The Emergence of Objective Classicality: A Computational First-Principles Study of Observer-Induced Decoherence in Unitary Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum measurement problem, the unresolved conflict between the unitary evolution of the wave function and the postulate of wave function collapse, remains the most profound conceptual challenge in quantum foundations. While environment-induced decoherence provides a compelling practical mechanism for the appearance of collapse, it does not resolve the fundamental issue of the observer's own quantum state. This work moves beyond philosophical discourse by introducing a novel computational framework to simulate a fully unitary universe comprising a quantum system (Q), a decohering environment (E), and a model physical observer (O). We strictly forbid the collapse axiom. Our simulations investigate whether a definite, classical measurement outcome can emerge objectively within O's state. The results demonstrate that objective classicality can emerge from unitary dynamics, challenging the necessity of the measurement postulate and providing a computational pathway toward resolving the quantum measurement problem.</description>

      <title>Privacy in continuous-variable distributed quantum sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can a distributed network of quantum sensors estimate a global parameter while protecting every locally encoded value? We answer this question affirmatively by introducing and analysing a protocol for distributed quantum sensing in the continuous-variable regime. We consider a multipartite network in which each node encodes a local phase into a shared entangled Gaussian state. We show that the average phase can be estimated with high precision, exhibiting Heisenberg scaling in the total photon number, while individual phases are inaccessible. Although complete privacy - where all other combinations of phases remain entirely hidden - is unattainable for finite squeezing in multi-party settings, it emerges in the large-squeezing limit. We further investigate the impact of displacements and optical losses, revealing trade-offs between estimation accuracy and privacy. Finally, we benchmark the protocol against other continuous-variable resource states.</description>

      <title>Exact Coset Sampling for Quantum Lattice Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a simple, fully correct, and assumption-light replacement for the contested "domain-extension" in Step 9 of a recent windowed-QFT lattice algorithm with complex-Gaussian windows~\citep{chen2024quantum}. The published Step~9 suffers from a periodicity/support mismatch. We present a pair-shift difference construction that coherently cancels all unknown offsets, produces an exact uniform CRT-coset state over $\mathbb{Z}_{P}$, and then uses the QFT to enforce the intended modular linear relation. The unitary is reversible, uses $\mathrm{poly}(\log M_2)$ gates, and preserves the algorithm's asymptotics. Project Page: https://github.com/yifanzhang-pro/quantum-lattice.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and optimization within autoregressive neural quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) are powerful variational ans\"atze capable of representing highly entangled quantum many-body wavefunctions. While the average entanglement properties of ensembles of restricted Boltzmann machines are well understood, the entanglement structure of autoregressive NQS such as recurrent neural networks and transformers remains largely unexplored. We perform large-scale simulations of ensembles of random autoregressive wavefunctions for chains of up to $256$ spins and uncover signatures of transitions in their average entanglement scaling, entanglement spectra, and correlation functions. We show that the standard softmax normalization of the wavefunction suppresses entanglement and fluctuations, and introduce a square modulus normalization function that restores them. Finally, we connect the insights gained from our entanglement and activation function analysis to initialization strategies for finding the ground states of strongly correlated Hamiltonians via variational Monte Carlo.</description>

      <title>Efficient Entanglement Purification Circuit Design for Dual-Species Atom Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement purification protocols (EPPs) are essential for generating high-fidelity entangled states in noisy quantum systems, enabling robust quantum networking and computation. Building on the circuit of the foundational recurrence protocol, we generalize two-way EPPs to arbitrary stabilizer codes. Through analytical derivations and noisy circuit simulations incorporating circuit-level noise, we demonstrate enhanced purification performance, with fidelity improvements and finite distillation rates for distillable input states. We propose efficient circuit designs for EPPs tailored to dual-species Rydberg atom arrays, leveraging species-specific laser control and interspecies Rydberg interactions. Introducing a low-overhead operation set, the dual-species atom convenient operation set, we facilitate straightforward compilation of EPP circuits without the need for ancillary atoms or complex atom rearrangements. Our framework provides practical guidance for near-term implementations on dual-species platforms, advancing towards scalable entanglement distribution in neutral atom systems and paving the way for fault-tolerant quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Efficient Privacy-Preserving Training of Quantum Neural Networks by Using Mixed States to Represent Input Data Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are gaining increasing interest due to their potential to detect complex patterns in data by leveraging uniquely quantum phenomena. This makes them particularly promising for biomedical applications. In these applications and in other contexts, increasing statistical power often requires aggregating data from multiple participants. However, sharing data, especially sensitive information like personal genomic sequences, raises significant privacy concerns. Quantum federated learning offers a way to collaboratively train QNN models without exposing private data. However, it faces major limitations, including high communication overhead and the need to retrain models when the task is modified. To overcome these challenges, we propose a privacy-preserving QNN training scheme that utilizes mixed quantum states to encode ensembles of data. This approach allows for the secure sharing of statistical information while safeguarding individual data points. QNNs can be trained directly on these mixed states, eliminating the need to access raw data. Building on this foundation, we introduce protocols supporting multi-party collaborative QNN training applicable across diverse domains. Our approach enables secure QNN training with only a single round of communication per participant, provides high training speed and offers task generality, i.e., new analyses can be conducted without reacquiring information from participants. We present the theoretical foundation of our scheme's utility and privacy protections, which prevent the recovery of individual data points and resist membership inference attacks as measured by differential privacy. We then validate its effectiveness on three different datasets with a focus on genomic studies with an indication of how it can used in other domains without adaptation.</description>

      <title>Enlarging the GKP stabilizer group for enhanced noise protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Encoding a qubit in a larger Hilbert space of an oscillator is an efficient way to protect its quantum information against decoherence. Promising examples of such bosonic encodings are the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes. In this work, we investigate how redefining the stabilizer group of the GKP codes to include all operations with trivial action on the code space can contribute to the search for an optimal implementation of a logical circuit when it is affected by noise. We find the generators of the Gaussian stabilizer group, allowing us to search for different physical implementations of a Clifford operation. We then propose an algorithm that finds the optimal implementation of a given logical Clifford circuit on GKP codes, such that the state is less affected by loss errors during the computation. Finally, we demonstrate numerically, with logical randomized benchmarking, that such a compiler can increase the lifetime of square-GKP qubits while running Clifford circuits, compared to a random walk compiler.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) to Simulate Large Atomistic Systems for Fidelity Improvement of Superconducting Qubits and Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials engineering using atomistic modeling is an essential tool for the development of qubits and quantum sensors. Traditional density-functional theory (DFT) does however not adequately capture the complete physics involved, including key aspects and dynamics of superconductivity, surface states, etc. There are also significant challenges regarding the system sizes that can be simulated, not least for thermal properties which are key in quantum-computing applications. The QuantumATK tool combines DFT, based on LCAO basis sets, with non-equilibrium Green's functions, to compute the characteristics of interfaces between superconductors and insulators, as well as the surface states of topological insulators. Additionally, the software leverages machine-learned force-fields to simulate thermal properties and to generate realistic amorphous geometries in large-scale systems. Finally, the description of superconducting qubits and sensors as two-level systems modeled with a double-well potential requires many-body physics, and this paper demonstrates how electron-electron interaction can be added to the single-particle energy levels from an atomistic tight-binding model to describe a realistic double-quantum dot system.</description>

      <title>Pulsed Generation of Continuous-Variable Cluster States in a Phononic Quantum Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cluster states are multipartite entangled states that are maximally connected and resilient to decoherence, making them valuable resources for quantum information processing. Continuous-variable (CV) cluster states have been extensively investigated for such applications. Here we present a pulsed protocol for generating CV cluster states in a phononic quantum network composed of phonon waveguides, mechanical resonators, and optical cavities. A key feature of this architecture is the modular design, where pairs of mechanical modes act as building blocks with only local, tunable interactions between mechanical and cavity modes. The scheme is scalable, requiring just $4N$ driving tones for $N$ mechanical resonators. We characterize the resulting cluster states by evaluating the nullifiers of the CV modes. We also study the effects of dissipation, showing that strong squeezing with large phonon occupations can degrade the generated cluster states under finite mechanical and optical losses. As a direct application, we demonstrate that distant mechanical modes can be entangled via local measurements.</description>

      <title>Toward Heisenberg Scaling in Non-Hermitian Metrology at the Quantum Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum metrology, an emerging field at the intersection of quantum estimation and non-Hermitian physics, holds promise for revolutionizing precision measurement. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of non-Hermitian quantum parameter estimation in the quantum regime, with a special focus on achieving Heisenberg scaling. We introduce a concise expression for the quantum Fisher information (QFI) that applies to general non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, enabling the analysis of estimation precision in these systems. Our findings unveil the remarkable potential of non-Hermitian systems to attain the Heisenberg scaling of $1/t$, where $t$ represents time. Moreover, we derive optimal measurement conditions based on the proposed QFI expression, demonstrating the attainment of the quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound. By constructing non-unitary evolutions governed by two non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, one with parity-time symmetry and the other without specific symmetries, we experimentally validate our theoretical analysis. The experimental results affirm the realization of Heisenberg scaling in estimation precision, marking a substantial milestone in non-Hermitian quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Erasing, Converting, and Communicating: The Power of Resource-Nongenerating Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate resource nongenerating operations (RNOs) in both static and dynamical quantum resource theories. For the static scenarios, we derive a sufficient condition for state transformations under RNOs. Then we construct a dynamical resource theory where RNOs constitute the set of free operations, and we propose an axiomatic approach to quantify quantum channels. We further analyze the erasure of the dynamical resources. As applications, we establish bounds on the asymptotic cost of states under RNOs in a generic convex resource theory and obtain capacity bounds for communication tasks assisted by dynamical coherence. Our results clarify the key roles of RNOs in quantum information processing tasks.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer Perturbation Theory: A Systematic Construction via Schrieffer-Wolff Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perturbation theories provide valuable insights on quantum many-body systems. Systems of interacting particles, like electrons, are often treated perturbatively around exactly solvable Gaussian points. Systems of interacting qubits have gained increasing prominence as another class of models for quantum systems thanks to the recent advances in experimentally realizing mesoscopic quantum devices. Stabilizer states, innately defined on systems of qudits, have correspondingly emerged as another class of classically simulatable starting point for the study of quantum error-correcting codes and topological phases of matter in such devices. As a step towards analyzing more general quantum many-body problems on these platforms, we develop a systematic stabilizer perturbation theory in qubit systems. Our approach relies on the local Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, which we show can be efficiently performed through the binary encoding the Pauli algebra. As demonstrations, we first benchmark the stabilizer perturbation theory on the transverse field Ising chain in one dimension. The method is then further applied to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric code on square lattice and kagome lattice to probe the tendency toward confinement for anyonic excitations.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Modified Nonequilibrium Fermi's Golden Rule Rate Coefficients from Cavity-Free Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nonequilibrium Fermi's Golden Rule (NE-FGR) provides a convenient theoretical framework for calculating the charge transfer rate between a photoexcited bright donor electronic state and a dark acceptor electronic state, when the nuclear degrees of freedom start out in a nonequilibrium initial state. In this paper, we show that NE-FGR rates can be significantly modified by placing the molecular system inside an electromagnetic microcavity, even when the coupling with the cavity modes is weak. In this case, cavity-modified NE-FGR rates can also be estimated from the same inputs needed for calculating the cavity-free NE-FGR rates, thereby bypassing the need for an explicit simulation of the molecular system inside the cavity. We also introduce an approximate limit of the cavity-modified NE-FGR, which we denote cavity-modified Instantaneous Marcus Theory, since it is based on the same assumptions underlying Marcus theory. The utility of the proposed framework for calculating cavity-modified NE-FGR rates is demonstrated by applications to photo-induced charge transfer in the carotenoid-porphyrin-C$_{60}$ molecular triad dissolved in liquid tetrahydrofuran and the Garg-Onuchic-Ambegaokar model for charge transfer in the condensed phase.</description>

      <title>EmuPlat: A Framework-Agnostic Platform for Quantum Hardware Emulation with Validated Transpiler-to-Pulse Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present EmuPlat, a framework-agnostic quantum hardware emulation platform that addresses the interoperability gap between high-level quantum programming frameworks and hardware-specific pulse control systems. Unlike existing solutions that operate within isolated software stacks, EmuPlat provides a unified infrastructure enabling seamless integration across diverse quantum computing ecosystems, including CUDA-Q, Qiskit, and Qibolab. The platform implements a complete transpiler-compiler pipeline that systematically transforms abstract quantum circuits through four validated stages: (1) recursive gate decomposition to a minimal native set $\mathcal{G}_{\text{native}} = \{I, Z, RZ(\theta), \text{GPI2}(\phi), CZ, M\}$, (2) virtual Z optimization implementing phase tracking without physical pulses, (3) connectivity-aware routing with automated SWAP insertion, and (4) deterministic pulse compilation respecting hardware timing constraints. Our modular architecture, based on clean architecture principles with a novel adapter pattern, supports extensible integration of multiple quantum dynamics simulation engines while maintaining consistent interfaces. We demonstrate EmuPlat's capabilities through comprehensive benchmarks on superconducting transmon architectures: Bell state preparation achieves 99.958\% fidelity with hardware-calibrated noise models, while 4-qubit Quantum Fourier Transform implementations successfully demonstrate scalable circuit execution. The platform's production-ready implementation, validated through end-to-end testing with TransformationValidator, establishes EmuPlat as essential infrastructure for accelerating hybrid quantum-classical algorithm development and hardware-software co-design.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian amplitude damping in a central spin model with random couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Markovian dynamics is central to quantum information processing, as memory effects strongly influence coherence preservation, metrology, and communication. In this work, we investigate the role of stochastic system--bath couplings in shaping non-Markovian behavior of open quantum systems, using the central spin model within a time-convolutionless master equation framework. We show that the character of the reduced dynamics depends jointly on the intrinsic memory of the environment and on the structure of the system--environment interaction. In certain regimes, the dynamics simplify to pure dephasing, while in general both amplitude damping and dephasing contribute to the evolution. By employing two complementary measures: the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) flow and the Breuer--Laine--Piilo (BLP) measure, we demonstrate that QFI flow may fail to witness memory effects in weak-coupling and near-resonant regimes, whereas the BLP measure still detects information backflow. Furthermore, external modulation of the interaction kernel produces qualitatively richer behavior, including irregular and frequency-dependent revivals of non-Markovianity. These results clarify the physical origin of memory effects, highlight the limitations of single-witness approaches, and suggest that stochasticity and modulation can be harnessed to engineer robust, noise-resilient quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Sample-optimal single-copy quantum state tomography via shallow depth measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is one of the fundamental problems in quantum information. Among various metrics, sample complexity is widely used to evaluate QST algorithms. While multi-copy measurements are known to achieve optimal sample complexity, they are challenging to implement on near-term quantum devices. In practice, single-copy measurements with shallow-depth circuits are more feasible. Although a near-optimal QST algorithm under single-qubit measurements has recently been proposed, its sample complexity does not match the known lower bound for single-copy measurements. Here, we make two contributions by employing circuits with depth $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ on an $n$-qubit system. First, QST for rank-$r$ $d$-dimensional state $\rho$ can be achieved with sample complexity $\mathcal{O}\!\left(\tfrac{dr^2 \ln d}{\epsilon^2}\right)$ to error $\epsilon$ in trace distance, which is near-optimal up to a $\ln d$ factor compared to the known lower bound $\Omega\left(\frac{dr^2}{\epsilon^2}\right)$. Second, for the general case of $r = d$, we can remove the $\ln d$ factor, yielding an optimal sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}\!\left(\frac{d^3}{\epsilon^2}\right)$.</description>

      <title>Ancilla-train quantum algorithm for simulating non-Markovian open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for simulating open quantum systems coupled to Gaussian environments valid for any configuration and coupling strength. The algorithm is for instance applicable to problems with strongly coupled, or non-Markovian, environments; problems with multiple environments out of mutual equilibrium; and problems with time-dependent Hamiltonians. We show that the algorithm can reproduce the true dynamics of such problems at arbitrary accuracy and, for a broad range of problems, only adds a minor resource cost relative to Trotterized time evolution; the cost is polynomial in the inverse target accuracy. The algorithm is based on the insight that any Gaussian environment can be represented as a train of ancillary qubits that sequentially interact with the system through a time-local coupling, given by the convolution square root of the bath correlation function; this is a secondary result of our work. Our results open up new applications of quantum computers for efficient simulation of non-equilibrium and open quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive simulation-based analysis of optical pilot tone generation for local oscillator synchronization in continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) systems using Gaussian-modulated (GM) coherent states. We compare system performance when the pilot tone is generated either electrically or optically, examining the effects of key parameters such as pilot tone power, laser linewidth, digital-to-analog converter resolution, and link distance. The results provide insights into pilot tone generation strategies that enhance robustness while reducing the implementation complexity of GM CV-QKD systems</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce RandomMeas.jl, a modular and high-performance open-source software package written in Julia for implementing and analyzing randomized measurement protocols in quantum computing. Randomized measurements provide a powerful framework for extracting properties of quantum states and processes such as expectation values, entanglement, and fidelities using simple experimental procedures combined with classical post-processing, most prominently via the classical shadow formalism. RandomMeas.jl covers the full randomized measurement workflow, from the generation of measurement settings for use on a quantum computer, the optional classical simulation of randomized measurements with tensor networks, to a suite of estimators for physical properties based on classical shadows. The package includes advanced features such as robust and shallow shadow techniques, batch estimators, and built-in statistical uncertainty estimation. Its unified, composable design enables the scalable application and further development of randomized measurements protocols across theoretical and experimental contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floquet modulations often yield effective Hamiltonians not easily accessible in traditional time-dependent systems, which brings opportunities for exploring novel physics of quantum dynamics. We investigate a Floquet system exhibiting translational symmetry at any fixed time but the spatial periodicity is time-dependent. Such a system is a natural platform for studying thermalization and novel dynamical structures. We find that the single-particle Hilbert space spontaneously develops a structure of a two-level subsystem and the rest part forms a bath. The dynamic process is analyzed perturbatively within the two-level subsystem as well as numerical solutions, exhibiting stable time-evolutions. These results enrich our understanding of Floquet thermalization without definite spatial periodicity, which brings hints for exploring many-body physics such as scar states.</description>

      <title>Designing Shadow Tomography Protocols by Natural Language Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum circuits form a foundational framework in quantum science, enabling the description, analysis, and implementation of quantum computations. However, designing efficient circuits, typically constructed from single- and two-qubit gates, remains a major challenge for specific computational tasks. In this work, we introduce a novel artificial intelligence-driven protocol for quantum circuit design, benchmarked using shadow tomography for efficient quantum state readout. Inspired by techniques from natural language processing (NLP), our approach first selects a compact gate dictionary by optimizing the entangling power of two-qubit gates. We identify the iSWAP gate as a key element that significantly enhances sample efficiency, resulting in a minimal gate set of {I, SWAP, iSWAP}. Building on this, we implement a recurrent neural network trained via reinforcement learning to generate high-performing quantum circuits. The trained model demonstrates strong generalization ability, discovering efficient circuit architectures with low sample complexity beyond the training set. Our NLP-inspired framework offers broad potential for quantum computation, including extracting properties of logical qubits in quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Generalised two-dimensional nonlinear oscillator with a position-dependent effective mass and the thermodynamic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a two-dimensional nonlinear oscillator with a position-dependent effective mass in the framework of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. Using the Nikiforov-Uvarov method, we obtain exact analytical expressions for the energy spectrum and wave functions. Based on the canonical partition function, we derive key thermodynamic quantities, including internal energy, specific heat, free energy, and entropy. Our results show that, unlike the one-dimensional case, where the specific heat is unaffected by the nonlinearity parameter $k$, the two-dimensional system exhibits a strong $k-$dependence. At high temperatures, the specific heat becomes temperature-independent for fixed values of $k$, in line with the Dulong-Petit law. However, these behaviors occur only for negative values of $k$. These findings highlight the impact of effective mass nonlinearity on macroscopic thermodynamic quantities and suggest that tuning the parameter $k$ could serve as an effective strategy for enhancing the performance of quantum devices, including thermal machines and optoelectronic components.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the phase-mismatch effect in non-resonant four-wave mixing enabled by optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-mismatch in nonlinear optical processes can severely limit the propagation and conversion efficiency of light fields. Here, we present an efficient optimal-control strategy to mitigate the detrimental effects of phase-mismatch in an electromagnetically induced transparency medium via non-resonant four-wave mixing (FWM). By applying a set of fixed, linearly modulated coupling fields that induce a dark eigenmode, we globally optimize a single coupling detuning to minimize the spontaneous emission loss, the primary factor limiting conversion efficiency. Our approach outperforms existing FWM schemes by providing strong robustness against large phase-mismatch variations while maintaining efficient probe-to-signal conversion. These results offer a promising route toward more efficient nonlinear frequency conversion, alleviating the stringent requirement for phase matching in experiments.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Control Hierarchy: When Physics-Informed Design Meets Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address a wide spectrum of quantum control strategies, including various open-loop protocols and advanced adaptive methods. These methodologies apply to few-qubit scenarios and naturally scale to larger N-qubit systems. We benchmark them across fundamental quantum tasks: entanglement preservation/generation, and directed quantum transport in a disordered quantum walk. All simulations are performed in a challenging environment featuring non-Markov colored noise, imperfections, and the Markov Lindblad equation. With a complex task-dependent performance hierarchy, our deterministic protocols proved highly effective for entanglement generation/preservation, and in specific pulse configurations, they even outperformed the RL-optimization. In contrast, more advanced methods demonstrate a marked specialization. For entanglement preservation, a physics-informed hybrid Quantum Error Correction and Dynamical Decoupling (QEC-DD) protocol provides the most stable and effective solution, outperforming all other approaches. Conversely, for dynamic tasks requiring the discovery of non-trivial control sequences, such as DD, Floquet engineering, and rapid entanglement generation or coherent transport, the model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents consistently find superior solutions. We further demonstrate that the control pulse envelope is a non-trivial factor that actively shapes the control landscape, which determines the difficulty for all protocols and highlights the adaptability of the RL agent. We conclude that no single strategy is universally dominant. A clear picture emerges: the future of high-fidelity quantum control lies in a synthesis of physics-informed design, as exemplified by robust hybrid methods, and the specialized, high-performance optimization power of adaptive machine learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamics of quantum analogs of classical impact oscillators to explore how complex nonlinear behaviors manifest in quantum systems. While classical impact oscillators exhibit chaos and bifurcations, quantum systems, governed by linear equations, appear to forbid such dynamics. Through simulations of unforced, forced, and dissipative quantum oscillators, we uncover quasiperiodicity, strange nonchaotic dynamics, and even chaos in the presence of dissipation. Using entropy time series, Fourier spectra, OTOCs, Lyapunov analysis, and the 0-1 test, we demonstrate that quantum systems can exhibit rich dynamical signatures analogous to classical nonlinear systems, bridging quantum mechanics and chaos theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uniqueness of purifications of quantum states on a system $A$ up to local unitary transformations on a purifying system $B$ is central to quantum information theory. We show that, if the two systems are modelled by commuting von Neumann algebras $M_A$ and $M_B$ on a Hilbert space $\mathcal H$, then uniqueness of purifications is equivalent to Haag duality $M_A = M_B'$. In particular, the uniqueness of purifications can fail in systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom -- even when $M_A$ and $M_B$ are commuting factors that jointly generate $B(\mathcal H)$ and hence allow for local tomography of all density matrices on $\mathcal H$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximizing the computational utility of near-term quantum processors requires predictive noise models that inform robust, noise-aware compilation and error mitigation. Conventional models often fail to capture the complex error dynamics of real hardware or require prohibitive characterization overhead. We introduce a data-efficient, machine learning-based framework to construct accurate, parameterized noise models for superconducting quantum processors. Our approach circumvents costly characterization protocols by learning hardware-specific error parameters directly from the measurement data of existing application and benchmark circuits. The generality and robustness of the framework are demonstrated through comprehensive benchmarking across multiple quantum devices and algorithms. Crucially, we show that a model trained exclusively on small-scale circuits accurately predicts the behavior of larger validation circuits. Our data-efficient approach achieves up to a 65% improvement in model fidelity quantified by the Hellinger distance between predicted and experimental circuit output distributions, compared to standard noise models derived from device properties. This work establishes a practical paradigm for noise characterization, providing a crucial tool for developing more effective noise-aware compilation and error-mitigation strategies.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating Quantum Computers into High Performance Computing (HPC) environments (commonly referred to as HPC+QC integration) marks a pivotal step in advancing computational capabilities for scientific research. Here we report the integration of a superconducting 20-qubit quantum computer into the HPC infrastructure at Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (LRZ), one of the first practical implementations of its kind. This yielded four key lessons: (1) quantum computers have stricter facility requirements than classical systems, yet their deployment in HPC environments is feasible when preceded by a rigorous site survey to ensure compliance; (2) quantum computers are inherently dynamic systems that require regular recalibration that is automatic and controllable by the HPC scheduler; (3) redundant power and cooling infrastructure is essential; and (4) effective hands-on onboarding should be provided for both quantum experts and new users. The identified conclusions provide a roadmap to guide future HPC center integrations.</description>

      <title>Towards Universal Quantum Tamper Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tamper-resilient cryptography studies how to protect data against adversaries who can physically manipulate codewords before they are decoded. The notion of tamper detection codes formalizes this goal, requiring that any unauthorized modification be detected with high probability. Classical results, starting from Jafargholi and Wichs (TCC 2015), established the existence of such codes against very large families of tampering functions, subject to structural restrictions ruling out identity and constant maps. Recent works of Boddu and Kapshikar (Quantum, 7) and Bergamaschi (Eurocrypt 2024) have extended these ideas to quantum adversaries, but only consider unitary tampering families.
  In this work, we give the first general treatment of tamper detection against arbitrary quantum maps. We show that Haar-random encoding schemes achieve exponentially small soundness error against any adversarial family whose size, Kraus rank, and entanglement fidelity obey natural constraints, which are direct quantum analogues of restrictions in the classical setting. Our results unify and extend previous works. Beyond this, we demonstrate a fundamental separation between classical and quantum tamper detection. Classically, relaxed tamper detection which allows either rejection or recovery of the original message cannot protect even against the family of constant functions. This family is of size $2^n$. In contrast, we show that quantum encodings can handle this obstruction, and we conjecture and provide evidence that they may in fact provide relaxed tamper detection and non-malleable security against any family of quantum maps of size up to $2^{2^{\alpha n}}$ for any constant $\alpha &lt;\frac{1}{2}$, leading to a conjecture on the existence of universal quantum tamper detection. Our results provide the first evidence that quantum tamper detection is strictly more powerful than its classical counterpart.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the sign problem by quantum computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notorious sign problem severely limits the applicability of quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, as statistical errors grow exponentially with system size and inverse temperature. A recent proposal of a quantum-computing stochastic series expansion (qc-SSE) method suggested that the problem could be avoided by introducing constant energy shifts into the Hamiltonian. Here we critically examine this framework and show that it does not strictly resolve the sign problem for Hamiltonians with non-commuting terms. Instead, it provides a practical mitigation strategy that suppresses the occurrence of negative weights. Using the antiferromagnetic anisotropic XY chain as a test case, we analyze the dependence of the average sign on system size, temperature, anisotropy, and shift parameters. An operator contraction method is introduced to improve efficiency. Our results demonstrate that moderate shifts optimally balance sign mitigation and statistical accuracy, while large shifts amplify errors, leaving the sign problem unresolved but alleviated.</description>

      <title>Slice-Wise Initial State Optimization to Improve Cost and Accuracy of the VQE on Lattice Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an optimization method for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) that combines adaptive and physics-inspired ansatz design. Instead of optimizing multiple layers simultaneously, the ansatz is built incrementally from its operator subsets, enabling subspace optimization that provides better initialization for subsequent steps. This quasi-dynamical approach preserves expressivity and hardware efficiency while avoiding the overhead of operator selection associated with adaptive methods. Benchmarks on one- and two-dimensional Heisenberg and Hubbard models with up to 20 qubits show improved fidelities, reduced function evaluations, or both, compared to fixed-layer VQE. The method is simple, cost-effective, and particularly well-suited for current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.</description>

      <title>Resource-efficient entanglement detection in high-dimensional states via two-qubit witnesses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an efficient method for detecting entanglement in high-dimensional two-qudit states by mapping the Hilbert space onto the space of two qubits. This transformation enables the use of well-established two-qubit entanglement witnesses. The proposed approach is not restricted to any specific class of states, successfully identifies a vast majority of pure entangled states, and requires a number of measurements that does not increase with the dimensionality of the qudits. The method demonstrates solid sensitivity when applied to two notable classes of states, incomplete-permutation-symmetric states and random pure states mixed with white noise, and is shown to be feasible with current experimental techniques.</description>

      <title>Certifying bipartite entangled states with few local measurements: from separable stabilizers to applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show a simple and systematic way to certify any given bipartite state as the unique joint $1$-eigenstate of two separable projectors, each of which can be measured with simple local observables. This is practically useful, as the detection probabilities of the two stabilizer projectors relate directly to the fidelity of certification. The same result gives a simple and effective lower bound on the entanglement fidelity of a quantum channel in terms of two ensemble fidelities.
  We then generalise the bipartite result recursively to multipartite systems, showing that every $n$-party pure state is the unique joint $1$-eigenstate of $2^{n-1}$ separable projectors, and an upper bound of the infidelity of the state in terms of the infidelities of the separable stabilizer projectors.</description>

      <title>Steady-state entanglement of spin qubits mediated by non-reciprocal and chiral magnons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum system in which a magnet supporting non-reciprocal magnons, chiral magnons, or both mediates the dissipative and unidirectional coupling of spin qubits. By driving the qubits, the steady state of this qubit-qubit coupling scheme becomes the maximally entangled Bell state. We devise a protocol where the system converges to this entangled state and benchmark it including qubit decay and dephasing. The protocol is numerically tested on a hybrid system consisting of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers coupled to magnon surface modes of an yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film. We show that the dephasing time of the NV centers forms the bottleneck for achieving the entanglement of NV centers separated by a distance exceeding microns. Our findings identify the key technological requirements and demonstrate a viable route toward steady-state entanglement of solid-state spins over distances of several microns using magnonic quantum networks, expanding the toolbox of magnonics for quantum information purposes.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Variational Quantum Eigensolver: Escaping Barren Plateaus through Staircase Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Cyclic Variational Quantum Eigensolver (CVQE), a hardware-efficient framework for accurate ground-state quantum simulation on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. CVQE departs from conventional VQE by incorporating a measurement-driven feedback cycle: Slater determinants with significant sampling probability are iteratively added to the reference superposition, while a fixed entangler (e.g., single-layer UCCSD) is reused throughout. This adaptive reference growth systematically enlarges the variational space in most promising directions, avoiding manual ansatz or operator-pool design, costly searches, and preserving compile-once circuits. The strategy parallels multi-reference methods in quantum chemistry, while remaining fully automated on quantum hardware. Remarkably, CVQE exhibits a distinctive staircase-like descent pattern, where successive energy drops sharply signal efficient escape from barren plateaus. Benchmarks show that CVQE consistently maintains chemical precision across correlation regimes, outperforms fixed UCCSD by several orders of magnitude, and achieves favorable accuracy-cost trade-offs compared to the Selected Configuration Interaction. These results position CVQE as a scalable, interpretable, and resource-efficient paradigm for near-term quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Real-time vacuum-state quantum random number generator on a chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum random number generators (QRNGs) produce true random numbers, which are guaranteed by the fundamental principles of quantum physics. Miniaturization of QRNGs is crucial for a wide range of communication and cryptography applications. Here, we first report a fully functional QRNG chip based on vacuum-state fluctuations, with dimensions of 16.6 mm x 7.8 mm. The quantum entropy source, which is achieved via hybrid photonic integration with a SiO2 waveguide, generates raw quantum random numbers. The hybrid photonic and electrical components are assembled into a compact ceramic package using system-in-package technology. A microcontroller unit acquires the raw data and outputs the processed quantum random numbers via a serial peripheral interface. According to the characterization results, the QRNG chip achieves a constant real-time output rate of 5.2 Mbps across the industrial temperature range of -40{\deg}C to 85{\deg}C, making it suitable for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast non-adiabatic molecular energy conversion into photons induced by quantized electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular polaritons within the mid-infrared regime have emerged as a source for modifying and manipulating molecular and photonic properties. However, the development of new methodologies for photon generation is still a challenge in nanophotonics. We propose a molecular model based on the Holstein-quantum-Rabi Hamiltonian, which also incorporates realistic dipole moments and non-adiabatic couplings among electronic excited states, to study the ultrafast photodynamics of diatomic molecules in confined electromagnetic fields within quantized cavities. In addition to vibronic transitions due to intrinsic non-adiabatic couplings, two types of light-induced crossings emerge: one type is located at molecular nuclear geometries where the rotating wave approximation is fulfilled, and another type appears at different geometries where counter-rotating transitions may occur. We make a comprehensive study of polariton photodynamics within a time window of a few tens of femtoseconds, where dissipative mechanisms do not influence the polariton photodynamics. We stress the dramatic change of the polariton energy spectrum as a function of the Huang-Rhys factor when non-adiabatic couplings are included in the model. We conclude that both the molecular non-adiabatic couplings and, more specifically, the counter-rotating couplings in the cavity-molecule interaction play a crucial role in converting vibronic energy into photons through excited dressed states. We also show that the sign of the Huang-Rhys factor has a significant impact on this photon conversion. Our work paves the way for the development of many-photon generation powered by strong light-matter interaction, along with potential applications using alkaline earth monohydride molecules.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of a Logical Architecture Uniting Motion and In-Place Entanglement: Shor's Algorithm, Constant-Depth CNOT Ladder, and Many-Hypercube Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Logical qubits are considered an essential component for achieving utility-scale quantum computation. Multiple recent demonstrations of logical qubits on neutral atoms have relied on coherent qubit motion into entangling zones. However, this architecture requires motion prior to every entangling gate, incurring significant cost in wall clock runtime and motion-related error accumulation. We propose and experimentally realize an alternative architecture which unites qubit motion and in-place entanglement via nearest-neighbor gates. Our approach maintains all-to-all connectivity, while minimizing qubit motion overheads. We demonstrate three key results on Infleqtion's Sqale QPU, which hosts an array of 114 neutral atom qubits. First, we perform a logical qubit realization of a pre-compiled variant of Shor's Algorithm. We find better logical-than-physical performance over a range of settings including with loss correction and leakage detection. Second, we introduce a technique for performing CNOT ladders with depth independent of both the number of logical qubits N and the code distance d. In proof-of-principle experiments with 8 and 12 logical qubits, we find ~4x reduction in error via the logical encodings. Third, we experimentally realize initialization of the [[16, 4, 4]] many-hypercube QEC code. All three results benefit from optimized compilation via Superstaq, as well as our underlying architecture uniting motion and in-place entanglement. This architecture offers a path to reducing the overhead of utility-scale quantum applications relative to architectures based on entangling zones.</description>

      <title>A Robust Modular Quantum Processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the concept of redundancy of critical elements in a quantum computing architecture to circumvent disruption of quantum operations due to a failure of such an element, for example, from a catastrophic cosmic ray event. We illustrate this concept with reference to a recently proposed superconducting modular quantum architecture with a star-like configuration, which has a router at the center that enables superconducting qubit interactions across various modules. Regarding this router as a vital element, we propose a double-star configuration, where a loss of one router is backed by the second one. We also examine the usefulness of this double-star configuration under normal conditions, namely, when the quantum hardware has been rendered safe against cosmic rays due to other mitigating actions like shielding or movement to an underground facility. Simultaneous two qubit-pair interactions like two simultaneous CZ gates and multiqubit gates like CCZS are then easily facilitated.</description>

      <title>Coherence and Dimensionality Witnesses for Fractional OAM Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize sets of fractional orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes of a light beam using unitary-invariant properties encoded by two-mode overlaps. Using basis-independent coherence and dimension witnesses, we experimentally certify, on a triple of fractional modes, both the presence of coherence and that the states necessarily span a space of dimension 3. We propose and implement a practical, fast experimental method to extract two-mode overlaps requiring only a single intensity image per interference pair. These results lay the groundwork for using fractional OAM states in high-dimensional quantum information protocols.</description>

      <title>Generalized Quantum Stein's Lemma and Reversibility of Quantum Resource Theories for Classical-Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the recent proof of the Generalized Quantum Stein's Lemma by Hayashi and Yamasaki [arXiv:2408.02722] to classical-quantum (c-q) channels. We analyze the composite hypothesis testing problem of testing a c-q channel $\mathcal{E}^{\otimes n}$ against a sequence of sets of c-q channels $(\mathcal{S}_n)_n$ (satisfying certain natural assumptions), under parallel strategies. We prove that the optimal asymptotic asymmetric error exponent is given by the regularization of Umegaki channel divergence, minimized over $\mathcal{S}_n$. This allows us to prove the reversibility of resource theories of classical-quantum channels in a natural framework, where the distance between channels (and hence also the notion of approximate interconvertibility of channels) is measured in diamond norm, and the set of free operations is the set of all asymptotically resource non-generating superchannels. The results we obtain are similar to the ones in the concurrent and independent work by Hayashi and Yamasaki [arXiv:2509.07271]. However the proof of the direct part of the GQSL uses different arguments and techniques to deal with the challenges that arise from dealing with c-q channels.</description>

      <title>Quantum spread complexity as a probe of NSI, $CP$ Violation, and mass ordering in neutrino oscillations in matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum spread complexity characterizes how a quantum state evolves and becomes distributed over the Hilbert space under unitary dynamics. In this work, we employ a cost function as a quantitative measure of spread complexity. We investigate this cost function within the framework of three-flavor neutrino oscillations in vacuum and matter, incorporating the $CP$-violation phase and Non-Standard Interaction (NSI) effects, under both normal and inverted mass ordering scenarios. The cost function is evaluated for each scenario and analyzed with the corresponding neutrino transition probabilities for both initial muon neutrino and muon antineutrino flavor states. The results are presented using the energy where the first oscillation is maximum and baseline lengths of ongoing long-baseline accelerator neutrino experiments, including T2K and NOvA, as well as upcoming experiments such as DUNE and P2O. Our findings indicate that the difference in the cost function between normal and inverted mass orderings during neutrino propagation in matter is sensitive to these experiments, with the appropriate choice of NSI parameters and the best-fit $CP$-violation phase values.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Inspired Stacked Integrated Concept Graph Model (QISICGM) for Diabetes Risk Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Quantum-Inspired Stacked Integrated Concept Graph Model (QISICGM) is an innovative machine learning framework that harnesses quantum-inspired techniques to predict diabetes risk with exceptional accuracy and efficiency. Utilizing the PIMA Indians Diabetes dataset augmented with 2,000 synthetic samples to mitigate class imbalance (total: 2,768 samples, 1,949 positives), QISICGM integrates a self-improving concept graph with a stacked ensemble comprising Random Forests (RF), Extra Trees (ET), transformers, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs). This approach achieves an out-of-fold (OOF) F1 score of 0.8933 and an AUC of 0.8699, outperforming traditional methods. Quantum inspired elements, such as phase feature mapping and neighborhood sequence modeling, enrich feature representations, enabling CPU-efficient inference at 8.5 rows per second. This paper presents a detailed architecture, theoretical foundations, code insights, and performance evaluations, including visualizations from the outputs subfolder. The open-source implementation (v1.0.0) is available at https://github.com/keninayoung/QISICGM, positioning QISICGM as a potential benchmark for AI-assisted clinical triage in diabetes and beyond. Ultimately, this work emphasizes trustworthy AI through calibration, interpretability, and open-source reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Stocks Index Price using Quantum GANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs) for stock price prediction. Financial markets are inherently complex, marked by high volatility and intricate patterns that traditional models often fail to capture. QGANs, leveraging the power of quantum computing, offer a novel approach by combining the strengths of generative models with quantum machine learning techniques. We implement a QGAN model tailored for stock price prediction and evaluate its performance using historical stock market data. Our results demonstrate that QGANs can generate synthetic data closely resembling actual market behavior, leading to enhanced prediction accuracy. The experiment was conducted using the Stocks index price data and the AWS Braket SV1 simulator for training the QGAN circuits. The quantum-enhanced model outperforms classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and GAN models in terms of convergence speed and prediction accuracy. This research represents a key step toward integrating quantum computing in financial forecasting, offering potential advantages in speed and precision over traditional methods. The findings suggest important implications for traders, financial analysts, and researchers seeking advanced tools for market analysis.</description>

      <title>Higher-Form Anomalies on Lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-form symmetry in a tensor product Hilbert space is always emergent: the symmetry generators become genuinely topological only when the Gauss law is energetically enforced at low energies. In this paper, we present a general method for defining the 't Hooft anomaly of higher-form symmetries in lattice models built on a tensor product Hilbert space. In (2+1)D, for given Gauss law operators realized by finite-depth circuits that generate a finite 1-form $G$ symmetry, we construct an index representing a cohomology class in $H^4(B^2G, U(1))$, which characterizes the corresponding 't Hooft anomaly. This construction generalizes the Else-Nayak characterization of 0-form symmetry anomalies. More broadly, under the assumption of a specified formulation of the $p$-form $G$ symmetry action and Hilbert space structure in arbitrary $d$ spatial dimensions, we show how to characterize the 't Hooft anomaly of the symmetry action by an index valued in $H^{d+2}(B^{p+1}G, U(1))$.</description>

      <title>Phases of 2d Gauge Theories and Symmetric Mass Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics and phase structure of Abelian gauge theories in $d=1+1$ dimensions. These include $U(1)$ gauge theory coupled to a scalar and a fermion, as well as the two-flavour Schwinger model with different charges. Both theories exhibit a surprisingly rich phase diagram as masses are varied, with both $c=1$ and $c=1/2$ critical lines or points. We build up to the study of 2d chiral gauge theories, which hold particular interest because they provide a mechanism for symmetric mass generation, a phenomenon in which fermions become gapped without breaking chiral symmetries.</description>

      <title>On the fate of spacetime singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I investigate spacetime singularities from the point of view of the wavefunction of the universe. In order to extend the classical notion of geodesic incompleteness one has to include the proper time of an observer as a degree of freedom in the Wheeler DeWitt equation. This leads to a Schr\"odinger equation along the observer worldline. Near the singularity, as in the classical BLK treatment, I ignore spatial gradients and effectively describe the spacetime around the worldline in the mini-superspace approximation. The problem proves identical to a spherically symmetric scattering of a quantum particle off a central potential and singularity avoidance is tantamount to the unitary evolution of this system. Standard types of matter (dust, radiation) correspond to regular potentials and thus lead to a bounce. The most singular component, spatial anisotropy, is associated to a conserved charge and yields a negative inverse-square potential-like standard angular momentum, but with opposite sign. This potential is critical, in that the unitarity of the evolution depends on the actual numerical factor in front of it, i.e., on the anisotropy charge.</description>

      <title>Driven-Dissipative Landau Polaritons: Two Highly Nonlinearly-Coupled Quantum Harmonic Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Landau levels (LLs) are the massively-degenerate discrete energy spectrum of a charged particle in a transverse magnetic field and lie at the heart of many intriguing phenomena such as the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects as well as quantized vortices. In this Letter, we consider coupling of LLs of a transversely driven charge neutral particle in a synthetic gauge potential to a quantized field of an optical cavity -- a setting reminiscent of superradiant self-ordering setups in quantum gases. We uncover that this complex system can be surprisingly described in terms of two highly nonlinearly-coupled quantum harmonic oscillators, thus enabling a full quantum mechanical treatment. Light-matter coupling mixes the LLs and the superradiant photonic mode, leading to the formation of hybrid states referred to as ``Landau polaritons''. They inherit partially the degeneracy of the LLs and possess intriguing features such as non-zero light-matter entanglement and quadrature squeezing. Depending on the system parameters and the choice of initial state, the system exhibits diverse nonequilibrium quantum dynamics and multiple steady states, with distinct physical properties. This work lays the foundation for further investigating the novel, driven-dissipative Landau-polariton physics in quantum-gas--cavity-QED settings.</description>

      <title>Accurate ground states of $SU(2)$ lattice gauge theory in 2+1D and 3+1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a neural network wavefunction framework for solving non-Abelian lattice gauge theories in a continuous group representation. Using a combination of $SU(2)$ equivariant neural networks alongside an $SU(2)$ invariant, physics-inspired ansatz, we learn a parameterization of the ground state wavefunction of $SU(2)$ lattice gauge theory in 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions. Our method, performed in the Hamiltonian formulation, has a straightforward generalization to $SU(N)$. We benchmark our approach against a solely invariant ansatz by computing the ground state energy, demonstrating the need for bespoke gauge equivariant transformations. We evaluate the Creutz ratio and average Wilson loop, and obtain results in strong agreement with perturbative expansions. Our method opens up an avenue for studying lattice gauge theories beyond one dimension, with efficient scaling to larger systems, and in a way that avoids both the sign problem and any discretization of the gauge group.</description>

      <title>A graphical diagnostic of topological order using ZX calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Establishing a universal diagnostic of topological order remains an open theoretical challenge. In particular, diagnosing long-range entanglement through the entropic area law suffers from spurious contributions, failing to unambiguously identify topological order. Here we devise a protocol based on the ZX calculus, a graphical tensor network, to determine the topological order of a state circumventing entropy calculations. The protocol takes as input real-space bipartitions of a state and returns a ZX contour diagram, $\mathcal{D}_{\partial A}$, displaying long-range graph connectivity only for long-range entangled states. We validate the protocol by showing that the contour diagrams of the toric and color codes are equivalent except for the number of non-local nodes, which differentiates their topological order. The number of these nodes is robust to the choice of the boundary and ground-state superposition, and they are absent for trivial states, even those with spurious entropy contributions. Our results single out ZX calculus as a tool to detect topological long-range entanglement by leveraging the advantages of diagrammatic reasoning against entropic diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Neural-Quantum-States Impurity Solver for Quantum Embedding Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a promising approach to solve second-quantised Hamiltonians, because of their scalability and flexibility. In this work, we design and benchmark an NQS impurity solver for the quantum embedding methods, focusing on the ghost Gutzwiller Approximation (gGA) framework. We introduce a graph transformer-based NQS framework able to represent arbitrarily connected impurity orbitals and develop an error control mechanism to stabilise iterative updates throughout the quantum embedding loops. We validate the accuracy of our approach with benchmark gGA calculations of the Anderson Lattice Model, yielding results in excellent agreement with the exact diagonalisation impurity solver. Finally, our analysis of the computational budget reveals the method's principal bottleneck to be the high-accuracy sampling of physical observables required by the embedding loop, rather than the NQS variational optimisation, directly highlighting the critical need for more efficient inference techniques.</description>

      <title>QKD Oracles for Authenticated Key Exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) establishes shared ('symmetric') cryptographic keys which are essential for secure online communication. AKE protocols can be constructed from public-key cryptography like Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs). Another approach is to use Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) to establish a symmetric key, which uses quantum communication. Combining post-quantum AKE and QKD appropriately may provide security against quantum attacks even if only one of the two approaches turns out to be secure.
  We provide an extensive review of existing security analyses for combined AKE and their formal security models, and identify some gaps in their treatment of QKD key IDs. In particular, improper handling of QKD key IDs leads to Dependent-Key attacks on AKE.
  As our main conceptual contribution, we model QKD as an oracle that closely resembles the standard ETSI 014 QKD interface. We demonstrate the usability of our QKD oracle for cryptographic security analyses by integrating it into a prominent security model for AKE, called CK+ model, thereby obtaining a security model for combined AKE that catches Dependent-Key attacks. In this model, we formally prove security of a new protocol that combines QKD with a triple-KEM handshake. This is the first provably secure hybrid protocol that maintains information-theoretic security of QKD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unidirectional emission holds significant potential for advancing integrated photonics and quantum information technologies. However, the inherent randomness of spontaneous emission fundamentally makes its efficient realization rather challenging. To address this, here we develop a quantitative metric -- iso-frequency contour straightness and implement Fourier-transform analysis of radiation patterns to systematically evaluate directional quality of emission in photonic crystal (PhC) slabs. Through structural optimization, we demonstrate single-emitter radiation efficiency enhancement while maintaining low-loss unidirectional propagation. Furthermore, by strategically positioning multi-emitter arrays within PhC platforms, we simultaneously achieve scalable intensity amplification and superradiant emission via cooperative effects. This synergy of photonic band engineering and collective emitter coupling is able to realize unprecedented spatiotemporal coherence control in quantum emitter arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a symmetry classification for a general class of quantum feedback control. For successive feedback control with a non-adaptive sequence of bare measurements (i.e., with positive Kraus operators), we prove that the symmetry classification collapses to the ten-fold AZ$^\dagger$ classes, specifying the allowed topology of CPTP maps associated with feedback control. We demonstrate that a chiral Maxwell's demon with Gaussian measurement errors exhibits quantized winding numbers. Moreover, for general (non-bare) measurements, we explicitly construct a protocol that falls outside the ten-fold classification. These results broaden and clarify the principles in engineering topological aspects of quantum control robust against disorder and imperfections.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Scaling Laws for Neural Quantum States in Quantum Chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling laws have been used to describe how large language model (LLM) performance scales with model size, training data size, or amount of computational resources. Motivated by the fact that neural quantum states (NQS) has increasingly adopted LLM-based components, we seek to understand NQS scaling laws, thereby shedding light on the scalability and optimal performance--resource trade-offs of NQS ansatze. In particular, we identify scaling laws that predict the performance, as measured by absolute error and V-score, for transformer-based NQS as a function of problem size in second-quantized quantum chemistry applications. By performing analogous compute-constrained optimization of the obtained parametric curves, we find that the relationship between model size and training time is highly dependent on loss metric and ansatz, and does not follow the approximately linear relationship found for language models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resolving high-contrast targets is a fundamental yet highly challenging task in astronomy. Using quantum estimation theory, we demonstrate that the ultimate limit for estimating the separation between two unequal-brightness thermal sources via interferometry remains constant, enabling the potential for superresolution. We give a comparative analysis of two primary stellar interferometric schemes: amplitude interferometry and intensity interferometry. Notably, the nulling strategy employed in amplitude interferometry, a configuration specifically proposed for exoplanet detection by leveraging destructive interference to suppress the brighter source, is quantum optimal for separation estimation. While intensity interferometry is less effective than amplitude interferometry in lossless scenarios and fails to achieve superresolution, it becomes competitive when optical loss in large-scale interferometry is considered. By applying these methodologies to modern stellar interferometry, we highlight the promise of large-scale interferometry for advancing high-resolution astronomical observation.</description>

      <title>Efficient lattice field theory simulation using adaptive normalizing flow on a resistive memory-based neural differential equation solver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice field theory (LFT) simulations underpin advances in classical statistical mechanics and quantum field theory, providing a unified computational framework across particle, nuclear, and condensed matter physics. However, the application of these methods to high-dimensional systems remains severely constrained by several challenges, including the prohibitive computational cost and limited parallelizability of conventional sampling algorithms such as hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC), the substantial training expense associated with traditional normalizing flow models, and the inherent energy inefficiency of digital hardware architectures. Here, we introduce a software-hardware co-design that integrates an adaptive normalizing flow (ANF) model with a resistive memory-based neural differential equation solver, enabling efficient generation of LFT configurations. Software-wise, ANF enables efficient parallel generation of statistically independent configurations, thereby reducing computational costs, while low-rank adaptation (LoRA) allows cost-effective fine-tuning across diverse simulation parameters. Hardware-wise, in-memory computing with resistive memory substantially enhances both parallelism and energy efficiency. We validate our approach on the scalar phi4 theory and the effective field theory of graphene wires, using a hybrid analog-digital neural differential equation solver equipped with a 180 nm resistive memory in-memory computing macro. Our co-design enables low-cost computation, achieving approximately 8.2-fold and 13.9-fold reductions in integrated autocorrelation time over HMC, while requiring fine-tuning of less than 8% of the weights via LoRA. Compared to state-of-the-art GPUs, our co-design achieves up to approximately 16.1- and 17.0-fold speedups for the two tasks, as well as 73.7- and 138.0-fold improvements in energy efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoelectromechanical resonators provide an ideal platform for investigating the interplay between electron transport and nonlinear mechanical motion. Externally driven suspended carbon nanotubes, containing an electrostatically defined quantum dot are especially promising. These devices possess two main sources of nonlinearity: the electromechanical coupling and the intrinsic contributions of the resonator that induce a Duffing-like nonlinear behavior. In this work, we observe the interplay between the two sources across different driving regimes. The main nonlinear feature we observe is the emergence of arch-like resonances in the electronic transport when the resonator is strongly driven. We show that our model is in good agreement with our experimental electron transport measurements on a suspended carbon nanotube. This characterization paves the way for the exploration of nonlinear phenomena using mesoscopic electromechanical resonators.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the impact of conserved charges on the dynamics of spread complexity of quantum states. Building on the notion of symmetry-resolved Krylov complexity [1], we extend the framework to general quantum states and analyze the relation between the total spread complexity and its decomposition into fixed-charge sectors. After exploring a range of analytical examples and using orthogonal polynomial approach, we identify conditions under which spread complexity exhibits equipartition across sectors. Finally, we discuss quantum speed limits that constrain the growth of complexity in the presence of conserved charges.</description>

      <title>Topological Photon Transport in Programmable Photonic Processors via Discretized Evolution of Synthetic Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photons, unlike electrons, do not couple directly to magnetic fields, yet synthetic gauge fields can impart magnetic-like responses and enable topological transport. Discretized Floquet evolution provides a controlled route, where the time-ordered sequencing of non-commuting Hamiltonians imprints complex hopping phases and breaks time-reversal symmetry. However, stabilizing such driven dynamics and observing unambiguous topological signatures on a reconfigurable platform has remained challenging. Here we demonstrate synthetic gauge fields for light on a programmable photonic processor by implementing discretized Floquet drives that combine static and dynamic phases. This approach reveals hallmark features of topological transport: chiral circulation that reverses under drive inversion, flux-controlled interference with high visibility, and robust directional flow stabilized by maximizing the minimal Floquet quasi-energy gap. The dynamics are further characterized by a first-harmonic phase order parameter, whose per-period winding number quantifies angular drift and reverses sign with the drive order. These results establish discretized, gap-optimized Floquet evolution as a versatile and fully programmable framework for topological photonics, providing a compact route to engineer gauge fields, stabilize driven phases, and probe winding-number signatures of chiral transport.</description>

      <title>QDFlow: A Python package for physics simulations of quantum dot devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have accelerated progress in calibrating and operating quantum dot (QD) devices. However, most ML approaches rely on access to large, high-quality labeled datasets for training, benchmarking, and validation, with labels capturing key features in the data. Obtaining such datasets experimentally is challenging due to limited data availability and the labor-intensive nature of labeling. QDFlow is an open-source physics simulator for multi-QD arrays that generates realistic synthetic data with ground-truth labels. QDFlow combines a self-consistent Thomas-Fermi solver, a dynamic capacitance model, and flexible noise modules to produce charge stability diagrams and ray-based data closely resembling experiments. With extensive tunable parameters and customizable noise models, QDFlow supports the creation of large, diverse datasets for ML development, benchmarking, and quantum device research.</description>

      <title>Composite Classical and Quantum Channel Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of binary composite channel discrimination in the asymmetric setting, where the hypotheses are given by fairly arbitrary sets of channels, and samples do not have to be identically distributed. In the case of quantum channels we prove: (i) a characterization of the Stein exponent for parallel channel discrimination strategies and (ii) an upper bound on the Stein exponent for adaptive channel discrimination strategies. We further show that already for classical channels this upper bound can sometimes be achieved and be strictly larger than what is possible with parallel strategies. Hence, there can be an advantage of adaptive channel discrimination strategies with composite hypotheses for classical channels, unlike in the case of simple hypotheses. Moreover, we show that classically this advantage can only exist if the sets of channels corresponding to the hypotheses are non-convex. As a consequence of our more general treatment, which is not limited to the composite i.i.d. setting, we also obtain a generalization of previous composite state discrimination results.</description>

      <title>Tracially embeddable strategies: Lifting MIP* tricks to MIPco</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01940v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that any two-party correlation in the commuting operator model can be approximated using a tracially embeddable strategy, a class of strategies defined on a finite tracial von Neumann algebra, which we define in this paper. Using this characterization, we show that any approximately synchronous correlation can be approximated to the average of a collection of synchronous correlations in the commuting operator model. This generalizes the result from Vidick [JMP 2022] which only applies to finite-dimensional quantum correlations. As a corollary, we show that the quantum tensor code test from Ji et al. [FOCS 2022] follows the soundness property even under the general commuting operator model.
  Furthermore, we extend the state-dependent norm variant of the Gowers-Hatami theorem to finite von Neumann algebras. Combined with the aforementioned characterization, this enables us to lift many known results about robust self-testing for non-local games to the commuting operator model, including a sample efficient finite-dimensional EPR testing for the commuting operator strategies. We believe that, in addition to the contribution from this paper, this class of strategies can be helpful for further understanding non-local games in the infinite-dimensional setting.</description>

      <title>Potential renormalisation, Lamb shift and mean-force Gibbs state -- to shift or not to shift?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Often, the microscopic interaction mechanism of an open quantum system gives rise to a `counter term' which renormalises the system Hamiltonian. Such term compensates for the distortion of the system's potential due to the finite coupling to the environment. Even if the coupling is weak, the counter term is, in general, not negligible. Similarly, weak-coupling master equations feature a number of `Lamb-shift terms' which, contrary to popular belief, cannot be neglected. Yet, the practice of vanishing both counter term and Lamb shift when dealing with master equations is almost universal; and, surprisingly, it can yield better results. By accepting the conventional wisdom, one may approximate the dynamics more accurately and, importantly, the resulting master equation is guaranteed to equilibrate to the correct steady state in the high-temperature limit. In this paper we discuss why is this the case. Specifically, we show that, if the potential distortion is small -- but non-negligible -- the counter term does not influence any dissipative processes to second order in the coupling. Furthermore, we show that, for large environmental cutoff, the Lamb-shift terms approximately cancel any coherent effects due to the counter term -- this renders the combination of both contributions irrelevant in practice. We thus provide precise conditions under which the open-system folklore regarding Lamb shift and counter terms is rigorously justified.</description>

      <title>Fast quantum algorithm for differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11802v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are ubiquitous in science and engineering. Prior quantum algorithms for solving the system of linear algebraic equations obtained from discretizing a PDE have a computational complexity that scales at least linearly with the condition number $\kappa$ of the matrices involved in the computation. For many practical applications, $\kappa$ scales polynomially with the size $N$ of the matrices, rendering a polynomial complexity in $N$ for these algorithms. Here we present a quantum algorithm with a complexity that is polylogarithmic in $N$ but is independent of $\kappa$ for a large class of PDEs. Our algorithm generates a quantum state from which features of the solution can be extracted. Central to our methodology is using a wavelet basis as an auxiliary system of coordinates in which the condition number of associated matrices becomes independent of $N$ by a simple diagonal preconditioner. We present numerical simulations showing the effect of the wavelet preconditioner for several differential equations. Our work could provide a practical way to boost the performance of quantum simulation algorithms where standard methods are used for discretization.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Fault-Tolerance to Quantum Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard approach to universal fault-tolerant quantum computing is to develop a general purpose quantum error correction mechanism that can implement a universal set of logical gates fault-tolerantly. Given such a scheme, any quantum algorithm can be realized fault-tolerantly by composing the relevant logical gates from this set. However, we know that quantum computers provide a significant quantum advantage only for specific quantum algorithms. Hence, a universal quantum computer can likely gain from compiling such specific algorithms using tailored quantum error correction schemes. In this work, we take the first steps towards such algorithm-tailored quantum fault-tolerance. We consider Trotter circuits in quantum simulation, which is an important application of quantum computing. We develop a solve-and-stitch algorithm to systematically synthesize physical realizations of Clifford Trotter circuits on the well-known $\llbr n,n-2,2 \rrbr$ error-detecting code family. Our analysis shows that this family implements Trotter circuits with essentially optimal depth under reasonable assumptions, thereby serving as an illuminating example of tailored quantum error correction. We achieve fault-tolerance for these circuits using flag gadgets, which add minimal overhead. Importantly, the solve-and-stitch algorithm has the potential to scale beyond this specific example, as illustrated by a generalization to the four-qubit logical Clifford Trotter circuit on the $\llbr 20,4,2 \rrbr$ hypergraph product code, thereby providing a principled approach to tailored fault-tolerance in quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Topological, multi-mode amplification induced by non-reciprocal, long-range dissipative couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10176v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal couplings or drivings are known to induce steady-state, directional, amplification in driven-dissipative bosonic lattices. This amplification phenomenon has been recently linked to the existence of a non-zero topological invariant defined with the system's dynamical matrix, and thus, it depends critically on the couplings' structure. In this work, we demonstrate the emergence of unconventional, non-reciprocal, long-range dissipative couplings induced by the interaction of the bosonic chain with a chiral, multimode channel, and then study their impact on topological amplification phenomena. We show that these couplings can lead to topological invariant values greater than one which induce topological, multimode amplification and metastability behaviour. Besides, we also show how these couplings can also display topological amplifying phases that are dynamically stable in the presence of local parametric drivings. Finally, we conclude by showing how such phenomena can be naturally obtained in two-dimensional topological insulators hosting multiple edge modes.</description>

      <title>Finite-size analysis of prepare-and-measure and decoy-state QKD via entropy accumulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10198v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important goal in quantum key distribution (QKD) is the task of providing a finite-size security proof without the assumption of collective attacks. For prepare-and-measure QKD, one approach for obtaining such proofs is the generalized entropy accumulation theorem (GEAT), but thus far it has only been applied to study a small selection of protocols. In this work, we present techniques for applying the GEAT in finite-size analysis of generic prepare-and-measure protocols, with a focus on decoy-state protocols. In particular, we present an improved approach for computing entropy bounds for decoy-state protocols, which has the dual benefits of providing tighter bounds than previous approaches (even asymptotically) and being compatible with methods for computing min-tradeoff functions in the GEAT. Furthermore, we develop methods to incorporate some improvements to the finite-size terms in the GEAT, and implement techniques to automatically optimize the min-tradeoff function. Our approach also addresses some numerical stability challenges specific to prepare-and-measure protocols, which were not addressed in previous works.</description>

      <title>Optimal Mechanisms for Quantum Local Differential Privacy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Centralized differential privacy has been successfully applied to quantum computing and information processing to protect privacy and avoid leaks in the connections between neighboring quantum states. Consequently, quantum local differential privacy (QLDP) has been newly proposed to preserve quantum data privacy akin to the classical scenario where all states are viewed as neighboring states. However, the exploration of the QLDP framework is still in its early stages, primarily conceptual, which poses challenges for its practical implementation in safeguarding quantum state privacy.
  This paper delves into optimal QLDP mechanisms to balance privacy and utility to enhance the practical use of the QLDP framework. QLDP utilizes a parameter $\epsilon$ to manage privacy leaks and ensure the privacy of individual quantum states. The optimization of the QLDP value $\epsilon$, denoted as $\epsilon^*$, for any quantum mechanism is addressed as an optimization problem. The introduction of quantum noise is shown to provide privacy protections similar to classical scenarios, with quantum depolarizing noise identified as the optimal unital privatization mechanism within the QLDP framework. Unital mechanisms represent a diverse set of quantum mechanisms that encompass frequently employed quantum noise types. Quantum depolarizing noise optimizes both fidelity and trace distance utilities, which are crucial metrics in the field of quantum computation and information, and can be viewed as a quantum counterpart to classical randomized response methods. The study further explores the trade-off between utility and privacy across different quantum noise mechanisms, including unital and non-unital quantum noise mechanisms, through both analytical and numerically experimental approaches. This highlights the optimization of quantum depolarizing noise in the QLDP framework.</description>

Abstract: A central requirement in asymmetric quantum nonlocality protocols, such as quantum steering, is the precise reconstruction of state assemblages -- statistical ensembles of quantum states correlated with remote classical signals. Here we introduce a generalized loss model for assemblage tomography that uses conical optimization techniques combined with maximum likelihood estimation. Using an evidence-based framework based on Akaike's Information Criterion, we demonstrate that our approach excels in the accuracy of reconstructions while accounting for model complexity. In comparison, standard tomographic methods fall short when applied to experimentally relevant data.</description>

      <title>Dynamically Optimized Super-Robust Nonadiabatic Holonomic Quantum Gates Based on Superconducting Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation (NHQC) leverages non-Abelian geometric phases within a nonadiabatic framework to achieve fast and robust quantum gate operations. However, the practical implementation of NHQC is challenged by the imperfect control inherent in experimental environments. Ensuring deep suppression of control error is critical. In this work, we propose a dynamically optimized NHQC scheme to construct universal super-robust holonomic quantum gates. The proposed scheme is implemented by strategically designing a set of dynamically correcting pulses to achieve cyclic evolution, while ensuring that unwanted and disruptive dynamical phase elements, including previously neglected cross-coupling terms, are not accumulated. This constructed super-robust NHQC scheme efficiently safeguards the cyclic evolution process and makes the holonomic gate immune to control error by effectively correcting the error up to the fourth order. Furthermore, when integrated with decoherence-free subspace (DFS) encoding in superconducting quantum circuits, our scheme can achieve high-fidelity holonomic gates, and demonstrate robust resilience against both control errors and collective dephasing errors. Consequently, our work offers a promising pathway toward the realization of scalable and fault-tolerant holonomic quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Gibbs state preparation for commuting Hamiltonian: Mapping to classical Gibbs sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04909v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gibbs state preparation, or Gibbs sampling, is a key computational technique extensively used in physics, statistics, and other scientific fields. Recent efforts for designing fast mixing Gibbs samplers for quantum Hamiltonians have largely focused on commuting local Hamiltonians (CLHs), a non-trivial subclass of Hamiltonians which include highly entangled systems such as the Toric code and quantum double model. Most previous Gibbs samplers relied on simulating the Davies generator, which is a Lindbladian associated with the thermalization process in nature.
  Instead of using the Davies generator, we design a different Gibbs sampler for various CLHs by giving a reduction to classical Hamiltonians, in the sense that one can efficiently prepare the Gibbs state for some CLH $H$ on a quantum computer as long as one can efficiently do classical Gibbs sampling for the corresponding classical Hamiltonian $H^{(c)}$. We demonstrate that our Gibbs sampler is able to replicate state-of-the-art results as well as prepare the Gibbs state in regimes which were previously unknown, such as the low temperature region, as long as there exists fast mixing Gibbs samplers for the corresponding classical Hamiltonians. Our reductions are as follows.
  - If $H$ is a 2-local qudit CLH, then $H^{(c)}$ is a 2-local qudit classical Hamiltonian.
  - If $H$ is a 4-local qubit CLH on 2D lattice and there are no classical qubits, then $H^{(c)}$ is a 2-local qudit classical Hamiltonian on a planar graph. As an example, our algorithm can prepare the Gibbs state for the (defected) Toric code at any non-zero temperature in $O(n^2 poly(log n))$ time.
  - If $H$ is a 4-local qubit CLH on 2D lattice and there are classical qubits, assuming that quantum terms are uniformly correctable, then $H^{(c)}$ is a constant-local classical Hamiltonian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23353v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate unitary and state $t$-designs from a computational complexity perspective. First, we address the problems of computing frame potentials that characterize (approximate) $t$-designs. We present a quantum algorithm for computing frame potentials and establish the following: (1) exact computation can be achieved by a single query to a $\# \textsf{P}$-oracle and is $\# \textsf{P}$-hard; (2) for state vectors, deciding whether the frame potential is larger than or smaller than certain values is $\textsf{BQP}$-complete, provided the promise gap between the two values is inverse-polynomial in the number of qubits; and (3) for both state vectors and unitaries, this promise problem is $\textsf{PP}$-complete if the promise gap is exponentially small. Second, we address the promise problem of deciding whether or not a given set is a good approximation to a design. Given a certain promise gap that could be constant, we show that this problem is $\textsf{PP}$-hard, highlighting the inherent computational difficulty of determining properties of unitary and state designs. We further identify the implications of our results across diverse areas, including variational methods for constructing designs, diagnosing quantum chaos through out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and exploring emergent designs in Hamiltonian systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement entropy in quantum states featuring repeated sequential excitations of unit patterns in momentum space. In the scaling limit, each unit pattern contributes independently and universally to the entanglement entropy, leading to a characteristic volume-law scaling. Crucially, this universal contribution remains identical for both free and interacting models, enabling decomposition of the total entanglement into pattern-specific components. Numerical verification in fermionic and bosonic chains confirms this volume-law fragmentation phenomenon. For fermionic systems, we derive analytical expressions where many-body entanglement becomes expressible through few-body entanglement components. Notably, this analytical framework extends to spin-1/2 XXZ chains through appropriate identifications.</description>

      <title>Measurement-free code-switching for low overhead quantum computation using permutation invariant codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13142v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transversal gates on quantum error correction codes have been a promising approach for fault-tolerant quantum computing, but are limited by the Eastin-Knill no-go theorem. Existing solutions like gate teleportation and magic state distillation are resource-intensive. We present a measurement-free code-switching protocol for universal quantum computation, switching between a stabiliser code for transversal Cliffords and a permutation-invariant (PI) code for transversal non-Cliffords that are logical $Z$ rotations for any rational multiple of $\pi$. The novel non-Clifford gates enabled by this code-switching protocol provide for a lower gate count implementation of a universal gate set relative to the Clifford$+T$ gate set. To achieve this, we present a protocol for performing controlled-NOTs between the codes using near-term quantum control operations that employ a catalytic bosonic mode. We also present a new class of PI codes with tunable code distance, supporting transversal non-Clifford gates, and demonstrate their reduced gate count overhead relative to a comparable stabilizer code to stabilizer code switching scheme.</description>

      <title>Bell Inequalities and Unitary Dynamics in Quantum Field Theory: Scalar and Proca Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the role of unitary transformations in enhancing violations of the Bell-CHSH inequality in relativistic quantum field theory. In quantum systems, all relevant observables can be expressed via unitary rotations of reference operators. We extend this perspective to a real massive free scalar field and to the Proca vector field in $(1+1)$ Minkowski spacetime. In two dimensions, the Proca theory carries only one degree of freedom and is known to be equivalent to the scalar theory, implying that both yield identical Bell-CHSH violations. After introducing suitable Hermitian operators, we employ Tomita-Takesaki modular theory to construct spacelike separated observables in the vacuum. We demonstrate that unitary deformations significantly increase the Bell-CHSH violation, approaching the Tsirelson bound, and we report the first explicit evaluation of such violation in a vector-field vacuum.</description>

      <title>Quantum model reduction for continuous-time quantum filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13885v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of quantum stochastic models is widespread in dynamical reduction, simulation of open systems, feedback control and adaptive estimation. In many applications only part of the information contained in the filter's state is actually needed to reconstruct the target observable quantities; thus, filters of smaller dimensions could be in principle implemented to perform the same task.In this work, we propose a systematic method to find, when possible, reduced-order quantum filters that are capable of exactly reproducing the evolution of expectation values of interest. In contrast with existing reduction techniques, the reduced model we obtain is exact and in the form of a Belavkin filtering equation, ensuring physical interpretability.This is attained by leveraging tools from the theory of both minimal realization and non-commutative conditional expectations. The proposed procedure is tested on prototypical examples, laying the groundwork for applications in quantum trajectory simulation and quantum feedback control.</description>

      <title>Transport approach to quantum state tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is a central task for quantum information processing, enabling quantum cryptography, computation, and state certification. Traditional QST relies on projective measurements of single- and two-qubit Pauli operators, requiring the system of interest to be isolated from environmental dissipation. In this work, we demonstrate that measuring currents and associated transport quantities flowing through a quantum system in an open configuration enable the reconstruction of its quantum state. This result relies on an exact relation between transport quantities and the Krylov subspaces associated with the Lindbladian which encodes the dynamical evolution of an open quantum system. We illustrate this transport approach to QST with the explicit example of a two-qubit system embedded in a two-terminal setup. As a direct consequence of our framework, we are able to provide a transport-based entanglement measure to certify the presence of quantum correlations, expressing the concurrence in terms of current averages and correlations function only. Our findings are analytical, providing fundamental insights into quantum information processing in open quantum systems. They establish new connections between the fields of mesoscopic physics and quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>Work Statistics via Real-Time Effective Field Theory: Application to Work Extraction from Thermal Bath with Qubit Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18812v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum thermal states are known to be passive, as required by the second law of thermodynamics. This paper investigates the potential for work extraction by coupling a thermal bath to a qubit of either spin, fermionic, or topological type, which acts as a quantum thermal state at different temperatures. The amount of work extraction is derived from the work statistics under a cyclic nonequilibrium process. Although the work statistics of many-body systems are known to be challenging to calculate explicitly, we propose an effective field theory approach to tackle this problem by assuming the externally driven source couples to a specific quasiparticle operator of the thermal state. We show that the work statistics can be expressed succinctly in terms of this quasiparticle's thermal spectral function. We obtain the non-perturbative work distribution function (WDF) for the pure thermal bath without the qubit coupling. With qubit coupling, we get the second-order WDF, from which the physical regime of work extraction can be pinned down precisely to help devise quantum heat engines or refrigerators. Their efficiency or coefficient of performance (COP) can be inferred from the combination of the fluctuation theorem and the first law, and we find that the spin/topological qubit-bath system generally yields a far better heat engine/refrigerator than the other two alternatives due to the underlying quantum statistics.</description>

      <title>Conserved operators and exact conditions for pair condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the necessary and sufficient conditions which ensure that an $N=2m$-particle fermionic or bosonic state has the form $|\Psi\rangle\propto(A^{\dagger})^{m}|0\rangle$, where $A^{\dagger}=\tfrac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j}A_{ij}c_{i}^{\dagger}c_{j}^{\dagger}$ is a general pair creation operator. These conditions can be cast as an eigenvalue equation for a modified two-body density matrix, and enable an exact reconstruction of the operator $A^\dag$, providing as well a measure of the proximity of a given state to an exact pair condensate. Through a covariance-based formalism, it is also shown that such states are fully characterized by a set of $L$ "conserved" one-body operators which have $|\Psi\rangle$ as exact eigenstate, with $L$ determined just by the single particle space dimension involved. The whole set of two-body Hamiltonians having $|\Psi\rangle$ as exact eigenstate is in this way determined, while a general subset having $|\Psi\rangle$ as nondegenerate ground state is also identified. Extension to states $\propto f(A^\dag)|0\rangle$ with $f$ an arbitrary function is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matrix Product States (MPS) and Tensor Networks provide a general framework for the construction of solvable models. The best-known example is the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) model, which is the ground state of a 2-body nearest-neighbor parent Hamiltonian. We show that such simple parent Hamiltonians for MPS models are, in fact, much more prevalent than hitherto known: The existence of a single example with a simple Hamiltonian for a given choice of dimensions already implies that any generic MPS with those dimensions possesses an equally simple Hamiltonian. We illustrate our finding by discussing a number of models with nearest-neighbor parent Hamiltonians, which generalize the AKLT model on various levels.</description>

      <title>Wave-particle duality in the measurement of gravitational radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03527v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a consistent description of the quantum measurement process, whether the wave or particle-like aspect of a system is revealed depends on the details of the measurement chain, and cannot be interpreted as an objective fact about the system independent of the measurement. We show precisely how this comes to be in the measurement of gravitational radiation. Whether a wave or particle-like aspect is revealed is a property of the detector employed at the end of the quantum measurement chain, rather than of the meter, such as a gravitational-wave (GW) antenna or resonant bar, used to couple the radiation to the detector. A linear detector yields no signal for radiation in a Fock state and a signal proportional to the amplitude in a coherent state -- supporting a wave-like interpretation. By contrast, the signal from a detector coupled to the meter's energy is non-zero only when the incident radiation contains at least a single graviton. Thus, conceptually simple modifications of contemporary GW antennae can reveal wave-particle duality in the measurement of gravitational radiation.</description>

      <title>Scalable universal quantum gates between nitrogen-vacancy centers in levitated nanodiamonds arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamond offer a promising platform for quantum information processing due to their room-temperature spin coherence and optical addressability. However, scalable quantum processors remain limited by the challenge of achieving strong, controllable interactions between distant NV spins. Here, we propose a scalable architecture utilizing optically levitated nanodiamond arrays, where torsional vibrations mediate the coherent coupling between the embedded NV centers. By optimizing the shape of ellipsoidal nanoparticles, we achieve a light-induced coupling strength exceeding 119 kHz between torsional modes of the distant levitated nanodiamonds, which are two orders of magnitude larger than the typical decoherence rates in this system. This strong interaction, combined with magnetic-field-enabled spin-torsion coupling, establishes an effective interaction between the spatially separated NV centers in the distant nanodiamonds. Numerical simulations confirm that dynamic decoupling can suppress both thermal noise and spin dephasing, enabling two-qubit gates with fidelity exceeding 99%. This work provides a foundation for reconfigurable quantum hybrid systems, with potential applications in rotational sensing and programmable quantum processing.</description>

Abstract: Buhrman, Patro, and Speelman presented a framework of conjectures that together form a quantum analogue of the strong exponential-time hypothesis and its variants. They called it the QSETH framework. In this paper, using a notion of quantum natural proofs (built from natural proofs introduced by Razborov and Rudich), we show how part of the QSETH conjecture that requires properties to be `compression oblivious' can in many cases be replaced by assuming the existence of quantum-secure pseudorandom functions, a standard hardness assumption. Combined with techniques from Fourier analysis of Boolean functions, we show that properties such as PARITY and MAJORITY are compression oblivious for certain circuit class $\Lambda$ if subexponentially secure quantum pseudorandom functions exist in $\Lambda$, answering an open question in [Buhrman-Patro-Speelman 2021].</description>

      <title>High-performance local decoders for defect matching in 1D</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10162v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local decoders, also known as cellular-automaton decoders, offer a promising path toward real-time quantum error correction by replacing centralized classical decoding, with inherent hardware constraints, by a natively parallel and streamlined architecture from a simple local transition rule. We propose two new types of local decoders for the quantum repetition code in one dimension. The signal-rule decoders interpret odd parities between neighboring qubits as defects, attracted to each other via the exchange of classical point-like excitations, represented by a few bits of local memory. We prove the existence of a threshold in the code-capacity model and present numerical evidence of exponential logical error suppression under a phenomenological noise model, with data and measurement errors at each error correction cycle. Compared to previously known local decoders that suffer from sub-optimal threshold and scaling, our construction significantly narrows the gap with global decoders for practical system sizes and error rates. Implementation requirements can be further reduced by eliminating the need for local classical memories, with a new rule defined on two rows of qubits. This shearing-rule works well at relevant system sizes making it an appealing short-term solution. When combined with biased-noise qubits, such as cat qubits, these decoders enable a fully local quantum memory in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen-vacancy centre in lonsdaleite: a novel nanoscale sensor?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hexagonal diamond, often called lonsdaleite, is an exotic allotrope of carbon, predicted to be harder than cubic (conventional) diamond with a wider bandgap. Due to its pure sp$^3$ bonded lattice, it should be expected to host sub-bandgap defect centres (colour centres). Here we perform \textit{ab initio} modeling of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) colour centres in hexagonal diamond nanocrystals; for both the neutral and negatively charged species (NV$^0$ and NV$^-$). We identify three distinct configurations for the NV center: two of which are analogous to NV in diamond, and one which is a configuration that can only exist in the hexagonal form. The diamond-like NV systems comprise three symmetry equivalent centers which reside on the same carbon plane, and one defect that is split across two planes and replaces a carbon-carbon bond. There is an additional NV centre where the N and V each have four nearest neighbour carbon atoms. The presence of this latter configuration would provide an unambiguous determination of the hexagonal nature of lonsdaleite. Quantum chemical analysis show all derivatives to be thermochemically stable, and each with their own unique photophysical properties, spectral profiles, and magneto-optical characteristics. By assuming that the ground state properties of the NV$^-$ in hexagonal diamond are comparable to those of NV$^-$ in cubic diamond, albeit with increased strain, we predict ground state fine structure splitting for two of the centres of 2.74~GHz and 4.56~MHz, compared with 2.87~GHz for cubic diamond. The possibility of optically detected magnetic resonance with NV$^-$ in lonsdaleite would provide a new carbon-based quantum sensing system, and an unambiguous method to resolve outstanding issues around the structure of lonsdaleite as hexagonal diamond.</description>

      <title>Is Circuit Depth Accurate for Comparing Quantum Circuit Runtimes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although quantum circuit depth is commonly used to approximate circuit runtimes, it overlooks a prevailing trait of current hardware implementation: different gates have different execution times. Recognizing the potential for discrepancies, we investigate depth's accuracy for comparing runtimes between compiled versions of the same circuit. In particular, we assess the accuracy of traditional and multi-qubit depth for (1) predicting relative differences in runtime and (2) identifying compiled circuit version(s) with the shortest runtime. Finding that circuit depth is not accurate for either task, we introduce a new metric, gate-aware depth, that weights gates' contributions to runtime using an architecture's average gate execution times. Using average gate times allows gate-aware depth to capture variations by gate type without requiring exact knowledge of all gate times, increasing accuracy while maintaining portability across devices of the same architecture. Compared to traditional and multi-qubit depth, gate-aware depth reduces the average relative error of predictions in task (1) by 68 and 18 times and increases the average number of correct identifications in task (2) by 20 and 43 percentage points, respectively. Finally, we provide gate-aware depth weight configurations for current IBM Eagle and Heron architectures.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing promises to revolutionize many-body simulations for quantum chemistry, but its potential is constrained by limited qubits and noise in current devices. In this work, we introduce the Lossy Quantum Selected Configuration Interaction (Lossy-QSCI) framework, which combines a lossy subspace Hamiltonian preparation pipeline with a generic QSCI selection process. This framework integrates a chemistry-inspired lossy Random Linear Encoder (Chemical-RLE) with a neural network-assisted Fermionic Expectation Decoder (NN-FED). The RLE leverages fermionic number conservation to compress quantum states, reducing qubit requirements to O(N log M) for M spin orbitals and N electrons, while preserving crucial ground state information and enabling self-consistent configuration recovery. NN-FED, powered by a neural network trained with minimal data, efficiently decodes these compressed states, overcoming the measurement challenges common in the approaches of the traditional QSCI and its variants. Through iterative quantum sampling and classical post-processing, our hybrid method refines ground state estimates with high efficiency. This framework offers a resource-efficient pathway for ground-state simulations on near-term noisy hardware and could inspire resource-efficient extensions to future devices by minimizing qubit overhead.</description>

      <title>Universal dissipators for driven open quantum systems and the correction to linear response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate in parallel two common pictures used to describe quantum systems interacting with their surrounding environment, i.e., the stochastic Hamiltonian description, where the environment is implicitly included in the fluctuating internal parameters of the system, and the explicit inclusion of the environment via the time-convolutionless projection operator method. Utilizing these two different frameworks, we show that the dissipator characterizing the dynamics of the reduced system, determined up to second order in the noise strength or bath-system coupling, is composed of two parts. One is universal, meaning that it keeps the same form regardless of the drive term. This form constitutes the relevant part of the dissipator only as long as the drive is weak. We thoroughly discuss the assumptions on which this treatment is based and its limitations. Then, by considering the first non-vanishing higher-order term in our expansion, we derive the other, drive-dependent, term completing the full dissipator. This part of the dissipator, originating from the third cumulant, is usually neglected when modeling the decoherent dynamics of controlled qubits. However, this further term constitutes the linear response correction due to memory-mediated environmental effects in driven-dissipative quantum systems. Also, it notably shows that the structure of our quantum master equation goes beyond the Lindblad form. The Lindblad form is recovered for memory-less baths. Finally, we demonstrate this technique to be highly accurate for the problems of dephasing in a driven qubit and for the theory of pseudo-modes for quantum environments.</description>

      <title>Spin-qubit readout analysis based on a hidden Markov model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Across most qubit platforms, the readout fidelities do not keep up with the gate fidelities, and new ways to increase the readout fidelities are searched for. For semiconductor spin qubits, a typical qubit-readout signal consists of a finite stretch of a digitized charge-sensor output. Such a signal trace is usually analyzed by compressing it into a single value, either maximum or sum. The binary measurement result follows by comparing the single value to a decision threshold fixed in advance. This threshold method, while simple and fast, omits information that could potentially improve the readout fidelity. Here, we analyze what can be achieved by more sophisticated signal-trace processing using the hidden Markov model (HMM). The HMM is a natural choice, being the optimal statistical processing if the noise is white. It also has a computationally efficient implementation, known as the forward-backward algorithm, making HMM processing practical. However, unlike in many computer-simulation studies, in real experiments the noise is correlated. How this change affects the HMM implementation and reliability is our subject. We find that the HMM using white noise as the system statistical model is surprisingly sensitive to correlations; it only tolerates very small correlation times. We suggest alleviating this deficiency by a signal prefiltering. The correlations have a similar strongly negative impact on the HMM model calibration (the Baum-Welch algorithm). Besides studying the effects of noise correlations, as a specific application of the HMM we calculate the readout fidelity at elevated temperatures, relevant to recent experimental pursuits of hot spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Optimized quantum sensor networks for ultralight dark matter detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) remains one of the most compelling unresolved problems in fundamental physics, motivating the search for new detection approaches. We propose a network-based quantum sensor architecture to enhance sensitivity to ultralight DM fields. Each node in the network is a superconducting qubit, interconnected via controlled-Z gates in symmetric topologies such as line, ring, star, and fully connected graphs. We investigate four- and nine-qubit systems, optimizing both state preparation and measurement using a variational quantum metrology framework. This approach minimizes the quantum and classical Cram\'er-Rao bounds to identify optimal configurations. Bayesian inference is employed to extract the DM-induced phase shift from measurement outcomes. Our results show that optimized network configurations significantly outperform conventional GHZ-based protocols while maintaining shallow circuit depths compatible with noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware. Sensitivity remains robust under local dephasing noise. These findings highlight the importance of network structure in quantum sensing and point toward scalable strategies for quantum-enhanced DM detection.</description>

Abstract: We report a bosonic anomaly emerging in the quantum harmonic oscillator, whose partition function is rigorously identified as the Chern character via the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem, establishing a new connection among statistical mechanics, anomaly, Atiyah-Singer index theorem and Gromov-Witten theory. We investigate how its internal energy relates to the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, showing that the partition function can be interpreted as the Chern character of "physical sheaf" over Eucildean spacetime by using Grothentic-Riemann-Roch theorem. This correspondence reveals the internal energy of oscillator as a concrete non-SUSY manifestation of the index theorem. Moreover, we show that this connection naturally leads to the emergence of a quantum anomaly. Furthermore, we arrive at Gromov-Witten theory through a more direct and physically intuitive approach. As a result, the internal energy of the quantum harmonic oscillator serves as a bridge linking two key concepts in physics -- statistical mechanics and anomalies -- with three fundamental mathematical frameworks: the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem, and Gromov-Witten theory.</description>

      <title>Will it glue? On short-depth designs beyond the unitary group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23925v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the formation of short-depth designs beyond the unitary group. We provide a range of results on several groups of broad interest in quantum information science: the Clifford group, the orthogonal group, the unitary symplectic groups, and the matchgate group. For all of these groups, we prove that analogues of unitary designs cannot be generated by any circuit ensemble with light-cones that are smaller than the system size. This implies linear lower bounds on the circuit depth in one-dimensional systems. For the Clifford and orthogonal group, we moreover show that a broad class of circuits cannot generate designs in sub-linear depth on any circuit architecture. We show this by exploiting observables in the higher-order commutants of each group, which allow one to distinguish any short-depth circuit from truly random. While these no-go results rule out short-depth unitary designs, we prove that slightly weaker forms of randomness -- including additive-error state designs and anti-concentration in sampling distributions -- nevertheless emerge at logarithmic depths in many cases. Our results reveal that the onset of randomness in shallow quantum circuits is a widespread yet subtle phenomenon, dependent on the interplay between the group itself and the context of its application.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reveal the power of Grover's algorithm from thermodynamic and geometric perspectives by showing that it is a product formula approximation of imaginary-time evolution (ITE), a Riemannian gradient flow on the special unitary group. This viewpoint uncovers three key insights. First, we show that the ITE dynamics trace the shortest path between the initial and the solution states in complex projective space. Second, we prove that the geodesic length of ITE determines the query complexity of Grover's algorithm. This complexity notably aligns with the known optimal scaling for unstructured search. Lastly, utilizing the geodesic structure of ITE, we construct a quantum signal processing formulation for ITE without post-selection, and derive a new set of angles for the fixed-point search. These results collectively establish a deeper understanding of Grover's algorithm and suggest a potential role for thermodynamics and geometry in quantum algorithm design.</description>

      <title>Neural network for excess noise estimation in continuous-variable quantum key distribution under composable finite-size security</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameter estimation is a critical step in continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD), especially in the finite-size regime where worst-case confidence intervals can significantly reduce the achievable secret-key rate. We provide a finite-size security analysis demonstrating that neural networks can be reliably employed for parameter estimation in CV-QKD with quantifiable failure probabilities $\epsilon_{PE}$, endowed with an operational interpretation and composable security guarantees. Using a protocol that is operationally equivalent to standard approaches, our method produces significantly tighter confidence intervals, unlocking higher key rates even under collective Gaussian attacks. The proposed approach yields tighter confidence intervals, leading to a quantifiable increase in the secret-key rate under collective Gaussian attacks. These results open up new perspectives for integrating modern machine learning techniques into quantum cryptographic protocols, particularly in practical resource-constrained scenarios.</description>

      <title>Fault tolerant Operations in Majorana-based Quantum Codes: Gates, Measurements and High Rate Constructions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Majorana-based quantum computation in nanowires and neutral atoms has gained prominence as a promising platform to encode qubits and protect them against noise. In order to run computations reliably on such devices, a fully fault-tolerant scheme is needed for state preparation, gates, and measurements. However, current fault-tolerant schemes have either been limited to specific code families or have not been developed fully. In this work, we develop a general framework for fault-tolerant computation with logical degrees encoded into Majorana hardware. We emphasize the division between even and odd Majorana codes and how it manifests when constructing fault tolerant gadgets for these families. We provide transversal constructions and supplement them with measurements to obtain several examples of fault tolerant Clifford gadgets. For the case of odd codes, we give a novel construction for gadgets using quantum reference frames, that allows to implement operations that are forbidden due to parity superselection. We also provide a fault-tolerant measurement scheme for Majorana codes inspired by Steane error correction, enabling state preparation, measurement of logical operations and error correction. We also point out a construction for odd Majorana codes with transversal T gates. Finally, we construct a high rate quantum LDPC Majorana code with logical qubits. Our work shows that all necessary elements of fault-tolerant quantum computation can be consistently implemented in fermionic hardware such as Majorana nanowires and fermionic neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>Cultivating T states on the surface code with only two-qubit gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-fidelity T magic states are a key requirement for fault-tolerant quantum computing in 2D. It has generally been assumed that preparing high-fidelity T states requires noisy injection of T states followed by lengthy distillation routines. This assumption has been recently challenged by the introduction of cultivation, in which careful state injection and postselection alone are used to prepare T states close to the fidelity required for quantum algorithms. Cultivation was originally proposed for the color code, but can also be done on the $RP^2$ code, a code similar to the surface code.
  In this work, we demonstrate how to cultivate T states directly on the surface code. Besides its simplicity compared to color or $RP^2$ cultivation, surface code cultivation offers a number of advantages, including: (1) It is more directly compatible with neutral atom architectures than ${RP}^2$ cultivation (2) Cultivated surface code states can be used in transversal CNOT gates with other surface codes, unlike color code states (3) Surface code cultivation can be done at any distance, unlike color and ${RP}^2$ cultivation which requires odd distances. Under a standard depolarizing error model, our $d=3,\ (4),\ (5)$ cultivation circuit reaches an error rate of $1\cdot 10^{-6},\ (1\cdot10^{-8}),\ (2\cdot10^{-9})$ and an acceptance rate of $34\%,\ (6\%),\ (1\%)$, meeting or exceeding the fidelity of color and $RP^2$ cultivation with comparable acceptance rates.</description>

Abstract: Optomechanical interactions between mechanical oscillators and an electromagnetic field induce controllable modifications in mechanical fluctuation. When multiple mechanical oscillators are coupled to a single electromagnetic mode, these interactions can be extended to utilize the electromagnetic mode as a mediator for distributing noise squeezing among different mechanical oscillators. We investigate the transfer of mechanical noise squeezing between two mechanical modes, enabled by a single microwave cavity mode which is strongly coupled to both mechanical modes. Noise squeezing in one mechanical mode (control) is achieved through parametric modulation of its resonance frequency via the optical spring effect. Simultaneously, optomechanical beam-splitter interaction is applied between the mechanical modes to transfer noise squeezing from the control mode to the other mode (target). Strong correlations between the quadratures of the two mechanical modes confirm that the observed squeezing in the target mode originates from the squeezing in the control mode. Remarkably, the observed squeezing transfer manifests noise characteristics of both single-mode and two-mode squeezing. This unique feature suggests that the squeezing transfer holds significant potential for enhancing precision measurements.</description>

      <title>Perfect pure quantum state transfer via state restoring and ancilla measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the protocol for perfect state transfer of an arbitrary pure quantum state along the spin-1/2 chain governed by the Hamiltonian preserving the excitation number in the system. We show that the $k$-excitation pure sender's state can be restored at the receiver using only the local transformations over the qubits of the extended receiver. The restored state appears in the superposition with other states which form garbage. This garbage can be easily removed by including the ancilla, whose state labels the garbage, and then measuring the {ancilla state} with desired output. The resulting state of the receiver coincides with the initial sender's state {up to the unimportant common phase factor.} Then, to transfer an arbitrary {pure} state of some system $S_0$, we encode this state into the $k$-excitation state of the sender, transfer and restore this state and finally decode the restored $k$-excitation state {of the receiver} into the state of another subsystem $R_0$. After labeling and removing the garbage via the ancilla-state measuring we complete the algorithm for the perfect transfer of an arbitrary pure state.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Recovery via Direct Sum Formalism Without Measurement Outcomes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a new approach to quantum state recovery following measurement. Specifically, we introduce a special operation that transfers the probability amplitude of the quantum state into its orthogonal complement. This operation is followed by a measurement performed on this orthogonal subspace, enabling the undisturbed original quantum state to be regained. Remarkably, this recovery is achieved without dependence of the post-measurement operation on the measurement outcome, thus allowing the recovery without historical dependence. This constitutes a highly nontrivial phenomenon. From the operational perspective, as the no-cloning theorem forbids perfect and probabilistic cloning of arbitrary quantum states, and traditional post-measurement reversal methods typically rely on operations contingent on the measurement outcomes, it questions fundamental assumptions regarding the necessity of historic dependence. From an informational perspective, since this recovery method erases the information about the measurement outcome, it's intriguing that the information can be erased without accessing the measurement outcome. These results imply the operational and informational non-triviality formulated in a direct-sum Hilbert space framework.</description>

Abstract: Physical quantities with long lifetimes have both theoretical significance in the study of quantum many-body systems and practical implications for quantum technologies. In this manuscript, we investigate the roles played by topological defects in the construction of quasi-conserved quantities, using as a prototypical example the Kramers-Wannier duality defect in a deformed 1d quantum transverse field Ising model. We construct the duality defect Hamiltonian in three different ways: half-chain Kramers-Wannier transformation, utilization of techniques in the Ising fusion category, and defect-modified weak integrability breaking deformation. The third method is also applicable for the study of generic integrable defects under weak integrability breaking deformations. We also work out the deformation of defect-modified higher charges in the model and study their slower decay behavior. Furthermore, we consider the corresponding duality defect twisted deformed Floquet transverse field Ising model, and investigate the stability of the isolated zero mode associated with the duality defect in the integrable Floquet Ising model, under such weak integrability breaking deformation.</description>

      <title>Correlation hypergraph: a new representation of a quantum marginal independence pattern</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18018v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of the quantum marginal independence problem, namely the question of which faces of the subadditivity cone are achievable by quantum states. We introduce a new representation of the patterns of marginal independence (PMIs, corresponding to faces of the subadditivity cone) based on certain correlation hypergraphs, and demonstrate that this representation provides a more efficient description of a PMI, and consequently of the set of PMIs which are compatible with strong subadditivity. We then show that these correlation hypergraphs generalize to arbitrary quantum systems the well known relation between positivity of mutual information and connectivity of entanglement wedges in holography, and further use this representation to derive new results about the combinatorial structure of collections of simultaneously decorrelated subsystems specifying SSA-compatible PMIs. In the context of holography, we apply these techniques to derive a necessary condition for the realizability of entropy vectors by simple tree graph models, which were conjectured in arXiv:2204.00075 to provide the building blocks of the holographic entropy cone. Since this necessary condition is formulated in terms of chordality of a certain graph, it can be tested efficiently.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian geometry, topology, and dynamics of a nonreciprocal Su-Schrieffer-Heeger ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity naturally breaks down the adiabaticity and thus leads to non-Abelian behaviors in multi-band systems. Here, we study how non-Abelian properties emerge in non-Hermitian systems by considering a multi-band non-Hermitian model -- the nonreciprocal Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) ladder that is formed by coupling two nonreciprocal SSH chains. Under periodic boundary conditions, we analytically obtain the exact phase diagrams of the geometry of band structure classified by its complex value and gap type, and of the non-Abelian topology based on a newly defined gauge-invariant winding number under the chiral symmetry. Under open boundary conditions, we find that the bulk-boundary correspondence survives in the thermodynamic limit but breaks down for finite sizes along with the emergence of critical non-Hermitian skin effects when the inter-leg coupling is weak, where the decaying length $\xi$ of the bulk skin modes varies with the system size $L$, satisfying the scale-free power law $\xi\propto L$. Finally, we demonstrate the non-Abelian dynamics of a Bloch state subject to an external constant force in the pseudo-Hermitian symmetric regime in comparison with the non-Hermitian Wilson lines. Our work may stimulate further interests in nontrivial non-Abelian behaviors in non-Hermitian and open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transport and Molecular Sensing in Reduced Graphene Oxide Measured with Scanning Probe Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report combined scanning probe microscopy and electrical measurements to investigate local electronic transport in reduced graphene oxide (rGO) devices. We demonstrate that quantum transport in these materials can be significantly tuned by the electrostatic potential applied with a conducting atomic force microscope (AFM) tip. Scanning gate microscopy (SGM) reveals a clear p-type response in which local gating modulates the source-drain current, while scanning impedance microscopy (SIM) indicates corresponding shifts of the Fermi level under different gating conditions. The observed transport behavior arises from the combined effects of the AFM tip induced Fermi level shifts and defect mediated scattering. These results show that resonant scattering associated with impurities or structural defects plays a central role and highlight the strong influence of local electrostatic potentials on rGO conduction. Consistent with this electrostatic control, the device also exhibits chemical gating and sensing: during exposure to electron-withdrawing molecules (acetone), the source-drain current increases reversibly and returns to baseline upon purging with air. Repeated cycles over 15 minutes show reproducible amplitudes and recovery. Using a simple transport model we estimate an increase of about 40 percent in carrier density during exposure, consistent with p-type doping by electron-accepting analytes. These findings link nanoscale electrostatic control to macroscopic sensing performance, advancing the understanding of charge transport in rGO and underscoring its promise for nanoscale electronics, flexible chemical sensors, and tunable optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e Superradiance in Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics with Quantum Atom Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17696v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a novel platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena, the moir\'e lattice has garnered significant interest in solid-state physics, photonics, and cold atom physics. While moir\'e lattices in two- and three-dimensional systems have been proposed for neutral cold atoms, the simpler one-dimensional moir\'e effect remains largely unexplored. We present a scheme demonstrating moir\'e effects in a one-dimensional cold atom-cavity coupling system, which resembles a generalized open Dicke model exhibiting superradiant phase transitions. We reveal a strong link between the phase transition critical point and the one-dimensional moir\'e parameter. Evidences of the one-dimensional moir\'e effect are explicitly explored, including cavity field spectrum, phase transition dynamics, and anomalous atomic diffusion. This work provides a new route for testing one-dimensional moir\'e effects with cold atoms and open new possibility of moir\'e metrology.</description>

      <title>Nonseparability of multipartite systems in dilaton black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nonseparability of N-partite quantum systems by employing the Abe-Rajagopal (AR) $q$-conditional entropy for both free bosonic and fermionic fields in the background of a Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) dilaton black hole. An intriguing finding is that the Hawking effect of the black hole can generate a net nonseparability of W state for fermionic field. Notably, we observe that fermionic nonseparability exhibits a stronger robustness than its bosonic counterpart, while fermionic coherence is found to be weaker than bosonic coherence within the dilaton black hole background. Additionally, our analysis reveals that the nonseparability of GHZ state is more pronounced than that of W state, yet quantum coherence of GHZ state is comparatively weaker than that of W state in dilaton spacetime. These results suggest that choosing the appropriate quantum resources for different particle types and quantum state configurations is essential for effectively tackling relativistic quantum information tasks.</description>

      <title>Towards a $\cos(2\varphi)$ Josephson element using aluminum junctions with well-transmitted channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21494v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for fabricating all-aluminum Josephson junctions with highly transmitted conduction channels. Such properties are typically associated with structures requiring intricate fabrication processes, such as atomic contacts or hybrid junctions based on semiconducting nanowires and 2D materials. In contrast, our approach relies solely on standard nanofabrication techniques. The resulting devices exhibit a key signature of high-transmission junctions - Multiple Andreev Reflections (MAR) - in their current-voltage characteristics. Furthermore, we propose a straightforward superconducting circuit design based on these junctions, enabling the implementation of a parity-protected qubit.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the relaxation of constraints in gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02468v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, there were works claiming that path integral quantisation of gauge theories necessarily requires relaxation of Lagrangian constraints. As has also been noted in the literature, it is of course wrong since there perfectly exist gauge field quantisations respecting the constraints, and at the same time the very idea of changing the classical theory in this way has many times appeared in other works. On the other hand, what was done in the path integral approach is fixing a gauge in terms of zero-momentum variables. We would like to show that this relaxation is what normally happens when one fixes such a gauge at the level of action principle in a Lagrangian theory. Moreover, there is an interesting analogy to be drawn. Namely, one of the ways to quantise a gauge theory is to build an extended Hamiltonian and then add new conditions by hand such as to make it a second class system. The constraints' relaxation occurs when one does the same at the level of the total Hamiltonian, i.e. a second class system with the primary constraints only.</description>

      <title>Subsystem Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases from Subsystem SymTFT of 2-Foliated Exotic Tensor Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), or topological holography, posits a correspondence between symmetries in a $d$-dimensional theory and topological order in a $(d+1)$-dimensional theory. In this work, we extend this framework to subsystem symmetries and develop subsystem SymTFT as a systematic tool to characterize and classify subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases. For $(2+1)$D gapped phases, we introduce a 2-foliated $(3+1)$D exotic tensor gauge theory (which is equivalent to 2-foliated $(3+1)$D BF theory via exotic duality) as the subsystem SymTFT and systematically analyze its topological boundary conditions and linearly rigid subsystem symmetries. Taking subsystem symmetry groups $G = \mathbb{Z}_N$ and $G=\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_M$ as examples, we demonstrate how to recover the classification scheme $\mathcal{C}[G] = H^{2}(G^{\times 2}, U(1)) / \left( H^2(G, U(1)) \right)^3$, which was previously derived by examining topological invariant under linear subsystem-symmetric local unitary transformations in the lattice Hamiltonian formalism. To illustrate the correspondence between field-theoretic and lattice descriptions, we further analyze $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_M$ cluster state models as concrete examples.</description>

      <title>Ultra-long-living magnons in the quantum limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherence time is a key property of quantum systems, determining how long quantum information can be preserved. In solid-state platforms, this parameter is closely linked to the lifetime of quasiparticles that can store quantum information. For decades, magnons - quasiparticles arising from collective magnetization dynamics - have exhibited lifetimes below one microsecond at gigahertz frequencies, limiting their viability as quantum information carriers. Here, we report the discovery of short-wavelength magnons with lifetimes exceeding 18 {\mu}s at millikelvin temperatures. The experiment was performed on an ultra-pure single-crystal Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) sphere over a wide temperature range, from ambient down to 30 mK. These results directly confirm the theoretical prediction that the magnon lifetime in an ideal YIG crystal at zero temperature is infinite, paving the way for the engineering of lossless magnetic systems in which magnons will be employed as long-lived carriers of information for quantum gates and quantum storage.</description>

      <title>Design and Optimization of Spin Dynamics in Ge Quantum Dots: g-Factor Modulation, Dephasing Sweet Spots, and Phonon-Induced Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of spin dynamics in hole-based quantum dot qubits demands high-fidelity simulations that capture realistic device geometries, material interfaces, and self-consistent electrostatics. Here, we present a comprehensive three-dimensional study of gate-defined quantum dot hole spin qubits in strained Si$_{0.2}$Ge$_{0.8}$/Ge heterostructures. In contrast to prior work relying on idealized confinement or decoupled Poisson-Schr\"odinger treatments, our approach combines self-consistent electrostatics with a four-band Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian to resolve spin-orbit interactions, wavefunction asymmetries, and g-tensor anisotropies in realistic device structures. We quantify the impact of device size and gate bias on wavefunction localization, electric-field-induced g-factor modulation, and identify "sweet spots" in vertical electric field where g-factor sensitivity to charge noise is minimized, enhancing spin dephasing times. Spin relaxation due to phonon coupling is also modeled, revealing size-dependent T1 behavior consistent with strong Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling and a magnetic-field scaling near $B^{-8}$. This work establishes a predictive modeling framework for optimizing spin coherence in planar Ge quantum dots and provides quantitative design guidance for scalable, electrically controlled hole spin qubits in group-IV semiconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum instruments are mathematical devices introduced to describe the conditional state change during a quantum process. They are completely positive map valued measures on measurable spaces. We may also view them as non-commutative analogues of joint probability measures. We analyze the $C^*$-convexity structure of spaces of quantum instruments. A complete description of the $C^*$-extreme instruments in finite dimensions has been established. Further, the implications of $C^*$-extremity between quantum instruments and their marginals has been explored.</description>

      <title>Letter of Intent: AICE - 100m Atom Interferometer Experiment at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an O(100)m Atom Interferometer (AI) experiment - AICE - to be installed against a wall of the PX46 access shaft to the LHC. This experiment would probe unexplored ranges of the possible couplings of bosonic ultralight dark matter (ULDM) to atomic constituents and undertake a pioneering search for gravitational waves (GWs) at frequencies intermediate between those to which existing and planned experiments are sensitive, among other fundamental physics studies. A conceptual feasibility study showed that this AI experiment could be isolated from the LHC by installing a shielding wall in the TX46 gallery, and surveyed issues related to the proximity of the LHC machine, finding no technical obstacles. A detailed technical implementation study has shown that the preparatory civil-engineering work, installation of bespoke radiation shielding, deployment of access-control systems and safety alarms, and installation of an elevator platform could be carried out during LS3, allowing installation and operation of the AICE detector to proceed during Run 4 without impacting HL-LHC operation. These studies have established that PX46 is a uniquely promising location for an AI experiment. We foresee that, if the CERN management encourages this Letter of Intent, a significant fraction of the Terrestrial Very Long Baseline Atom Interferometer (TVLBAI) Proto-Collaboration may wish to contribute to AICE.</description>
