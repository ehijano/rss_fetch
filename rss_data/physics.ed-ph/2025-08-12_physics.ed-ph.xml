      <title>Computation and Experimentation as Equal Partners in a Modern Physics Lab Exercise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experience with experimental and computational work are important components of students' understanding of the practice of physics. Physics departments typically use specific experimental lab courses and computational lab courses to develop students' skills in these areas. However these siloed experiences do not accurately represent the nuanced interplay between the theory, computation, and experiment that occurs outside of the curricular setting when physicists are building and testing models of the physical world. To expose students to this interplay, we have integrated computational and experimental work as equal partners within two radioactivity labs that occur within our modern physics lab course - the decay of $^{137}{\rm Ba}$ and the simultaneous decay of two silver isotopes in pre-1965 quarters. We present both of these labs and potential extensions that allow students to iterate on their theoretical, computational and/or experimental models based on what they learn from their initial investigation.</description>

      <title>Teaching Problem Solving in Undergraduate Physics Courses: An Endorsement for Deliberate Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing expert-like problem-solving skills is a central goal of undergraduate physics education. In this study, we investigate the impact of teaching explicit problem-solving frameworks, combined with deliberate practice, on students' problem-solving approaches. Using multidimensional scaling to analyze students' decision-making patterns, we compare the similarity of students taught with these methods to physics experts and to students taught with traditional repeated practice. Our results show that students who received structured frameworks and targeted feedback through deliberate practice exhibited problem-solving behaviors significantly more aligned with those of experts. These findings suggest that pedagogies emphasizing explicit strategy instruction with feedback are more effective than rote repetition for fostering expertise. We recommend integration of these approaches into physics curricula to better support the development of skilled and adaptive problem solvers.</description>

      <title>Numeric simulations build a bridge from a two-slit experiment to the basics of X-ray diffraction and coherent optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numeric simulations based on the Huygens-Fresnel method allow one to develop intuition about the behavior of coherent light in diffraction and interference experiments. They give an opportunity to numerically observe and appreciate a number important phenomena, while avoiding the need to deal with the intricacies of their analytic descriptions. In an introductory teaching lab, they help to build a matrix of ideas, into which many optical demonstration experiments fall nicely and to the benefit of a student.</description>
