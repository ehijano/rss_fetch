      <title>Csi-LLM: A Novel Downlink Channel Prediction Method Aligned with LLM Pre-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Downlink channel temporal prediction is a critical technology in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, existing methods that rely on fixed-step historical sequences significantly limit the accuracy, practicality, and scalability of channel prediction. Recent advances have shown that large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong pattern recognition and reasoning abilities over complex sequences. The challenge lies in effectively aligning wireless communication data with the modalities used in natural language processing to fully harness these capabilities. In this work, we introduce Csi-LLM, a novel LLM-powered downlink channel prediction technique that models variable-step historical sequences. To ensure effective cross-modality application, we align the design and training of Csi-LLM with the processing of natural language tasks, leveraging the LLM's next-token generation capability for predicting the next step in channel state information (CSI). Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this alignment strategy, with Csi-LLM consistently delivering stable performance improvements across various scenarios and showing significant potential in continuous multi-step prediction.</description>

      <title>Channel Knowledge Map for Cellular-Connected UAV via Binary Bayesian Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) is a promising technology to enable environment-aware wireless communications and sensing. Link state map (LSM) is one particular type of CKM that aims to learn the location-specific line-of-sight (LoS) link probability between the transmitter and the receiver at all possible locations, which provides the prior information to enhance the communication quality of dynamic networks. This paper investigates the LSM construction for cellularconnected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) by utilizing both the expert empirical mathematical model and the measurement data. Specifically, we first model the LSM as a binary spatial random field and its initial distribution is obtained by the empirical model. Then we propose an effective binary Bayesian filter to sequentially update the LSM by using the channel measurement. To efficiently update the LSM, we establish the spatial correlation models of LoS probability on the location pairs in both the distance and angular domains, which are adopted in the Bayesian filter for updating the probabilities at locations without measurements. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for LSM construction, which significantly outperforms the benchmark scheme, especially when the measurements are sparse.</description>

      <title>GNN-Empowered Effective Partial Observation MARL Method for AoI Management in Multi-UAV Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), due to their low cost and high flexibility, have been widely used in various scenarios to enhance network performance. However, the optimization of UAV trajectories in unknown areas or areas without sufficient prior information, still faces challenges related to poor planning performance and low distributed execution. These challenges arise when UAVs rely solely on their own observation information and the information from other UAVs within their communicable range, without access to global information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Qedgix framework, which combines graph neural networks (GNNs) and the QMIX algorithm to achieve distributed optimization of the Age of Information (AoI) for users in unknown scenarios. The framework utilizes GNNs to extract information from UAVs, users within the observable range, and other UAVs within the communicable range, thereby enabling effective UAV trajectory planning. Due to the discretization and temporal features of AoI indicators, the Qedgix framework employs QMIX to optimize distributed partially observable Markov decision processes (Dec-POMDP) based on centralized training and distributed execution (CTDE) with respect to mean AoI values of users. By modeling the UAV network optimization problem in terms of AoI and applying the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, the Qedgix framework achieves efficient neural network training through parameter sharing based on permutation invariance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly improves convergence speed while reducing the mean AoI values of users.

      <title>Partitioned Successive-Cancellation List Flip Decoding of Polar Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently proposed Successive-Cancellation List Flip (SCLF) decoding algorithm for polar codes improves the error-correcting performance of state-of-the-art SC List (SCL) decoding. However, it comes at the cost of a higher complexity. In this paper, we propose the Partitioned SCLF decoding algorithm, an algorithm that divides a word in partitions and applies SCLF decoding to each partition separately. Compared to SCLF, PSCLF allows early termination but is more susceptible to cyclic-redundancy check (CRC) collisions. In order to maximize the coding gain, a new partition design tailored to PSCLF is proposed as well as the possibility to support different CRC lengths. Numerical results show that the proposed PSCLF algorithm has an error-correction performance gain of up to 0.15 dB with respect to SCLF. Moreover, the proposed CRC structure permits to mitigate the error-correction loss at low frame-error rate (FER) due to CRC collisions, showing a gain of 0.2 dB at $\text{FER}=10^{-4}$ with respect to the regular CRC structure. The average execution time of PSCLF is shown to be 1.5 times lower than that of SCLF, and matches the latency of SCLF at $\text{FER}=4\cdot10^{-3}$ and lower.</description>

      <title>Dual-Polarized Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Based Antenna for Holographic MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic multiple-input-multiple output (HMIMO), which is enabled by large-scale antenna arrays with quasi-continuous apertures, is expected to be an important technology in the forthcoming 6G wireless network. Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-based antennas provide an energy-efficient solution for implementing HMIMO. Most existing works in this area focus on single-polarized RIS-enabled HMIMO, where the RIS can only reflect signals in one polarization towards users and signals in the other polarization cannot be received by intended users, leading to degraded data rate. To improve multiplexing performance, in this paper, we consider a dual-polarized RIS-enabled single-user HMIMO network, aiming to optimize power allocations across polarizations and analyze corresponding maximum system capacity. However, due to interference between different polarizations, the dual-polarized system cannot be simply decomposed into two independent single-polarized ones. Therefore, existing methods developed for the single-polarized system cannot be directly applied, which makes the optimization and analysis of the dual-polarized system challenging. To cope with this issue, we derive an asymptotically tight upper bound on the ergodic capacity, based on which the power allocations across two polarizations are optimized. Potential gains achievable with such dual-polarized RIS are analyzed. Numerical results verify our analysis.</description>

      <title>Highly-sensitive measure of complexity captures boolean networks regimes and temporal order more optimally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, several random Boolean networks (RBN) are generated and analyzed from two characteristics: their time evolution diagram and their transition diagram. For this purpose, its randomness is estimated using three measures, of which Algorithmic Complexity is capable of both a) revealing transitions towards the chaotic regime in a more marked way, and b) disclosing the algorithmic contribution of certain states to the transition diagram and their relationship with the order they occupy in the temporal evolution of the respective RBN. The results obtained from both types of analysis are useful for the introduction of both Algorithmic Complexity and Perturbation Analysis in the context of Boolean networks, and their potential applications in regulatory network models.</description>

      <title>Resource Management for IRS-Assisted Full-Duplex Integrated Sensing, Communication and Computing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted full-duplex (FD) integrated sensing, communication and computing system. Specifically, an FD base station (BS) provides service for uplink and downlink transmission, and a local cache is connected to the BS through a backhaul link to store data. Meanwhile, active sensing elements are deployed on the IRS to receive target echo signals. On this basis, in order to evaluate the overall performance of the system under consideration, we propose a system utility maximization problem while ensuring the sensing quality, expressed as the difference between the sum of communication throughput, total computation bits (offloading bits and local computation bits) and the total backhaul cost for content delivery. This makes the problem difficult to solve due to the highly non-convex coupling of the optimization variables. To effectively solve this problem, we first design the most effective caching strategy. Then, we develop an algorithm based on weighted minimum mean square error, alternative direction method of multipliers, majorization-minimization framework, semi-definite relaxation techniques, and several complex transformations to jointly solve the optimization variables. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the utility performance of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed scheme compared with the baseline scheme.</description>

      <title>Generalized Orthogonal Chirp Division Multiplexing in Doubly Selective Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, orthogonal chirp division modulation (OCDM) has gained attention as a robust communication waveform due to its strong resistance to both time-domain and frequency-domain interference. However, similar to orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), OCDM suffers from a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), resulting in increased hardware costs and reduced energy efficiency of the transmitter's power amplifiers. In this work, we introduce a novel unitary transform called the Generalized Discrete Fresnel Transform (GDFnT) and propose a new waveform based on this transform, named Generalized Orthogonal Chirp Division Modulation (GOCDM). In GOCDM, data symbols from the constellation diagram are independently placed in the Generalized Fresnel (GF) domain. We derive the GF-domain channel matrix for the GOCDM system under time-frequency doubly selective channels and leverages the sparsity of the GF-domain channel matrix to design an iterative receiver based on the message-passing algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that GOCDM achieves better PAPR performance than OCDM without compromising bit error rate (BER) performance.</description>

      <title>Interference-Cancellation-Based Channel Knowledge Map Construction and Its Applications to Channel Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) is viewed as a digital twin of wireless channels, providing location-specific channel knowledge for environment-aware communications. A fundamental problem in CKM-assisted communications is how to construct the CKM efficiently. Current research focuses on interpolating or predicting channel knowledge based on error-free channel knowledge from measured regions, ignoring the extraction of channel knowledge. This paper addresses this gap by unifying the extraction and representation of channel knowledge. We propose a novel CKM construction framework that leverages the received signals of the base station (BS) as online and low-cost data. Specifically, we partition the BS coverage area into spatial grids. The channel knowledge per grid is represented by a set of multi-path powers, delays, and angles, based on the principle of spatial consistency. In the extraction of these channel parameters, the challenges lie in strong inter-cell interferences and non-linear relationship between received signals and channel parameters. To address these issues, we formulate the problem of CKM construction into a problem of Bayesian inference, employing a block-sparsity prior model to characterize the path-loss differences of interferers. Under the Bayesian inference framework, we develop a hybrid message-passing algorithm for the interference-cancellation-based CKM construction. Based on the CKM, we obtain the joint frequency-space covariance of user channel and design a CKM-assisted Bayesian channel estimator. The computational complexity of the channel estimator is substantially reduced by exploiting the CKM-derived covariance structure. Numerical results show that the proposed CKM provides accurate channel parameters at low signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and that the CKM-assisted channel estimator significantly outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts.</description>

      <title>Non-negative Sparse Recovery at Minimal Sampling Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that sparse recovery is possible if the number of measurements is in the order of the sparsity, but the corresponding decoders either lack polynomial decoding time or robustness to noise. Commonly, decoders that rely on a null space property are being used. These achieve polynomial time decoding and are robust to additive noise but pay the price by requiring more measurements. The non-negative least residual has been established as such a decoder for non-negative recovery. A new equivalent condition for uniform, robust recovery of non-negative sparse vectors with the non-negative least residual that is not based on null space properties is introduced. It is shown that the number of measurements for this equivalent condition only needs to be in the order of the sparsity. Further, it is explained why the robustness to additive noise is similar, but not equal, to the robustness of decoders based on null space properties.</description>

      <title>Communicating in the Mediumband:What it is and Why it Matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper, based on recent research, articulates the opportunities and challenges posed by an emerging area of study known as ``mediumband wireless communication'', which refers to digital radio-frequency (RF) wireless communication through mediumband channels. This class of channels that falls in the transitional region between the narrowband and broadband channels, in many ways, is unique and shows significant potential. For instance, the effect of a highly unfavourable non-line-of-sight (NLoS) propagation environment can be transformed into a significantly favourable condition without making any intervention on the original propagation environment, but by simply communicating in the mediumband. The more unfavourable a propagation environment for wireless communication, the higher the potential gain by communicating in the mediumband. In this paper, using lay language as much as possible, we elaborate the unique properties of mediumband channels and implications of communicating in the mediumband for wider wireless communication along with some future research directions.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Designs for SIM-Based Broadcast MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM), which consists of multiple layers of intelligent metasurfaces, is emerging as a promising solution for future wireless communication systems. In this timely context, we focus on broadcast multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems and aim to characterize their energy efficiency (EE) performance. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the potential of SIM, we consider both dirty paper coding (DPC) and linear precoding and formulate the corresponding EE maximization problems. For DPC, we employ the broadcast channel (BC)-multiple-access channel (MAC) duality to obtain an equivalent problem, and optimize users' covariance matrices using the successive convex approximation (SCA) method, which is based on a tight lower bound of the achievable sum-rate, in combination with Dinkelbach's method. Since optimizing the phase shifts of the SIM meta-elements is an optimization problem of extremely large size, we adopt a conventional projected gradient-based method for its simplicity. A similar approach is derived for the case of linear precoding. Simulation results show that the proposed optimization methods for the considered SIM-based systems can significantly improve the EE, compared to the conventional counterparts. Also, we demonstrate that the number of SIM meta-elements and their distribution across the SIM layers have a significant impact on both the achievable sum-rate and EE performance.</description>

      <title>Indoor Sensing with Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cellular wireless networks are evolving towards acquiring newer capabilities, such as sensing, which will support novel use cases and applications. Many of these require indoor sensing capabilities, which can be realized by exploiting the perturbation in the indoor channel. In this work, we conduct an indoor channel measurement campaign to study these perturbations and develop AI-based algorithms for estimating sensing parameters. We develop several AI methods based on CNN and tree-based ensemble architectures for sensing. We show that the presence of a passive target like a person can be detected from the channel perturbation of a single link with more than 90 % accuracy with a simple CNN based AI algorithm. However, sensing the position of a passive target is far more challenging requiring more complex AI algorithms and deployments. We show that the position of the human in the indoor room can be estimated within the average position error of 0.7 m with a deployment having three links and employing complex AI architecture for position estimation. We also compare the results with the baseline algorithm to demonstrate the utility of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>On the Price of Decentralization in Decentralized Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fundamental limits on the error probabilities of a family of decentralized detection algorithms (eg., the social learning rule proposed by Lalitha et al. over directed graphs are investigated. In decentralized detection, a network of nodes locally exchanging information about the samples they observe with their neighbors to collectively infer the underlying unknown hypothesis. Each node in the network weighs the messages received from its neighbors to form its private belief and only requires knowledge of the data generating distribution of its observation. In this work, it is first shown that while the original social learning rule of Lalitha et al. achieves asymptotically vanishing error probabilities as the number of samples tends to infinity, it suffers a gap in the achievable error exponent compared to the centralized case. The gap is due to the network imbalance caused by the local weights that each node chooses to weigh the messages received from its neighbors. To close this gap, a modified learning rule is proposed and shown to achieve error exponents as large as those in the centralized setup. This implies that there is essentially no first-order penalty caused by decentralization in the exponentially decaying rate of error probabilities.</description>

      <title>Achieving Optimal Short-Blocklength Secrecy Rate Using Multi-Kernel PAC Codes for the Binary Erasure Wiretap Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate practical short-blocklength coding for the semi-deterministic binary erasure wiretap channel (BE-WTC), where the main channel to the legitimate receiver is noiseless, and the eavesdropper's channel is a binary erasure channel (BEC). It is shown that under the average total variation distance secrecy metric, multi-kernel polarization-adjusted convolutional (MK-PAC) codes can achieve the best possible theoretical secrecy rate at blocklengths of 16, 32, 64, and 128 if the secrecy leakage is less than or equal to certain values.</description>

      <title>Geno-Weaving: Low-Complexity Capacity-Achieving DNA Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a possible implementation of data storage using DNA, multiple strands of DNA are stored in a liquid container so that, in the future, they can be read by an array of DNA readers in parallel. These readers will sample the strands with replacement to produce a random number of noisy reads for each strand. An essential component of such a data storage system is how to reconstruct data out of these unsorted, repetitive, and noisy reads.
  It is known that if a single read can be modeled by a substitution channel $W$, then the overall capacity can be expressed by the "Poisson-ization" of $W$. In this paper, we lay down a rateless code along each strand to encode its index; we then lay down a capacity-achieving block code at the same position across all strands to protect data. That weaves a low-complexity coding scheme that achieves DNA's capacity.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Position-Fluid Antenna Array for Ultra-dense Connectivity in Terahertz Beamforming Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The position-fluid antenna (PFA) architecture has become one of the appealing technologies to support ubiquitous connectivity demand in next-generation wireless systems. Specifically, allowing the antenna to adjust its physical position to one of the predefined ports within a fixed region can introduce additional spatial diversity and improve the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). In addition, frequency diversity is also widely-explored through frequency interleaving in the terahertz (THz) band. However, the operating bandwidth of one antenna is usually limited to 10% of the central frequency, which imposes a waste of the ultra-broad bandwidth in the THz band. In light of this, a frequency-position-fluid antenna (FPFA) system is proposed in this paper to facilitate ultra-dense connectivity. Specifically, antennas with non-overlapping operating frequency ranges are deployed at the base station (BS) to expand the total available bandwidth and provide frequency domain diversity, while the PFA-enabled users are capable of providing the spatial domain diversity. The channel model is first derived, based on which a channel correlation-based frequency allocation strategy is proposed. Then, a minimum-projection-based port selection algorithm is developed with singular-value-decomposition (SVD) precoders. Simulation results show that the proposed FPFA architecture exhibits steady performance with an increasing number of users, and outperforms the PFA and the fixed-antenna system in ultra-dense user deployment.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an uplink over-the-air aggregation (OAA) method for wireless federated learning (FL) that simultaneously trains multiple models. To maximize the multi-model training convergence rate, we derive an upper bound on the optimality gap of the global model update, and then, formulate an uplink joint transmit-receive beamforming optimization problem to minimize this upper bound. We solve this problem using the block coordinate descent approach, which admits low-complexity closed-form updates. Simulation results show that our proposed multi-model FL with fast OAA substantially outperforms sequentially training multiple models under the conventional single-model approach.</description>

      <title>Bounds for Joint Detection and Decoding on the Binary-Input AWGN Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For asynchronous transmission of short blocks, preambles for packet detection contribute a non-negligible overhead. To reduce the required preamble length, joint detection and decoding (JDD) techniques have been proposed that additionally utilize the payload part of the packet for detection. In this paper, we analyze two instances of JDD, namely hybrid preamble and energy detection (HyPED) and decoder-aided detection (DAD). While HyPED combines the preamble with energy detection for the payload, DAD also uses the output of a channel decoder. For these systems, we propose novel achievability and converse bounds for the rates over the binary-input additive white Gaussian noise (BI-AWGN) channel. Moreover, we derive a general bound on the required blocklength for JDD. Both the theoretical bound and the simulation of practical codebooks show that the rate of DAD quickly approaches that of synchronous transmission.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Atomic Norm for parametric estimation of sparse channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric channel estimation in mmWave not only enables the anticipated large spectral efficiency gains of \acs{MIMO} systems but also reveals important propagation parameters, allowing for a low complexity representation of the channel matrix. In this work, we propose to use atomic norm as a gridless multidimensional spectral estimation approach to address parametric channel estimation where both AoD and AoA are identified. The conditions for recovery of the propagation parameters are given depending on properties of the measurement matrix, and on structural features such as the antenna geometry or the number of scatters to resolve. The proposed methodology is compared against several state-of-the-art parametric approaches.</description>

      <title>Exact Error Exponents of Concatenated Codes for DNA Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a concatenated coding based class of DNA storage codes in which the selected molecules are constrained to be taken from an ``inner'' codebook associated with the sequencing channel. This codebook is used in a ``black-box'' manner, and is only assumed to operate at an achievable rate in the sense of attaining asymptotically vanishing maximal (inner) error probability. We first derive the exact error exponent in a widely-studied regime of constant rate and a linear number of sequencing reads, and show strict improvements over an existing achievable error exponent. Moreover, our achievability analysis is based on a coded-index strategy, implying that such strategies attain the highest error exponents within the broader class of codes that we consider. We then extend our results to other scaling regimes, including a super-linear number of reads, as well as several certain low-rate regimes. We find that the latter comes with notable intricacies, such as the suboptimality of codewords with all distinct molecules, and certain dependencies of the error exponents on the model for sequencing errors.</description>

      <title>Refined Statistical Bounds for Classification Error Mismatches with Constrained Bayes Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In statistical classification/multiple hypothesis testing and machine learning, a model distribution estimated from the training data is usually applied to replace the unknown true distribution in the Bayes decision rule, which introduces a mismatch between the Bayes error and the model-based classification error. In this work, we derive the classification error bound to study the relationship between the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the classification error mismatch. We first reconsider the statistical bounds based on classification error mismatch derived in previous works, employing a different method of derivation. Then, motivated by the observation that the Bayes error is typically low in machine learning tasks like speech recognition and pattern recognition, we derive a refined Kullback-Leibler-divergence-based bound on the error mismatch with the constraint that the Bayes error is lower than a threshold.</description>

      <title>Exploring Hannan Limitation for 3D Antenna Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hannan Limitation successfully links the directivity characteristics of 2D arrays with the aperture gain limit, providing the radiation efficiency upper limit for large 2D planar antenna arrays. This demonstrates the inevitable radiation efficiency degradation caused by mutual coupling effects between array elements. However, this limitation is derived based on the assumption of infinitely large 2D arrays, which means that it is not an accurate law for small-size arrays. In this paper, we extend this theory and propose an estimation formula for the radiation efficiency upper limit of finite-sized 2D arrays. Furthermore, we analyze a 3D array structure consisting of two parallel 2D arrays. Specifically, we provide evaluation formulas for the mutual coupling strengths for both infinite and finite size arrays and derive the fundamental efficiency limit of 3D arrays. Moreover, based on the established gain limit of antenna arrays with fixed aperture sizes, we derive the achievable gain limit of finite size 3D arrays. Besides the performance analyses, we also investigate the spatial radiation characteristics of the considered 3D array structure, offering a feasible region for 2D phase settings under a given energy attenuation threshold. Through simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed theories and gain advantages of 3D arrays for better spatial coverage under various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Optimal SSB Beam Planning and UAV Cell Selection for 5G Connectivity on Aerial Highways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a method to optimize 5G massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) connectivity for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) on aerial highways through strategic cell association. UAVs operating in 3D space encounter distinct channel conditions compared to traditional ground user equipment (gUE); under the typical line of sight (LoS) condition, UAVs perceive strong reference signal received power (RSRP) from multiple cells within the network, resulting in a large set of suitable serving cell candidates and in low signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) due to high interference levels. Additionally, a downside of aerial highways is to pack possibly many UAVs along a small portion of space which, when taking into account typical LoS propagation conditions, results in high channel correlation and severely limits spatial multiplexing capabilities.
  In this paper, we propose a solution to both problems based on the suitable selection of serving cells based on a new metric which differs from the classical terrestrial approaches based on maximum RSRP. We then introduce an algorithm for optimal planning of synchronization signal block (SSB) beams for this set of cells, ensuring maximum coverage and effective management of UAVs cell associations. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the rates of UAVs on aerial highways, up to four times in achievable data rates, without impacting ground user performance.</description>

      <title>Power Control and Random Serving Mode Allocation for CJT-NCJT Hybrid Mode Enabled Cell-Free Massive MIMO With Limited Fronthauls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a great potential of improving the service fairness and quality for user equipments (UEs), cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) has been regarded as an emerging candidate for 6G network architectures. Under ideal assumptions, the coherent joint transmission (CJT) serving mode has been considered as an optimal option for cell-free mMIMO systems, since it can achieve coherent cooperation gain among the access points. However, when considering the limited fronthaul constraint in practice, the non-coherent joint transmission (NCJT) serving mode is likely to outperform CJT, since the former requires much lower fronthaul resources. In other words, the performance excellence and worseness of single serving mode (CJT or NCJT) depends on the fronthaul capacity, and any single transmission mode cannot perfectly adapt the capacity limited fronthaul. To explore the performance potential of the cell-free mMIMO system with limited fronthauls by harnessing the merits of CJT and NCJT, we propose a CJT-NCJT hybrid serving mode framework, in which UEs are allocated to operate on CJT or NCJT serving mode. To improve the sum-rate of the system with low complexity, we first propose a probability-based random serving mode allocation scheme. With a given serving mode, a successive convex approximation-based power allocation algorithm is proposed to maximize the system's sum-rate. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Six-Dimensional Movable Antenna for Wireless Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is an emerging technology that is able to fully exploit the spatial variation of wireless channels by controlling the 3D positions and 3D rotations of distributed antennas/antenna surfaces at the transmitter/receiver. In this letter, we apply 6DMA at the base station (BS) to enhance its wireless sensing performance over a given set of regions. To this end, we first divide each region into a number of equal-size subregions and select one typical target location within each subregion. Then, we derive an expression for the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the directions of arrival (DoAs) from these typical target locations in all regions, which sheds light on the sensing performance of 6DMA enhanced systems in terms of a power gain and a geometric gain. Next, we minimize the CRB for DoA estimation via jointly optimizing the positions and rotations of all 6DMAs at the BS, subject to practical movement constraints, and propose an efficient algorithm to solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem sub-optimally. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the significant improvement in DoA estimation accuracy achieved by the proposed 6DMA sensing scheme as compared to various benchmark schemes, for both isotropic and directive antenna radiation patterns.</description>

      <title>Direction of Arrival Estimation with Sparse Subarrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes design techniques for partially-calibrated sparse linear subarrays and algorithms to perform direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. First, we introduce array architectures that incorporate two distinct array categories, namely type-I and type-II arrays. The former breaks down a known sparse linear geometry into as many pieces as we need, and the latter employs each subarray such as it fits a preplanned sparse linear geometry. Moreover, we devise two Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation algorithms that are suitable for partially-calibrated array scenarios within the coarray domain. The algorithms are capable of estimating a greater number of sources than the number of available physical sensors, while maintaining the hardware and computational complexity within practical limits for real-time implementation. To this end, we exploit the intersection of projections onto affine spaces by devising the Generalized Coarray Multiple Signal Classification (GCA-MUSIC) in conjunction with the estimation of a refined projection matrix related to the noise subspace, as proposed in the GCA root-MUSIC algorithm. An analysis is performed for the devised subarray configurations in terms of degrees of freedom, as well as the computation of the Cram\`er-Rao Lower Bound for the utilized data model, in order to demonstrate the good performance of the proposed methods. Simulations assess the performance of the proposed design methods and algorithms against existing approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While differentially private synthetic data generation has been explored extensively in the literature, how to update this data in the future if the underlying private data changes is much less understood. We propose an algorithmic framework for streaming data that generates multiple synthetic datasets over time, tracking changes in the underlying private data. Our algorithm satisfies differential privacy for the entire input stream (continual differential privacy) and can be used for high-dimensional tabular data. Furthermore, we show the utility of our method via experiments on real-world datasets. The proposed algorithm builds upon a popular select, measure, fit, and iterate paradigm (used by offline synthetic data generation algorithms) and private counters for streams.</description>

      <title>Online Optimization for Learning to Communicate over Time-Correlated Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques have garnered great interest in designing communication systems owing to their capacity in tacking with channel uncertainty. To provide theoretical guarantees for learning-based communication systems, some recent works analyze generalization bounds for devised methods based on the assumption of Independently and Identically Distributed (I.I.D.) channels, a condition rarely met in practical scenarios. In this paper, we drop the I.I.D. channel assumption and study an online optimization problem of learning to communicate over time-correlated channels. To address this issue, we further focus on two specific tasks: optimizing channel decoders for time-correlated fading channels and selecting optimal codebooks for time-correlated additive noise channels. For utilizing temporal dependence of considered channels to better learn communication systems, we develop two online optimization algorithms based on the optimistic online mirror descent framework. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees for proposed algorithms via deriving sub-linear regret bound on the expected error probability of learned systems. Extensive simulation experiments have been conducted to validate that our presented approaches can leverage the channel correlation to achieve a lower average symbol error rate compared to baseline methods, consistent with our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Leveraging parallelizability and channel structure in THz-band, Tbps channel-code decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As advancements close the gap between current device capabilities and the requirements for terahertz (THz)-band communications, the demand for terabit-per-second (Tbps) circuits is on the rise. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving Tbps data rates in THz-band communications by focusing on the baseband computation bottleneck. We propose leveraging parallel processing and pseudo-soft information (PSI) across multicarrier THz channels for efficient channel code decoding. We map bits to transmission resources using shorter code-words to enhance parallelizability and reduce complexity. Additionally, we integrate channel state information into PSI to alleviate the processing overhead of soft decoding. Results demonstrate that PSI-aided decoding of 64-bit code-words halves the complexity of 128-bit hard decoding under comparable effective rates, while introducing a 4 dB gain at a $10^{-3}$ block error rate. The proposed scheme approximates soft decoding with significant complexity reduction at a graceful performance cost.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Outdoor THz Links under Mixture Gamma Fading with Misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precision of link-level theoretical performance analysis for emerging wireless communication paradigms is critical. Recent studies have demonstrated the excellent fitting capabilities of the mixture gamma (MG) distribution in representing small-scale fading in outdoor terahertz (THz)-band scenarios. Our study establishes an in-depth performance analysis for outdoor point-to-point THz links under realistic configurations, incorporating MG small-scale fading combined with the misalignment effect. We derive closed-form expressions for the bit-error probability, outage probability, and ergodic capacity. Furthermore, we conduct an asymptotic analysis of these metrics at high signal-to-noise ratios and derive the necessary convergence conditions. Simulation results, leveraging precise measurement-based channel parameters in various configurations, closely align with the derived analytical equations.</description>

      <title>Entropy Loss: An Interpretability Amplifier of 3D Object Detection Network for Intelligent Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing complexity of the traffic environment, the significance of safety perception in intelligent driving is intensifying. Traditional methods in the field of intelligent driving perception rely on deep learning, which suffers from limited interpretability, often described as a "black box." This paper introduces a novel type of loss function, termed "Entropy Loss," along with an innovative training strategy. Entropy Loss is formulated based on the functionality of feature compression networks within the perception model. Drawing inspiration from communication systems, the information transmission process in a feature compression network is expected to demonstrate steady changes in information volume and a continuous decrease in information entropy. By modeling network layer outputs as continuous random variables, we construct a probabilistic model that quantifies changes in information volume. Entropy Loss is then derived based on these expectations, guiding the update of network parameters to enhance network interpretability. Our experiments indicate that the Entropy Loss training strategy accelerates the training process. Utilizing the same 60 training epochs, the accuracy of 3D object detection models using Entropy Loss on the KITTI test set improved by up to 4.47\% compared to models without Entropy Loss, underscoring the method's efficacy. The implementation code is available at \url{https://github.com/yhbcode000/Eloss-Interpretability}.</description>

      <title>Convolutional Beamspace Beamforming for Low-Complexity Far-Field and Near-Field MU-MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inter-user interference (IUI) mitigation has been an essential issue for multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) communications. The commonly used linear processing schemes include the maximum-ratio combining (MRC), zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean squared error (MMSE) beamforming, which may result in the unfavorable performance or complexity as the antenna number grows. In this paper, we introduce a low-complexity linear beamforming solution for the IUI mitigation by using the convolutional beamspace (CBS) technique. Specifically, the dimension of channel matrix can be significantly reduced via the CBS preprocessing, thanks to its beamspace and spatial filtering effects. However, existing methods of the spatial filter design mainly benefit from the Vandermonde structure of channel matrix, which only holds for the far-field scenario with the uniform plane wave (UPW) model. As the antenna size increases, this characteristic may vanish in the near-field region of the array, where the uniform spherical wave (USW) propagation becomes dominant. To gain useful insights, we first investigate the beamforming design and performance analysis of the CBS-based beamforming based on the UPW model. Our results unveil that the proposed CBS-based MMSE beamforming is able to achieve a near-optimal performance but demands remarkably lower complexity than classical ZF and MMSE schemes. Furthermore, our analysis is also extended to the near-field case. To this end, a novel optimization-based CBS approach is proposed for preserving spatial filtering effects, thus rendering the compatibility of the CBS-based beamforming. Finally, numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed CBS-based beamforming method.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, some new upper bounds for KL-divergence based on $L^1, L^2$ and $L^\infty$ norms of density functions are discussed. Our findings unveil that the convergence in KL-divergence sense sandwiches between the convergence of density functions in terms of $L^1$ and $L^2$ norms. Furthermore, we endeavor to apply our newly derived upper bounds to the analysis of the rate theorem of the entropic conditional central limit theorem.</description>

      <title>Learning Robust Representations for Communications over Noisy Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A deep learning (DL)-based communication system offers advantages over traditional mathematically modelled systems, as the former may be jointly optimized. FCNNs (Fully Connected Neural Networks) are common Deep Learning architectures. Though they are well known to solve optimization problems, existing literature suggests that they fail to learn robust representations for communication models. This work explores the potential of FCNNs to learn an end-to-end communication system without taking any inspiration from existing classical models. The study investigates the impact of imbibing domain knowledge by varying cost functions to generate robust representations of symbols under strict power constraints. Additionally, we introduce a novel encoder structure inspired by the Barlow Twins framework. Finally, we introduce a training strategy that addresses the often-overlooked issue of training Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) sensitivity, highlighting its importance in communication systems. We demonstrate that such a method leads to more reliable models.</description>

      <title>Exact computation of Transfer Entropy with Path Weight Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information processing in networks entails a dynamical transfer of information between stochastic variables. Transfer entropy is widely used for quantification of the directional transfer of information between input and output trajectories. However, currently there is no exact technique to quantify transfer entropy given the dynamical model of a general network. Here we introduce an exact computational algorithm, Transfer Entropy-Path Weight Sampling (TE-PWS), to quantify transfer entropy and its variants in an arbitrary network in the presence of multiple hidden variables, nonlinearity, transient conditions, and feedback. TE-PWS extends a recently introduced algorithm Path Weight Sampling (PWS) and uses techniques from the statistical physics of polymers and trajectory sampling. We apply TE-PWS to linear and nonlinear systems to reveal how transfer entropy can overcome naive applications of data processing inequalities in presence of feedback.</description>

      <title>Robust Privatization with Multiple Tasks and the Optimal Privacy-Utility Tradeoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.10081v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, fundamental limits and optimal mechanisms of privacy-preserving data release that aims to minimize the privacy leakage under utility constraints of a set of multiple tasks are investigated. While the private feature to be protected is typically determined and known by the sanitizer, the target task is usually unknown. To address the lack of information on the specific task, utility constraints laid on a set of multiple possible tasks are considered. The mechanism protects the specific privacy feature of the to-be-released data while satisfying utility constraints of all possible tasks in the set. First, the single-letter characterization of the rate-leakage-distortion region is derived, where the utility of each task is measured by a distortion function. It turns out that the minimum privacy leakage problem with log-loss distortion constraints and the unconstrained released rate is a non-convex optimization problem. Second, focusing on the case where the raw data consists of multiple independent components, we show that the above non-convex optimization problem can be decomposed into multiple parallel privacy funnel (PF) problems with different weightings. We explicitly derive the optimal solution to each PF problem when the private feature is a component-wise deterministic function of a data vector. The solution is characterized by a leakage-free threshold: when the utility constraint is below the threshold, the minimum leakage is zero; once the required utility level is above the threshold, the privacy leakage increases linearly. Finally, we show that the optimal weighting of each privacy funnel problem can be found by solving a linear program (LP). A sufficient released rate to achieve the minimum leakage is also derived. Numerical results are shown to illustrate the robustness of our approach against the task non-specificity.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Beam Selection for RIS-Aided Terahertz MIMO Networks via Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.02597v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) have been cast as a promising alternative to alleviate blockage vulnerability and enhance coverage capability for terahertz (THz) communications. Owing to large-scale array elements at transceivers and RIS, the codebook based beamforming can be utilized in a computationally efficient manner. However, the codeword selection for analog beamforming is an intractable combinatorial optimization (CO) problem. To this end, by taking the CO problem as a classification problem, a multi-task learning based analog beam selection (MTL-ABS) framework is developed to implement cooperative beam selection concurrently at transceivers and RIS. In addition, residual network and self-attention mechanism are used to combat the network degradation and mine intrinsic THz channel features. Finally, the network convergence is analyzed from a blockwise perspective, and numerical results demonstrate that the MTL-ABS framework greatly decreases the beam selection overhead and achieves near optimal sum-rate compared with heuristic search based counterparts.</description>

      <title>A Gaussian Copula Approach to the Performance Analysis of Fluid Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of a single-user fluid antenna system (FAS), by exploiting a class of elliptical copulas to describe the dependence structure amongst the fluid antenna positions (ports). By expressing the well-known Jakes' model in terms of the Gaussian copula, we consider two cases: (i) the general case, i.e., any arbitrary correlated fading distribution; and (ii) the specific case, i.e., correlated Nakagami-$m$ fading. For both scenarios, we first derive analytical expressions for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and probability density function (PDF) of the equivalent channel in terms of multivariate normal distribution. Then we obtain the outage probability (OP) and the delay outage rate (DOR) to analyze the performance of FAS. By employing the popular rank correlation coefficients such as Spearman's $\rho$ and Kendall's $\tau$ , we measure the degree of dependency in correlated arbitrary fading channels and illustrate how the Gaussian copula can be accurately connected to Jakes' model in FAS. Our numerical results demonstrate that increasing the size of FAS provides lower OP and DOR, but the system performance saturates as the number of antenna ports increases. In addition, our results indicate that FAS provides better performance compared to conventional single-fixed antenna systems even when the size of fluid antenna is small.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna-Enabled Co-Frequency Co-Time Full-Duplex Wireless Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) provides an innovative way to arrange antennas that can contribute to improved signal quality and more effective interference management. This technology is especially beneficial for co-frequency co-time full-duplex (CCFD) wireless communication, which struggles with self-interference (SI) that usually overpowers the desired incoming signals. By dynamically repositioning transmit/receive antennas, we can mitigate the SI and enhance the reception of incoming signals. Thus, this paper proposes a novel MA-enabled point-to-point CCFD system and formulates the minimum achievable rate of two CCFD terminals. To maximize the minimum achievable rate and determine the positions of MAs, we introduce a solution based on projected particle swarm optimization (PPSO), which can circumvent common suboptimal positioning issues. Moreover, simulation results reveal that the PPSO method leads to better performance compared to the conventional alternating position optimization (APO). The results also demonstrate that an MA-enabled CCFD system outperforms the one using fixed-position antennas (FPAs).</description>

      <title>On the Performance of RIS-Aided Spatial Modulation for Downlink Transmission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the performance of a reconfigurable reflecting surface (RIS)-assisted transmit spatial modulation (SM) system for downlink transmission, wherein the deployment of RIS serves the purpose of blind area coverage within the channel. At the receiving end, we present three detectors, i.e., maximum likelihood (ML) detector, two-stage ML detection, and greedy detector to recover the transmitted signal. By utilizing the ML detector, we initially derive the conditional pair error probability expression for the proposed scheme. Subsequently, we leverage the central limit theorem (CLT) to obtain the probability density function of the combined channel. Following this, the Gaussian-Chebyshev quadrature method is applied to derive a closed-form expression for the unconditional pair error probability and establish the union tight upper bound for the average bit error probability (ABEP). Furthermore, we derive a closed-form expression for the ergodic capacity of the proposed RIS-SM scheme. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted not only to assess the complexity and reliability of the three detection algorithms but also to validate the results obtained through theoretical derivation results.</description>

Abstract: The increasing demand for data storage has prompted the exploration of new techniques, with molecular data storage being a promising alternative. In this work, we develop coding schemes for a new storage paradigm that can be represented as a collection of two-dimensional arrays. Motivated by error patterns observed in recent prototype architectures, our study focuses on correcting erasures in the last few symbols of each row, and also correcting arbitrary deletions across rows. We present code constructions and explicit encoders and decoders that are shown to be nearly optimal in many scenarios. We show that the new coding schemes are capable of effectively mitigating these errors, making these emerging storage platforms potentially promising solutions.</description>

Abstract: The performance bounds of near-field sensing are studied for circular arrays, focusing on the impact of bandwidth and array size. The closed-form Cramer-Rao bound (CRBs) for angle and distance estimation are derived, revealing the scaling laws of the CRBs with bandwidth and array size. Contrary to expectations, enlarging array size does not always enhance sensing performance. Furthermore, the asymptotic CRBs are analyzed under different conditions, unveiling that the derived expressions include the existing results as special cases. Finally, the derived expressions are validated through numerical results.</description>

      <title>Limitations of the decoding-to-LPN reduction via code smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) problem underlies several classic cryptographic primitives. Researchers have endeavored to demonstrate the algorithmic difficulty of this problem by attempting to find a reduction from the decoding problem of linear codes, for which several hardness results exist. Earlier studies used code smoothing as a technical tool to achieve such reductions, showing that they are possible for codes with vanishing rate. This has left open the question of attaining a reduction with positive-rate codes. Addressing this case, we characterize the efficiency of the reduction in terms of the parameters of the decoding and LPN problems. As a conclusion, we isolate the parameter regimes for which a meaningful reduction is possible and the regimes for which its existence is unlikely.</description>

      <title>On Binary Shadow Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09287v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the shadow codes of Cherubini and Micheli to include basic polynomials having arbitrary degree, and show that restricting basic polynomials to have degree one or less can result in improved lower bounds on the minimum distance of the code. However, even these improved lower bounds suggest that shadow codes have considerably inferior distance-rate characteristics compared with the concatenation of a Reed-Solomon outer code and a first-order Reed-Muller inner code.</description>

      <title>Assembly Theory Reduced to Shannon Entropy and Rendered Redundant by Naive Statistical Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previously, we formally proved that any implementation of the concept of `copy number' underlying Assembly Theory (AT) and its assembly index (Ai) was equivalent to Shannon Entropy and not fundamentally or methodologically different from algorithms like ZIP and PNG via an LZ grammar. We show that the weak empirical correlation between Ai and LZW, which the authors offered as a defence against the previously proven result that the assembly index calculation method is an LZ scheme, is based on a misleading experiment. When the experiment is conducted properly the asymptotic convergence to LZ compression and Shannon Entropy is evident, and aligns with the mathematical proof previously provided. This completes both the theoretical and empirical demonstrations that any variation of the copy-number concept underlying AT, which resorts to counting the number of repetitions to arrive at a measure for life, is equivalent to statistical compression and Shannon Entropy. We demonstrate that the authors' `we-are-better-because-we-are-worse argument' does not withstand basic scrutiny, and that their primary empirical results separating organic from inorganic compounds have not only been previously reported -- sans claims to unify physics and biology -- but are also driven solely by molecular length, not by any special feature of life captured by their assembly index. Finally, we show that Ai is a special subcase of our Block Decomposition Method introduced almost a decade earlier.</description>

      <title>Movable Antennas Meet Intelligent Reflecting Surface: When Do We Need Movable Antennas?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and movable antenna (MA)/fluid antenna (FA) techniques have both received increasing attention in the realm of wireless communications due to their ability to reconfigure and improve wireless channel conditions. In this paper, we investigate the integration of MAs/FAs into an IRS-assisted wireless communication system. In particular, we consider the downlink transmission from a multi-MA base station (BS) to a single-antenna user with the aid of an IRS, aiming to maximize the user's received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), by jointly optimizing the BS/IRS active/passive beamforming and the MAs' positions. Due to the similar capability of MAs and IRS for channel reconfiguration, we first conduct theoretical analyses of the performance gain of MAs over conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs) under the line-of-sight (LoS) BS-IRS channel and derive the conditions under which the performance gain becomes more or less significant. Next, to solve the received SNR maximization problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm that decomposes it into two subproblems and solve them alternately. Numerical results are provided to validate our analytical results and evaluate the performance gains of MAs over FPAs under different setups.</description>

      <title>An Effective Information Theoretic Framework for Channel Pruning</title>

Abstract: Channel pruning is a promising method for accelerating and compressing convolutional neural networks. However, current pruning algorithms still remain unsolved problems that how to assign layer-wise pruning ratios properly and discard the least important channels with a convincing criterion. In this paper, we present a novel channel pruning approach via information theory and interpretability of neural networks. Specifically, we regard information entropy as the expected amount of information for convolutional layers. In addition, if we suppose a matrix as a system of linear equations, a higher-rank matrix represents there exist more solutions to it, which indicates more uncertainty. From the point of view of information theory, the rank can also describe the amount of information. In a neural network, considering the rank and entropy as two information indicators of convolutional layers, we propose a fusion function to reach a compromise of them, where the fusion results are defined as ``information concentration''. When pre-defining layer-wise pruning ratios, we employ the information concentration as a reference instead of heuristic and engineering tuning to provide a more interpretable solution. Moreover, we leverage Shapley values, which are a potent tool in the interpretability of neural networks, to evaluate the channel contributions and discard the least important channels for model compression while maintaining its performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and promising performance of our method. For example, our method improves the accuracy by 0.21% when reducing 45.5% FLOPs and removing 40.3% parameters for ResNet-56 on CIFAR-10. Moreover, our method obtains loss in Top-1/Top-5 accuracies of 0.43%/0.11% by reducing 41.6% FLOPs and removing 35.0% parameters for ResNet-50 on ImageNet.</description>

      <title>A Plaque Test for Redundancies in Relational Data [Extendend Version]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the visualization of dental plaque at the dentist's office, this article proposes a novel visualization of redundancies in relational data. Our approach is based on a well-principled information-theoretic framework that has so far seen limited practical application in systems and tools. In this framework, we quantify the information content (or entropy) of each cell in a relation instance given a set of functional dependencies. The entropy value signifies the likelihood of recovering the cell value based on the dependencies and the remaining tuples. By highlighting cells with lower entropy, we effectively visualize redundancies in the data. We present an initial prototype implementation and demonstrate that a straightforward approach is insufficient to handle practical problem sizes. To address this limitation, we propose several optimizations which we prove to be correct. In addition, we present a Monte Carlo approximation with a known error, enabling a computationally tractable analysis. By applying our visualization technique to real-world datasets, we showcase its potential. Our vision is to empower data analysts by directing their focus in data profiling toward pertinent redundancies, analogous to the diagnostic role of a plaque test at the dentist's office.</description>

      <title>A Truly Concurrent Semantics for Reversible CCS</title>

Abstract: Reversible CCS (RCCS) is a well-established, formal model for reversible communicating systems, which has been built on top of the classical Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS). In its original formulation, each CCS process is equipped with a memory that records its performed actions, which is then used to reverse computations. More recently, abstract models for RCCS have been proposed in the literature, basically, by directly associating RCCS processes with (reversible versions of) event structures. In this paper we propose a different abstract model: starting from one of the well-known encoding of CCS into Petri nets we apply a recently proposed approach to incorporate causally-consistent reversibility to Petri nets, obtaining as result the (reversible) net counterpart of every RCCS term.</description>

      <title>Joint and Robust Beamforming Framework for Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is widely recognized as a fundamental enabler for future wireless communications. In this paper, we present a joint communication and radar beamforming framework for maximizing a sum spectral efficiency (SE) while guaranteeing desired radar performance with imperfect channel state information (CSI) in multi-user and multi-target ISAC systems. To this end, we adopt either a radar transmit beam mean square error (MSE) or receive signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) as a radar performance constraint of a sum SE maximization problem. To resolve inherent challenges such as non-convexity and imperfect CSI, we reformulate the problems and identify first-order optimality conditions for the joint radar and communication beamformer. Turning the condition to a nonlinear eigenvalue problem with eigenvector dependency (NEPv), we develop an alternating method which finds the joint beamformer through power iteration and a Lagrangian multiplier through binary search. The proposed framework encompasses both the radar metrics and is robust to channel estimation error with low complexity. Simulations validate the proposed methods. In particular, we observe that the MSE and SCNR constraints exhibit complementary performance depending on the operating environment, which manifests the importance of the proposed comprehensive and robust optimization framework.</description>
