      <title>Higher-Order Analysis of Three-Dimensional Anisotropy in Imbalanced Alfv\'enic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze in-situ observations of imbalanced solar wind turbulence to evaluate MHD turbulence models grounded in "Critical Balance" (CB) and "Scale-Dependent Dynamic Alignment" (SDDA). At energy injection scales, both outgoing and ingoing modes exhibit a weak cascade; a simultaneous tightening of SDDA is noted. Outgoing modes persist in a weak cascade across the inertial range, while ingoing modes shift to a strong cascade at $\lambda \approx 3 \times 10^{4} d_i$, with associated spectral scalings deviating from expected behavior due to "anomalous coherence" effects. The inertial range comprises two distinct sub-inertial segments. Beyond $\lambda \gtrsim 100 d_i$, eddies adopt a field-aligned tube topology, with SDDA signatures mainly evident in high amplitude fluctuations. The scaling exponents $\zeta_{n}$ of the $n$-th order conditional structure functions, orthogonal to both the local mean field and fluctuation direction, align with the analytical models of Chandran et al. 2015 and Mallet et al. 2017, indicating "multifractal" statistics and strong intermittency; however, scaling in parallel and displacement components is more concave than predicted, possibly influenced by expansion effects. Below $\lambda \approx 100 d_i$, eddies become increasingly anisotropic, evolving into thin current sheet-like structures. Concurrently, $\zeta_{n}$ scales linearly with order, marking a shift towards "monofractal" statistics. At $\lambda \approx 8 d_i$, the increase in aspect ratio halts, and the eddies become quasi-isotropic. This change may signal tearing instability, leading to reconnection, or result from energy redirection into the ion-cyclotron wave spectrum, aligning with the "helicity barrier". Our analysis utilizes 5-point structure functions, proving more effective than the traditional 2-point method in capturing steep scaling behaviors at smaller scales.</description>

      <title>On the plasma quasi-thermal noise in the outer heliosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent paper by Li et al. on electron quasi-thermal noise in the outer heliosphere is flawed. It assumes the plasma drift speed to be much smaller than the electron thermal speed, even though both quantities are of the same order of magnitude in the outer heliosphere inward of the termination shock, because of the low plasma temperature. In this case, the Langmuir wave dispersion equation and the quasi-thermal noise in the antenna frame are completely changed. Furthermore, these calculations neglect the shot noise, which should produce a large contribution below the plasma frequency with the Voyager antennas in the outer heliosphere.</description>

      <title>Effect of magnetospheric conditions on the morphology of Jupiter's UV main auroral emission, as observed by Juno-UVS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Auroral emissions are a reflection of magnetospheric processes, and, at Jupiter, it is not entirely certain how the morphology of the UV main emission (ME) varies with magnetospheric compression or the strength of the central current sheet. This work leverages the observations from Juno-UVS to link ME variability with magnetospheric states. Novel arc-detection techniques are used to determine new reference ovals for the ME from perijoves 1 through 54, in both hemispheres, and analyse how the size and shape of the ME vary compared to this reference oval. The morphology and brightness of the ME vary in local time: the dawn-side ME is typically expanded and the dusk-side ME typically contracted compared to the reference oval, and the dusk-side ME being typically twice as bright as the dawn-side ME. Both the northern and southern ME, and the day-side and night-side ME, expand and contract from their reference ovals synchronously, which indicates that the variable size of the ME is caused by a process occurring throughout the jovian magnetosphere. The poleward latitudinal shift of the auroral footprint of Ganymede correlates with the poleward motion of the ME, whereas a similar relation is not present for the footprint of Io. Additionally, the expansion of the ME correlates well with an increase in magnetodisc current. These two results suggest that a changing current-sheet magnetic field is partially responsible for the variable size of the ME. Finally, magnetospheric compression is linked to a global ME contraction and brightening, though this brightening occurs predominantly in the day-side ME. This observation, and the observation that the dusk-side ME is typically brighter than the dawn-side ME, stands in contrast to the modelled and observed behaviour of field-aligned currents and thus weakens the theoretical link between field-aligned currents and the generation of the auroral ME.</description>
