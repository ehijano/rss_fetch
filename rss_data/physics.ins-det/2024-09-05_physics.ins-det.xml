      <title>A Compact Magnet System for the Tsinghua Tabletop Kibble Balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the so-called magnetic geometrical factor, $Bl$, of a Kibble balance does not appear in the Kibble equations, it offers the precision link between electrical and mechanical quantities and furthers a quasi-quantum traceability path for mass metrology. This feature makes the magnet system, supplying the $Bl$ in Kibble equations, play a core role in Kibble balances. Following the open-hardware idea, we report here on the design, manufacture, assembly, optimization, and finally performance of a compact magnet system for the Tsinghua tabletop Kibble balance. Notably, the magnet system showcased in this study facilitates a straightforward upper levitation of splitting through a streamlined mechanism guide, substantially enhancing the ease of open and close operations. Experimental tests show the realized magnet systems can yield a high $Bl$ value (e.g., 400 Tm for a bifilar coil and 800 Tm for a single coil with a wire gauge of 0.2 mm) meanwhile a low volume/weight (40 kg) thanks to the uniformity improvement of magnetic profiles. Furthermore, important parameters related to systematic effects, such as the current effect, are checked, aiming for a final mass-realization accuracy at the $10^{-8}$ level.</description>

      <title>On-orbit calibration and long-term performance of the DAMPE trigger system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is a satellite-borne particle detector for measurements of high-energy cosmic rays and {\gamma}-rays. DAMPE has been operating smoothly in space for more than 8 years since launch on December 17, 2015. The trigger logic of DAMPE is designed according to the deposited energy information recorded by the calorimeter. The precise calibration of the trigger thresholds and their long-term evolutions are very important for the scientific analysis of DAMPE. In this work, we develop a new method for the threshold calibration, considering the influence from the electronic noise, and obtain the long-term evolutions of the trigger thresholds. The average increase rate of the trigger thresholds for the first 4 layers of the calorimeter is found to be about 0.9% per year, resulting in variations of the high-energy trigger efficiency of cosmic ray electrons by about -5% per year at 2 GeV and less than about -0.05% above 30 GeV.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Sensitivity in Ge-Based Rare-Event Physics Experiments through Underground Crystal Growth and Detector Fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmogenic production of long-lived isotopes such as $^{3}$H,$^{55}$Fe, $^{60}$Co, $^{65}$Zn, and $^{68}$Ge poses a significant challenge as a source of background events in Ge-based dark matter (DM) and neutrinoless double-beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) experiments. In the pursuit of DM, particularly within the largely unexplored parameter space for low-mass DM, new detector technologies are being developed with extremely low-energy thresholds to detect MeV-scale DM. However, isotopes like $^{3}$H, $^{55}$Fe, $^{65}$Zn, and $^{68}$Ge, produced cosmogenically within the detector material, emerge as dominant backgrounds that severely limit sensitivity in these searches. Similarly, efforts to detect $0\nu\beta\beta$, especially under a neutrino normal mass hierarchy scenario, require a sensitivity to the effective Majorana mass of $\sim$1 meV. Achieving this level of sensitivity necessitates stringent suppression of background signals from isotopes such as $^{60}$Co and $^{68}$Ge, which impose critical detection limits. To reach the targeted sensitivity for these next-generation experiments and to unlock their full discovery potential for both low-mass DM and $0\nu\beta\beta$, relocating Ge crystal growth and detector fabrication to underground environments is crucial. This approach is the most effective strategy to significantly reduce the production of these long-lived isotopes, thereby ensuring the experimental sensitivity required for groundbreaking discoveries.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field tunable spectral response of kinetic inductance detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We tune the onset of optical response in aluminium kinetic inductance detectors from a natural cutoff frequency of 90 GHz to 60 GHz by applying an external magnetic field. The change in spectral response is due to the decrease of the superconducting gap, from 90 GHz at zero magnetic field to 60 GHz at a magnetic field of around 3 mT. We characterize the variation of the superconducting gap, the detector frequency shift and the internal quality factor as a function of the applied field. In principle, the magnetic field tunable response could be used to make spectroscopic measurements. In practice, the internal quality factor behaves hysteretically with the magnetic field due to the presence of vortices in the thin superconducting film. We conclude by discussing possible solutions to achieve spectroscopy measurements using kinetic inductance detectors and magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Performance of the CMS electromagnetic calorimeter in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The operation and performance of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) are presented, based on data collected in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV at the CERN LHC, in the years from 2015 to 2018 (LHC Run 2), corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 151 fb$^{-1}$. The CMS ECAL is a scintillating lead-tungstate crystal calorimeter, with a silicon strip preshower detector in the forward region that provides precise measurements of the energy and the time-of-arrival of electrons and photons. The successful operation of the ECAL is crucial for a broad range of physics goals, ranging from observing the Higgs boson and measuring its properties, to other standard model measurements and searches for new phenomena. Precise calibration, alignment, and monitoring of the ECAL response are important ingredients to achieve these goals. To face the challenges posed by the higher luminosity, which characterized the operation of the LHC in Run 2, the procedures established during the 2011-2012 run of the LHC have been revisited and new methods have been developed for the energy measurement and for the ECAL calibration. The energy resolution of the calorimeter, for electrons from Z boson decays reaching the ECAL without significant loss of energy by bremsstrahlung, was better than 1.8%, 3.0%, and 4.5% in the $\lvert\eta\rvert$ intervals [0.0, 0.8], [0.8, 1.5], [1.5, 2.5], respectively. This resulting performance is similar to that achieved during Run 1 in 2011-2012, in spite of the more severe running conditions.</description>

      <title>The Design, Implementation, and Performance of the LZ Calibration Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) is a tonne-scale experiment searching for direct dark matter interactions and other rare events. It is located at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in Lead, South Dakota, USA. The core of the LZ detector is a dual-phase xenon time projection chamber (TPC), designed with the primary goal of detecting Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) via their induced low energy nuclear recoils. Surrounding the TPC, two veto detectors immersed in an ultra-pure water tank enable reducing background events to enhance the discovery potential. Intricate calibration systems are purposely designed to precisely understand the responses of these three detector volumes to various types of particle interactions and to demonstrate LZ's ability to discriminate between signals and backgrounds. In this paper, we present a comprehensive discussion of the key features, requirements, and performance of the LZ calibration systems, which play a crucial role in enabling LZ's WIMP-search and its broad science program. The thorough description of these calibration systems, with an emphasis on their novel aspects, is valuable for future calibration efforts in direct dark matter and other rare-event search experiments.</description>

      <title>Saturation of gas concentration signal of the laser gas sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00351v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nowadays it is possible to determine the type of gas with sufficient accuracy when its concentration is less than {10}^{-6} (in units of ppm) fractions using spectroscopic methods (optical, radio engineering, acoustic). Along with this, the value of permissible concentrations of explosive, toxic, harmful to technology and ecology gases is practically important. Known physical experimental studies indicate only a linear dependence of the response of a laser gas sensor at ppm\gtrsim{10}^3. The research methods for ppm\lesssim{10}^3 are based on the processes of combustion, microexplosion, structural and phase transformations and are not always applicable in real practical conditions. The work is devoted to the analysis of experimentally obtained fluctuations caused by a laser beam in a gas in a photodiode (signal receiver) due to its influence not only at the atomic level, but also on the scale of clusters of nanoparticle molecules. The gas concentration is estimated by the fluctuation-dissipation ratio. It is shown that the signal correlator is saturated to a constant value when the quantum (laser photon energy) and thermal (nanoparticle temperature) factors are comparable with an increase in the concentration of the target gas. The critical values of the saturation concentration are determined by the equality of these two factors.</description>

      <title>Vertex Imaging Hadron Calorimetry Using AI/ML Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fluctuations in energy loss to processes that do not generate measurable signals, such as binding energy losses, set the limit on achievable hadronic energy resolution in traditional energy reconstruction techniques. The correlation between the number of hadronic interaction vertices in a shower and invisible energy is found to be strong and is used to estimate invisible energy fraction in highly granular calorimeters in short time intervals (&lt;10 ns). We simulated images of hadronic showers using GEANT4 and deployed a neural network to analyze the images for energy regression. The neural network-based approach results in significant improvement in energy resolution, from 13 % to 4 % in the case of a Cherenkov calorimeter for 100 GeV pion showers. We discuss the significance of the phenomena responsible for this improvement and the plans for experimental verification of these results and further development.</description>

      <title>On the use of a consumer-grade 360-degree camera as a radiometer for scientific applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Improved miniaturization capabilities for complex fisheye camera systems have recently led to the introduction of many compact 360-degree cameras on the consumer technology market. Designed primarily for recreational photography, several manufacturers have decided to allow users access to raw imagery for further editing flexibility, thereby offering data at sensor level that can be directly exploited for absolute-light quantification. In this study, we demonstrate methodologies to carefully calibrate a consumer-grade 360-degree camera for radiometry use. The methods include linearity analysis, geometric calibration, assessment of the illumination fall-off across the image plane, spectral-response determination, absolute spectral-radiance calibration, immersion factor determination and dark-frame analysis. Accuracy of the calibration was validated by a real-world experiment comparing sky radiance measurements with a co-localized Compact Optical Profiling System (C-OPS, Biospherical Instruments Inc.), which gave mean unbiased percentage differences of less than 21.1 %. Using the photon-transfer technique, we calculated that this camera consisting of two fisheyes with a 182$^\circ$ field of view in air (152$^\circ$ in water) has a limit of detection of at least $4.6 \times 10^{-7}$ $\mathrm{W \cdot sr^{-1} \cdot m^{-2} \cdot nm^{-1}}$ in its three spectral channels. This technology, with properly stored calibration data, may benefit researchers from multiple scientific areas interested in radiometric geometric light-field study. While some of these radiometric calibration methods are complex or costly, this work opens up possibilities for easy-to-use, inexpensive, and accessible radiance cameras.</description>
