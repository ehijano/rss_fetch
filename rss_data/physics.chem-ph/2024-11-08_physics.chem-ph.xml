      <title>Diabatic states of charge transfer with constrained charge equilibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge transfer (CT) processes that are electronically non-adiabatic are ubiquitous in chemistry, biology, and materials science, but their theoretical description requires diabatic states or adiabatic excited states. For complex systems, these latter states are more difficult to calculate than the adiabatic ground state. Here, we propose a simple method to obtain diabatic states, including energies and charges, by constraining the atomic charges within the charge equilibration framework. For two-state systems, the exact diabatic coupling can be determined, from which the adiabatic excited-state energy can also be calculated. The method can be viewed as an affordable alternative to constrained density functional theory (CDFT), and so we call it constrained charge equilibration (CQEq). We test the CQEq method on the anthracene-tetracyanoethylene CT complex and the reductive decomposition of ethylene carbonate on a lithium metal surface. We find that CQEq predicts diabatic energies, charges, and adiabatic excitation energies in good agreement with CDFT, and we propose that CQEq is promising for combination with machine learning force fields to study non-adiabatic CT in the condensed phase.</description>

      <title>Test of the Orbital-Based LI3 Index as a Predictor of the Height of the 3MLCT to 3MC Transition-State Barrier for [Ru(N N)3]2+ Polypyridine Complexes in CH3CN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ruthenium(II) polypyridine compounds often have a relatively long lived triplet metalligand charge transfer (3MLCT) state, making these complexes useful as chromophores for photoactivated electron transfer in photomolecular devices (PMDs). As different PMDs typically require different ligands and as the luminescence lifetime of the 3MLCT is sensitive to the structure of the ligand, it is important to understand this state and what types of photoprocesses can lead to its quenching. Recent work has increasingly emphasized that there are likely multiple competing pathways involved which should be explored in order to fully comprehend the 3MLCT state. However the lowest barrier that needs to be crossed to pass over to the nonluminescent triplet metal-centered (3MC) state has been repeatedly found to be a trans dissociation of the complex, at least in the simpler cases studied. This is the fourth in a series of articles investigating the possibility of an orbital based luminescence index (LI3, because it was the most successful of three) for predicting luminescence lifetimes. In an earlier study of bidentate (N N) ligands, we showed that the gas-phase 3MLCT to 3MC mechanism proceeded via an initial charge transfer to a single N N ligand which moves symmetrically away from the central ruthenium atom, followed by a bifurcation pathway to one of two 3MC enantiomers. The actual transition state barrier was quite small and independent, to within the limits of our calculations, to the choice of ligand studied. Here we investigate the same reaction in acetonitrile, CH3CN, solution and find that the mechanism differs from that in the gas phase in that the reaction passes directly via a trans mechanism. This has implications for the interpretation of LI3 via the Bell-Evans Polanyi principle.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Insights into the Self-assembly of Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks from Computer Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are periodically synthesized all over the world due to the wide range of societally and environmentally relevant applications they possess. However, the mechanisms and thermodynamics associated to MOF self-assembly are poorly understood because of the difficulties in studying such a multi-scale process with molecular-level resolution. In this work, we performed well-tempered metadynamics simulations of the early nucleation and late growth steps of the self-assembly of ZIF-4 using a reactive force field. We found that the formation of building blocks is a complex, multi-step process that involves changes in the coordination of the metal ion. Saturating the ligand coordination of a metal ion is more energetically favorable during growth than during early nucleation. The addition of a fourth ligand is less exergonic than it is for the first three and the associated free energy is highly dependent on the local environment of the undercoordinated metal ion. The stability of this bond depends on the strength of the solvent--metal ion interaction. Incorporating a ligand to a ZIF-1 crystal is less favorable compared to the more stable ZIF-4 polymorph. Milder differences were found when comparing the growth of (100), (010) and (001) ZIF-4 surfaces.</description>

      <title>Orientation-Dependent Enhanced Ionization in Acetylene Revealed by Ultrafast Cross-Polarized Pulse Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the orientation dependence of Enhanced Ionization (EI) during strong-field-driven nuclear motion in acetylene (C$_2$H$_2$). Here, we both initiate and probe molecular dynamics in acetylene with intense 6-fs cross-polarized pulse pairs, separated by a variable delay. Following multiple ionization by the first pulse, acetylene undergoes simultaneous elongation of the carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds, enabling further ionization by the second pulse and the formation of a very highly charged state, [C$_2$H$_2]^{6+}$. At small inter-pulse delays ($&lt;$20 fs), this enhancement occurs when the molecule is aligned to the probe pulse. Conversely, at large delays ($&gt;$40 fs), formation of [C$_2$H$_2]^{6+}$ occurs when the molecule is aligned to the pump pulse. By analyzing the polarization and time dependence of sequentially ionized [C$_2$H$_2]^{6+}$, we resolve two distinct pathways that both contribute to a large increase in the multiple ionization yield. This cross-polarized pulse pair scheme uniquely enables selective probing of deeply bound orbitals, providing new insights on orientation-dependent EI in highly charged hydrocarbons.</description>

      <title>Odd Viscodiffusive Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a theory of "odd viscodiffusive fluids," which exhibit three-dimensional odd transport phenomena through the coupling of viscous and diffusive transport. In these fluids, diffusive fluxes may arise from orthogonal velocity gradients and, reciprocally, stresses may arise from concentration gradients. We examine microscopic fluctuations using the recently proposed "flux hypothesis" to derive Green-Kubo and reciprocal relations for the governing transport coefficients. These relations suggest that only parity symmetry, and not time-reversal symmetry, must be broken at the microscopic scale to observe these couplings. Chiral liquids, whether passive or active, are therefore a natural choice as viscodiffusive fluids. We then introduce two analytically tractable model systems, namely a generator and a corresponding reciprocal engine, which illustrate the nature of viscodiffusive cross-coupling in chiral matter and enable the experimental measurement of the novel transport coefficients. Finally, we make the case for chiral bacterial suspensions to be odd viscodiffusive fluids, and use our theory to predict the behaviors exhibited in prior experimental microfluidic studies involving bacterial migration in response to shearing flows.</description>

      <title>The Effect of a Knot on the Thermal Stability of Protein MJ0366: Insights from Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein MJ0366 is a hypothetical protein from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii that has a rare and complex knot in its structure. The knot is a right-handed trefoil knot that involves about half of the protein's residues. In this article, we investigate the thermal stability of protein MJ0366 using numerical simulations based on molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo methods. We compare the results with those of a similar unknotted protein and analyze the effects of the knot on the folding and unfolding processes. We show that the knot in protein MJ0366 increases its thermal stability by creating a topological barrier that prevents the protein from unfolding at high temperatures. We also discuss the possible biological implications of the knot for the function and evolution of protein MJ0366.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Centric Study of Methylene Singlet and Triplet States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the electronic structure of the CH$_2$ molecule, modeled as a (6e, 23o) system using a 52-qubit quantum experiment, which is relevant for interstellar and combustion chemistry. We focused on calculating the dissociation energies for CH$_2$ in the ground state triplet and the first excited state singlet, applying the Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) method within a quantum-centric supercomputing framework. We evaluated the ability of SQD to provide accurate results compared to Selected Configuration Interaction (SCI) calculations and experimental values for the singlet-triplet gap. To our knowledge, this is the first study of an open-shell system, such as the CH$_2$ triplet, using SQD. To obtain accurate energy values, we implemented post-SQD orbital optimization and employed a warm-start approach using previously converged states. While the results for the singlet state dissociation were only a few milli-Hartrees from the SCI reference values, the triplet state exhibited greater variability. This discrepancy likely arises from differences in bit-string handling within the SQD method for open- versus closed-shell systems, as well as the inherently complex wavefunction character of the triplet state. The SQD-calculated singlet-triplet energy gap matched well with experimental and SCI values. This study enhances our understanding of the SQD method for open-shell systems and lays the groundwork for future applications in large-scale electronic structure studies using quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Fluid flow inside slit-shaped nanopores: the role of surface morphology at the molecular scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations of fluid flow have highlighted the peculiarities of nanoscale flows compared to classical fluid mechanics. In particular, boundary conditions can deviate from the no-slip behavior at macroscopic scales due to various factors. In this context, we investigate the influence of surface morphology in slit-shaped nanopores on the fluid flow. We demonstrate that the surface morphology effectively controls the slip length, which approaches zero when the molecular structures of the pore wall and the fluid are matched. Using boundary-driven, energy-conserving NEMD simulations with a pump-like driving mechanism, we examine two types of pore walls--mimicking a crystalline and an amorphous material--that exhibit markedly different surface resistances to flow. The resulting flow velocity profiles are consistent with Hagen-Poiseuille theory for incompressible, Newtonian fluids when adjusted for surface slip. For the two pores, we observe partial slip and no-slip behavior, respectively, which correlate with fluid layering and depletion near the surfaces. However, the confinement of the fluid gives rise to an effective viscosity that varies substantially with the pore width. Analysis of the hydrodynamic permeability shows that the simulated flows are in the Darcy regime. Additionally, the thermal isolation of the flow causes a linear increase in fluid temperature along the flow, which we relate to strong viscous dissipation and heat convection, utilizing conservation laws of fluid mechanics. Our findings underscore the need for molecular-scale modeling to accurately capture the fluid dynamics near boundaries and in nanoporous materials, where macroscopic models may not be applicable.</description>

Abstract: The conductivity of concentrated salt solutions has posed a real puzzle for theories of electrolytes. Despite a quantitative understanding of highly dilute solutions, an analytical theory for concentrated ones remains a challenge almost a century, although a number of parameters and effects incorporated into theories increases with time. Here we show that the conductivity of univalent salt solutions can be perfectly interpreted using an extremely simple model that relies just on a mean-field description of electrostatic effects and on an adapted for salt ions classical approach to calculating colloid electrophoresis. We derive a compact equation, which predicts that the ratio of conductivity at a finite concentration to that at an infinite dilution is the same for all salt, if it is plotted against a product of the harmonic mean of ion hydrodynamic radii and the square root of concentration. Our equation fits very well the experimental data for inorganic salts up to 3 mol/l.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative models hold great promise for small molecule discovery, significantly increasing the size of search space compared to traditional in silico screening libraries. However, most existing machine learning methods for small molecule generation suffer from poor synthesizability of candidate compounds, making experimental validation difficult. In this paper we propose Reaction-GFlowNet (RGFN), an extension of the GFlowNet framework that operates directly in the space of chemical reactions, thereby allowing out-of-the-box synthesizability while maintaining comparable quality of generated candidates. We demonstrate that with the proposed set of reactions and building blocks, it is possible to obtain a search space of molecules orders of magnitude larger than existing screening libraries coupled with low cost of synthesis. We also show that the approach scales to very large fragment libraries, further increasing the number of potential molecules. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across a range of oracle models, including pretrained proxy models and GPU-accelerated docking.</description>

      <title>Navigating Chemical Space with Latent Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03987v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress of deep generative models in the vision and language domain has stimulated significant interest in more structured data generation such as molecules. However, beyond generating new random molecules, efficient exploration and a comprehensive understanding of the vast chemical space are of great importance to molecular science and applications in drug design and materials discovery. In this paper, we propose a new framework, ChemFlow, to traverse chemical space through navigating the latent space learned by molecule generative models through flows. We introduce a dynamical system perspective that formulates the problem as learning a vector field that transports the mass of the molecular distribution to the region with desired molecular properties or structure diversity. Under this framework, we unify previous approaches on molecule latent space traversal and optimization and propose alternative competing methods incorporating different physical priors. We validate the efficacy of ChemFlow on molecule manipulation and single- and multi-objective molecule optimization tasks under both supervised and unsupervised molecular discovery settings. Codes and demos are publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/garywei944/ChemFlow.</description>

      <title>Adaptive energy reference for machine-learning models of the electronic density of states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electronic density of states (DOS) provides information regarding the distribution of electronic energy levels in a material, and can be used to approximate its optical and electronic properties and therefore guide computational material design. Given its usefulness and relative simplicity, it has been one of the first electronic properties used as target for machine-learning approaches going beyond interatomic potentials. A subtle but important point, well-appreciated in the condensed matter community but usually overlooked in the construction of data-driven models, is that for bulk configurations the absolute energy reference of single-particle energy levels is ill-defined. Only energy differences matter, and quantities derived from the DOS are typically independent on the absolute alignment. We introduce an adaptive scheme that optimizes the energy reference of each structure as part of the training process, and show that it consistently improves the quality of ML models compared to traditional choices of energy reference, for different classes of materials and different model architectures. On a practical level, we trace the improved performance to the ability of this self-aligning scheme to match the most prominent features in the DOS. More broadly, we believe that this work highlights the importance of incorporating insights into the nature of the physical target into the definition of the architecture and of the appropriate figures of merit for machine-learning models, that translate in better transferability and overall performance.</description>

      <title>Characterizing RNA oligomers using Stochastic Titration Constant-pH Metadynamics simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: RNA molecules exhibit various biological functions intrinsically dependent on their diverse ecosystem of highly flexible structures. This flexibility arises from complex hydrogen-bonding networks defined by canonical and non-canonical base pairs that require protonation events to stabilize or perturb these interactions. Constant pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD) methods provide a reliable framework to explore the conformational and protonation space of dynamic structures and for robust calculations of pH-dependent properties, such as the pK$_\mathrm{a}$ of titrable sites. Despite growing biological evidence concerning pH regulation of certain motifs and in biotechnological applications, pH-sensitive in silico methods have rarely been applied to nucleic acids. In this work, we extended the stochastic titration CpHMD method to include RNA parameters from the standard $\chi$OL3 AMBER force field and highlighted its capability to depict titration events of nucleotides in single-stranded RNAs. We validated the method using trimers and pentamers with a single central titrable site while integrating a well-tempered metadynamics approach into the st-CpHMD methodology (CpH-MetaD) using PLUMED. This approach enhanced the convergence of the conformational landscape and enabled more efficient sampling of protonation-conformation coupling. Our pK$_\mathrm{a}$ estimates agree with experimental data, validating the method's ability to reproduce electrostatic changes around a titrable nucleobase in single-stranded RNA. These findings provided molecular insight into intramolecular phenomena, such as nucleobase stacking and phosphate interactions, that dictate the experimentally observed pK$_\mathrm{a}$ shifts between different strands. Overall, this work validates both the st-CpHMD and the metadynamics integration as reliable tools for studying biologically relevant RNA systems.</description>
