      <title>Thermal conductivity of various CFRPs from 100 mK to 20 K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRPs) are some of the most useful materials for building spacecraft and aerospace tools. They are especially valuable for systems that work at extremely cold (cryogenic) temperatures because they are strong, lightweight, and don't transfer heat easily.
  In this study, researchers measured how well heat moves through several different types of carbon fiber samples, specifically T300, T700, HS40, M55J, and IMA, at different fiber layouts and densities. These measurements were taken at ultra-cold temperatures ranging from 100 mK to 20 K. The team used a newly developed analysis method to calculate the thermal conductivity for each sample. Finally, they shared how each material behaved at different temperatures and compared their findings to previous research.</description>

      <title>WFC3/UVIS Geometric Distortion -- Time Evolution of Linear Terms w.r.t Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We align more than 7,400 WFC3/UVIS exposures to the Gaia DR3 catalog to examine the time evolution of the linear terms (shift, rotation, scale and skew) of the geometric distortion solution between 2009 and 2022. We find small linear temporal changes in the scale and skew terms (less than 0.2 pixels in 13 years) which are generally dominated by intrinsic scatter (up to $\pm$ 0.3 pixels). Concurrently, a larger filter-dependent offset in the scale term is observed, with a maximum difference of 0.3 pixels between F275W and F814W images at all epochs. A small rotation offset to Gaia of 0.003 $\pm$ 0.004 degrees is measured from 2009 to mid-2017, after which the offsets are as large as 0.01 degrees, with a large scatter. MAST pipeline processing includes an additional alignment step which corrects UVIS images for any residual linear terms with respect to Gaia DR3 when there are at least 10 matched sources. In addition to any pointing offsets, this step accounts for any evolution in the distortion linear terms described here. For observers requiring high-precision astrometry, we recommend using the tweakreg routine to realign images using a 4-parameter fit (x-shift, y-shift, rotation, and scale) or a 6-parameter fit (x-shift, y-shift, x-rotation, y-rotation, x-scale, and y-scale) depending on the number of matched sources. We provide links to DrizzlePac tutorials for improving both absolute and relative astrometry in WFC3 images.</description>

      <title>GASV: A New VLBI analysis software for Geodesy and Astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present GASV, a novel Python-based software package specifically designed for the analysis of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) data. Developed with ease of installation and user friendliness in mind, GASV supports both pipeline and interactive processing modes. The software processes VLBI baseline delays and rates in standard formats such as HOPS outputs and NGS card files to estimate key geodetic and astrometric parameters, including station coordinates, Earth Orientation Parameters, source coordinates, clock parameters, and atmospheric models. We evaluate the capabilities and performance of GASV, demonstrating that its parameter estimation accuracy for IVS INT, Regular, and CONT sessions is comparable to that achieved by the VLBI analysis centers at BKG and USNO. As a state-of-the-art tool, GASV not only enables high-quality single-session data processing but also but also supports global analyses of long-term SINEX files, generating Celestial Reference Frame and Terrestrial Reference Frame solutions with reliable accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Computing Framework for VLBI Data Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum computing framework for VLBI data correlation. We point out that a classical baseband time series data of length $N$ can be embedded into a quantum superposition state using amplitude encoding with only $\log_2 N$ qubits. The basic VLBI correlation and fringe fitting operations, including fringe rotation, Fourier transform, delay compensation, and cross correlation, can be implemented via quantum algorithms with significantly reduced computational complexity. We construct a full quantum processing pipeline and validate its feasibility and accuracy through direct comparison with a classical VLBI pipeline. We recognize that amplitude encoding of large data volumes remains the primary bottleneck in quantum computing; however, the quantized nature of VLBI raw data helps reduce the state-preparation complexity. Our investigation demonstrates that quantum computation offers a promising paradigm for VLBI data correlation and is likely to play a role in future VLBI systems.</description>

      <title>Expanding the Horizon of Black Hole Imaging with AtLAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has directly resolved and imaged two supermassive black holes and opening a new window on black hole physics. However, the current array is limited to only these two brightest nearby targets. This white paper outlines how future EHT upgrades, anchored by the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), will enable a transformative expansion of the accessible population of event-horizon-scale sources. By substantially improving sensitivity and multi-frequency capabilities, EHT+AtLAST will enable demographic studies of black hole growth, accretion physics, and jet launching across a wide range of masses, environments, and accretion states.</description>

      <title>The EXoplanet Climate Infrared TElescope (EXCITE): A balloon-borne mission to measure spectroscopic phase curves of transiting hot Jupiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The EXoplanet Climate Infrared TElescope (EXCITE) is a balloon-borne mission dedicated to measuring spectroscopic phase curves of hot Jupiter-type exoplanets. Phase curve measurements can be used to characterize an exoplanet's longitude-dependent atmospheric composition and energy circulation patterns. EXCITE carries a 0.5 m primary mirror and moderate resolution diffraction-limited spectrograph with spectral coverage from 0.8--3.5 um. EXCITE is designed to fly from a long-duration balloon (LDB). EXCITE will observe through the peak of a target's spectral energy distribution (SED) and through spectral signatures of hydrogen and carbon-containing molecules. In this paper, we present the science goals of EXCITE, detail the as-built instrument, and discuss its performance during a 2024 engineering flight from Fort Sumner, New Mexico.</description>

      <title>The local void model for the Hubble and BAO tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inconsistency between the locally inferred Hubble constant and the value inferred from the cosmic microwave background assuming the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model has persisted, turning into an important problem. An emergent underlying trend is that this Hubble tension is driven by data confined to the very low-redshift Universe (typically $z &lt; 0.15$). Most intermediate-redshift measurements remain mutually consistent with $H_0^\mathrm{CMB}$, the $\Lambda$CDM expectation anchored by the CMB. This Perspective examines if a large local void can explain the Hubble tension and its appearance only at low $z$. For an observer residing within a large underdensity, such as the Milky Way inside the claimed KBC void, gravitationally induced outflows and redshift can inflate the locally inferred recession scale $cz'$ despite having $H_0 = H_0^\mathrm{CMB}$. We summarise evidence suggestive of a local underdensity from multi-wavelength galaxy number counts, discuss the dynamical requirements implied by the amplitude of inferred bulk flows, and connect the solution to the emerging low-redshift BAO distance anomaly ($\alpha_{\mathrm{iso}} &lt; 1$). Previously published semi-analytic void models anticipated the observed redshift dependence of BAO deviations and predict a rapid convergence to CMB-consistent expansion for $z \gtrsim 0.2$, aligning with reconstructions of $H_0(z)$ from BAO plus uncalibrated Type Ia supernovae. We conclude by looking to future tests, including improved mapping of the local density and velocity field, fits to galaxy distance catalogues at the field level, kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich constraints on coherent outflows, fast radio bursts, and the long-term prospect of redshift drift measurements as a direct probe of time-varying non-cosmological redshift contributions.</description>

      <title>The Landscape of Undergraduate Astronomy and Astrophysics Degree Requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this document we summarize the results of a survey of undergraduate degree-granting programs conducted by the 2024-2025 American Astronomical Society Education Committee's Subcommittee on UndeRgraduate and Graduate Education (SURGE). Individuals from 78 institutions completed the survey, representing approximately 1000 majors annually and a majority of undergraduate Astronomy and Astrophysics degree-granting institutions. Information collected from participants include: degree names, degree types, course requirements, elective course options, and learning goals. Our report presents 9 key findings and 10 recommendations, and these are summarized in the preamble to the report. The recommendations are directed primarily to degree-granting departments and the American Astronomical Society, as the principal relevant professional organization, though we earnestly invite all members of the Astronomy and Astrophysics community to contribute to a broader discussion about these findings and recommendations. Appendix A of the report contains detailed descriptions of survey data analyses. Appendices B and C contain recommended undergraduate course requirements and learning goals, respectively. Our survey results show clearly that there is not currently community consensus about what knowledge and competencies an undergraduate Astronomy or Astrophysics degree should instill. This lack of cohesion is a problem for our community, as it dilutes the significance and interpretability of the credential for employers and graduate schools. We view this report as just the beginning of an important dialog, and we look forward to engaging with the Astronomy and Astrophysics community about our findings and recommendations through our feedback form at bit.ly/49c4FYb.</description>

      <title>Propulsion Trades for a 2035-2040 Solar Gravitational Lens Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Solar Gravitational Lens (SGL) enables multipixel imaging and spatially resolved spectroscopy of a nearby terrestrial exoplanet from heliocentric distances $z\simeq 650$-$900$ AU, where solar power is negligible and transportation largely sets time-to-first-science. Reaching 650 AU in 20 yr implies a ballistic lower bound $\bar v_r \simeq 32.5~{\rm AU/yr}\simeq 154$ km/s, motivating propulsion beyond chemical and gravity-assist-only options. We compare close-perihelion solar sailing, fission-powered nuclear electric propulsion (NEP), and Oberth-enabled hybrid injection using simple time-to-distance models that isolate the long outbound leg (i.e., excluding architecture-dependent inner-solar-system injection overhead). For solar sailing, $r_p=0.05$ AU requires $\sigma_{\rm tot}\simeq 4.9~\mathrm{g\,m^{-2}}$ for $v_\infty\simeq 105$ km/s and $\sigma_{\rm tot}\simeq 2.3~\mathrm{g\,m^{-2}}$ for $v_\infty\simeq 155$ km/s, placing sub-20 yr sail-only access in an ultra-low-areal-density, deep-perihelion survivability regime. For NEP, a constant-power stage closure shows that a $m_0=20$ t spacecraft with $m_{\rm pay}=800$ kg and $\eta=0.7$ reaches 650 AU in ~27-33 yr for $\alpha_{\rm tot}=10$-$20~\mathrm{kg\,kW_e^{-1}}$ (typical optima $P_e\simeq 0.18$-$0.30~\mathrm{MW_e}$, thrust of a few newtons). NEP-only sub-20 yr transfers require extremely aggressive assumptions ($\alpha_{\rm tot}\lesssim 3~\mathrm{kg\,kW_e^{-1}}$ and very-high-$I_{\rm sp}$, long-life EP), whereas hybrid architectures become plausible for $\alpha_{\rm tot}\sim 10$-$15~\mathrm{kg\,kW_e^{-1}}$ if an injection stage supplies $v_0\gtrsim 50$-70 km/s prior to NEP cruise. We map these requirements to technology readiness and identify system-level demonstrations needed by the early 2030s for a credible 2035--2040 start.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe our efforts to fully integrate generative artificial intelligence (GAI) into an introductory undergraduate astronomy course. Ordered by student perception of utility, GAI was used in instructional Python notebooks, in a subset of assignments, for student presentation preparations, and as a participant (in conjunction with a RAG-encoded textbook) in a course Slack channel. Assignments were divided into GAI-encouraged and GAI-discouraged. We incentivized student mastery of the material through midterm and final exams in which electronics were not allowed. Student evaluations of the course showed no reduction compared to the non-GAI version from the previous year.</description>

      <title>Separation of polarized dust emission in Planck observations with Scattering Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarized dust emission is a major astrophysical foreground contaminant of the cosmic microwave background polarization (CMB), which must be accurately measured to look for the faint primordial polarization B-modes of inflationary origin. The available maps to date, obtained from Planck space mission data, are noise-dominated in the high Galactic latitude regions that are most relevant for CMB observations. The goal of this work is to obtain better dust polarization maps from Planck observations, by exploiting both the dependence between polarization and total intensity, as well as the non-Gaussian filamentary structure of the dust emission. To this end, we use scattering transforms, which provide a stable and interpretable representation of complex non-Gaussian textures, allowing for a data-driven analysis approach requiring no explicit priors on dust. The analysis is performed locally on Cartesian patches of sky, where Stokes linear polarization parameters, redefined in a local reference frame, are modeled as the sum of a signal of interest and a nuisance term. Using multiple realizations of the random nuisance term, we recover the polarized dust maps by minimizing a composite objective function that enforces multiple statistical constraints in scattering space. The proposed algorithm reconstructs maps of polarized dust emission whose statistics are consistent with those expected from the Planck data once random nuisance realizations are added. This is confirmed in a validation test using a high signal-to-noise sky region as a test case. Comparisons with existing dust polarization maps and models show that our approach better recovers small-scale polarized dust emission, and that our reconstructed power and cross-spectra closely match those of the dust polarization maps. A second set of maps that deterministically reproduce the features of the dust polarized emission is also produced.</description>

      <title>Impact of Higher-Order Modes on Eccentricity Measurement in Binary Black Hole Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the systematic biases in measuring orbital eccentricity for binary black hole (BBH) mergers that arise when higher-order modes (HOMs) of gravitational waves are neglected in waveform modeling. Using Bayesian inference with the state-of-the-art eccentric, spin-aligned, higher-mode effective-one-body model SEOBNRv5EHM, we reanalyze six previously suggested eccentric gravitational-wave events--GW190521, GW190620, GW190701, GW191109, GW200129, and GW200208\_222617. Comparing results with its dominant-mode-only counterpart SEOBNRv5E, we find no statistically significant HOM-induced bias in eccentricity for any of these events, including GW190521, whose eccentricity has been debated in the literature. To identify parameter regimes vulnerable to HOM omission, we perform a broad zero-noise injection campaign varying detector-frame total mass, mass ratio, eccentricity, inclination, and network SNR. We find that significant systematic biases ($\Delta_e/\sigma &gt; 1$) arise predominantly in systems with high total mass ($M^{\rm det}\gtrsim120M_\odot$), highly asymmetric mass ratios ($q \gtrsim 4$), near edge-on orientations ($\theta_\textrm{JN} \gtrsim 30^\circ$), and high SNRs ($\rho^N_\textrm{mf}\approx50$). Notably, for quasi-circular BBHs with $M^{\rm det}\gtrsim140M_\odot$, neglecting HOMs may lead to strong false-positive evidence for nonzero eccentricity. By contrast, for lower-mass systems ($M^{\rm det}\sim100 M_\odot$), HOM exclusion produces negligible eccentricity biases. Our results demonstrate that although current eccentric candidates are not impacted by HOM omission, future eccentricity measurements--particularly for massive, asymmetric, or edge-on systems--require HOM-inclusive waveforms to avoid substantial systematic errors.</description>

      <title>Systematic effect induced by misalignment in a Reflective Polarization Modulator for CMB, and application to the LiteBIRD case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: [Abridged] The LiteBIRD mission aims to measure the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization with unprecedented precision, targeting the detection of primordial B modes and a precise determination of the tensor-to-scalar ratio r. A central component of LiteBIRD are the polarization modulators based on Half-Wave Plates (HWP). In this work, we investigate systematic effects caused by a small, constant misalignment between the reflective HWP's rotation axis and optical axis, which mimics a wedge-like effect. This effect can introduce HWP-synchronous pointing errors, biasing polarization measurements and generating spurious B modes. Using the LiteBIRD simulation framework, we implement this wedge-like misalignment in time-ordered data and evaluate its impact on reconstructed maps and angular power spectra. Our results show that the contamination predominantly mimics lensing B modes rather than primordial tensor modes, and its impact is reduced when increasing the number of detectors. By estimating the resulting error on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, we set constraints on the maximum allowable wedge angle to ensure systematic effects remain below mission requirements. This study emphasizes the critical importance of precise optical alignment in CMB polarization experiments. Future work will address the additional effects of time-dependent HWP wobbling and more realistic scenarios with non-ideal detector pairs.</description>

      <title>QuGrav: Bringing gravitational waves to light with Qumodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose using qumodes, quantum bosonic modes, for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves via the inverse Gertsenshtein effect, where a gravitational wave resonantly converts into a single photon in a magnetized cavity. For an occupation number $n$ of the photon field in a qumode, the conversion probability is enhanced by a factor of $n+1$ due to Bose-Einstein statistics. Unlocking this increased sensitivity entails the ability to continuously prepare the qumode and perform non-demolition measurement on the qumode-qubit system within the qumode coherence time. Our results indicate that, at microwave frequencies and with existing technology, the proposed setup can attain sensitivities within 1.7 orders of magnitude of the cosmological bound. With anticipated near-future improvements, it has the potential to surpass this limit and pave the way for the first exploration of high-frequency cosmological gravitational wave backgrounds. At optical frequencies, it can enhance the sensitivity of current detectors by one order of magnitude. That further enhances their potential in reaching the single-graviton level.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent deflection reconstruction: new technique to search for gravitational waves with the cosmic microwave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) passing through the Earth cause a correlated pattern of time-dependent deflections of the apparent position of astronomical sources. We build upon standard lensing reconstruction techniques to develop a new time-dependent quadratic estimator, providing a novel technique to search for the deflections produced by GWs using observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We find that the time-dependent deflection reconstruction is many orders of magnitude more sensitive than the ordinary static lensing estimator, and it can be employed with the data collected by existing and future CMB surveys, without requiring any modification to the experimental or survey design. We demonstrate that CMB surveys offer sensitivity to GWs across a broad frequency range: while the sensitivity will not be competitive over the frequency range covered by pulsar timing arrays, it does extend coverage to both lower and higher frequencies. Finally, we discuss how our methods can be extended to search for other time-varying signals, and also how it can be applied to surveys at other wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Active-Passive Galactic Cosmic Ray Simulator: experimental implementation and microdosimetric characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13158v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Space radiation is one of the major obstacles to space exploration. If not mitigated, radiation can interact both with biological and electronic systems, inducing damage and posing significant risk to space missions. Countermeasures can only be studied effectively with ground-based accelerators that act as a proxy for space radiation. Following an in-silico design and optimization process we have developed a galactic cosmic ray (GCR) simulator using a hybrid active-passive methodology. In this approach, the primary beam energy is actively switched and the beam interacts with specifically designed passive modulators. In this paper, we present the implementation of such a GCR simulator and its experimental microdosimetric characterization. Measuring the GCR field is of paramount importance, both before providing it to the user as a validated radiation field and for achieving the best possible radiation description. The issue is addressed in this paper by using a tissue equivalent proportional counter to measure radiation quality and by comparing experimental measurements with Monte Carlo simulations. In conclusion, we will demonstrate the GCR simulator's capability to reproduce a GCR field.</description>

      <title>The multimessenger view of Pulsar Timing Array black holes with the Horizon-AGN simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the Horizon-AGN cosmological simulation to study the properties of supermassive black hole binaries (MBHBs) contributing most to the gravitational wave background (GWB) signal expected in the pulsar timing array (PTA) band. We develop a pipeline to generate realistic populations of MBHBs, allowing us to estimate both the characteristic strain and GWB time series observable by PTA experiments. We identify potential continuous wave (CW) candidates standing above the background noise, using toy PTA sensitivities representing the current EPTA and future SKA. We estimate the probability of detecting at least one CW with signal-to-noise ratio $&gt;3$ to be $4\%$ ($20\%$) for EPTA (SKA)-like sensitivities, assuming a 10-year baseline. We find the GWB to be dominated by hundreds to thousands of binaries at redshifts in the range $0.05-1$, with chirp masses of $10^{8.5}-10^{9.5}\, M_\odot$, hosted mainly in quiescent massive galaxies residing in halos of mass $\sim 10^{13}\, M_\odot$. CW candidates have larger masses, lower redshifts and are found in even more massive halos, typical of galaxy groups and clusters. The majority of these systems would appear as AGN rather than quasars, because of their low Eddington ratios. Nevertheless, CW candidates with $f_{\rm Edd}&gt;10^{-3}$ can still outshine their hosts, particularly in radio and X-ray bands, suggesting them as the most promising route for identification. Our findings imply that optical and near-infrared searches based on light curve variability are challenging and biased toward more luminous systems. Finally, we highlight important caveats in the common method used to compare PTA observations with theoretical models. We find that GWB spectral inferences used by PTAs could be biased toward shallower slopes and higher amplitudes at $f=1/\rm yr$, thereby reducing the apparent tension between astrophysical expectations and PTA observations.</description>

      <title>STORMY : A Real-time Triggering Framework using Yamagawa Solar Spectrograph for Active Solar Emission Observations with the MWA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some of the most interesting insights into solar physics and space weather come from studying radio emissions associated with solar activity, which remain inherently unpredictable. Hence, a real-time triggering system is needed for solar observations with the versatile new-generation radio telescopes to efficiently capture these episodes of solar activity with the precious and limited solar observing time. We have developed such a system, Solar Triggered Observations of Radio bursts using MWA and Yamagawa (STROMY) for the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), the precursor for the low frequency telescope of upcoming Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO). It is based on near-real-time data from the Yamagawa solar spectrograph, located at a similar longitude to the MWA. We have devised, implemented, and tested algorithms to perform an effective denoising of the data to identify signatures of solar activity in the Yamagawa data in near real-time. End-to-end tests of triggered observations have been successfully carried out at the MWA. STORMY is operational at the MWA for the routine solar observations, a timely development in the view of the ongoing solar maximum. We present this new observing framework and discuss how it can enable efficient capturing of event-rich solar data with existing instruments, like the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), Owens Valley Radio Observatory - Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA) etc., and pave the way for triggered observing with the SKAO, especially the SKA-Low.</description>

      <title>VLBI astrometry of radio stars to link radio and optical celestial reference frames. II. 11 radio stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The alignment between the radio-based International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) and the optical Gaia Celestial Reference Frame (Gaia-CRF) is critical for multi-waveband astronomy, yet systematic offsets at the optical bright end (G&lt;13) limit their consistency. While radio stars offer a potential link between these frames, their utility has been restricted by the scarcity of precise Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) astrometry. In this study, we present new VLBI astrometry of 11 radio stars using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), expanding the existing sample with positions, parallaxes, and proper motions measured. All 11 radio stars were detected, for 10 of which parallaxes and proper motions can be estimated, achieving median uncertainties better than 0.1 mas and 0.1 mas/yr, respectively. These new samples greatly contribute to the link between ICRF and Gaia-CRF at the optical bright end.</description>
