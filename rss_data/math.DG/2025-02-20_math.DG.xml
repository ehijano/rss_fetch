      <title>Uniqueness of asymptotically conical shrinking gradient K\"ahler-Ricci solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, up to biholomorphism, a given noncompact complex manifold only admits one shrinking gradient K\"ahler-Ricci soliton with Ricci curvature tending to zero at infinity. Our result does not require fixing the asymptotic data of the metric, nor fixing the soliton vector field. The method used to prove the uniqueness of the soliton vector field can be applied more widely, for example to show that conical Calabi-Yau metrics on a given complex manifold are unique up to biholomorphism. We also use it to prove that if two polarized Fano fibrations, as introduced by Sun-Zhang, are biholomorphic and their vertices agree, then they are isomorphic as algebraic varieties.</description>

      <title>Biharmonic Maps on Conformally Compact Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study biharmonic maps between conformally compact manifolds, a large class of complete manifolds with bounded geometry, asymptotically negative curvature, and smooth compactification. These metrics provide a far-reaching generalization of hyperbolic space. We work on the class of simple $b$-maps, i.e. maps which send interior to interior, boundary to boundary, and are transversal to the boundary of the target manifold. The main result of this paper is a non-existence result: if a simple $b$-map $u:\left(M,g\right)\to\left(N,h\right)$ between conformally compact manifolds is biharmonic, its restriction to the boundary is non-constant, and moreover $\left(N,h\right)$ is non-positively curved, then $u$ is harmonic. We do not assume any integrability condition on $u$: in particular, $u$ is not required to have finite energy, nor is its tension field required to be in $L^{p}$ for any $p$. Our result implies the following version of the Generalized Chen's Conjecture: if $\left(N,h\right)$ is a non-positively curved conformally compact manifold, and $\Sigma\hookrightarrow N$ is a properly embedded submanifold with boundary meeting $\partial N$ transversely, then $\Sigma$ is biharmonic if and only if it is minimal.</description>

      <title>The Light ray transform for pseudo-Euclidean metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ray transform $L$ over null (light) rays in the pseudo-Euclidean space with signature $(n',n'')$, $n'\ge2$, $n''\ge2$. We analyze the normal operator $L'L$, derive an inversion formula, and prove stability estimates. We show that the symbol $p(\xi)$ is elliptic but singular at the light cone. We analyze $L$ as an Fourier Integral Operator as well. Finally, we compare this to the Minkowski case.</description>

      <title>Projective structures on curves and conformal geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Projective structures on curves appear naturally in many areas of mathematics, from extrinsic conformal geometry to analysis, where the main problem is to find qualitative information about the solutions of Hill equations. In this paper, we describe in detail the correspondence between different equivalent definitions of projective structures and their isomorphism classes, correcting long-standing inexactitudes in the literature. As an application, we show that the {\em Yamabe problem for curves} in a conformal/M\"obius ambient space has no solutions in general.</description>

      <title>Stability of systolic inequalities for the M\"obius strip and Klein bottle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The systolic area $\alpha_{sys}$ of a nonsimply connected compact Riemannian surface $(M,g)$ is defined as its area divided by the square of the systole, where the systole is equal to the length of a shortest noncontractible closed curve. The systolic inequality due to Bavard states that on the Klein bottle, the systolic area has the optimal lower bound $\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{\pi}$. Bavard also constructed metrics of minimal systolic area in any given conformal class. We give an alternative proof of these results, which also yields an estimate on the systolic defect $\alpha_{sys}-\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{\pi}$ in terms of the $L^2$-distance of the conformal factor to the metric which minimizes the systolic area. On the M\"obius strip, we also prove similar estimates for metrics in fixed conformal classes.</description>

      <title>Existence of Minimal Surfaces in Infinite Volume Hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of embedded minimal surfaces in non-compact 3-manifolds remains a largely unresolved and challenging problem in geometry. In this paper, we address several open cases regarding the existence of finite-area, embedded, complete, minimal surfaces in infinite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds.
  Among other results, for doubly degenerate manifolds with bounded geometry, we prove a dichotomy: either every such manifold contains a closed minimal surface or there exists such a manifold admitting a foliation by closed minimal surfaces. We also construct the first examples of Schottky manifolds with closed minimal surfaces and demonstrate the existence of Schottky manifolds containing infinitely many closed minimal surfaces. Lastly, for hyperbolic 3-manifolds with rank-1 cusps, we show that a broad class of these manifolds must contain a finite-area, embedded, complete minimal surface.</description>

Abstract: In this work we find a unifying scheme for the known explicit complex-valued eigenfunctions on the classical compact Riemannian symmetric spaces. For this we employ the well-known Cartan embedding for those spaces. This also leads to the construction of new eigenfunctions on the quaternionic Grassmannians.</description>

      <title>Isometries of spacetimes without observer horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the isometry groups of (non-compact) Lorentzian manifolds with well-behaved causal structure, aka causal spacetimes satisfying the ``no observer horizons'' condition. Our main result is that the group of time orientation-preserving isometries acts properly on the spacetime. As corollaries, we obtain the existence of an invariant Cauchy temporal function, and a splitting of the isometry group into a compact subgroup and a subgroup roughly corresponding to time translations. The latter can only be the trivial group, $\mathbb{Z}$, or $\mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We work through Book I of Euclid's Elements with our focus on application of areas (I.42, I.44, I.45). We summarize alternate constructions from medieval editions of Euclid's elements and ancient and medieval commentaries. We remark that Euclid's proof of I.44 involves a seldom commented on use of superposition, but that several medieval editions of Euclid give constructions that avoid the use of superposition. This use of superposition is also avoided in Ralph Abraham's "VCE: The Visual Constructions of Euclid" C#12, C#12B at http://www.visual-euclid.org/vce/contents.html

      <description>arXiv:2502.13927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we prove that every closed connected oriented odd-dimensional manifold admits a map of non-zero degree (i.e., a domination) from a tight contact manifold of the same dimension. This provides an odd-dimensional counterpart of a symplectic domination result due to Joel Fine and Dmitri Panov. We prove that the dominating contact manifold can be ensured to be Liouville-fillable, but not Weinstein-fillable in general. We discuss an application for contact divisors arising as zero sets of asymptotically contact-holomorphic sections.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we formulate and prove a gauge equivalence for unitary connections and skew-Hermitian Higgs fields of suitable regularity that are mapped to the same function under the non-abelian X-ray transform on nontrapping asymptotically hyperbolic spaces with negative curvature and no nontrivial twisted conformal Killing tensor fields with certain regularity. If one furthermore fixes such a connection with zero curvature, a corollary provides an injectivity result for the non-abelian X-ray transform over skew-Hermitian Higgs fields.</description>

      <title>On the normal stability of the 4-harmonic and the ES-4-harmonic hypersphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Both 4-harmonic and ES-4-harmonic maps are two higher order generalizations of the well-studied harmonic map equation given by a nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation of order eight. Due to the large number of derivatives it is very difficult to find any difference in the qualitative behavior of these two variational problems. It is well known that the small hypersphere \(\iota\colon\s^m(\frac{1}{2})\to\s^{m+1}\) is a critical point of both the 4-energy as well as the ES-4-energy but up to now it has not been investigated if there is a difference concerning its stability.
  The main contribution of this article is to show that the small hypersphere is unstable with respect to normal variations both as 4-harmonic hypersphere as well as ES-4-harmonic hypersphere and that its normal index equals one in both cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two homogeneous spaces of the form G_1/K and G_2/K, where G_1 and G_2 are compact simple Lie groups, we study the existence problem for G_1xG_2-invariant Einstein metrics on the homogeneous space M=G_1xG_2/K. For the large subclass C of spaces having three pairwise inequivalent isotropy irreducible summands (12 infinite families and 70 sporadic examples), we obtain that existence is equivalent to the existence of a real root for certain quartic polynomial depending on the dimensions and two Killing constants, which allows a full classification and the possibility to weigh the existence and non-existence pieces of C.</description>

      <title>Connected components of the space of triples of transverse partial flags in $\mathrm{SO}_0(p,q)$ and Anosov representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We count the number of connected components in the space of triples of transverse flags in any flag manifold of $\mathrm{SO}_0(p,q)$. We compute the effect the involution of the unipotent radical has on those components and deduce that for certain parabolic subgroups $P_{\Theta}$, any $P_{\Theta}$-Anosov subgroup is virtually isomorphic to either a surface group of a free group. We give examples of Anosov subgroups which are neither free nor surface groups for some sets of roots which do not fall under the previous results. As a consequence of the methods developed here, we get an explicit algorithm based on computation of minors to check if a unipotent matrix in $\mathrm{SO}_0(p,q)$ belong to the $\Theta$-positive semigroup $U_\Theta^{&gt;0}$ when $p\neq q$.</description>

      <title>Circle bundles with PSC over large manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01047v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct infinitely many examples of macroscopically large manifolds of dimension $m \geq 4$ equipped with circle bundles whose total spaces admit metrics of positive scalar curvature and have macroscopic dimension at most $\lceil m/2 \rceil + 1$. In particular, we answer a question of Gromov on the existence of circle bundles over enlargeable manifolds whose total spaces admit metrics of positive scalar curvature, in all dimensions. Our constructions are based on techniques from symplectic geometry.</description>

      <title>A Codimension Two Approach to the $\mathbb{S}^1$-Stability Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12479v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: J. Rosenberg's $\mathbb{S}^1$-stability conjecture states that a closed oriented manifold $X$ admits a positive scalar curvature metric iff $X\times \mathbb{S}^1$ admits a positive scalar curvature metric $h$. As pointed out by J. Rosenberg and others, there are known counterexamples in dimension four. We prove this conjecture whenever $h$ satisfies a geometric bound, depending only on the dimension of $ X $, which measures the discrepancy between $\partial_\theta\in T\mathbb{S}^1$ and the normal vector field to $X\times \{P\}$, for a fixed $P\in \mathbb{S}^1.$</description>

      <title>Global critical points of the Standard Model on four-dimensional spacetimes of expanding type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Standard Model of elementary particle physics is one of the most successful models of contemporary theoretical physics being in full agreement with experiments. However, its mathematical structure deserves further investigations both from a geometric and an analytic point of view. The aim of this manuscript is to provide a mathematically well-defined and self-contained description of the Standard Model in terms of gauge theory and differential geometry on globally hyperbolic manifolds. Within this setup we then prove the existence of a global solution for the Euler-Lagrange equations of the Standard Model (with the conformal Higgs potential) under the assumptions that the globally hyperbolic manifold is a four-dimensional spacetime of expanding type and small initial data. This is achieved by establishing a gauge-invariant energy estimate which is of independent mathematical interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an example of an infinite planar embedded self-similar binary tree $\Sigma$ which is the essentially unique solution to the Steiner problem of finding the shortest connection of a given planar self-similar fractal set $C$ of positive Hausdorff dimension. The set $C$ can be considered the set of leaves, or the ``boundary``, of the tree $\Sigma$, so that $\Sigma$ is an irreducible solution to the Steiner problem with datum $C$ (i.e. $\Sigma\setminus C$ is connected).</description>

      <title>A Positive Quasilocal Mass for Causal Variational Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new inequality for a nonlinear surface layer integral is proved for minimizers of causal variational principles. This inequality is applied to obtain a new proof of the positive mass theorem with volume constraint. Next, a positive mass theorem without volume constraint is stated and proved by introducing and using the concept of asymptotic alignment. Moreover, a positive quasilocal mass and a synthetic definition of scalar curvature are introduced in the setting of causal variational principles. Our notions and results are illustrated by the explicit examples of causal fermion systems constructed in ultrastatic spacetimes and the Schwarzschild spacetime. In these examples, the correspondence to the ADM mass and similarities to the Brown-York mass are worked out.</description>

      <title>Stability theory over toroidal or Novikov type base and Canonical modifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02489v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We set up a generalization of ubiquitous one-parameter families in algebraic geometry and their use for stability theories ([GIT, HL, AHLH]) to families over toric varieties and their analytic analogues. The language allows us to reformulate degenerations of ``irrational" direction in the literature as canonical objects in a unified manner.
  Accordingly, we generalize the (semi)stable reduction-type theorem for $\Theta$-stratification in [AHLH] of Langton type to our higher rank setup. We also establish complex analytic analogue of the results. As an infinitesimal analogue of toric spectrum, we also use Novikov type rings as it gives more canonicity but its use can be avoided logically for readers for readers who prefer not to use such rings.
  As applications, we establish the properness part of the moduli of Calabi-Yau cones (cf., [Od24a]), and also reduce the properness of the moduli of Kahler-Ricci solitons, again to a finite generation type problem in birational geometry.</description>

      <title>Algebraic geometry of bubbling Kahler metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14518v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an algebro-geometric or non-archimedean framework to study bubbling phenomena of Kahler metrics with Euclidean volume growth, after [DS17, Sun23, dBS23]. In particular, for any degenerating family to log terminal singularity, we algebraically construct a finite sequence of birational modifications of the family with milder degenerations, and compare with analytic bubbling constructions in loc.cit. We also provide approaches in terms of coordinates and valuations. Our discussion partially depends on the general framework of stability theory in our [Od24b] (arXiv:2406.02489) after [HL14, AHLH23].</description>

      <title>Nonnegative cross-curvature in infinite dimensions: synthetic definition and spaces of measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonnegative cross-curvature (NNCC) is a geometric property of a cost function defined on a product space that originates in optimal transportation and the Ma-Trudinger-Wang theory. Motivated by applications in optimization, gradient flows and mechanism design, we propose a variational formulation of nonnegative cross-curvature on c-convex domains applicable to infinite dimensions and nonsmooth settings. The resulting class of NNCC spaces is closed under Gromov-Hausdorff convergence and for this class, we extend many properties of classical nonnegative cross-curvature: stability under generalized Riemannian submersions, characterization in terms of the convexity of certain sets of c-concave functions, and in the metric case, it is a subclass of positively curved spaces in the sense of Alexandrov. One of our main results is that Wasserstein spaces of probability measures inherit the NNCC property from their base space. Additional examples of NNCC costs include the Bures-Wasserstein and Fisher-Rao squared distances, the Hellinger-Kantorovich squared distance (in some cases), the relative entropy on probability measures, and the 2-Gromov-Wasserstein squared distance on metric measure spaces.</description>

      <title>Some Remarks on Isoparametric Functions in Closed 4-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study transnormal and isoparametric functions on closed Riemannian 4-manifolds and establish fundamental restrictions on their topology and geometry. In particular, we show that such manifolds cannot be endowed with negatively curved metrics, contrasting with known results in the compact simply connected case. Moreover, in certain cases, we provide a description of their fundamental groups. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the global structure of isoparametric foliations.</description>

      <title>Periodic double tilings of the plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study tilings of the plane composed of two repeating tiles of different assigned areas relative to an arbitrary periodic lattice. We classify isoperimetric configurations (i.e., configurations with minimal length of the interfaces) both in the case of a fixed lattice or for an arbitrary periodic lattice. We find three different configurations depending on the ratio between the assigned areas of the two tiles and compute the isoperimetric profile. The three different configurations are composed of tiles with a different number of circular edges, moreover, different configurations exhibit a different optimal lattice. Finally, we raise some open problems related to our investigation.</description>
