      <title>LHIEM: the Longitudinal Health, Income, and Employment Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic microsimulation has long been recognized as a powerful tool for policy analysis, but in fact most major health policy simulations lack path dependency, a critical feature for evaluating policies that depend on accumulated outcomes such as retirement savings, wealth, or debt. We propose LHIEM (the Longitudinal Health, Income and Employment Model), a path-dependent discrete-time microsimulation that predicts annual health care expenditures, family income, and health status for the U.S. population over a multi-year period. LHIEM advances the population from year to year as a Markov chain with modules capturing the particular dynamics of each predictive attribute. LHIEM was designed to assess a health care financing proposal that would allow individuals to borrow from the U.S. government to cover health care costs, requiring careful tracking of medical expenditures and medical debt over time. However, LHIEM is flexible enough to be used for a range of modeling needs related to predicting health care spending and income over time. In this paper, we present the details of the model and all dynamic modules, and include a case study to demonstrate how LHIEM can be used to evaluate proposed policy changes.</description>

      <title>The Prosecutor's Fallacy and Expert Testimony: A Modern Take Using Likelihood Ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forensic examiners and attorneys need to know how to express evidence in favor or against a prosecutor's hypothesis in a way that avoids the prosecutor's fallacy and follows the modern reporting standards for forensic evidence. This article delves into the inherent conflict between legal and scientific principles, exacerbated by the prevalence of alternative facts in contemporary discourse. Courts grapple with contradictory expert testimonies, leading to a surge in erroneous rulings based on flawed amicus briefs and testimonies, notably the persistent prosecutor's fallacy. The piece underscores the necessity for legal practitioners to navigate this fallacy within the modern forensic science framework, emphasizing the importance of reporting likelihood ratios (LRs) over posterior probabilities. Recognizing the challenge of lay comprehension of LRs, the article calls for updated recommendations to mitigate the prosecutor's fallacy. Its contribution lies in providing a detailed analysis of the fallacy using LRs and advocating for a sound interpretation of evidence. Illustrated through a modified real case, this article serves as a valuable guide for legal professionals, offering insights into avoiding fallacious reasoning in forensic evidence assessment.</description>

      <title>Bayesian network approach to building an affective module for a driver behavioural model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the affective component of a Driver Behavioural Model (DBM), specifically modelling some driver's mental states, such as mental load and active fatigue, which may affect driving performance. We used Bayesian networks (BNs) to explore the dependencies between various relevant variables and estimate the probability that a driver was in a particular mental state based on their physiological and demographic conditions. Through this approach, our goal is to improve our understanding of driver behaviour in dynamic environments, with potential applications in traffic safety and autonomous vehicle technologies.</description>

      <title>Statistical analysis of team formation and player roles in football</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The availability of tracking data in football presents unique opportunities for analyzing team shape and player roles, but leveraging it effectively remains challenging. This difficulty arises from the significant overlap in player positions, which complicates the identification of distinct roles and team formations. In this work, we propose a novel model that incorporates a hidden permutation matrix to simultaneously estimate team formations and assign roles to players at the frame level. To address the cardinality of permutation sets, we develop a statistical procedure to parsimoniously select relevant matrices prior to parameter estimation. Additionally, to capture formation changes during a match, we introduce a latent regime variable, enabling the modeling of dynamic tactical adjustments. This framework disentangles player locations from role-specific positions, providing a clear representation of team structure. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach using player tracking data, showcasing its potential for detailed team and player analysis.</description>

      <title>When are Diffusion Priors Helpful in Sparse Reconstruction? A Study with Sparse-view CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on image generation, and are gaining traction for sparse medical image reconstruction tasks. However, compared to classical reconstruction algorithms relying on simple analytical priors, diffusion models have the dangerous property of producing realistic looking results \emph{even when incorrect}, particularly with few observations. We investigate the utility of diffusion models as priors for image reconstruction by varying the number of observations and comparing their performance to classical priors (sparse and Tikhonov regularization) using pixel-based, structural, and downstream metrics. We make comparisons on low-dose chest wall computed tomography (CT) for fat mass quantification. First, we find that classical priors are superior to diffusion priors when the number of projections is ``sufficient''. Second, we find that diffusion priors can capture a large amount of detail with very few observations, significantly outperforming classical priors. However, they fall short of capturing all details, even with many observations. Finally, we find that the performance of diffusion priors plateau after extremely few ($\approx$10-15) projections. Ultimately, our work highlights potential issues with diffusion-based sparse reconstruction and underscores the importance of further investigation, particularly in high-stakes clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Power and Sample Size Calculations for Bayes Factors in the Binomial Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian design of experiments and sample size calculations usually rely on complex Monte Carlo simulations in practice. Obtaining bounds on Bayesian notions of the false-positive rate and power therefore often lack closed-form or approximate numerical solutions. In this paper, we focus on the sample size calculation in the binomial setting via Bayes factors, the predictive updating factor from prior to posterior odds. We discuss the drawbacks of sample size calculations via Monte Carlo simulations and propose a numerical root-finding approach which allows to determine the necessary sample size to obtain prespecified bounds of Bayesian power and type-I-error rate almost instantaneously. Real-world examples and applications in clinical trials illustrate the advantage of the proposed method. We focus on point-null versus composite and directional hypothesis tests, derive the corresponding Bayes factors, and discuss relevant aspects to consider when pursuing Bayesian design of experiments with the introduced approach. In summary, our approach allows for a Bayes-frequentist compromise by providing a Bayesian analogue to a frequentist power analysis for the Bayes factor in binomial settings. A case study from a Phase II trial illustrates the utility of our approach. The methods are implemented in our R package bfpwr.</description>

      <title>Rank-Based Identification of High-dimensional Surrogate Markers: Application to Vaccinology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In vaccine trials with long-term participant follow-up, it is of great importance to identify surrogate markers that accurately infer long-term immune responses. These markers offer practical advantages such as providing early, indirect evidence of vaccine efficacy, and can accelerate vaccine development while identifying potential biomarkers. High-throughput technologies like RNA-sequencing have emerged as promising tools for understanding complex biological systems and informing new treatment strategies. However, these data are high-dimensional, presenting unique statistical challenges for existing surrogate marker identification methods. We introduce Rank-based Identification of high-dimensional SurrogatE Markers (RISE), a novel approach designed for small sample, high-dimensional settings typical in modern vaccine experiments. RISE employs a non-parametric univariate test to screen variables for promising candidates, followed by surrogate evaluation on independent data. Our simulation studies demonstrate RISE's desirable properties, including type one error rate control and empirical power under various conditions. Applying RISE to a clinical trial for inactivated influenza vaccination, we sought to identify genes whose post-vaccination expression could serve as a surrogate for the induced immune response. This analysis revealed a signature of genes whose combined expression at 1 day post-injection appears to be a reasonable surrogate for the neutralising antibody titres at 28 days after vaccination. Pathways related to innate antiviral signalling and interferon stimulation were strongly represented in this derived surrogate, providing a clear immunological interpretation.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Covariate-Dependent Circadian Modeling of Rest-Activity Rhythms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a Bayesian covariate-dependent anti-logistic circadian model for analyzing activity data collected via wrist-worn wearable devices. The proposed approach integrates covariates into the modeling of the amplitude and phase parameters, facilitating cohort-level analysis with enhanced flexibility and interpretability. To promote model sparsity, we employ an l_1-ball projection prior, enabling precise control over complexity while identifying significant predictors. We assess performances on simulated data and then apply the method to real-world actigraphy data from people with epilepsy. Our results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in uncovering complex relationships among demographic, psychological, and medical factors influencing rest-activity rhythms, offering insights for personalized clinical assessments and healthcare interventions.</description>

      <title>Generation of Threat: Crediting football players for creating dangerous actions in an unbiased way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an innovative methodology to identify football players at the origin of threatening actions in a team. In our framework, a threat is defined as entering the opposing team's danger area. We investigate the timing of threat events and ball touches of players, and capture their correlation using Hawkes processes. Our model-based approach allows us to evaluate a player's ability to create danger both directly and through interactions with teammates. We define a new index, called Generation of Threat (GoT), that measures in an unbiased way the contribution of a player to threat generation. For illustration, we present a detailed analysis of Chelsea's 2016-2017 season, with a standout performance from Eden Hazard. We are able to credit each player for his involvement in danger creation and determine the main circuits leading to threat. In the same spirit, we investigate the danger generation process of Stade Rennais in the 2021-2022 season. Furthermore, we establish a comprehensive ranking of Ligue 1 players based on their generated threat in the 2021-2022 season. Our analysis reveals surprising results, with players such as Jason Berthomier, Moses Simon and Frederic Guilbert among the top performers in the GoT rankings. We also present a ranking of Ligue 1 central defenders in terms of generation of threat and confirm the great performance of some center-back pairs, such as Nayef Aguerd and Warmed Omari.</description>

      <title>Individual causal effect estimation accounting for latent disease state modification among bipolar participants in mobile health studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Individuals with bipolar disorder tend to cycle through disease states such as depression and mania. The heterogeneous nature of disease across states complicates the evaluation of interventions for bipolar disorder patients, as varied interventional success is observed within and across individuals. In fact, we hypothesize that disease state acts as an effect modifier for the causal effect of a given intervention on health outcomes. To address this dilemma, we propose an N-of-1 approach using an adapted autoregressive hidden Markov model, applied to longitudinal mobile health data collected from individuals with bipolar disorder. This method allows us to identify a latent variable from mobile health data to be treated as an effect modifier between the exposure and outcome of interest while allowing for missing data in the outcome. A counterfactual approach is employed for causal inference and to obtain a g-formula estimator to recover said effect. The performance of the proposed method is compared with a naive approach across extensive simulations and application to a multi-year smartphone study of bipolar patients, evaluating the individual effect of digital social activity on sleep duration across different latent disease states.</description>

      <title>Changes over time in the 100-year return value of climate model variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We assess evidence for changes in tail characteristics of wind, solar irradiance and temperature variables output from CMIP6 global climate models (GCMs) due to climate forcing. We estimate global and climate zone annual maximum and annual means for period (2015, 2100) from daily output of seven GCMs for daily wind speed, maximum wind speed, solar irradiance and near-surface temperature. We calculate corresponding annualised data for individual locations within neighbourhoods of the North Atlantic and Celtic Sea region. We consider output for three climate scenarios and multiple climate ensembles. We estimate non-stationary extreme value models for annual extremes, and non-homogeneous Gaussian regressions for annual means, using Bayesian inference. We use estimated statistical models to quantify the distribution of (i) the change in 100-year return value for annual extremes, and (2) the change in annual mean, over the period (2025, 2125). To summarise results, we estimate linear mixed effects models for observed variation of (i) and (ii). Evidence for changes in the 100-year return value for annual maxima of solar irradiance and temperature is much stronger than for wind variables over time and with climate scenario.</description>

      <title>Context in Public Health for Underserved Communities: A Bayesian Approach to Online Restless Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04933v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Public health programs often provide interventions to encourage program adherence, and effectively allocating interventions is vital for producing the greatest overall health outcomes, especially in underserved communities where resources are limited. Such resource allocation problems are often modeled as restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) with unknown underlying transition dynamics, hence requiring online reinforcement learning (RL). We present Bayesian Learning for Contextual RMABs (BCoR), an online RL approach for RMABs that novelly combines techniques in Bayesian modeling with Thompson sampling to flexibly model the complex RMAB settings present in public health program adherence problems, namely context and non-stationarity. BCoR's key strength is the ability to leverage shared information within and between arms to learn the unknown RMAB transition dynamics quickly in intervention-scarce settings with relatively short time horizons, which is common in public health applications. Empirically, BCoR achieves substantially higher finite-sample performance over a range of experimental settings, including a setting using real-world adherence data that was developed in collaboration with ARMMAN, an NGO in India which runs a large-scale maternal mHealth program, showcasing BCoR practical utility and potential for real-world deployment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an impact centrality measure to evaluate shock propagation on financial networks capturing a notion of contagion and systemic risk contributions, permitting comparisons of these risks over time. In addition, we provide a statistical validation method when the network is estimated from data, as is done in practice. This statistical test allows us to reliably assess the computed centrality values. We validate our methodology on simulated data and conduct empirical case studies using financial data. We find that our proposed centrality measure increases significantly during times of financial distress and is able to provide insights into the (market implied) risk-levels of different firms and sectors.</description>

      <title>Hypothesis tests and model parameter estimation on data sets with missing correlation information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ideally, all analyses of normally distributed data should include the full covariance information between all data points. In practice, the full covariance matrix between all data points is not always available. Either because a result was published without a covariance matrix, or because one tries to combine multiple results from separate publications. For simple hypothesis tests, it is possible to define robust test statistics that will behave conservatively in the presence on unknown correlations. For model parameter fits, one can inflate the variance by a factor to ensure that things remain conservative at least up to a chosen confidence level. This paper describes a class of robust test statistics for simple hypothesis tests, as well as an algorithm to determine the necessary inflation factor for model parameter fits and Goodness of Fit tests and composite hypothesis tests. It then presents some example applications of the methods to real neutrino interaction data and model comparisons.</description>

      <title>A Poisson Process AutoDecoder for X-ray Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: X-ray observing facilities, such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the eROSITA, have detected millions of astronomical sources associated with high-energy phenomena. The arrival of photons as a function of time follows a Poisson process and can vary by orders-of-magnitude, presenting obstacles for common tasks such as source classification, physical property derivation, and anomaly detection. Previous work has either failed to directly capture the Poisson nature of the data or only focuses on Poisson rate function reconstruction. In this work, we present Poisson Process AutoDecoder (PPAD). PPAD is a neural field decoder that maps fixed-length latent features to continuous Poisson rate functions across energy band and time via unsupervised learning. PPAD reconstructs the rate function and yields a representation at the same time. We demonstrate the efficacy of PPAD via reconstruction, regression, classification and anomaly detection experiments using the Chandra Source Catalog.</description>
