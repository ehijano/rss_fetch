      <title>Memory reshapes stability landscapes: resilience-resistance tradeoffs and critical transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regime shifts in biology, ecology, and other complex systems are often interpreted through stability landscapes and early warning signals that implicitly assume dynamics without memory effects. Yet many real systems exhibit these effects, thus present dynamics depend on past states and past forcing. Here, we study how memory reshapes bistable stability landscapes and regime shifts using a minimal bistable model with a fractional derivative that controls memory strength. We connect landscape geometry to classical notions of resilience and resistance by quantifying basin curvature and the perturbation magnitude required to cross the unstable threshold, and we track how these quantities evolve in time after perturbations. Memory typically flattens basin floors, slowing recovery, while often increasing the perturbation threshold for stability transitions, revealing a tradeoff between resilience and resistance. Because the landscape becomes history-dependent and time-evolving, memory generates qualitative behaviors that do not appear in memory-free models, including delayed collapse or recovery after stress ends, rebound after apparently successful transition, and broadened hysteresis under gradual parameter change. Finally, we show that fitting a memory-free model to memory-driven data can reproduce trajectories while systematically shifting equilibrium branches and tipping locations, risking incorrect diagnosis and management of regime shifts. These results motivate a moving landscape view and provide practical guidance for interpreting observed anomalies and distinguishing memory-driven effects from noise.</description>

      <title>KANDy: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks and Dynamical System Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Dynamics (KANDy) as a zero-depth, wide neural architecture capable of discovering governing equations in chaotic and complex dynamical systems. Building on the foundation of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), KANDy explicitly learns governing equations by replacing sparse regression with a KAN. The synthesis of KANs and sparse regression addresses the limitations of equation discovery for KANs applied to dynamical systems and overcomes cases where sparse regression is hindered by sparsity constraints. Additionally, we show that our model, applied to the Hopf Fibration, recovers topological structure, thereby improving coherence with attractor properties. We apply our model to discrete and continuous dynamical systems, as well as to chaotic partial differential equations (PDEs). These results position KANDy as an interpretable and effective alternative for data-driven modeling of nonlinear dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Continuity of Julia sets and invariant rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For certain typical perturbations $(f_n)_n$ of a rational map $f$ with parabolic cycles, we investigate the relations between the Hausdorff convergence of Julia sets and invariant rays, and the horocyclic convergence of multipliers of periodic points. We establish several equivalent characterizations by means of parabolic implosion theory. This builds upon an analysis of the edge dynamics on the tree for the gate structure induced by the perturbation. The edge dynamics which are driven by Oudkerk's algorithm, are used to trace the orbits for the near parabolic perturbations.</description>

      <title>Uniform Weighted Averages and a Conjecture of Bergelson, Moreira, and Richter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We confirm a conjecture posed by Bergelson, Moreira, and Richter (arXiv:1711.05729), and in particular show that for every probability measure preserving system $(X,\mathscr{B},\mu,T)$, every $k\in \mathbb{N}$, every set $A\in \mathscr{B}$ with $\mu(A)&gt;0$, and every tempered function $f$, \[
  \lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N\mu(A\cap T^{-\lfloor{f(n)\rfloor}}A\cap T^{-\lfloor{f(n+1)\rfloor}}A\cap \cdots \cap T^{-\lfloor{f(n+k)\rfloor}}A)&gt;0. \] This is achieved by establishing conditions on an increasing function $W:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow (0,\infty)$ such that if $(x_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ is a bounded sequence in a Banach space with \[ \lim_{W(N)-W(M)\to\infty}\frac{1}{W(N)-W(M)}\sum_{n=M}^N (W(n)-W(n-1))x_n =L \] then the limit of Ces\`aro averages of $(x_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$, $\lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^Nx_n$ is also equal to $L$.
  Furthermore, the methods we develop can be used to sharpen some of the combinatorial results obtained by Bergelson, Moreira, and Richter. For example, if $E$ is a set of positive upper density, then for any $k\in \mathbb{N}$, any $\epsilon&gt;0$, and all sufficiently large $N\in \mathbb{N}$ there is an $n\in [N-N^{1/2+\epsilon},N]$ such that
  \[\{a,a+\lfloor{n^{3/2}\rfloor},a+\lfloor{(n+1)^{3/2}\rfloor},\dots ,a +\lfloor{(n+k)^{3/2}\rfloor}\}\subseteq E.

      <title>On K{\r u}rka's dichotomy for cellular automata on groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is about topological dynamics of cellular automata on finitely generated groups. We tackle the problem of determining for which group sensitivity to initial conditions is equivalent to the absence of equicontinuity points (so-called K{\r u}rka's dichotomy). We show that the dichotomy holds on any virtually-Z group but not on free groups with 2 or more generators. We also show that if it holds on some group, it must hold on any of its subgroups.</description>

      <title>Dynamic interactions and equilibrium configurations of pulses in the two-dimensional complex quintic Ginzburg-Landau equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper constructs a fast and effective novel numerical scheme which accurately calculates the dynamics of weakly-interacting pulses in the two-dimensional quintic-complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (QCGLE). The numerical scheme uses a global centre-manifold reduction, where the solution to the QCGLE is constructed as the sum of the individual pulses plus a remainder function, which is chosen to be orthogonal to the zero adjoint eigenmodes of the QCGLE linear operator. Projecting this constructed solution onto the stable centre-manifold leads to a fast-slow system of equations consisting of {\it slow} ordinary differential equations for the position and phases of the individual pulses and a {\it fast} partial differential equation for the remainder function. By considering the pulses to be well-separated, the system can be expanded asymptotically in terms of the small parameter $\epsilon=e^{-\lambda_r d}\ll1$, where $\lambda_r$ is the spatial decay rate of the pulse, and $d&gt;0$ is the minimum pulse separation distance. Here the remainder function is determined via a stationary partial differential equation that can be readily solved in an efficient manner using GMRES. Results for $N=2,3,4$ and $5$ pulses are considered, and it is found that different equilibrium solutions are possible such as stable fixed points and limit cycles. The interaction of two stable $N=3$ coherent structures is also considered, where the common tendency found is for the structure to degenerate into pairs of pulses which propagate away from the initial configuration of pulses.</description>

      <title>Onsager--Machlup Functional for Fractional Stochastic Newton Dynamics with Time-Dependent Noise Intensities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the Onsager--Machlup functional for a second-order Newton-type stochastic system driven by time-dependent fractional noise, \[
  X_t'' = f_t(X_t, X_t') + \sigma_t \,\xi_t^{H}, \] where \( H \in (1/4,1) \). The analysis relies on applying a Girsanov transformation to the non-degenerate components and evaluating the limiting conditional expectation associated with the noise term, for which the stochastic Fubini theorem plays a crucial role. To illustrate the applicability of the result, we study two mechanical systems perturbed by noise and provide supporting numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Monodromic singularities of Brunella-Miari vector fields with two edges in the Newton diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on the study of monodromic singularities in planar analytic families of vector fields whose Newton diagram consists of exactly two edges. We begin by analyzing the desingularization scheme of a minimal model of polynomial vector fields, denoted by ${X}$, which includes only the monomials corresponding to the vertices of the Newton diagram. We then extend this minimal model to the so-called Brunella-Miari vector fields ${X} \subset {X}^{[1]}$, incorporating all monomials associated with points lying on the edges of the Newton diagram. As a second extension, we consider vector fields ${X}^{[1]} \subset {X}^{[2]}$ that include higher-order terms corresponding to points located above the polygonal line in the Newton diagram. The key point of our approach is to preserve the desingularization geometry at each extension step. We provide explicit desingularization procedures, which enable the computation of the linear part of the return map $\Pi$ in cases where the desingularized singularity is associated with a hyperbolic polycycle. Several nontrivial examples are included to illustrate the method.</description>

      <title>The Limit Sets of Linear and Nonlinear Infinite IFSs Related to Complex Continued Fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two families of infinite iterated function systems (IFSs) $\mathcal{F}(\mathbf{d}, T)$ and $\mathcal{G}(\mathbf{d}, T)$, parametrized by a sequence of positive real numbers $\mathbf{d}$ and a natural number $T$, and investigate the measure-theoretic properties of their limit sets. $\mathcal{G}(\mathbf{d}, T)$ is an infinite M\"{o}bius IFS, which is an extension of the IFS of real continued fractions to the IFS on the closed unit disc in the complex plane. $\mathcal{F}(\mathbf{d}, T)$ is an infinite linear IFS that shares the same first approximation as $\mathcal{G}(\mathbf{d}, T)$. We show that for many choices of $\mathbf{d}$ and $T$, the limit sets of both $\mathcal{F}(\mathbf{d}, T)$ and $\mathcal{G}(\mathbf{d}, T)$ exhibit phenomena unique to infinite IFSs, such as having zero Hausdorff measure at the Hausdorff dimension, having infinite packing measure at the packing dimension, or having different Hausdorff and packing dimensions. We also prove that the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set of $\mathcal{F}(\mathbf{d}, T)$ is strictly larger than that of $\mathcal{G}(\mathbf{d}, T)$ under certain conditions on the parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Host-Kra factors and the spectral type of nilsystems, without assuming ergodicity. In the ergodic case, it is known that the spectral type splits into a discrete component and a Lebesgue component of infinite multiplicity. We extend this decomposition to nonergodic nilsystems. As a consequence, we obtain a spectral decomposition for ergodic $\mathbb{Z}^2$-nilsystems.</description>

      <title>Global self-similar solutions for Hardy-H\'enon equations with linear and quasilinear diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global self-similar solutions to the parabolic Hardy-H\'enon equation $$ u_t=\Delta u^m+|x|^{\sigma}u^p, \quad (x,t)\in\mathbb{R}^N\times(0,\infty), $$ are classified in the range of exponents $m\geq1$, $p&gt;m$ and $\sigma&gt;\max\{-2,-N\}$. The classification varies strongly with respect to the celebrated \emph{Fujita} and \emph{Sobolev critical exponents} $$ p_F(\sigma)=m+\frac{\sigma+2}{N}, \quad p_S(\sigma)=
  \begin{cases}
  \frac{m(N+2\sigma+2)}{N-2}, &amp; \mbox{if } N\geq3, \\[1mm]
  \infty, &amp; \mbox{if } N\in\{1,2\}.
  \end{cases} $$ Indeed, if $p\in(p_F(\sigma),p_S(\sigma))$, both equations admit self-similar solutions with either compact support (if $m&gt;1$) or Gaussian-like tail as $|x|\to\infty$ (if $m=1$), as well as a one-parameter family satisfying $$ u(x,t)\sim C|x|^{-(\sigma+2)/(p-m)}, \quad {\rm as} \ |x|\to\infty. $$ If $p\geq p_S(\sigma)$, there are only self-similar solutions with the latter algebraic tail, while for $m&lt;p\leq p_F(\sigma)$ no global solutions exist. The results open the way for a deeper study of the role of these solutions in the dynamics of the Hardy-H\'enon equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a nonrelativistic system made of two quantum particles constrained to move on a line and a spin located at a fixed point of the line. Initially the two particles are in a maximally entangled state and the spin is down. The first particle interacts with the spin while the second particle is free, i.e., it does not interact neither with the first particle nor with the spin. We rigorously prove that there is a correlation between the state of the spin and the state of the second particle. More precisely, we show that, in a suitable scaling limit, if the first particle flips the spin, then the second particle possesses a definite momentum in the direction opposite to the spin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11302v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: \emph{Koopman Regularization} is a constrained optimization-based method to learn the governing equations from sparse and corrupted samples of the vector field. \emph{Koopman Regularization} extracts a functionally independent set of Koopman Eigenfunctions from the samples. This set implements the principle of parsimony, since, even though its cardinality is finite, it restores the dynamics precisely.
  \emph{Koopman Regularization} formulates the Koopman Partial Differential Equation as the objective function and the condition of functional independence as the feasible region. Then, this work suggests a barrier method-based algorithm to solve this constrained optimization problem that yields promising results in denoising, generalization, and dimensionality reduction.</description>

      <title>Center Manifolds and Normal Forms for Nonlinearly Periodically Forced DDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to provide an effective framework for analysing bifurcations of equilibria in nonlinearly periodically forced delay differential equations. First, we establish the existence of a periodic smooth finite-dimensional center manifold near a nonhyperbolic equilibrium using the rigorous functional analytic framework of dual semigroups (sun-star calculus). Second, we construct a center manifold parametrization that allows us to describe the local dynamics on the center manifold near the equilibrium in terms of periodically forced normal forms. Third, we present a normalization method to derive explicit computational formulas for the critical normal form coefficients at a bifurcation of interest. In particular, we obtain such formulas for the periodically forced fold and nonresonant Hopf bifurcation. Several examples and indications from the literature confirm the validity and effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Parabolic noncommutative geometry</title>

Abstract: We introduce to spectral noncommutative geometry the notion of tangled spectral triple, which encompasses the anisotropies arising in parabolic geometry as well as the parabolic commutator bounds arising in so-called "bad Kasparov products". Tangled spectral triples incorporate anisotropy by replacing the unbounded operator in a spectral triple that mimics a Dirac operator with several unbounded operators mimicking directional Dirac operators. We allow for varying and dependent orders in different directions, controlled by using the tools of tropical combinatorics. We study the conformal equivariance of tangled spectral triples as well as how they fit into $K$-homology by means of producing higher order spectral triples. Our main examples are hypoelliptic spectral triples constructed from Rockland complexes on parabolic geometries; we also build spectral triples on nilpotent group $C^*$-algebras from the dual Dirac element and crossed product spectral triples for parabolic dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Regularity and Stability Properties of Selective SSMs with Discontinuous Gating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep selective State-Space Models (SSMs), whose state-space parameters are modulated online by a selection signal, offer significant expressive power but pose challenges for stability analysis, especially under discontinuous gating. We study continuous-time selective SSMs through the lenses of passivity and Input-to-State Stability (ISS), explicitly distinguishing the selection schedule $x(\cdot)$ from the driving (port) input $u(\cdot)$. First, we show that state-strict dissipativity ($\beta&gt;0$) together with quadratic bounds on a storage functional implies exponential decay of homogeneous trajectories ($u\equiv 0$), yielding exponential forgetting. Second, by freezing the selection ($x(t)\equiv 0$) we obtain a passive LTV input-output subsystem and prove that its minimal available storage is necessarily quadratic, $V_{a,0}(t,h)=\tfrac{1}{2}h^H Q_0(t)h,$ with $Q_0 \in \mathrm{AUC}_{\mathrm{loc}}$, accommodating discontinuities induced by gating. Third, under the strong hypothesis that a single quadratic storage certifies passivity uniformly over all admissible selection schedules, we derive a parametric LMI and universal kernel constraints on gating, formalizing an "irreversible forgetting" structure. Finally, we give sufficient conditions for global ISS with respect to the port input $u(\cdot)$, uniformly over admissible selection schedules, and we validate the main predictions in targeted simulation studies.</description>
