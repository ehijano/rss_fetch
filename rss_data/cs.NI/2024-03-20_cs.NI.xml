      <title>A Thorough Analysis of Radio Resource Assignment for UAV-Enhanced Vehicular Sidelink Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and the shift towards millimiter-wave (mmWave) frequencies offer unprecedented opportunities to enhance road safety and traffic efficiency. Sidelink communication, enabling direct Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications, play a pivotal role in this transformation. As communication technologies transit to higher frequencies, the associated increase in bandwidth comes at the cost of a severe path and penetration loss. In response to these challenges, we investigate a network configuration that deploys beamforming-capable Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as relay nodes. In this work, we present a comprehensive analytical framework with a groundbreaking performance metric, i.e. average access probability, that quantifies user satisfaction, considering factors across different protocol stack layers. Additionally, we introduce two Radio Resources Assignment (RRA) methods tailored for UAVs. These methods consider parameters such as resource availability, vehicle distribution, and latency requirements. Through our analytical approach, we optimize the average access probability by controlling UAV altitude based on traffic density. Our numerical findings validate the proposed model and strategy, which ensures that Quality of Service (QoS) standards are met in the domain of Vehicle-to-Anything (V2X) sidelink communications.</description>

      <title>Blockchain-Empowered Immutable and Reliable Delivery Service (BIRDS) Using UAV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploiting unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for delivery services is expected to reduce delivery time and human resource costs. However, the proximity of these UAVs to the ground can make them an ideal target for opportunistic criminals. Consequently, UAVs may be hacked, diverted from their destinations, or used for malicious purposes. Furthermore, as a decentralized (peer-to-peer) technology, the blockchain has immense potential to enable secure, decentralized, and cooperative communication among UAVs. With this goal in mind, we propose the Blockchain-Empowered, Immutable, and Reliable Delivery Service (BIRDS) framework to address data security challenges. BIRDS deploys communication hubs across a scalable network. Following the registration phase of BIRDS, UAV node selection is carried out based on a specific consensus proof-of-competence (PoC), where UAVs are evaluated solely on their credibility. The chosen finalist is awarded a certificate for the BIRDS global order fulfillment system. The simulation results demonstrate that BIRDS requires fewer UAVs compared to conventional solutions, resulting in reduced costs and emissions. The proposed BIRDS framework caters to the requirements of numerous users while necessitating less network traffic and consuming low energy.</description>

      <title>Towards a Wireless Physical-Layer Foundation Model: Challenges and Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) plays an important role in the dynamic landscape of wireless communications, solving challenges unattainable by traditional approaches. This paper discusses the evolution of wireless AI, emphasizing the transition from isolated task-specific models to more generalizable and adaptable AI models inspired by recent successes in large language models (LLMs) and computer vision. To overcome task-specific AI strategies in wireless networks, we propose a unified wireless physical-layer foundation model (WPFM). Challenges include the design of effective pre-training tasks, support for embedding heterogeneous time series and human-understandable interaction. The paper presents a strategic framework, focusing on embedding wireless time series, self-supervised pre-training, and semantic representation learning. The proposed WPFM aims to understand and describe diverse wireless signals, allowing human interactivity with wireless networks. The paper concludes by outlining next research steps for WPFMs, including the integration with LLMs.</description>

      <title>Edge-Disjoint Spanning Trees on Star-Product Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star-product graphs are a natural extension of the Cartesian product, but have not been well-studied. We show that many important established and emerging network topologies, including HyperX, SlimFly, BundleFly, PolarStar, mesh, and torus, are in fact star-product graphs. While this connection was known for BundleFly and PolarStar, it was not for the others listed.
  We extend a method of constructing maximal and near-maximal sets of edge-disjoint spanning trees on Cartesian products to the star product, thus obtain maximal or near-maximal sets of edge-disjoint spanning trees on new networks of importance, where such sets can improve bandwidth of collective operations and therefore accelerate many important workloads in high-performance computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the impact of using Renewable Energy Source (RES) generators in next-generation (5G) cellular systems on total power consumption (PC) has been investigated. The paper highlights the gain related to the use of photovoltaic (PV) panels and wind turbines (WTs) in the form of two factors - the average extension of battery lifetime (AEBL) powering a single network cell and the average reduction in energy consumption (AREC) within the whole network. The examination has been conducted for four different seasons of the year and various configurations of available power sources. The provided system scenario was based on real data on weather conditions, building placement, and implemented mobile networks for the city of Poznan in Poland. Used RES generators were designed in accordance with the specifications of real devices.</description>

      <title>BostonTwin: the Boston Digital Twin for Ray-Tracing in 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital twins are now a staple of wireless networks design and evolution. Creating an accurate digital copy of a real system offers numerous opportunities to study and analyze its performance and issues. It also allows designing and testing new solutions in a risk-free environment, and applying them back to the real system after validation. A candidate technology that will heavily rely on digital twins for design and deployment is 6G, which promises robust and ubiquitous networks for eXtended Reality (XR) and immersive communications solutions. In this paper, we present BostonTwin, a dataset that merges a high-fidelity 3D model of the city of Boston, MA, with the existing geospatial data on cellular base stations deployments, in a ray-tracing-ready format. Thus, BostonTwin enables not only the instantaneous rendering and programmatic access to the building models, but it also allows for an accurate representation of the electromagnetic propagation environment in the real-world city of Boston. The level of detail and accuracy of this characterization is crucial to designing 6G networks that can support the strict requirements of sensitive and high-bandwidth applications, such as XR and immersive communication.</description>

Abstract: The paper considers energy consumption in 5G cellular networks powered by Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) and equipped with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) and tethered Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), acting as mobile access points. The study was focused on the energy side of the Radio Access Network (RAN) located in the city of Pozna\'n in Poland. The profit associated with the use of renewable energy generators, i.e. photovoltaic panels (PVP) for base stations (BSs) is presented in the form of two factors: the average number of UAV charges (ANUC) to provide continuous access to mobile services for connected user equipment (UE) terminals, and the average reduction in energy consumption (AREC) of the wireless system.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Digital Twin for Efficient 6G Network Orchestration via Adaptive Attribute Selection and Scalable Network Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving a holistic and long-term understanding through accurate network modeling is essential for orchestrating future networks with increasing service diversity and infrastructure complexities. However, due to unselective data collection and uniform processing, traditional modeling approaches undermine the efficacy and timeliness of network orchestration. Additionally, temporal disparities arising from various modeling delays further impair the centralized decision-making with distributed models. In this paper, we propose a new hierarchical digital twin paradigm adapting to real-time network situations for problem-centered model construction. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive attribute selection mechanism that evaluates the distinct modeling values of diverse network attributes, considering their relevance to current network scenarios and inherent modeling complexity. By prioritizing critical attributes at higher layers, an efficient evaluation of network situations is achieved to identify target areas. Subsequently, scalable network modeling facilitates the inclusion of all identified elements at the lower layers, where more fine-grained digital twins are developed to generate targeted solutions for user association and power allocation. Furthermore, virtual-physical domain synchronization is implemented to maintain accurate temporal alignment between the digital twins and their physical counterparts, spanning from the construction to the utilization of the proposed paradigm. Extensive simulations validate the proposed approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in efficiently identifying pressing issues and delivering network orchestration solutions in complex 6G HetNets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work discusses the benefits of having multiple simulated environments with different degrees of realism for the development of algorithms in scenarios populated by autonomous nodes capable of communication and mobility. This approach aids the development experience and generates robust algorithms. It also proposes GrADyS-SIM NextGen as a solution that enables development on a single programming language and toolset over multiple environments with varying levels of realism. Finally, we illustrate the usefulness of this approach with a toy problem that makes use of the simulation framework, taking advantage of the proposed environments to iteratively develop a robust solution.</description>

      <title>A Novel Energy-Efficient Cross-Layer Design for Scheduling and Routing in 6TiSCH Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 6TiSCH protocol stack was proposed to ensure high-performance communications in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). However, the lack of sufficient time slots for nodes outside the 6TiSCH's Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) to transmit their Destination Advertisement Object (DAO) messages and cell reservation requests significantly hinders their integration into the DODAG. This oversight not only prolongs the device's join time but also increases energy consumption during the network formation phase. Moreover, challenges emerge due to the substantial number of control packets employed by both the 6TiSCH Scheduling Function (SF) and routing protocol (RPL), thus draining more energy resources, increasing medium contention, and decreasing spatial reuse. Furthermore, an SF that overlooks previously allocated slots when assigning new ones to the same node may increase jitter, and more complications ensue when it neglects the state of the TSCH queue, thus leading to packet dropping due to queue saturation. Additional complexity arises when the RPL disregards the new parent's schedule saturation during parent switching, which results in inefficient energy and time usage. To address these issues, we introduce in this paper novel mechanisms, strategically situated at the intersection of SF and RPL that are designed to balance the control packet distribution and adaptively manage parent switching. Our proposal, implemented within the 6TiSCH simulator, demonstrates significant improvements across vital performance metrics, such as node's joining time, jitter, latency, energy consumption, and amount of traffic, in comparison to the conventional 6TiSCH benchmark.</description>

      <title>A GNN Approach for Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beyond 5G wireless technology Cell-Free Massive MIMO (CFmMIMO) downlink relies on carefully designed precoders and power control to attain uniformly high rate coverage. Many such power control problems can be calculated via second order cone programming (SOCP). In practice, several order of magnitude faster numerical procedure is required because power control has to be rapidly updated to adapt to changing channel conditions. We propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based solution to replace SOCP. Specifically, we develop a GNN to obtain downlink max-min power control for a CFmMIMO with maximum ratio transmission (MRT) beamforming. We construct a graph representation of the problem that properly captures the dominant dependence relationship between access points (APs) and user equipments (UEs). We exploit a symmetry property, called permutation equivariance, to attain training simplicity and efficiency. Simulation results show the superiority of our approach in terms of computational complexity, scalability and generalizability for different system sizes and deployment scenarios.</description>

      <title>E-DoH: Elegantly Detecting the Depths of Open DoH Service on the Internet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, DNS over Encrypted (DoE) methods have been regarded as a novel trend within the realm of the DNS ecosystem. In these DoE methods, DNS over HTTPS (DoH) provides encryption to protect data confidentiality while providing better obfuscation to avoid censorship by multiplexing port 443 with web services. This development introduced certain inconveniences in discovering publicly available DoH services. In this paper, we propose the E-DoH method for elegant and efficient DoH service detection. First, we optimized the probing mechanism to enable a single DoH connection to accomplish multiple tasks including service discovery, correctness validation and dependency construction. Second, we propose an efficient DoH detection tool. This tool can enhance probing efficiency while significantly reduce the required traffic volume. Third, based on the above optimization methods, we conducted an exploration of the IPv4 space and performed an in-depth analysis of DoH based on the collected information. Through experiments, our approach demonstrates a remarkable 80% improvement in time efficiency, and only requires 4%-20% traffic volume to complete the detection task. In wild detection, our approach discovered 46k DoH services, which nearly doubles the number discovered by the state-of-the-art. Based on the collected data, we present several intriguing conclusions about the current DoH service ecosystem.</description>

      <title>QUIC Hunter: Finding QUIC Deployments and Identifying Server Libraries Across the Internet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diversity of QUIC implementations poses challenges for Internet measurements and the analysis of the QUIC ecosystem. While all implementations follow the same specification and there is general interoperability, differences in performance, functionality, but also security (e.g., due to bugs) can be expected. Therefore, knowledge about the implementation of an endpoint on the Internet can help researchers, operators, and users to better analyze connections, performance, and security. In this work, we improved the detection rate of QUIC scans to find more deployments and provide an approach to effectively identify QUIC server libraries based on CONNECTION CLOSE frames and transport parameter orders. We performed Internet-wide scans and identified at least one deployment for 18 QUIC libraries. In total, we can identify the libraries with 8.0 M IPv4 and 2.5 M IPv6 addresses. We provide a comprehensive view of the landscape of competing QUIC libraries.</description>

      <title>NetBench: A Large-Scale and Comprehensive Network Traffic Benchmark Dataset for Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In computer networking, network traffic refers to the amount of data transmitted in the form of packets between internetworked computers or Cyber-Physical Systems. Monitoring and analyzing network traffic is crucial for ensuring the performance, security, and reliability of a network. However, a significant challenge in network traffic analysis is to process diverse data packets including both ciphertext and plaintext. While many methods have been adopted to analyze network traffic, they often rely on different datasets for performance evaluation. This inconsistency results in substantial manual data processing efforts and unfair comparisons. Moreover, some data processing methods may cause data leakage due to improper separation of training and testing data. To address these issues, we introduce the NetBench, a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark dataset for assessing machine learning models, especially foundation models, in both network traffic classification and generation tasks. NetBench is built upon seven publicly available datasets and encompasses a broad spectrum of 20 tasks, including 15 classification tasks and 5 generation tasks. Furthermore, we evaluate eight State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) classification models (including two foundation models) and two generative models using our benchmark. The results show that foundation models significantly outperform the traditional deep learning methods in traffic classification. We believe NetBench will facilitate fair comparisons among various approaches and advance the development of foundation models for network traffic. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/WM-JayLab/NetBench.</description>
