      <title>Distortion of Multi-Winner Elections on the Line Metric: The Polar Comparison Rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of selecting a committee of $k$ alternatives among $m$ alternatives, based on the ordinal rank list of voters. Our focus is on the case where both voters and alternatives lie on a metric space-specifically, on the line-and the objective is to minimize the additive social cost. The additive social cost is the sum of the costs for all voters, where the cost for each voter is defined as the sum of their distances to each member of the selected committee.
  We propose a new voting rule, the Polar Comparison Rule, which achieves upper bounds of $1 + \sqrt{2} \approx 2.41$ and $7/3 \approx 2.33$ distortions for $k = 2$ and $k = 3$, respectively, and we show that these bounds are tight. Furthermore, we generalize this rule, showing that it maintains a distortion of roughly $7/3$ based on the remainder of the committee size when divided by three. We also establish lower bounds on the achievable distortion based on the parity of $k$ and for both small and large committee sizes.</description>

      <title>Market Making without Regret</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a sequential decision-making setting where, at every round $t$, a market maker posts a bid price $B_t$ and an ask price $A_t$ to an incoming trader (the taker) with a private valuation for one unit of some asset. If the trader's valuation is lower than the bid price, or higher than the ask price, then a trade (sell or buy) occurs. If a trade happens at round $t$, then letting $M_t$ be the market price (observed only at the end of round $t$), the maker's utility is $M_t - B_t$ if the maker bought the asset, and $A_t - M_t$ if they sold it. We characterize the maker's regret with respect to the best fixed choice of bid and ask pairs under a variety of assumptions (adversarial, i.i.d., and their variants) on the sequence of market prices and valuations. Our upper bound analysis unveils an intriguing connection relating market making to first-price auctions and dynamic pricing. Our main technical contribution is a lower bound for the i.i.d. case with Lipschitz distributions and independence between prices and valuations. The difficulty in the analysis stems from the unique structure of the reward and feedback functions, allowing an algorithm to acquire information by graduating the "cost of exploration" in an arbitrary way.</description>

      <title>Approximating One-Sided and Two-Sided Nash Social Welfare With Capacities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of maximizing Nash social welfare, which is the geometric mean of agents' utilities, in two well-known models. The first model involves one-sided preferences, where a set of indivisible items is allocated among a group of agents (commonly studied in fair division). The second model deals with two-sided preferences, where a set of workers and firms, each having numerical valuations for the other side, are matched with each other (commonly studied in matching-under-preferences literature). We study these models under capacity constraints, which restrict the number of items (respectively, workers) that an agent (respectively, a firm) can receive.
  We develop constant-factor approximation algorithms for both problems under a broad class of valuations. Specifically, our main results are the following: (a) For any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, a $(6+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the one-sided problem when agents have submodular valuations, and (b) a $1.33$-approximation algorithm for the two-sided problem when the firms have subadditive valuations. The former result provides the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for Nash welfare in the one-sided problem with submodular valuations and capacities, while the latter result improves upon an existing $\sqrt{OPT}$-approximation algorithm for additive valuations. Our result for the two-sided setting also establishes a computational separation between the Nash and utilitarian welfare objectives. We also complement our algorithms with hardness-of-approximation results.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Aware Data Acquisition under Data Similarity in Regression Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data markets facilitate decentralized data exchange for applications such as prediction, learning, or inference. The design of these markets is challenged by varying privacy preferences as well as data similarity among data owners. Related works have often overlooked how data similarity impacts pricing and data value through statistical information leakage. We demonstrate that data similarity and privacy preferences are integral to market design and propose a query-response protocol using local differential privacy for a two-party data acquisition mechanism. In our regression data market model, we analyze strategic interactions between privacy-aware owners and the learner as a Stackelberg game over the asked price and privacy factor. Finally, we numerically evaluate how data similarity affects market participation and traded data value.</description>

      <title>Can CDT rationalise the ex ante optimal policy via modified anthropics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Newcomb's problem, causal decision theory (CDT) recommends two-boxing and thus comes apart from evidential decision theory (EDT) and ex ante policy optimisation (which prescribe one-boxing). However, in Newcomb's problem, you should perhaps believe that with some probability you are in a simulation run by the predictor to determine whether to put a million dollars into the opaque box. If so, then causal decision theory might recommend one-boxing in order to cause the predictor to fill the opaque box. In this paper, we study generalisations of this approach. That is, we consider general Newcomblike problems and try to form reasonable self-locating beliefs under which CDT's recommendations align with an EDT-like notion of ex ante policy optimisation. We consider approaches in which we model the world as running simulations of the agent, and an approach not based on such models (which we call 'Generalised Generalised Thirding', or GGT). For each approach, we characterise the resulting CDT policies, and prove that under certain conditions, these include the ex ante optimal policies.</description>
