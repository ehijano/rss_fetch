      <title>Application of Laplace filters to the analysis of lattice time correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of lattice simulation correlation function data is notoriously hindered by the ill-conditioning of the Euclidean time covariance matrix. Additionally, the isolation of a single physical state in such functions is generally affected by systematic contamination from unwanted states. In this paper, we present a new methodology based on regulated Laplace filters and demonstrate that it can be used to address both issues using state-of-the-art simulation data. Regulated Laplace filters are invertible high-pass filters that suppress local correlations in the data, and we show that they can reduce the condition number of covariance matrices by several orders of magnitude. Furthermore, Laplace filters can annihilate functions that decay exponentially with time, which can be used to alter the spectrum of a lattice correlation function. We show that this property can be exploited to significantly reduce excited-state contamination in the determination of matrix elements. The same property can also be used to constrain the spectral content of a correlation function and has the potential to form the basis of new methods to extract physical information from lattice data.</description>

      <title>Implementing the finite-volume three-pion scattering formalism across all non-maximal isospins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical exploration of the relativistic-field-theory (RFT) formalism for three pions with all possible values of non-maximal isospin, $I_{\pi\pi\pi} = 2$, $1$ and $0$. Using the generic-isospin extension of the RFT formalism and applying our open-source Python library to implement the framework, we predict a range of three-pion energies for illustrative values of the two-to-two scattering amplitudes for various finite-volume irreps also with non-zero total momentum $\boldsymbol P$ in the finite-volume frame. The results restrict attention to the case of a vanishing intrinsic three-body interaction so that the spectra can be understood as a baseline. In future lattice QCD calculations, deviations from these values will be translated into evidence for intrinsic three-body effects in the various scattering channels.</description>

      <title>Two-Loop Extraction of the Pion-Nucleon Sigma Term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pion-nucleon sigma term, characterizing the mass component of Higgs origin related to $u$ and $d$ quarks inside the nucleon, is investigated within relativistic baryon chiral perturbation theory at leading two-loop order using the extended-on-mass-shell renormalization scheme. The two-loop representation of the sigma term is derived from the nucleon mass via the Feynman-Hellmann theorem and verified through a direct calculation of the forward isoscalar-scalar nucleon matrix element. We apply the derived chiral expression to extract the physical pion-nucleon sigma term by extrapolating $N_f=2+1$ lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) data at unphysical quark masses. We find that, at the two-loop level, the long-standing tension between lattice QCD and dispersive determinations can be naturally resolved, owing to the incorporation of intermediate $\pi\pi$ rescattering effects that begin to contribute at two-loop order. Our final result for the nucleon sigma term based on recent lattice QCD calculations is $\sigma_{\pi N}=55.9(2.5)$ MeV. It is compatible with the result of the Roy-Steiner equation analysis and thus provides a satisfactory resolution to the previous debate between lattice QCD and phenomenological determinations.</description>

      <title>On the origin of mixed inhomogeneous phase in vortical gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, lattice simulations of SU(3) Yang-Mills theory revealed that rotating hot gluon matter in thermal equilibrium possesses a novel inhomogeneous phase consisting of the deconfinement phase located in the center region, which is spatially separated from the confinement phase in the periphery. This inhomogeneous two-phase structure is also expected to be produced by vorticity in quark-gluon plasma formed in non-central relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We show that its vortical properties are determined by two types of couplings of the angular velocity to the gluon fields: a linear coupling to the mechanical angular momentum of gluons and a quadratic ``magnetovortical'' coupling to a chromomagnetic component. We demonstrate numerically that the distinctive inhomogeneous structure of the vortical (quark-)gluon plasma is determined by the latter, while the former plays only a subleading role. We argue that the anisotropy of the gluonic action in the curved co-rotating background can quantitatively explain the remarkable property that the spatial structure of this inhomogeneous phase disobeys the picture based on a straightforward implementation of the Tolman-Ehrenfest law. We also support our findings with Monte Carlo simulations of Yang-Mills plasma at the real-valued angular frequency, which take into account only the magnetic part of the action.</description>

      <title>Extended framework for the hybrid Monte Carlo in lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an extended framework for the hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm in lattice gauge theory by embedding the $SU(N)$ group into the space of general complex matrices,$M_N(\mathbb{C})$. Auxiliary directions will be completely factorized in the path integral, and the embedding does not alter the expectation values of the original theory. We perform the molecular dynamics updates by using the matrix elements of $W \in M_N(\mathbb{C})$ as the dynamical variables without group theoretic constraints. The framework enables us to introduce non-separable Hamiltonians for the HMC in lattice gauge theory exactly, whose immediate application includes the Riemannian manifold HMC.</description>

      <title>Lattice Chern-Simons-Maxwell Theory and its Chirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11034v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and solve the $\text{U(1)}$ Chern-Simons-Maxwell theory on spacetime lattice, with an emphasis on the chirality of the theory. Realizing Chern-Simons theory on lattice has been a problem of interest for decades, and over the years it has gradually become clear that there are two key points: 1) Some non-topological term, such as a Maxwell term, is necessary -- this is true even in the continuum, but more manifestly on the lattice; 2) the $\text{U(1)}$ gauge field should be implemented in the Villainized form to retain its topological properties. Putting the two ideas together seriously, we show all interesting properties of a chiral Chern-Simons theory are reproduced in an explicitly regularized manner on the lattice. These include the bosonic and fermionic level quantization, the bulk and chiral edge spectrum, the Wilson loop flux attachment (with point-split framing or geometric framing depending on the Maxwell coupling), the Wilson loop spin, the ground state degeneracy, and, most non-trivially, the chiral gravitational anomaly.</description>

      <title>Improved entanglement entropy estimates from filtered bitstring probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07092v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the bitstring probabilities of ground states of bipartitioned ladders of Rydberg atoms, we calculate the mutual information, which is a lower bound on the corresponding bipartite von Neumann quantum entanglement entropy $S^{vN}_A$. We show that in many cases these lower bounds can be improved by removing the bitstrings with a probability lower than some value $p_{min}$ and renormalizing the remaining probabilities (filtering). We propose a heuristic based on the change of the conditional entropy under filtering that very effectively improves the estimate of $S^{vN}_A$. We consider various sizes, lattice spacings and bipartitions. Our numerical investigation suggest that the filtered mutual information obtained with samples having just a few thousand bitstrings can provide reasonably close estimates of $S^{vN}_A$. We briefly discuss practical implementations with QuEra's Aquila device.</description>

      <title>Exploring near critical lattice gauge simulators with Rydberg atoms facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We motivate the use of a ladder of Rydberg atoms as an analog simulator for a lattice gauge theory version of scalar electrodynamics also called the compact Abelian Higgs model. We demonstrate that by using a few thousand shots from a single copy of the ladder simulator it is possible to estimate the bipartite quantum von Neumann entanglement entropy $S^{vN}_A$. The estimation relies on an optimized filtration of the mutual information associated with the bitstrings obtained from public facilities of configurable Rydberg arrays named Aquila. We discuss the limitations associated with finite sampling, sorting fidelity, adiabatic preparation, ramp-down of the Rabi frequency before measurement, and readout errors. We use cumulative probability distribution to compare Aquila results with high accuracy density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) or exact results. The state preparation appears to be the main source of error. We discuss the large volume behavior of the cumulative probability distribution and show examples where for a finite number of shots, there appears to be some large enough size for which, with high probability, any given state is seen at most once. We show that the results presented can be extended to multipartite entanglement. We briefly discuss the cost of the calculations for large square arrays in the context of obtaining quantum advantage in the near future.</description>
