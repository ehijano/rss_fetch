      <title>Nonlocal decoding of positional and correlational information during development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many developmental systems, cells differentiate into a tissue by reading out morphogen concentration fields, a process fundamentally limited by noise. How much can the precision of this process be improved by nonlocal information, e.g., via cell-cell communication? Using a Bayes-optimal framework, we show that positional inference depends crucially on morphogen spatial correlations and on the ``structural prior'' that encodes the geometry of the cellular lattice performing the readout. We derive upper bounds on positional information gain due to nonlocal readout and identify signal processing algorithms that approximate optimal positional inference, as well as simple chemical reaction schemes which implement such algorithms. Our theory suggests that correlational information can be exploited to significantly enhance developmental precision.</description>

      <title>Fabrication, drug delivery kinetics and cell viability assay of PLGA-coated vancomycin-loaded silicate porous microspheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Porous ceramic microspheres are a desirable substance for bone tissue reconstruction and delivery applications. This study focuses on Mg-Ca silicate microspheres encapsulated in biodegradable poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) to serve as a biocompatible carrier for the controlled release of vancomycin hydrochloride. In this regard, diopside (MgCaSi2O6), bredigite (MgCa7Si4O16) and akermanite (MgCa2Si2O7) powders were synthesized by sol-gel and subsequent calcination methods. Then, porous akermanite, diopside and bredigite microspheres of 700-1000 um in diameter were fabricated by using carbon porogen, droplet extrusion and sintering, then loaded with the drug and eventually coated with PLGA. The bare microspheres showed a considerable burst release mode of the drug into a physiological medium, whereas PLGA coating of the microspheres reduced the burst release level. To investigate effective mechanisms governing in the drug release from the carriers, the contribution of burst, degradation, and diffusion was analyzed by the sequential quadratic programming algorithm method. It was found that the relative contribution of diffusion to bioresorption is ranked as diopside &gt; akermanite &gt; bredigite, whereas PLGA coating dominates the diffusion mechanism. The dental pulp stem cells cytocompatibility MTT assay of the microspheres also showed that the drug loading deteriorates but PLGA coating improves the cell biocompatibility significantly. Comparatively, the biocompatibility of the PLGA-coated microspheres was ranked as akermanite &gt; diopside &gt; bredigite, as a result of a compromise between the release of the constituting ions of the ceramic carriers and vancomycin molecules. It was eventually concluded that PLGA-coated Mg-Ca silicate microspheres are promising candidates for drug-delivery bone tissue engineering and dental bone grafting applications.</description>

      <title>Microscopic and spectroscopic evidences for multiple ion-exchange reactions controlling biomineralization of CaO.MgO.2SiO2 nanoceramics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study is focused on the mechanism of in vitro biomineralization on the surface of CaO.MgO.2SiO2 (diopside) nanostructured coatings by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy assessments. A homogeneous diopside coating of almost 2 um in thickness was deposited on a medical-grade stainless steel by coprecipitation, dipping and sintering sequences. After soaking the sample in a simulated body fluid (SBF) for 14 days, a layer with the thickness of 8 {\mu}m is recognized to be substituted for the primary diopside deposit, suggesting the mineralization of apatite on the surface. Investigations revealed that the newly-formed layer is predominantly composed of Ca, P and Si, albeit with a biased accumulations of P and Si towards the surface and substrate, respectively. The variations in the ionic composition and pH of the SBF due to the incubation of the sample were also correlated with the above-interpreted biomineralization. In conclusion, the multiple ion-exchange reactions related to Ca, Mg, Si and P were found to be responsible for the in vitro bioactivity of nanodiopside.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Chaos and Defect Proliferation in Polar-Apolar Active Mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chaotic transitions in inertial fluids typically proceed through a direct energy cascade from large to small scales. In contrast, active systems, composed of self propelled units, inject energy at microscopic scales and therefore exhibit an inverse cascade, giving rise to distinctly unconventional flow patterns. Here, we investigate an active mixture consisting of both apolar and polar self driven components, a setting expected to display richer behaviours than those found in living liquid crystal (LLC) systems, where the apolar constituent is passive. Using numerical solutions of the corresponding hydrodynamic equations, we uncover a variety of complex dynamical states. Our results reveal a non-monotonic response of the apolar species to changes in the density and activity of the polar component. In an intermediate regime, reminiscent of LLC-induced disorder, the system develops a dynamically disordered phase characterised by high-density, chaotically evolving band-like structures and by the continual creation and annihilation of half integer topological defects. We show that this regime exhibits spatiotemporal chaos, which we quantify through two complementary measures: the spectral properties of density fluctuations and the maximal Lyapunov exponent. Together, these findings broaden the understanding of complex transitions in active matter and suggest potential experimental realisations in bacterial suspensions or synthetic microswimmer assemblies.</description>

      <title>Consistent time reversal and reliable and accurate inference in the presence of memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11819v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamic inference from coarse observations remains a key challenge. Memory, in particular correlations between consecutively observed mesostates, blur signatures of irreversibility and must be accounted for in defining physical time-reversal, which remains an open problem. We derive an experimentally accessible k-th order estimator for the entropy production rate. Using novel measure-theoretic techniques we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for guaranteed lower bounds on the dissipation even in the strongly non-Markovian setting. The proof reveals that estimators saturated in the order unravel the duration of memory which needs to be considered in defining physically consistent time-reversal. We show that Markovian estimators in absence of a time-scale separation lead to artifacts, which convey no physical meaning. Similarly, estimators not saturated in the order may overestimate the dissipation. The necessity of correctly accounting for memory in thermodynamic inference from strongly non-Markovian observations underscores the still underappreciated challenges and intricacies in defining and understanding irreversibility in presence of memory. Our results will hopefully stimulate experiments systematically considering thermodynamic inference on multiple scales consistently accounting for memory.</description>
