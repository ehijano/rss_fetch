      <title>Analyzing Dynamical Systems Inspired by Montgomery's Conjecture: Insights into Zeta Function Zeros and Chaos in Number Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we delve into a novel dynamic system inspired by Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture in number theory. The dynamic system is intricately designed to emulate the behavior of the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Our exploration encompasses bifurcation analysis and Lyapunov exponents to scrutinize the system's behavior and stability, offering insights into both small and large initial conditions. Our efforts extend to unveiling the probability distribution characterizing the dynamics for varying initial conditions. The dynamic system unfolds intricate behaviors, displaying sensitivity to initial conditions and revealing complex bifurcation patterns. Small deviations in the initial conditions unveil significantly different trajectories, reminiscent of chaotic systems. Lyapunov exponents become our lens into understanding stability and chaos within the system. A comparative analysis between the dynamic system's approximate solutions and the actual nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function enhances our comprehension of model accuracy and its potential implications for number theory.
  This research illuminates the versatility of dynamic systems as analogs for studying complex mathematical phenomena. It provides fresh perspectives on the pair correlation conjecture, establishing connections with nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory. Notably, we delve into the boundedness of solutions for both small and large initial conditions, unraveling the distinctive probability distribution governing the dynamics in each scenario. Furthermore, we introduce an in-depth analysis of the entropy of our dynamic system for both small and large initial conditions. The entropy study enhances our understanding of the predictability and stability of the system, shedding light on its behavior in different parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Review of the analytical prediction method of surf-riding threshold in following sea, and its relation to IMO second-generation intact stability criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high-speed maritime operations, the broaching phenomenon can pose a significant risk when navigating in following/quartering seas. The occurrence of this phenomenon can result in a violent yaw motion, regardless of the steering effort, which, in turn, cause the resulting centrifugal force to capsize a vessel. A necessary condition for the occurrence of broaching is the surf-riding phenomenon. Therefore, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set up criteria to include theoretical formulas for estimating the occurrence of surf-riding phenomena. The theoretical equation used in the IMO's second-generation intact stability criteria (SGISC) to estimate the surf-riding threshold is based on Melnikov's method. This paper presents nonlinear equations describing the forward and backward motions of a ship. However, such equations cannot be directly solved; therefore, we proposed the use of and explain various approximate solution methods, including Meknikov's method. Subsequently, the relationship between the theoretical prediction method of the surf-riding threshold rooted in Melnikov's method and the IMO's SGISC is determined.</description>

      <title>Moving frame and spin field representations of submanifolds in flat space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a spin field approach, that is compatible with the Cartan moving frame method, to describe the submanifold in a flat space. In fact, we consider a kind of spin field $\psi$, that satisfies a Killing spin field equation (analogous to a Killing spinor equation) written in terms of the Clifford algebra, and we use the spin field to locally rotate the orthonormal basis $\{\hat{e}_\mathtt{I}\}$. Then, the deformed orthonormal frame $\{\tilde{\psi}\hat{e}_\mathtt{I}\psi\}$ can be seen as the moving frame of a submanifold. We find some solutions to the Killing spin field equation and demonstrate an explicit example. Using the product of the spin fields, one can easily generate a new immersion submanifold, and this technique should be useful for studies in geometry and physics. Through the spin field, we find a linear relation between the connection and the extrinsic curvature of the submanifold. We propose a conjecture that any solution of the Killing spin field equation can be locally written as the product of the solutions we find.</description>

      <title>Derivation of Chaotic Dynamics from Montgomery Conjecture and Its Interpretation as an Electrical System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an innovative derivation of chaotic dynamics rooted in the Montgomery conjecture, specifically addressing the pair correlation of Riemann zeta function zeros. Our exploration unveils a recursive relation inspired by the conjecture, manifesting chaotic behavior. Remarkably, we interpret this derived chaotic dynamics as a unique representation of an electrical system, providing a novel perspective within the domain of electrical engineering. Beyond this groundbreaking derivation, our study delves into the potential applications of chaos theory, bifurcation analysis, and entropy within the framework of this electrical system. We scrutinize the implications of chaos for signal processing, conduct stability analysis through bifurcation studies, and investigate the role of entropy in quantifying the randomness or predictability of electrical signals. Additionally, we explore energy distribution aspects within the electrical system, shedding light on how chaotic dynamics influence energy dissipation and allocation. In the course of our research, a new finding emerged, contributing to our understanding of the derived chaotic dynamics. This discovery enhances the applicability of our framework within electrical engineering, paving the way for innovative applications and deeper explorations in the realm of system dynamics. Moreover, we draw comparisons with the dynamics presented in our recent paper published in the European Physical Journal, specifically addressing Yitang Zhang's contributions. This comparative analysis further underscores the unique characteristics and potential applications of the derived chaotic dynamics. This study not only elucidates the intricate connection between chaotic dynamics and number theory but also offers a transformative perspective that extends the boundaries of conventional electrical system analysis</description>

      <title>A fuzzy framework for unraveling experiential tourism value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is currently a growing interest in the study of sustainable tourism experiences. Although the main dimensions of tourism experiences are known, the assessment of attractions as a key component in sustainable tourism design has seen little research. This gap stems from two primary challenges: firstly, the complexity of each tourism destination, which makes use of heterogeneous scales of evaluation; and secondly, the subjective nature of tourism experiences that requires qualitative measurement scales and assessment. To overcome these shortcomings, a new methodology based on fuzzy numbers is proposed, consisting of a scale normalization stage, followed by an aggregation of the fuzzy numbers that can be integrated into a Geographical Information System. This technique is tested on the quantification of the tourism value of attractions for sustainable experience in Santiago de Cuba.</description>
