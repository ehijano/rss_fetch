      <title>Parameterized Algorithms for Optimal Refugee Resettlement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study variants of the Optimal Refugee Resettlement problem where a set $F$ of refugee families need to be allocated to a set $L$ of possible places of resettlement in a feasible and optimal way. Feasibility issues emerge from the assumption that each family requires certain services (such as accommodation, school seats, or medical assistance), while there is an upper and, possibly, a lower quota on the number of service units provided at a given place. Besides studying the problem of finding a feasible assignment, we also investigate two natural optimization variants. In the first one, we allow families to express preferences over $P$, and we aim for a Pareto-optimal assignment. In a more general setting, families can attribute utilities to each place in $P$, and the task is to find a feasible assignment with maximum total utilities. We study the computational complexity of all three variants in a multivariate fashion using the framework of parameterized complexity. We provide fixed-parameter tractable algorithms for a handful of natural parameterizations, and complement these tractable cases with tight intractability results.</description>

      <title>Uncoupled and Convergent Learning in Monotone Games under Bandit Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of no-regret learning algorithms for general monotone and smooth games and their last-iterate convergence properties. Specifically, we investigate the problem under bandit feedback and strongly uncoupled dynamics, which allows modular development of the multi-player system that applies to a wide range of real applications. We propose a mirror-descent-based algorithm, which converges in $O(T^{-1/4})$ and is also no-regret. The result is achieved by a dedicated use of two regularizations and the analysis of the fixed point thereof. The convergence rate is further improved to $O(T^{-1/2})$ in the case of strongly monotone games. Motivated by practical tasks where the game evolves over time, the algorithm is extended to time-varying monotone games. We provide the first non-asymptotic result in converging monotone games and give improved results for equilibrium tracking games.</description>

      <title>Weighted Envy-free Allocation with Subsidy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of fair allocation with subsidy when agents have weighted entitlements. After highlighting several important differences from the unweighted cases, we present several results concerning weighted envy-freeability including general characterizations, algorithms for achieving and testing weighted envy-freeability, lower and upper bounds for worst case subsidy for non-wasteful and envy-freeable allocations, and algorithms for achieving weighted envy-freeability along with other properties.</description>

      <title>Beyond Proportional Individual Guarantees for Binary Perpetual Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perpetual voting studies fair collective decision-making in settings where many decisions are to be made, and is a natural framework for settings such as parliaments and the running of blockchain Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). We focus our attention on the binary case (YES/NO decisions) and \textit{individual} guarantees for each of the participating agents. We introduce a novel notion, inspired by the popular maxi-min-share (MMS) for fair allocation. The agent expects to get as many decisions as if they were to optimally partition the decisions among the agents, with an adversary deciding which of the agents decides on what bundle. We show an online algorithm that guarantees the MMS notion for $n=3$ agents, an offline algorithm for $n=4$ agents, and show that no online algorithm can guarantee the $MMS^{adapt}$ for $n\geq 7$ agents. We also show that the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) outcome can only guarantee $O(\frac{1}{n})$ of the MMS notion in the worst case.</description>

      <title>The Limitations of Model Retraining in the Face of Performativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study stochastic optimization in the context of performative shifts, where the data distribution changes in response to the deployed model. We demonstrate that naive retraining can be provably suboptimal even for simple distribution shifts. The issue worsens when models are retrained given a finite number of samples at each retraining step. We show that adding regularization to retraining corrects both of these issues, attaining provably optimal models in the face of distribution shifts. Our work advocates rethinking how machine learning models are retrained in the presence of performative effects.</description>

      <title>Explore-then-Commit Algorithms for Decentralized Two-Sided Matching Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online learning in a decentralized two-sided matching markets, where the demand-side (players) compete to match with the supply-side (arms), has received substantial interest because it abstracts out the complex interactions in matching platforms (e.g. UpWork, TaskRabbit). However, past works assume that each arm knows their preference ranking over the players (one-sided learning), and each player aim to learn the preference over arms through successive interactions. Moreover, several (impractical) assumptions on the problem are usually made for theoretical tractability such as broadcast player-arm match Liu et al. (2020; 2021); Kong &amp; Li (2023) or serial dictatorship Sankararaman et al. (2021); Basu et al. (2021); Ghosh et al. (2022). In this paper, we study a decentralized two-sided matching market, where we do not assume that the preference ranking over players are known to the arms apriori. Furthermore, we do not have any structural assumptions on the problem. We propose a multi-phase explore-then-commit type algorithm namely epoch-based CA-ETC (collision avoidance explore then commit) (\texttt{CA-ETC} in short) for this problem that does not require any communication across agents (players and arms) and hence decentralized. We show that for the initial epoch length of $T_{\circ}$ and subsequent epoch-lengths of $2^{l/\gamma} T_{\circ}$ (for the $l-$th epoch with $\gamma \in (0,1)$ as an input parameter to the algorithm), \texttt{CA-ETC} yields a player optimal expected regret of $\mathcal{O}\left(T_{\circ} (\frac{K \log T}{T_{\circ} \Delta^2})^{1/\gamma} + T_{\circ} (\frac{T}{T_{\circ}})^\gamma\right)$ for the $i$-th player, where $T$ is the learning horizon, $K$ is the number of arms and $\Delta$ is an appropriately defined problem gap. Furthermore, we propose a blackboard communication based baseline achieving logarithmic regret in $T$.</description>

      <title>Battlefield transfers in coalitional Blotto games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In competitive resource allocation environments, agents often choose to form alliances; however, for some agents, doing so may not always be beneficial. Is there a method of forming alliances that always reward each of their members? We study this question using the framework of the coalitional Blotto game, in which two players compete against a common adversary by allocating their budgeted resources across disjoint sets of valued battlefields. On any given battlefield, the agent that allocates a greater amount of resources wins the corresponding battlefield value. Existing work has shown the surprising result that in certain game instances, if one player donates a portion of their budget to the other player, then both players win larger amounts in their separate competitions against the adversary. However, this transfer-based method of alliance formation is not always mutually beneficial, which motivates the search for alternate strategies. In this vein, we study a new method of alliance formation referred to as a joint transfer, whereby players publicly transfer battlefields and budgets between one another before they engage in their separate competitions against the adversary. We show that in almost all game instances, there exists a mutually beneficial joint transfer that strictly increases the payoff of each player.</description>

      <title>Strategic Liquidity Provision in Uniswap v3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.12033v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uniswap v3 is the largest decentralized exchange for digital currencies. A novelty of its design is that it allows a liquidity provider (LP) to allocate liquidity to one or more closed intervals of the price of an asset instead of the full range of possible prices. An LP earns fee rewards proportional to the amount of its liquidity allocation when prices move in this interval. This induces the problem of {\em strategic liquidity provision}: smaller intervals result in higher concentration of liquidity and correspondingly larger fees when the price remains in the interval, but with higher risk as prices may exit the interval leaving the LP with no fee rewards. Although reallocating liquidity to new intervals can mitigate this loss, it comes at a cost, as LPs must expend gas fees to do so. We formalize the dynamic liquidity provision problem and focus on a general class of strategies for which we provide a neural network-based optimization framework for maximizing LP earnings. We model a single LP that faces an exogenous sequence of price changes that arise from arbitrage and non-arbitrage trades in the decentralized exchange. We present experimental results informed by historical price data that demonstrate large improvements in LP earnings over existing allocation strategy baselines. Moreover we provide insight into qualitative differences in optimal LP behaviour in different economic environments.</description>

      <title>Finding pure Nash equilibria in large random games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Best Response Dynamics (BRD) is a class of strategy updating rules to find Pure Nash Equilibria (PNE) in a game. At each step, a player is randomly picked, and the player switches to a "best response" strategy based on the strategies chosen by others, so that the new strategy profile maximises their payoff. If no such strategy exists, a different player will be chosen randomly. When no player wants to change their strategy anymore, the process reaches a PNE and will not deviate from it. On the other hand, either PNE may not exist, or BRD could be "trapped" within a subgame that has no PNE. We consider a random game with $N$ players, each with two actions available, and i.i.d. payoffs, in which the payoff distribution may have an atom, i.e. ties are allowed. We study a class of random walks in a random medium on the $N$-dimensional hypercube induced by the random game. The medium contains two types of obstacles corresponding to PNE and traps. The class of processes we analyze includes BRD, simple random walks on the hypercube, and many other nearest neighbour processes. We prove that, with high probability, these processes reach a PNE before hitting any trap.</description>
