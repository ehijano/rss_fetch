      <title>Fast Compute via MC Boosting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern training and inference pipelines in statistical learning and deep learning repeatedly invoke linear-system solves as inner loops, yet high-accuracy deterministic solvers can be prohibitively expensive when solves must be repeated many times or when only partial information (selected components or linear functionals) is required. We position \emph{Monte Carlo boosting} as a practical alternative in this regime, surveying random-walk estimators and sequential residual correction in a unified notation (Neumann-series representation, forward/adjoint estimators, and Halton-style sequential correction), with extensions to overdetermined/least-squares problems and connections to IRLS-style updates in data augmentation and EM/ECM algorithms. Empirically, we compare Jacobi and Gauss--Seidel iterations with plain Monte Carlo, exact sequential Monte Carlo, and a subsampled sequential variant, illustrating scaling regimes that motivate when Monte Carlo boosting can be an enabling compute primitive for modern statistical learning workflows.</description>

      <title>Optimal Accelerated Life Testing Sampling Plan Design with Piecewise Linear Function based Modeling of Lifetime Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers have widely used accelerated life tests to determine an optimal inspection plan for lot acceptance. All such plans are proposed by assuming a known relationship between the lifetime characteristic(s) and the accelerating stress factor(s) under a parametric framework of the product lifetime distribution. As the true relationship is rarely known in practical scenarios, the assumption itself may produce biased estimates that may lead to an inefficient sampling plan. To this endeavor, an optimal accelerating life test plan is designed under a Type-I censoring scheme with a generalized link structure similar to a spline regression, to capture the nonlinear relationship between the lifetime characteristics and the stress levels. Product lifetime is assumed to follow Weibull distribution with non-identical scale and shape parameters linked with the stress factor through a piecewise linear function. The elements of the Fisher information matrix are computed in detail to formulate the acceptability criterion for the conforming lots. The decision variables of the sampling plan including sample size, stress factors, and others are determined using a constrained aggregated cost minimization approach and variance minimization approach. A simulated case study demonstrates that the nonlinear link-based piecewise linear approximation model outperforms the linear link-based model.</description>

      <title>Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes for Bayesian Inference of PDE Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for piecewise deterministic Markov process (PDMP) samplers that enables efficient Bayesian inference in non-linear inverse problems with expensive likelihoods. The key ingredient is a surrogate-assisted thinning scheme in which a surrogate model provides a proposal event rate and a robust correction mechanism enforces an upper bound on the true rate by dynamically adjusting an additive offset whenever violations are detected. This construction is agnostic to the choice of surrogate and PDMP, and we demonstrate it for the Zig-Zag sampler and the Bouncy particle sampler with constant, Laplace, and Gaussian process (GP) surrogates, including gradient-informed and adaptively refined GP variants. As a representative application, we consider Bayesian inference of a spatially varying Young's modulus in a one-dimensional linear elasticity problem. Across dimensions, PDMP samplers equipped with GP-based surrogates achieve substantially higher accuracy and effective sample size per forward model evaluation than Random Walk Metropolis algorithm and the No-U-Turn sampler. The Bouncy particle sampler exhibits the most favorable overall efficiency and scaling, illustrating the potential of the proposed PDMP framework beyond this particular setting.</description>

      <title>MixMashNet: An R Package for Single and Multilayer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The R package MixMashNet provides an integrated framework for estimating and analyzing single and multilayer networks using Mixed Graphical Models (MGMs), accommodating continuous, count, and categorical variables. In the multilayer setting, layers may comprise different types and numbers of variables, and users can explicitly impose a predefined multilayer topology. Bootstrap procedures are implemented to derive confidence intervals for edge weights and node-level centrality indices. In addition, the package includes tools to assess the stability of node community membership and to compute community scores that summarize the latent dimensions identified through network clustering. MixMashNet also offers interactive Shiny applications to support exploration, visualization, and interpretation of the estimated networks.</description>

      <title>Regularized estimation of Monge-Kantorovich quantiles for spherical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02085v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tools from optimal transport (OT) theory have recently been used to define a notion of quantile function for directional data. In practice, regularization is mandatory for applications that require out-of-sample estimates. To this end, we introduce a regularized estimator built from entropic optimal transport, by extending the definition of the entropic map to the spherical setting. We propose a stochastic algorithm to directly solve a continuous OT problem between the uniform distribution and a target distribution, by expanding Kantorovich potentials in the basis of spherical harmonics. In addition, we define the directional Monge-Kantorovich depth, a companion concept for OT-based quantiles. We show that it benefits from desirable properties related to Liu-Zuo-Serfling axioms for the statistical analysis of directional data. Building on our regularized estimators, we illustrate the benefits of our methodology for data analysis.</description>

      <title>GEORCE: A Fast New Control Algorithm for Computing Geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing geodesics for Riemannian manifolds is a difficult task that often relies on numerical approximations. However, these approximations tend to be either numerically unstable, have slow convergence, or scale poorly with manifold dimension and number of grid points. We introduce a new algorithm called GEORCE that computes geodesics in a local chart via a transformation into a discrete control problem. We show that GEORCE has global convergence and quadratic local convergence. In addition, we show that it extends to Finsler manifolds. For both Finslerian and Riemannian manifolds, we thoroughly benchmark GEORCE against several alternative optimization algorithms and show empirically that it has a much faster and more accurate performance for a variety of manifolds, including key manifolds from information theory and manifolds that are learned using generative models.</description>
