      <title>Spiketrum: An FPGA-based Implementation of a Neuromorphic Cochlea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel FPGA-based neuromorphic cochlea, leveraging the general-purpose spike-coding algorithm, Spiketrum. The focus of this study is on the development and characterization of this cochlea model, which excels in transforming audio vibrations into biologically realistic auditory spike trains. These spike trains are designed to withstand neural fluctuations and spike losses while accurately encapsulating the spatial and precise temporal characteristics of audio, along with the intensity of incoming vibrations. Noteworthy features include the ability to generate real-time spike trains with minimal information loss and the capacity to reconstruct original signals. This fine-tuning capability allows users to optimize spike rates, achieving an optimal balance between output quality and power consumption. Furthermore, the integration of a feedback system into Spiketrum enables selective amplification of specific features while attenuating others, facilitating adaptive power consumption based on application requirements. The hardware implementation supports both spike-based and non-spike-based processors, making it versatile for various computing systems. The cochlea's ability to encode diverse sensory information, extending beyond sound waveforms, positions it as a promising sensory input for current and future spike-based intelligent computing systems, offering compact and real-time spike train generation.</description>

      <title>Application based Evaluation of an Efficient Spike-Encoder, "Spiketrum"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spike-based encoders represent information as sequences of spikes or pulses, which are transmitted between neurons. A prevailing consensus suggests that spike-based approaches demonstrate exceptional capabilities in capturing the temporal dynamics of neural activity and have the potential to provide energy-efficient solutions for low-power applications. The Spiketrum encoder efficiently compresses input data using spike trains or code sets (for non-spiking applications) and is adaptable to both hardware and software implementations, with lossless signal reconstruction capability. The paper proposes and assesses Spiketrum's hardware, evaluating its output under varying spike rates and its classification performance with popular spiking and non-spiking classifiers, and also assessing the quality of information compression and hardware resource utilization. The paper extensively benchmarks both Spiketrum hardware and its software counterpart against state-of-the-art, biologically-plausible encoders. The evaluations encompass benchmarking criteria, including classification accuracy, training speed, and sparsity when using encoder outputs in pattern recognition and classification with both spiking and non-spiking classifiers. Additionally, they consider encoded output entropy and hardware resource utilization and power consumption of the hardware version of the encoders. Results demonstrate Spiketrum's superiority in most benchmarking criteria, making it a promising choice for various applications. It efficiently utilizes hardware resources with low power consumption, achieving high classification accuracy. This work also emphasizes the potential of encoders in spike-based processing to improve the efficiency and performance of neural computing systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring Age-of-Information Weighting in Federated Learning under Data Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates federated learning in a wireless communication system, where random device selection is employed with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. The analysis indicates that while training deep learning networks using federated stochastic gradient descent (FedSGD) on non-IID datasets, device selection can generate gradient errors that accumulate, leading to potential weight divergence. To mitigate training divergence, we design an age-weighted FedSGD to scale local gradients according to the previous state of devices. To further improve learning performance by increasing device participation under the maximum time consumption constraint, we formulate an energy consumption minimization problem by including resource allocation and sub-channel assignment. By transforming the resource allocation problem into convex and utilizing KKT conditions, we derived the optimal resource allocation solution. Moreover, this paper develops a matching based algorithm to generate the enhanced sub-channel assignment. Simulation results indicate that i) age-weighted FedSGD is able to outperform conventional FedSGD in terms of convergence rate and achievable accuracy, and ii) the proposed resource allocation and sub-channel assignment strategies can significantly reduce energy consumption and improve learning performance by increasing the number of selected devices.</description>

      <title>Semantic Importance-Aware Communications with Semantic Correction Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communications, a promising approach for agent-human and agent-agent interactions, typically operate at a feature level, lacking true semantic understanding. This paper explores understanding-level semantic communications (ULSC), transforming visual data into human-intelligible semantic content. We employ an image caption neural network (ICNN) to derive semantic representations from visual data, expressed as natural language descriptions. These are further refined using a pre-trained large language model (LLM) for importance quantification and semantic error correction. The subsequent semantic importance-aware communications (SIAC) aim to minimize semantic loss while respecting transmission delay constraints, exemplified through adaptive modulation and coding strategies. At the receiving end, LLM-based semantic error correction is utilized. If visual data recreation is desired, a pre-trained generative artificial intelligence (AI) model can regenerate it using the corrected descriptions. We assess semantic similarities between transmitted and recovered content, demonstrating ULSC's superior ability to convey semantic understanding compared to feature-level semantic communications (FLSC). ULSC's conversion of visual data to natural language facilitates various cognitive tasks, leveraging human knowledge bases. Additionally, this method enhances privacy, as neither original data nor features are directly transmitted.</description>

      <title>Transformer Meets Gated Residual Networks To Enhance Photoplethysmogram Artifact Detection Informed by Mutual Information Neural Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves into the effectiveness of various learning methods in improving Transformer models, focusing particularly on the Gated Residual Network Transformer (GRN-Transformer) in the context of pediatric intensive care units (PICU) with limited data availability. Our findings indicate that Transformers trained via supervised learning are less effective compared to MLP, CNN, and LSTM networks in such environments. Yet, leveraging unsupervised and self-supervised learning on unannotated data, with subsequent fine-tuning on annotated data, notably enhances Transformer performance, although not to the level of the GRN-Transformer. Central to our research is the analysis of different activation functions for the Gated Linear Unit (GLU), a crucial element of the GRN structure. We also employ Mutual Information Neural Estimation (MINE) to evaluate the GRN's contribution. Additionally, the study examines the effects of integrating GRN within the Transformer's Attention mechanism versus using it as a separate intermediary layer. Our results highlight that GLU with sigmoid activation stands out, achieving 0.98 accuracy, 0.91 precision, 0.96 recall, and 0.94 F1 score. The MINE analysis supports the hypothesis that GRN enhances the mutual information between the hidden representations and the output. Moreover, the use of GRN as an intermediate filter layer proves more beneficial than incorporating it within the Attention mechanism. In summary, this research clarifies how GRN bolsters GRN-Transformer's performance, surpassing other learning techniques. These findings offer a promising avenue for adopting sophisticated models like Transformers in data-constrained environments, such as PPG artifact detection in PICU settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have demonstrated the potential to boost network capacity and expand coverage by adjusting their electromagnetic properties, existing RIS architectures have certain limitations, such as double-fading attenuation and restricted half-space coverage. In this article, we delve into the progressive development from single to multi-functional RIS (MF-RIS) that enables simultaneous signal amplification, reflection, and refraction. We begin by detailing the hardware design and signal model that distinguish MF-RIS from traditional RISs. Subsequently, we introduce the key technologies underpinning MF-RIS-aided communications, along with the fundamental issues and challenges inherent to its deployment. We then outline the promising applications of MFRIS in the realm of communication, sensing, and computation systems, highlighting its transformative impact on these domains. Lastly, we present simulation results to demonstrate the superiority of MF-RIS in enhancing network performance in terms of spectral efficiency.</description>

      <title>Networked Integrated Sensing and Communications for 6G Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is envisioned as a key pillar for enabling the upcoming sixth generation (6G) communication systems, requiring not only reliable communication functionalities but also highly accurate environmental sensing capabilities. In this paper, we design a novel networked ISAC framework to explore the collaboration among multiple users for environmental sensing. Specifically, multiple users can serve as powerful sensors, capturing back scattered signals from a target at various angles to facilitate reliable computational imaging. Centralized sensing approaches are extremely sensitive to the capability of the leader node because it requires the leader node to process the signals sent by all the users. To this end, we propose a two-step distributed cooperative sensing algorithm that allows low-dimensional intermediate estimate exchange among neighboring users, thus eliminating the reliance on the centralized leader node and improving the robustness of sensing. This way, multiple users can cooperatively sense a target by exploiting the block-wise environment sparsity and the interference cancellation technique. Furthermore, we analyze the mean square error of the proposed distributed algorithm as a networked sensing performance metric and propose a beamforming design for the proposed network ISAC scheme to maximize the networked sensing accuracy and communication performance subject to a transmit power constraint. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>A New Solution for MU-MISO Symbol-Level Precoding: Extrapolation and Deep Unfolding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructive interference (CI) precoding, which converts the harmful multi-user interference into beneficial signals, is a promising and efficient interference management scheme in multi-antenna communication systems. However, CI-based symbol-level precoding (SLP) experiences high computational complexity as the number of symbol slots increases within a transmission block, rendering it unaffordable in practical communication systems. In this paper, we propose a symbol-level extrapolation (SLE) strategy to extrapolate the precoding matrix by leveraging the relationship between different symbol slots within in a transmission block, during which the channel state information (CSI) remains constant, where we design a closed-form iterative algorithm based on SLE for both PSK and QAM modulation. In order to further reduce the computational complexity, a sub-optimal closed-form solution based on SLE is further developed for PSK and QAM, respectively. Moreover, we design an unsupervised SLE-based neural network (SLE-Net) to unfold the proposed iterative algorithm, which helps enhance the interpretability of the neural network. By carefully designing the loss function of the SLE-Net, the time-complexity of the network can be reduced effectively. Extensive simulation results illustrate that the proposed algorithms can dramatically reduce the computational complexity and time complexity with only marginal performance loss, compared with the conventional SLP design methods.</description>

      <title>Error Performance Analysis of UAV-Mounted RIS for NOMA Systems with Practical Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted recent attention for sixth-generation (6G) networks due to their low cost and flexible deployment. In order to maximize the ever-increasing data rates, spectral efficiency, and wider coverage, technologies such as reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) are adapted with UAVs (UAV-RIS NOMA). However, the error performance of UAV-RIS NOMA has not been considered, yet. In this letter, we investigate the error probability of UAV-RIS NOMA systems. We also consider the practical constraints of hardware impairments (HWI) at the transceivers, inter-cell interference (ICI), and imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC). The analytical derivations are validated by Monte-Carlo simulations. Our results demonstrate that our proposed system achieves higher performance gain (more than 5 dB with increasing the number of RIS elements) with less error probability compared to UAVs without RIS. Moreover, it is found that the HWI, ICI, and imperfect SIC have shown a negative impact on the system performance.</description>

      <title>Deep learning improved autofocus for motion artifact reduction and its application in quantitative susceptibility mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop a pipeline for motion artifact correction in mGRE and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). Methods: Deep learning is integrated with autofocus to improve motion artifact suppression, which is applied QSM of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The estimation of affine motion parameters in the autofocus method depends on signal-to-noise ratio and lacks accuracy when data sampling occurs outside the k-space center. A deep learning strategy is employed to remove the residual motion artifacts in autofocus. Results: Results obtained in simulated brain data (n =15) with reference truth show that the proposed autofocus deep learning method significantly improves the image quality of mGRE and QSM (p = 0.001 for SSIM, p &lt; 0.0001 for PSNR and RMSE). Results from 10 PD patients with real motion artifacts in QSM have also been corrected using the proposed method and sent to an experienced radiologist for image quality evaluation, and the average image quality score has increased (p=0.0039). Conclusions: The proposed method enables substantial suppression of motion artifacts in mGRE and QSM.</description>

      <title>On the Performance of Continuous Aperture Array (CAPA)-Based Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of continuous aperture array (CAPA)-based wireless communications is analyzed in an uplink scenario. An analytical framework is proposed to characterize uplink CAPA-based transmission using electromagnetic field theories. On this basis, new expressions are derived for the channel capacity in a single-user scenario and the sum-rate capacity in a multiuser scenario, along with the capacity-achieving decoding schemes. These findings are proved to differ greatly from those established for conventional spatially discrete (SPD) arrays. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate that CAPA offers significant capacity gains compared to the SPD array.</description>

      <title>Aperture Selection for CAP Arrays (CAPAs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of aperture selection is proposed for continuous aperture array (CAPA)-based communications. The achieved performance is analyzed in an uplink scenario by considering both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios. In the LoS scenario, the optimal selection strategy is demonstrated to follow the nearest neighbor criterion, and the resulting signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is analyzed. In the NLoS scenario, the achieved outage probability along with the diversity order is revealed. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate that aperture selection effectively maintains satisfactory performance by leveraging selection diversity while simultaneously reducing the implementation complexity of CAPAs.</description>

      <title>Coil Reweighting to Suppress Motion Artifacts in Real-Time Exercise Cine Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Accelerated real-time cine (RT-Cine) imaging enables cardiac function assessment without the need for breath-holding. However, when performed during in-magnet exercise, RT-Cine images may exhibit significant motion artifacts. Methods: By projecting the time-averaged images to the subspace spanned by the coil sensitivity maps, we propose a coil reweighting (CR) method to automatically suppress a subset of receive coils that introduces a high level of artifacts in the reconstructed image. RT-Cine data collected at rest and during exercise from ten healthy volunteers and six patients were utilized to assess the performance of the proposed method. One short-axis and one two-chamber RT-Cine series reconstructed with and without CR from each subject were visually scored by two cardiologists in terms of the level of artifacts on a scale of 1 (worst) to 5 (best). Results: For healthy volunteers, applying CR to RT-Cine images collected at rest did not significantly change the image quality score (p=1). In contrast, for RT-Cine images collected during exercise, CR significantly improved the score from 3.9 to 4.68 (p&lt;0.001). Similarly, in patients, CR did not significantly change the score for images collected at rest (p=0.031) but markedly improved the score from 3.15 to 4.42 (p&lt;0.001) for images taken during exercise. Despite lower image quality scores in the patient cohort compared to healthy subjects, likely due to larger body habitus and the difficulty of limiting body motion during exercise, CR effectively suppressed motion artifacts, with all image series from the patient cohort receiving a score of four or higher. Conclusion: Using data from healthy subjects and patients, we demonstrate that the motion artifacts in the reconstructed RT-Cine images can be effectively suppressed significantly with the proposed CR method.</description>

      <title>Coverage Analysis of Downlink Transmission in Multi-Connectivity Cellular V2X Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing of connected vehicles in the fifth-generation mobile communication networks (5G) and beyond 5G (B5G), ensuring the reliable and high-speed cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communication has posed significant challenges due to the high mobility of vehicles. For improving the network performance and reliability, multi-connectivity technology has emerged as a crucial transmission mode for C-V2X in the 5G era. To this end, this paper proposes a framework for analyzing the performance of multi-connectivity in C-V2X downlink transmission, with a focus on the performance indicators of joint distance distribution and coverage probability. Specifically, we first derive the joint distance distribution of multi-connectivity. By leveraging the tools of stochastic geometry, we then obtain the analytical expressions of coverage probability based on the previous results for general multi-connectivity cases in C-V2X. Subsequently, we evaluate the effect of path loss exponent and downlink base station density on coverage probability based on the proposed analytical framework. Finally, extensive Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed analytical framework and the simulation results reveal that multi-connectivity technology can significantly enhance the coverage probability in C-V2X.</description>

      <title>Extraction of In-Phase and Quadrature Components by Time-Encoding Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time encoding machine (TEM) is a biologically-inspired scheme to perform signal sampling using timing. In this paper, we study its application to the sampling of bandpass signals. We propose an integrate-and-fire TEM scheme by which the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components are extracted through reconstruction. We design the TEM according to the signal bandwidth and amplitude instead of upper-edge frequency and amplitude as in the case of bandlimited/lowpass signals. We show that the I and Q components can be perfectly reconstructed from the TEM measurements if the minimum firing rate is equal to the Landau's rate of the signal. For the reconstruction of I and Q components, we develop an alternating projection onto convex sets (POCS) algorithm in which two POCS algorithms are alternately iterated. For the algorithm analysis, we define a solution space of vector-valued signals and prove that the proposed reconstruction algorithm converges to the correct unique solution in the noiseless case. The proposed TEM can operate regardless of the center frequencies of the bandpass signals. This is quite different from traditional bandpass sampling, where the center frequency should be carefully allocated for Landau's rate and its variations have the negative effect on the sampling performance. In addition, the proposed TEM achieves certain reconstructed signal-to-noise-plus-distortion ratios for small firing rates in thermal noise, which is unavoidably present and will be aliased to the Nyquist band in the traditional sampling such that high sampling rates are required. We demonstrate the reconstruction performance and substantiate our claims via simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>CycloDSP: A cyclostationary signal analysis tool for GNU Radio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a first attempt to incorporate in the GNU Radio ecosystem a tool called CycloDSP, devoted to the analysis of complex-valued cyclostationary signals. Such signals are ubiquitous in communication and signal processing, exhibiting periodic or almost periodic statistics that are characterized by a countable set of cycle frequencies, which are related to the main signal periodicities. Common cycle frequencies for modulated signals are multiple of the baudrate and/or combination of the carrier frequency and baudrate. Conventional estimation strategies for cyclostationary signal analysis typically exhibit a high computational burden. Many approaches aimed at reducing complexity exploit fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms, which are very efficient for batch data but are not suited for continuously streaming data, typically encountered in software-defined radio (SDR) applications. The aim of this paper is to develop an out-of-tree (OOT) GNU Radio module containing a set of building block functions, aimed at estimating functions, such as the cyclic correlation functions, typically employed for cyclostationary signal analysis. The proposed implementation must be designed so as to ensure high efficiency in processing continuous data streams of complex samples, both in terms of computational load and data storage, in order to be executed on general purpose computers. We tested our implementation by estimating in real-time the second-order cyclic statistics of a Gaussian minimum-shift keying (GMSK) modulated signal, which belongs to a class of signals commonly employed in aeronautical telemetry datalinks.</description>

      <title>Joint Channel, Data and Radar Parameter Estimation for AFDM Systems in Doubly-Dispersive Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose new schemes for joint channel and data estimation (JCDE) and radar parameter estimation (RPE) in doubly-dispersive channels, such that integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is enabled by user equipment (UE) independently performing JCDE, and base stations (BSs) performing RPE. The contributed JCDE and RPE schemes are designed for waveforms known to perform well in doubly-dispersive channels, under a unified model that captures the features of either legacy orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), state-of-the-art (SotA) orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), and next-generation affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) systems. The proposed JCDE algorithm is based on a Bayesian parametric bilinear Gaussian belief propagation (PBiGaBP) framework first proposed for OTFS and here shown to apply to all aforementioned waveforms, while the RPE scheme is based on a new probabilistic data association (PDA) approach incorporating a Bernoulli-Gaussian denoising, optimized via expectation maximization (EM). Simulation results demonstrate that JCDE in AFDM systems utilizing a single pilot per block significantly outperforms the SotA alternative even if the latter is granted a substantial power advantage. Similarly, the AFDM-based RPE scheme is found to outperform the OTFS-based approach, as well as the sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) technique, regardless of the waveform used.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over-the-air computation (AirComp) leverages the signal-superposition characteristic of wireless multiple access channels to perform mathematical computations. Initially introduced to enhance communication reliability in interference channels and wireless sensor networks, AirComp has more recently found applications in task-oriented communications, namely, for wireless distributed learning and in wireless control systems. Its adoption aims to address latency challenges arising from an increased number of edge devices or IoT devices accessing the constrained wireless spectrum. This paper focuses on the physical layer of these systems, specifically on the waveform and the signal processing aspects at the transmitter and receiver to meet the challenges that AirComp presents within the different contexts and use cases.</description>

      <title>A Deep-NN Beamforming Approach for Dual Function Radar-Communication THz UAV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a scenario with one UAV equipped with a ULA, which sends combined information and sensing signals to communicate with multiple GBS and, at the same time, senses potential targets placed within an interested area on the ground. We aim to jointly design the transmit beamforming with the GBS association to optimize communication performance while ensuring high sensing accuracy. We propose a predictive beamforming framework based on a dual DNN solution to solve the formulated nonconvex optimization problem. A first DNN is trained to produce the required beamforming matrix for any point of the UAV flying area in a reduced time compared to state-of-the-art beamforming optimizers. A second DNN is trained to learn the optimal mapping from the input features, power, and EIRP constraints to the GBS association decision. Finally, we provide an extensive simulation analysis to corroborate the proposed approach and show the benefits of EIRP, SINR performance and computational speed.</description>

      <title>Beware of Overestimated Decoding Performance Arising from Temporal Autocorrelations in Electroencephalogram Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers have reported high decoding accuracy (&gt;95%) using non-invasive Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for brain-computer interface (BCI) decoding tasks like image decoding, emotion recognition, auditory spatial attention detection, etc. Since these EEG data were usually collected with well-designed paradigms in labs, the reliability and robustness of the corresponding decoding methods were doubted by some researchers, and they argued that such decoding accuracy was overestimated due to the inherent temporal autocorrelation of EEG signals. However, the coupling between the stimulus-driven neural responses and the EEG temporal autocorrelations makes it difficult to confirm whether this overestimation exists in truth. Furthermore, the underlying pitfalls behind overestimated decoding accuracy have not been fully explained due to a lack of appropriate formulation. In this work, we formulate the pitfall in various EEG decoding tasks in a unified framework. EEG data were recorded from watermelons to remove stimulus-driven neural responses. Labels were assigned to continuous EEG according to the experimental design for EEG recording of several typical datasets, and then the decoding methods were conducted. The results showed the label can be successfully decoded as long as continuous EEG data with the same label were split into training and test sets. Further analysis indicated that high accuracy of various BCI decoding tasks could be achieved by associating labels with EEG intrinsic temporal autocorrelation features. These results underscore the importance of choosing the right experimental designs and data splits in BCI decoding tasks to prevent inflated accuracies due to EEG temporal autocorrelation.</description>

      <title>Reliable Sub-Nyquist Spectrum Sensing via Conformal Risk Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting occupied subbands is a key task for wireless applications such as unlicensed spectrum access. Recently, detection methods were proposed that extract per-subband features from sub-Nyquist baseband samples and then apply thresholding mechanisms based on held-out data. Such existing solutions can only provide guarantees in terms of false negative rate (FNR) in the asymptotic regime of large held-out data sets. In contrast, this work proposes a threshold mechanism-based conformal risk control (CRC), a method recently introduced in statistics. The proposed CRC-based thresholding technique formally meets user-specified FNR constraints, irrespective of the size of the held-out data set. By applying the proposed CRC-based framework to both reconstruction-based and classification-based sub-Nyquist spectrum sensing techniques, it is verified via experimental results that CRC not only provides theoretical guarantees on the FNR but also offers competitive true negative rate (TNR) performance.</description>

      <title>Towards Accurate Ego-lane Identification with Early Time Series Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and timely determination of a vehicle's current lane within a map is a critical task in autonomous driving systems. This paper utilizes an Early Time Series Classification (ETSC) method to achieve precise and rapid ego-lane identification in real-world driving data. The method begins by assessing the similarities between map and lane markings perceived by the vehicle's camera using measurement model quality metrics. These metrics are then fed into a selected ETSC method, comprising a probabilistic classifier and a tailored trigger function, optimized via multi-objective optimization to strike a balance between early prediction and accuracy. Our solution has been evaluated on a comprehensive dataset consisting of 114 hours of real-world traffic data, collected across 5 different countries by our test vehicles. Results show that by leveraging road lane-marking geometry and lane-marking type derived solely from a camera, our solution achieves an impressive accuracy of 99.6%, with an average prediction time of only 0.84 seconds.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Automotive Radar Collaborative Sensing By Exploiting Constructive Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automotive radar emerges as a crucial sensor for autonomous vehicle perception. As more cars are equipped radars, radar interference is an unavoidable challenge. Unlike conventional approaches such as interference mitigation and interference-avoiding technologies, this paper introduces an innovative collaborative sensing scheme with multiple automotive radars that exploits constructive interference. Through collaborative sensing, our method optimally aligns cross-path interference signals from other radars with another radar's self-echo signals, thereby significantly augmenting its target detection capabilities. This approach alleviates the need for extensive raw data sharing between collaborating radars. Instead, only an optimized weighting matrix needs to be exchanged between the radars. This approach considerably decreases the data bandwidth requirements for the wireless channel, making it a more feasible and practical solution for automotive radar collaboration. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the constructive interference approach for enhanced object detection capability.</description>

      <title>Batteryless BLE and Light-based IoT Sensor Nodes for Reliable Environmental Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sustainable design of Internet of Things (IoT) networks encompasses considerations related to energy efficiency and autonomy as well as considerations related to reliable communications, ensuring no energy is wasted on undelivered data. Under these considerations, this work proposes the design and implementation of energy-efficient Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Light-based IoT (LIoT) batteryless IoT sensor nodes powered by an indoor light Energy Harvesting Unit (EHU). Our design intends to integrate these nodes into a sensing network to improve its reliability by combining both technologies and taking advantage of their features. The nodes incorporate state-of-the-art components, such as low-power sensors and efficient System-on-Chips (SoCs). Moreover, we design a strategy for adaptive switching between active and sleep cycles as a function of the available energy, allowing the IoT nodes to continuously operate without batteries. Our results show that by adapting the duty cycle of the BLE and LIoT nodes depending on the environment's light intensity, we can ensure a continuous and reliable node operation. In particular, measurements show that our proposed BLE and LIoT node designs are able to communicate with an IoT gateway in a bidirectional way, every 19.3 and 624.6 seconds, respectively, in an energy-autonomous and reliable manner.</description>

      <title>Massive Digital Over-the-Air Computation for Communication-Efficient Federated Edge Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over-the-air computation (AirComp) is a promising technology converging communication and computation over wireless networks, which can be particularly effective in model training, inference, and more emerging edge intelligence applications. AirComp relies on uncoded transmission of individual signals, which are added naturally over the multiple access channel thanks to the superposition property of the wireless medium. Despite significantly improved communication efficiency, how to accommodate AirComp in the existing and future digital communication networks, that are based on discrete modulation schemes, remains a challenge. This paper proposes a massive digital AirComp (MD-AirComp) scheme, that leverages an unsourced massive access protocol, to enhance compatibility with both current and next-generation wireless networks. MD-AirComp utilizes vector quantization to reduce the uplink communication overhead, and employs shared quantization and modulation codebooks. At the receiver, we propose a near-optimal approximate message passing-based algorithm to compute the model aggregation results from the superposed sequences, which relies on estimating the number of devices transmitting each code sequence, rather than trying to decode the messages of individual transmitters. We apply MD-AirComp to the federated edge learning (FEEL), and show that it significantly accelerates FEEL convergence compared to state-of-the-art while using the same amount of communication resources. To support further research and ensure reproducibility, we have made our code available at https://github.com/liqiao19/MD-AirComp.</description>

      <title>Unified Timing Analysis for Closed-Loop Goal-Oriented Wireless Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Goal-oriented communication has become one of the focal concepts in sixth-generation communication systems owing to its potential to provide intelligent, immersive, and real-time mobile services. The emerging paradigms of goal-oriented communication constitute closed loops integrating communication, computation, and sensing. However, challenges arise for closed-loop timing analysis due to multiple random factors that affect the communication/computation latency, as well as the heterogeneity of feedback mechanisms across multi-modal sensing data. To tackle these problems, we aim to provide a unified timing analysis framework for closed-loop goal-oriented communication (CGC) systems over fading channels. The proposed framework is unified as it considers computation, compression, and communication latency in the loop with different configurations. To capture the heterogeneity across multi-modal feedback, we categorize the sensory data into the periodic-feedback and event-triggered, respectively. We formulate timing constraints based on average and tail performance, covering timeliness, jitter, and reliability of CGC systems. A method based on saddlepoint approximation is proposed to obtain the distribution of closed-loop latency. The results show that the modified saddlepoint approximation is capable of accurately characterizing the latency distribution of the loop with analytically tractable expressions. This sets the basis for low-complexity co-design of communication and computation.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Empowered Physical Layer Security Without Eve's CSI: Joint Optimization of Beamforming and Antenna Positions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical layer security (PLS) technology based on the fixed-position antenna (FPA) has {attracted widespread attention}. Due to the fixed feature of the antennas, current FPA-based PLS schemes cannot fully utilize the spatial degree of freedom, and thus a weaken secure gain in the desired/undesired direction may exist. Different from the concept of FPA, mobile antenna (MA) is a novel technology that {reconfigures} the wireless channels and enhances the corresponding capacity through the flexible movement of antennas on a minor scale. MA-empowered PLS enjoys huge potential and deserves further investigation. In this paper, we, for the first time, investigate the secrecy performance of MA-enabled PLS system where a MA-based Alice transmits the confidential information to multiple single-antenna Bobs, in the presence of the single-antenna eavesdropper (Eve) {in the absence} of perfect channel state information (CSI). For the purpose of the secrecy rate maximization of the worst Bob, we jointly design the transmit beamforming and antenna positions at the Alice, subject to the minimum moving distance of the antenna, uncertainty CSI of Eve, and maximum transmit power. Furthermore, the projected gradient ascent (PGA), alternating optimization (AO), and simulated annealing (SA) {are} adopted to solve the non-convex characteristics of the problem of the secrecy rate maximization. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed method. In particular, MA-enabled PLS scheme can significantly enhance the secrecy rate compared to the conventional FPA-based ones for different settings of key system parameters.</description>

      <title>EEG-DBNet: A Dual-Branch Network for Motor-Imagery Brain-Computer Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) aid individuals with restricted limb mobility. However, challenges like low signal-to-noise ratio and limited spatial resolution hinder accurate feature extraction from EEG signals, impacting classification. To tackle these issues, we propose an end-to-end dual-branch neural network (EEG-DBNet). This network decodes temporal and spectral sequences separately using distinct branches. Each branch has local and global convolution blocks for extracting local and global features. The temporal branch employs three convolutional layers with smaller kernels, fewer channels, and average pooling, while the spectral branch uses larger kernels, more channels, and max pooling. Global convolution blocks then extract comprehensive features. Outputs from both branches are concatenated and fed to fully connected layers for classification. Ablation experiments demonstrate that our architecture, with specialized convolutional parameters for temporal and spectral sequences, significantly improves classification accuracy compared to single-branch structures. The complementary relationship between local and global convolutional blocks compensates for traditional CNNs' limitations in global feature extraction. Our method achieves accuracies of 85.84% and 91.42% on BCI Competition 4-2a and 4-2b datasets, respectively, surpassing existing state-of-the-art models.

      <description>arXiv:2405.16174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To meet the stringent requirements of next-generation wireless networks, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology is expected to become massive and pervasive. Unfortunately, this could pose scalability issues in terms of complexity, power consumption, cost, and processing latency. Therefore, novel technologies and design approaches, such as the recently introduced holographic MIMO paradigm, must be investigated to make future networks sustainable. In this context, we propose the concept of a dynamic scattering array (DSA) as a versatile 3D structure capable of performing joint wave-based computing and radiation by moving the processing from the digital domain to the electromagnetic (EM) domain. We provide a general analytical framework for modeling DSAs, introduce specific design algorithms, and apply them to various use cases. The examples presented in the numerical results demonstrate the potential of DSAs to further reduce complexity and the number of radiofrequency (RF) chains in holographic MIMO systems while achieving enhanced EM wave processing and radiation flexibility for tasks such as beamforming and single- and multi-user MIMO.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Reliability in LEO Satellite Networks via High-Speed Inter-Satellite Links</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites play a crucial role in providing global connectivity for non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) and supporting various Internet-of-Remote-Things (IoRT) applications. Each LEO satellite functions as a relay node in the sky, employing store-and-forward transmission strategies that necessitate the use of buffers. However, due to the finite size of these buffers, occurrences of buffer overflow leading to packet loss are inevitable. In this paper, we demonstrate how inter-satellite links (ISLs) can mitigate the probability of buffer overflow. Specifically, we propose an approach to reallocate packets among LEO satellites via ISLs to minimize the occurrence of buffer overflow events. Consequently, the implementation of ISLs can lead to a more reliable satellite network, enabling efficient packet reallocation to reduce the probability of buffer overflow.</description>

      <title>Study of Robust Direction Finding Based on Joint Sparse Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation methods are typically derived based on the Gaussian noise assumption, making them highly sensitive to outliers. Therefore, in the presence of impulsive noise, the performance of these methods may significantly deteriorate. In this paper, we model impulsive noise as Gaussian noise mixed with sparse outliers. By exploiting their statistical differences, we propose a novel DOA estimation method based on sparse signal recovery (SSR). Furthermore, to address the issue of grid mismatch, we utilize an alternating optimization approach that relies on the estimated outlier matrix and the on-grid DOA estimates to obtain the off-grid DOA estimates. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits robustness against large outliers.</description>

      <title>Joint Node Selection and Resource Allocation Optimization for Cooperative Sensing with a Shared Wireless Backhaul</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a cooperative sensing framework in the context of future multi-functional network with both communication and sensing ability, where one base station (BS) serves as a sensing transmitter and several nearby BSs serve as sensing receivers. Each receiver receives the sensing signal reflected by the target and communicates with the fusion center (FC) through a wireless multiple access channel (MAC) for cooperative target localization. To improve the localization performance, we present a hybrid information-signal domain cooperative sensing (HISDCS) design, where each sensing receiver transmits both the estimated time delay/effective reflecting coefficient and the received sensing signal sampled around the estimated time delay to the FC. Then, we propose to minimize the number of channel uses by utilizing an efficient Karhunen-Lo\'eve transformation (KLT) encoding scheme for signal quantization and proper node selection, under the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) constraint and the capacity limits of MAC. A novel matrix-inequality constrained successive convex approximation (MCSCA) algorithm is proposed to optimize the wireless backhaul resource allocation, together with a greedy strategy for node selection. Despite the high non-convexness of the considered problem, we prove that the proposed MCSCA algorithm is able to converge to the set of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solutions of a relaxed problem obtained by relaxing the discrete variables. Besides, a low-complexity quantization bit reallocation algorithm is designed, which does not perform explicit node selection, and is able to harvest most of the performance gain brought by HISDCS. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to show that the proposed HISDCS design is able to significantly outperform the baseline schemes.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Geological Prediction for Tunnel Excavation Using Full Waveform Inversion Integrating Sobolev Space Regularization with a Quadratic Penalty Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the process of tunnel excavation, advanced geological prediction technology has become indispensable for safe, economical, and efficient tunnel construction. Although traditional methods such as drilling and geological analysis are effective, they typically involve destructive processes, carry high risks, and incur significant costs. In contrast, non-destructive geophysical exploration offers a more convenient and economical alternative. However, the accuracy and precision of these non-destructive methods can be severely compromised by complex geological structures and environmental noise. To address these challenges effectively, a novel approach using frequency domain full waveform inversion (FWI), based on a penalty method and Sobolev space regularization, has been proposed to enhance the performance of non-destructive predictions. The proposed method constructs a soft-constrained optimization problem by restructuring the misfit function into a combination of data misfit and wave equation drive terms to enhance convexity. Additionally, it semi-extends the search space to both the wavefield and the model parameters to mitigate the strong nonlinearity of the optimization, facilitating high-resolution inversion. Furthermore, a Sobolev space regularization algorithm is introduced to flexibly adjust the regularization path, addressing issues related to noise and artefacts to improve the robustness of the inversion. We evaluated the proposed FWI with a tunnel fault model by comparing the results of the proposed method with those of traditional Tikhonov regularization and total variation regularization FWI methods. The results confirm the superior performance of the proposed algorithm as expected.</description>

      <title>Cross Far- and Near-Field Channel Measurement and Modeling in Extremely Large-scale Antenna Array (ELAA) Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Technologies like ultra-massive multiple-input-multiple-output (UM-MIMO) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are of special interest to meet the key performance indicators of future wireless systems including ubiquitous connectivity and lightning-fast data rates. One of their common features, the extremely large-scale antenna array (ELAA) systems with hundreds or thousands of antennas, give rise to near-field (NF) propagation and bring new challenges to channel modeling and characterization. In this paper, a cross-field channel model for ELAA systems is proposed, which improves the statistical model in 3GPP TR 38.901 by refining the propagation path with its first and last bounces and differentiating the characterization of parameters like path loss, delay, and angles in near- and far-fields. A comprehensive analysis of cross-field boundaries and closed-form expressions of corresponding NF or FF parameters are provided. Furthermore, cross-field experiments carried out in a typical indoor scenario at 300 GHz verify the variation of MPC parameters across the antenna array, and demonstrate the distinction of channels between different antenna elements. Finally, detailed generation procedures of the cross-field channel model are provided, based on which simulations and analysis on NF probabilities and channel coefficients are conducted for $4\times4$, $8\times8$, $16\times16$, and $9\times21$ uniform planar arrays at different frequency bands.</description>

      <title>Timeliness of Status Update System: The Effect of Parallel Transmission Using Heterogeneous Updating Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Timely status updating is the premise of emerging interaction-based applications in the Internet of Things (IoT). Using redundant devices to update the status of interest is a promising method to improve the timeliness of information. However, parallel status updating leads to out-of-order arrivals at the monitor, significantly challenging timeliness analysis. This work studies the Age of Information (AoI) of a multi-queue status update system where multiple devices monitor the same physical process. Specifically, two systems are considered: the Basic System, which only has type-1 devices that are ad hoc devices located close to the source, and the Hybrid System, which contains additional type-2 devices that are infrastructure-based devices located in fixed points compared to the Basic System. Using the Stochastic Hybrid Systems (SHS) framework, a mathematical model that combines discrete and continuous dynamics, we derive the expressions of the average AoI of the considered two systems in closed form. Numerical results verify the accuracy of the analysis. It is shown that when the number and parameters of the type-1 devices/type-2 devices are fixed, the logarithm of average AoI will linearly decrease with the logarithm of the total arrival rate of type-2 devices or that of the number of type-1 devices under specific condition. It has also been demonstrated that the proposed systems can significantly outperform the FCFS M/M/N status update system.</description>

      <title>Holographic MIMO Systems, Their Channel Estimation and Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holographic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems constitute a promising technology in support of next-generation wireless communications, thus paving the way for a smart programmable radio environment. However, despite its significant potential, further fundamental issues remain to be addressed, such as the acquisition of accurate channel information. Indeed, the conventional angular-domain channel representation is no longer adequate for characterizing the sparsity inherent in holographic MIMO channels. To fill this knowledge gap, in this article, we conceive a decomposition and reconstruction (DeRe)-based framework for facilitating the estimation of sparse channels in holographic MIMOs. In particular, the channel parameters involved in the steering vector, namely the azimuth and elevation angles plus the distance (AED), are decomposed for independently constructing their own covariance matrices. Then, the acquisition of each parameter can be formulated as a compressive sensing (CS) problem by harnessing the covariance matrix associated with each individual parameter. We demonstrate that our solution exhibits an improved performance and imposes a reduced pilot overhead, despite its reduced complexity. Finally, promising open research topics are highlighted to bridge the gap between the theory and the practical employment of holographic MIMO schemes.</description>

Abstract: Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite internet of things (IoT) is a promising way achieving global Internet of Everything, and thus has been widely recognized as an important component of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. Yet, due to high-speed movement of the LEO satellite, it is challenging to acquire timely channel state information (CSI) and design effective multibeam precoding for various IoT applications. To this end, this paper provides a deep learning (DL)-based joint channel prediction and multibeam precoding scheme under adverse environments, e.g., high Doppler shift, long propagation delay, and low satellite payload. {Specifically, this paper first designs a DL-based channel prediction scheme by using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short term memory (LSTM), which predicts the CSI of current time slot according to that of previous time slots. With the predicted CSI, this paper designs a DL-based robust multibeam precoding scheme by using a channel augmentation method based on variational auto-encoder (VAE).} Finally, extensive simulation results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed scheme in LEO satellite IoT.</description>

Abstract: To advance control, operation and planning tools of electrical networks with ML is not straightforward. 110 experts were surveyed showing where and how ML algorithmis could advance. This paper assesses this survey and research environment.

This paper finds that the R\&amp;D environment of system operators (and the surrounding research ecosystem) needs adaptation to enable faster developments with AI while maintaining high testing quality and safety. This roadmap may interest research centre managers in system operators, academics, and labs dedicated to advancing the next generation of tooling for electrical networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multiple-input multiple-output communication system with multiple antennas at both the base station (BS) and the user. We plan to maximize the achievable rate through jointly optimizing the transmit precoding matrix, the receive combining matrix, and the RIS reflection matrix under the constraints of the transmit power at the BS and the unit-modulus reflection at the RIS. Regarding the non-trivial problem form, we initially reformulate it into an considerable problem to make it tractable by utilizing the relationship between the achievable rate and the weighted minimum mean squared error. Next, the transmit precoding matrix, the receive combining matrix, and the RIS reflection matrix are alternately optimized. In particular, the optimal transmit precoding matrix and receive combining matrix are obtained in closed forms. Furthermore, a pair of computationally efficient methods are proposed for the RIS reflection matrix, namely the semi-definite relaxation (SDR) method and the successive closed form (SCF) method. We theoretically prove that both methods are ensured to converge, and the SCF-based algorithm is able to converges to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point of the problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel machine-learning (ML) approach (EM-GANSim) for real-time electromagnetic (EM) propagation that is used for wireless communication simulation in 3D indoor environments. Our approach uses a modified conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that incorporates encoded geometry and transmitter location while adhering to the electromagnetic propagation theory. The overall physically-inspired learning is able to predict the power distribution in 3D scenes, which is represented using heatmaps. Our overall accuracy is comparable to ray tracing-based EM simulation, as evidenced by lower mean squared error values. Furthermore, our GAN-based method drastically reduces the computation time, achieving a 5X speedup on complex benchmarks. In practice, it can compute the signal strength in a few milliseconds on any location in 3D indoor environments. We also present a large dataset of 3D models and EM ray tracing-simulated heatmaps. To the best of our knowledge, EM-GANSim is the first real-time algorithm for EM simulation in complex 3D indoor environments. We plan to release the code and the dataset.</description>

      <title>Which Framework is Suitable for Online 3D Multi-Object Tracking for Autonomous Driving with Automotive 4D Imaging Radar?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06036v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) has recently received significant research interests due to the expanding demand of 3D perception in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving (AD). Among the existing 3D MOT frameworks for ADAS and AD, conventional point object tracking (POT) framework using the tracking-by-detection (TBD) strategy has been well studied and accepted for LiDAR and 4D imaging radar point clouds. In contrast, extended object tracking (EOT), another important framework which accepts the joint-detection-and-tracking (JDT) strategy, has rarely been explored for online 3D MOT applications. This paper provides the first systematic investigation of the EOT framework for online 3D MOT in real-world ADAS and AD scenarios. Specifically, the widely accepted TBD-POT framework, the recently investigated JDT-EOT framework, and our proposed TBD-EOT framework are compared via extensive evaluations on two open source 4D imaging radar datasets: View-of-Delft and TJ4DRadSet. Experiment results demonstrate that the conventional TBD-POT framework remains preferable for online 3D MOT with high tracking performance and low computational complexity, while the proposed TBD-EOT framework has the potential to outperform it in certain situations. However, the results also show that the JDT-EOT framework encounters multiple problems and performs inadequately in evaluation scenarios. After analyzing the causes of these phenomena based on various evaluation metrics and visualizations, we provide possible guidelines to improve the performance of these MOT frameworks on real-world data. These provide the first benchmark and important insights for the future development of 4D imaging radar-based online 3D MOT algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate localization and perception are pivotal for enhancing the safety and reliability of vehicles. However, current localization methods suffer from reduced accuracy when the line-of-sight (LOS) path is obstructed, or a combination of reflections and scatterings is present. In this paper, we present an integrated localization and sensing method that delivers superior performance in complex environments while being computationally efficient. Our method uniformly leverages various types of multipath components (MPCs) through the lens of random finite sets (RFSs), encompassing reflections, scatterings, and their combinations. This advancement eliminates the need for the multipath identification step and streamlines the filtering process by removing the necessity for distinct filters for different multipath types, a requirement that was critical in previous research. The simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our method in both robustness and effectiveness, particularly in complex environments where the LOS MPC is obscured and in situations involving clutter and missed detection of MPC measurements.</description>

      <title>Improving Transformer Performance for French Clinical Notes Classification Using Mixture of Experts on a Limited Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.12892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based models have shown outstanding results in natural language processing but face challenges in applications like classifying small-scale clinical texts, especially with constrained computational resources. This study presents a customized Mixture of Expert (MoE) Transformer models for classifying small-scale French clinical texts at CHU Sainte-Justine Hospital. The MoE-Transformer addresses the dual challenges of effective training with limited data and low-resource computation suitable for in-house hospital use. Despite the success of biomedical pre-trained models such as CamemBERT-bio, DrBERT, and AliBERT, their high computational demands make them impractical for many clinical settings. Our MoE-Transformer model not only outperforms DistillBERT, CamemBERT, FlauBERT, and Transformer models on the same dataset but also achieves impressive results: an accuracy of 87\%, precision of 87\%, recall of 85\%, and F1-score of 86\%. While the MoE-Transformer does not surpass the performance of biomedical pre-trained BERT models, it can be trained at least 190 times faster, offering a viable alternative for settings with limited data and computational resources. Although the MoE-Transformer addresses challenges of generalization gaps and sharp minima, demonstrating some limitations for efficient and accurate clinical text classification, this model still represents a significant advancement in the field. It is particularly valuable for classifying small French clinical narratives within the privacy and constraints of hospital-based computational resources.</description>

Abstract: Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) is a novel technology which enables the full-space coverage. In this letter, a multi STAR-RIS-aided system using non-orthogonal multiple access in an uplink transmission is considered, where the multi-order reflections among multiple STAR-RISs assist the transmission from the single-antenna users to the multi-antenna base station. Specifically, the total sum rate maximization problem is solved by jointly optimizing the active beamforming, power allocation, transmission and reflection beamforming at the STAR-RIS, and user-STAR-RIS assignment. To solve the non-convex optimization problem, a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed which integrates meta-learning and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), denoted by Meta-DDPG. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed Meta-DDPG algorithm outperforms the conventional DDPG algorithm with $53\%$ improvement, while multi-order reflections among multi STAR-RISs yields to $14.1\%$ enhancement in the total data rate.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Wireless Channel Estimation Model for Environment Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07385</link>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel and efficient wireless channel estimation scheme based on a tapped delay line (TDL) model of wireless signal propagation, where a data-driven machine learning approach is used to estimate the path delays and gains. The key motivation for our novel channel estimation model is to gain environment awareness, i.e., detecting changes in path delays and gains related to interesting objects and events in the field. The estimated channel state provides a more detailed measure to sense the field than the single-tap channel state indicator (CSI) in current OFDM systems. Advantages of this approach also include low computation time and training data requirements, making it suitable for environment awareness applications.
  We evaluate this model's performance using Matlab's ray-tracing tool under static and dynamic conditions for increased realism instead of the standard evaluation approaches that rely on classical statistical channel models. Our results show that our TDL-based model can accurately estimate the path delays and associated gains for a broad-range of locations and operating conditions. Root-mean-square estimation error was less than $10^{-4}$, or $-40$dB, for SNR $\geq 60$dB in all of our experiments. Our results show that interference of a flying drone on signal multipaths, in a preliminary experiment, can be detected in estimated channel states which, otherwise, remains obscured in conventional CSI.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Channel Modeling for Electromagnetic Information Theory</title>

Abstract: Electromagnetic information theory (EIT) is one of the emerging topics for 6G communication due to its potential to reveal the performance limit of wireless communication systems. For EIT, the research foundation is reasonable and accurate channel modeling. Existing channel modeling works for EIT in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenario focus on far-field modeling, which can not accurately capture the characteristics of the channel in near-field. In this paper, we propose the near-field channel model for EIT based on electromagnetic scattering theory. We model the channel by using non-stationary Gaussian random fields and derive the analytical expression of the correlation function of the fields. Furthermore, we analyze the characteristics of the proposed channel model, e.g., channel degrees of freedom (DoF). Finally, we design a channel estimation scheme for near-field scenario by integrating the electromagnetic prior information of the proposed model. Numerical analysis verifies the correctness of the proposed scheme and shows that it can outperform existing schemes like least square (LS) and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP).</description>

      <title>R2D2 image reconstruction with model uncertainty quantification in radio astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ``Residual-to-Residual DNN series for high-Dynamic range imaging'' (R2D2) approach was recently introduced for Radio-Interferometric (RI) imaging in astronomy. R2D2's reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images, iteratively estimated as outputs of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) taking the previous iteration's image estimate and associated data residual as inputs. In this work, we investigate the robustness of the R2D2 image estimation process, by studying the uncertainty associated with its series of learned models. Adopting an ensemble averaging approach, multiple series can be trained, arising from different random DNN initializations of the training process at each iteration. The resulting multiple R2D2 instances can also be leveraged to generate ``R2D2 samples'', from which empirical mean and standard deviation endow the algorithm with a joint estimation and uncertainty quantification functionality. Focusing on RI imaging, and adopting a telescope-specific approach, multiple R2D2 instances were trained to encompass the most general observation setting of the Very Large Array (VLA). Simulations and real-data experiments confirm that: (i) R2D2's image estimation capability is superior to that of the state-of-the-art algorithms; (ii) its ultra-fast reconstruction capability (arising from series with only few DNNs) makes the computation of multiple reconstruction samples and of uncertainty maps practical even at large image dimension; (iii) it is characterized by a very low model uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Sensing and Communication for ISAC Networks: Performance Analysis and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks intending to effectively balance sensing and communication (S&amp;C) performance at the network level. Through the simultaneous utilization of multi-point (CoMP) coordinated joint transmission and distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar techniques, we propose a cooperative networked ISAC scheme to enhance both S&amp;C services. Then, the tool of stochastic geometry is exploited to capture the S&amp;C performance, which allows us to illuminate key cooperative dependencies in the ISAC network. Remarkably, the derived expression of the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the localization accuracy unveils a significant finding: Deploying $N$ ISAC transceivers yields an enhanced sensing performance across the entire network, in accordance with the $\ln^2N$ scaling law. Simulation results demonstrate that compared to the time-sharing scheme, the proposed cooperative ISAC scheme can effectively improve the average data rate and reduce the CRLB.</description>

      <title>Cooperative ISAC Networks: Performance Analysis, Scaling Laws and Optimization</title>

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks are investigated with the objective of effectively balancing the sensing and communication (S&amp;C) performance at the network level. Through the simultaneous utilization of multi-point (CoMP) coordinated joint transmission and distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar techniques, we propose an innovative networked ISAC scheme, where multiple transceivers are employed for collaboratively enhancing the S&amp;C services. Then, the potent tool of stochastic geometry is exploited for characterizing the S&amp;C performance, which allows us to illuminate the key cooperative dependencies in the ISAC network and optimize salient network-level parameters. Remarkably, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) expression of the localization accuracy derived unveils a significant finding: Deploying N ISAC transceivers yields an enhanced average cooperative sensing performance across the entire network, in accordance with the ln^2N scaling law. Crucially, this scaling law is less pronounced in comparison to the performance enhancement of N^2 achieved when the transceivers are equidistant from the target, which is primarily due to the substantial path loss from the distant base stations (BSs) and leads to reduced contributions to sensing performance gain. Moreover, we derive a tight expression of the communication rate, and present a low-complexity algorithm to determine the optimal cooperative cluster size. Based on our expression derived for the S&amp;C performance, we formulate the optimization problem of maximizing the network performance in terms of two joint S&amp;C metrics. To this end, we jointly optimize the cooperative BS cluster sizes and the transmit power to strike a flexible tradeoff between the S&amp;C performance.</description>

      <title>Array SAR 3D Sparse Imaging Based on Regularization by Denoising Under Few Observed Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Array synthetic aperture radar (SAR) three-dimensional (3D) imaging can obtain 3D information of the target region, which is widely used in environmental monitoring and scattering information measurement. In recent years, with the development of compressed sensing (CS) theory, sparse signal processing is used in array SAR 3D imaging. Compared with matched filter (MF), sparse SAR imaging can effectively improve image quality. However, sparse imaging based on handcrafted regularization functions suffers from target information loss in few observed SAR data. Therefore, in this article, a general 3D sparse imaging framework based on Regulation by Denoising (RED) and proximal gradient descent type method for array SAR is presented. Firstly, we construct explicit prior terms via state-of-the-art denoising operators instead of regularization functions, which can improve the accuracy of sparse reconstruction and preserve the structure information of the target. Then, different proximal gradient descent type methods are presented, including a generalized alternating projection (GAP) and an alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM), which is suitable for high-dimensional data processing. Additionally, the proposed method has robust convergence, which can achieve sparse reconstruction of 3D SAR in few observed SAR data. Extensive simulations and real data experiments are conducted to analyze the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method has superior sparse reconstruction performance.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Information Theory for Holographic MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10496v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) utilizes a compact antenna array to form a nearly continuous aperture, thereby enhancing higher capacity and more flexible configurations compared with conventional MIMO systems, making it attractive in current scientific research. Key questions naturally arise regarding the potential of HMIMO to surpass Shannon's theoretical limits and how far its capabilities can be extended. However, the traditional Shannon information theory falls short in addressing these inquiries because it only focuses on the information itself while neglecting the underlying carrier, electromagnetic (EM) waves, and environmental interactions. To fill up the gap between the theoretical analysis and the practical application for HMIMO systems, we introduce electromagnetic information theory (EIT) in this paper. This paper begins by laying the foundation for HMIMO-oriented EIT, encompassing EM wave equations and communication regions. In the context of HMIMO systems, the resultant physical limitations are presented, involving Chu's limit, Harrington's limit, Hannan's limit, and the evaluation of coupling effects. Field sampling and HMIMO-assisted oversampling are also discussed to guide the optimal HMIMO design within the EIT framework. To comprehensively depict the EM-compliant propagation process, we present the approximate and exact channel modeling approaches in near-/far-field zones. Furthermore, we discuss both traditional Shannon's information theory, employing the probabilistic method, and Kolmogorov information theory, utilizing the functional analysis, for HMIMO-oriented EIT systems.</description>

      <title>Wav-KAN: Wavelet Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Wav-KAN, an innovative neural network architecture that leverages the Wavelet Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (Wav-KAN) framework to enhance interpretability and performance. Traditional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and even recent advancements like Spl-KAN face challenges related to interpretability, training speed, robustness, computational efficiency, and performance. Wav-KAN addresses these limitations by incorporating wavelet functions into the Kolmogorov-Arnold network structure, enabling the network to capture both high-frequency and low-frequency components of the input data efficiently. Wavelet-based approximations employ orthogonal or semi-orthogonal basis and maintain a balance between accurately representing the underlying data structure and avoiding overfitting to the noise. While continuous wavelet transform (CWT) has a lot of potentials, we also employed discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for multiresolution analysis, which obviated the need for recalculation of the previous steps in finding the details. Analogous to how water conforms to the shape of its container, Wav-KAN adapts to the data structure, resulting in enhanced accuracy, faster training speeds, and increased robustness compared to Spl-KAN and MLPs. Our results highlight the potential of Wav-KAN as a powerful tool for developing interpretable and high-performance neural networks, with applications spanning various fields. This work sets the stage for further exploration and implementation of Wav-KAN in frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, aiming to make wavelets in KAN as widespread as activation functions like ReLU and sigmoid in universal approximation theory (UAT). The codes to replicate the simulations are available at https://github.com/zavareh1/Wav-KAN.</description>
