      <title>Machine Learning Practitioners' Views on Data Quality in Light of EU Regulatory Requirements: A European Online Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how data quality aligns with regulatory requirements in machine learning (ML) systems presents a critical challenge for practitioners navigating the evolving EU regulatory landscape. To address this, we first propose a practical framework aligning established data quality dimensions with specific EU regulatory requirements. Second, we conducted a comprehensive online survey with over 180 EU-based data practitioners, investigating their approaches, key challenges, and unmet needs when ensuring data quality in ML systems that align with regulatory requirements. Our findings highlight crucial gaps between current practices and regulatory expectations, underscoring practitioners' need for more integrated data quality tools and better collaboration between technical and legal practitioners. These insights inform recommendations for bridging technical expertise and regulatory compliance, ultimately fostering responsible and trustworthy ML deployments.</description>

      <title>Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search Cost Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid queries combining high-dimensional vector similarity with structured attribute filtering have garnered significant attention across both academia and industry. A critical instance of this paradigm is filtered Approximate k Nearest Neighbor (AKNN) search, where embeddings (e.g., image or text) are queried alongside constraints such as labels or numerical range. While essential for rich retrieval, optimizing these queries remains challenging due to the highly variable search cost induced by combined filters. In this paper, we propose a novel cost estimation framework, E2E, for filtered AKNN search and demonstrate its utility in downstream optimization tasks, specifically early termination. Unlike existing approaches, our model explicitly captures the correlation between the query vector distribution and attribute-value selectivity, yielding significantly higher estimation accuracy. By leveraging these estimates to refine search termination conditions, we achieve substantial performance gains. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach improves retrieval efficiency by 2x-3x over state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining high search accuracy.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneity in Entity Matching: A Survey and Experimental Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entity matching (EM) is a fundamental task in data integration and analytics, essential for identifying records that refer to the same real-world entity across diverse sources. In practice, datasets often differ widely in structure, format, schema, and semantics, creating substantial challenges for EM. We refer to this setting as Heterogeneous EM (HEM). This survey offers a unified perspective on HEM by introducing a taxonomy, grounded in prior work, that distinguishes two primary categories -- representation and semantic heterogeneity -- and their subtypes. The taxonomy provides a systematic lens for understanding how variations in data form and meaning shape the complexity of matching tasks. We then connect this framework to the FAIR principles -- Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability -- demonstrating how they both reveal the challenges of HEM and suggest strategies for mitigating them. Building on this foundation, we critically review recent EM methods, examining their ability to address different heterogeneity types, and conduct targeted experiments on state-of-the-art models to evaluate their robustness and adaptability under semantic heterogeneity. Our analysis uncovers persistent limitations in current approaches and points to promising directions for future research, including multimodal matching, human-in-the-loop workflows, deeper integration with large language models and knowledge graphs, and fairness-aware evaluation in heterogeneous settings.</description>

      <title>The Stretto Execution Engine for LLM-Augmented Data Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLM-augmented data systems enable semantic querying over structured and unstructured data, but executing queries with LLM-powered operators introduces a fundamental runtime-accuracy trade-off. In this paper, we present Stretto, a new execution engine that provides end-to-end query guarantees while efficiently navigating this trade-off in a holistic manner. For this, Stretto formulates query planning as a constrained optimization problem and uses a gradient-based optimizer to jointly select operator implementations and allocate error budgets across pipelines. Moreover, to enable fine-grained execution choices, Stretto introduces a novel idea on how KV-caching can be used to realize a spectrum of different physical operators that transform a sparse design space into a dense continuum of runtime-accuracy trade-offs. Experiments show that Stretto outperforms state-of-the-art systems while consistently meeting quality guarantees.</description>
