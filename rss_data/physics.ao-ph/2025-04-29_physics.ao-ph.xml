      <title>Compound event metrics detect and explain ten-fold increase of extreme heat over Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weather and climate extremes such as heatwaves are crucial climate hazards to people and ecosystems worldwide. In any region, climate change may alter their characteristics in complex ways so that rigorous and holistic quantification of the extremity of such events remains a challenge, impeding also uses by impact, attribution, and litigation communities. Here we introduce a new class of threshold-exceedance-amount metrics that track changes in event frequency, duration, magnitude, area, and timing aspects like daily exposure and seasonal shift -- separately and up to compound total extremity (TEX). Applying them to extreme heat and showing their utility, at local- to country-scale (example Austria) and across European land regions, we revealed TEX amplifications of ~10 [4 to 25] (Europe 45-55{\deg}N) and ~8 [6 to 20] (Austria) for 2008-2022 vs. 1961-1990, strongly emerged from natural variability and an unequivocal evidence of anthropogenic climate change. Given their fundamental capacity to reliably track any threshold-defined climate hazard at any location, the new metrics enable a myriad of uses, from improving impact quantifications to climate action.</description>

      <title>Global Climate Model Bias Correction Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change affects ocean temperature, salinity and sea level, impacting monsoons and ocean productivity. Future projections by Global Climate Models based on shared socioeconomic pathways from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) are widely used to understand the effects of climate change. However, CMIP models have significant bias compared to reanalysis in the Bay of Bengal for the time period when both projections and reanalysis are available. For example, there is a 1.5C root mean square error (RMSE) in the sea surface temperature (SST) projections of the climate model CNRM-CM6 compared to the Ocean Reanalysis System (ORAS5). We develop a suite of data-driven deep learning models for bias correction of climate model projections and apply it to correct SST projections of the Bay of Bengal. We propose the use of three different deep neural network architectures: convolutional encoder-decoder UNet, Bidirectional LSTM and ConvLSTM. We also use a baseline linear regression model and the Equi-Distant Cumulative Density Function (EDCDF) bias correction method for comparison and evaluating the impact of the new deep learning models. All bias correction models are trained using pairs of monthly CMIP6 projections and the corresponding month's ORAS5 as input and output. Historical data (1950-2014) and future projection data (2015-2020) of CNRM-CM6 are used for training and validation, including hyperparameter tuning. Testing is performed on future projection data from 2021 to 2024. Detailed analysis of the three deep neural models has been completed. We found that the UNet architecture trained using a climatology-removed CNRM-CM6 projection as input and climatology-removed ORAS5 as output gives the best bias-corrected projections. Our novel deep learning-based method for correcting CNRM-CM6 data has a 15% reduction in RMSE compared EDCDF.</description>

      <title>BiXiao: An AI-Based Atmospheric Environment Forecasting Model Using Discontinuous Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, the technique of numerical model-based atmospheric environment forecasting has becoming mature, yet traditional numerical prediction methods struggle to balance computational costs and forecast accuracy, facing developmental bottlenecks. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) offer new solutions for weather prediction. However, most existing AI models do not have atmospheric environmental forecasting capabilities, while those with related functionalities remain constrained by grid-dependent data requirements, thus unable to deliver operationally feasible city-scale atmospheric environment forecasts. Here we introduce 'BiXiao', a novel discontinuous-grid AI model for atmospheric environment forecasting. 'BiXiao' couples meteorological and environmental sub-models to generate predictions using site-specific observational data, completing 72-hour forecasts for six major pollutants across all key cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region within 30 seconds. In the comparative experiments, the 'BiXiao' model outperforms mainstream numerical models in both computational efficiency and forecast accuracy. It surpasses CAMS with respect of operational 72-hour forecasting and exceeds WRF-Chem's performance in heavy pollution case predictions. The 'BiXiao' shows potential for nationwide application, providing innovative technical support and new perspectives for China's atmospheric environment forecasting operations.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Potential of Latent Embeddings for Sea Ice Characterization using ICESat-2 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ice, Cloud, and Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) provides high-resolution measurements of sea ice height. Recent studies have developed machine learning methods on ICESat-2 data, primarily focusing on surface type classification. However, the heavy reliance on manually collected labels requires significant time and effort for supervised learning, as it involves cross-referencing track measurements with overlapping background optical imagery. Additionally, the coincidence of ICESat-2 tracks with background images is relatively rare due to the different overpass patterns and atmospheric conditions. To address these limitations, this study explores the potential of unsupervised autoencoder on unlabeled data to derive latent embeddings. We develop autoencoder models based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to reconstruct topographic sequences from ICESat-2 and derive embeddings. We then apply Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to reduce dimensions and visualize the embeddings. Our results show that embeddings from autoencoders preserve the overall structure but generate relatively more compact clusters compared to the original ICESat-2 data, indicating the potential of embeddings to lessen the number of required labels samples.</description>

      <title>Appa: Bending Weather Dynamics with Latent Diffusion Models for Global Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has transformed weather forecasting by improving both its accuracy and computational efficiency. However, before any forecast can begin, weather centers must identify the current atmospheric state from vast amounts of observational data. To address this challenging problem, we introduce Appa, a score-based data assimilation model producing global atmospheric trajectories at 0.25-degree resolution and 1-hour intervals. Powered by a 1.5B-parameter spatio-temporal latent diffusion model trained on ERA5 reanalysis data, Appa can be conditioned on any type of observations to infer the posterior distribution of plausible state trajectories, without retraining. Our unified probabilistic framework flexibly tackles multiple inference tasks -- reanalysis, filtering, and forecasting -- using the same model, eliminating the need for task-specific architectures or training procedures. Experiments demonstrate physical consistency on a global scale and good reconstructions from observations, while showing competitive forecasting skills. Our results establish latent score-based data assimilation as a promising foundation for future global atmospheric modeling systems.</description>

      <title>The Boundary Layer Dispersion and Footprint Model: A fast numerical solver of the Eulerian steady-state advection-diffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how greenhouse gases and pollutants move through the atmosphere is essential for predicting and mitigating their effects. We present a novel atmospheric dispersion and footprint model: the Boundary Layer Dispersion and Footprint Model (BLDFM), which solves the three-dimensional steady-state advection-diffusion equation in Eulerian form using a numerical approach based on the Fourier method, the linear shooting method and the exponential integrator method. The model is designed to be flexible and can be used for a wide range of applications, including climate impact studies, industrial emissions monitoring, agricultural planning and spatial flux attribution. We validate the model using an analytical test case. The numerical results show excellent agreement with the analytical solution. We also compare the model with the Kormann and Meixner (Boundary-Layer Meteorology, 2001) footprint model (FKM), and the results show overall good agreement but some differences in the fetch of the footprints, which are attributed to the neglect of streamwise turbulent mixing in the FKM model. Our results demonstrate the potential of the BLDFM model as a useful tool for atmospheric scientists, biogeochemists, ecologists, and engineers.</description>

      <title>ClimaEmpact: Domain-Aligned Small Language Models and Datasets for Extreme Weather Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate assessments of extreme weather events are vital for research and policy, yet localized and granular data remain scarce in many parts of the world. This data gap limits our ability to analyze potential outcomes and implications of extreme weather events, hindering effective decision-making. Large Language Models (LLMs) can process vast amounts of unstructured text data, extract meaningful insights, and generate detailed assessments by synthesizing information from multiple sources. Furthermore, LLMs can seamlessly transfer their general language understanding to smaller models, enabling these models to retain key knowledge while being fine-tuned for specific tasks. In this paper, we propose Extreme Weather Reasoning-Aware Alignment (EWRA), a method that enhances small language models (SLMs) by incorporating structured reasoning paths derived from LLMs, and ExtremeWeatherNews, a large dataset of extreme weather event-related news articles. EWRA and ExtremeWeatherNews together form the overall framework, ClimaEmpact, that focuses on addressing three critical extreme-weather tasks: categorization of tangible vulnerabilities/impacts, topic labeling, and emotion analysis. By aligning SLMs with advanced reasoning strategies on ExtremeWeatherNews (and its derived dataset ExtremeAlign used specifically for SLM alignment), EWRA improves the SLMs' ability to generate well-grounded and domain-specific responses for extreme weather analytics. Our results show that the approach proposed guides SLMs to output domain-aligned responses, surpassing the performance of task-specific models and offering enhanced real-world applicability for extreme weather analytics.</description>

      <title>Wave Energy Is Conserved in a Spatially Varying and Inhomogeneously Moving Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Waves are propagating disturbances that redistribute energy across space. Previous studies have shown that for waves propagating through an inhomogeneously moving mean flow, the conserved quantity is wave action rather than wave energy, raising questions about the validity of energy conservation, which is one of the foundational principles of physics. In this study, we prove that wave action conservation is, in fact, an apparent form of wave energy conservation in spatially varying and inhomogeneously moving media, where waves undergo deformation during propagation. We further show that wave action conservation can be derived directly from the law of energy conservation. This result holds universally across all isolated wave systems in varying media, including hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic waves.</description>

      <title>Relative Spectral Response Function Retrieval of Hyperspectral Instruments in Atmospheric Spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, tens of satellites carry hyperspectral spectrometers. Such instruments allow decomposing the light that exits the atmosphere from its top into hundreds to thousands of contiguous spectral channels. By analysis of the light spectral distribution, and in particular the depths of selected absorption lines, researchers and meteorological agencies can retrieve the atmosphere composition and thermodynamic state. To get a global view of the Earth, several instruments are generally operated synergistically, therefore, a harmonized calibration must be achieved between them.
  To cross-calibrate two spectrometers, a common practice is to analyze an ensemble of collocated measurements, meaning acquisitions performed at the same time and under the same geometry. Nonetheless, such analysis always faces the issue of setting appropriate temporal and geometric thresholds in defining the collocations, trading off between statistics and quality. Consequently, some collocation mismatches may have a substantial impact on the cross-calibration results. Thus, the following manuscript describes in detail the inclusion of collocation errors into the mathematical description and presents an application which is designed on purpose to be robust to such errors.
  Then, the knowledge of the spectral sensitivities of each channel to the incoming light, called the spectral response functions (SRF), are key to the exploitation of the acquisitions. In that context, the authors have studied and designed a novel methodology to retrieve relative SRF between two or more spectrometers, within a single instrument or between instruments embarked on different platforms. The objective of the methodology is to characterize discrepancies of responses between flying spectrometers, track long-term evolutions and harmonize their responses with post-processing when necessary.</description>

      <title>Mj\"olnir: A Deep Learning Parametrization Framework for Global Lightning Flash Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in AI-based weather forecasting models, such as FourCastNet, Pangu-Weather, and GraphCast, have demonstrated the remarkable ability of deep learning to emulate complex atmospheric dynamics. Building on this momentum, we propose Mj\"olnir, a novel deep learning-based framework for global lightning flash density parameterization. Trained on ERA5 atmospheric predictors and World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) observations at a daily temporal resolution and 1 degree spatial resolution, Mj\"olnir captures the nonlinear mapping between large-scale environmental conditions and lightning activity. The model architecture is based on the InceptionNeXt backbone with SENet, and a multi-task learning strategy to simultaneously predict lightning occurrence and magnitude. Extensive evaluations yield that Mollnir accurately reproduces the global distribution, seasonal variability, and regional characteristics of lightning activity, achieving a global Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.96 for annual mean fields. These results suggest that Mj\"olnir serves not only as an effective data-driven global lightning parameterization but also as a promising AI-based scheme for next-generation Earth system models (AI-ESMs).</description>

      <title>Lightning activity on a tidally locked terrestrial exoplanet in storm-resolving simulations for a range of surface pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cloudy atmospheres produce electric discharges, including lightning. Lightning, in turn, provides sufficient energy to break down air molecules into reactive species and thereby affects the atmospheric composition. The climate of tidally locked rocky exoplanets orbiting M-dwarf stars may have intense and highly localised thunderstorm activity associated with moist convection on their day side. The distribution and structure of lightning-producing convective clouds is shaped by various climate parameters, of which a key one is atmospheric mass, i.e. surface air pressure. In this study, we use a global storm-resolving climate model to predict thunderstorm occurrence for a tidally locked exoplanet over a range of surface pressures. We compare two lightning parameterisations: one based on ice cloud microphysics and one based on the vertical extent of convective clouds. We find that both parameterisations predict that the amount of lightning monotonically decreases with surface pressure due to weaker convection and fewer ice clouds. The spatial distribution of lightning on the planet changes with respect to the surface pressure, responding to the changes in the large-scale circulation and the vertical stratification of the atmosphere. Our study provides revised, high-resolution estimates for lightning activity on a tidally locked Earth-like exoplanet, with implications for global atmospheric chemistry.</description>

      <title>Boundary crisis and long transients of the Atlantic overturning circulation mediated by an edge state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), a large-scale ocean current and vital climate component, could transition to a substantially weakened flow state. Despite severe associated impacts, it remains difficult to reliably estimate the proximity to potential critical thresholds and predict the AMOC's fate under global warming. To advance our understanding of Earth system stability, a global view on the dynamics is needed beyond the local stability analysis underlying, e.g., standard early warning signs. Here we explore the phase space of an intermediate-complexity climate model featuring a metastable AMOC. For two atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) levels, we explicitly compute the edge state (also called Melancholia state), a chaotic saddle embedded in the basin boundary that separates the strong and weak AMOC attractors found in the model. While being unstable, the edge state can govern the transient climate for centuries. Its dynamics exhibits strong centennial AMOC oscillations driven by atmosphere-ice-ocean interactions in the North Atlantic. We demonstrate that at CO$_2$ levels projected to be reached in the next decades, the simulated AMOC undergoes a boundary crisis where the current AMOC attractor collides with the edge state. Near but beyond the crisis, long chaotic transients occur due to a resulting ghost state, causing a splitting of ensemble trajectories under time-dependent forcing. Rooted in dynamical systems theory, our results offer an interpretation of large ensemble variances and a so-called stochastic bifurcation observed in earth system models under intermediate forcing scenarios.</description>

      <title>DIRESA, a distance-preserving nonlinear dimension reduction technique based on regularized autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In meteorology, finding similar weather patterns or analogs in historical datasets can be useful for data assimilation, forecasting, and postprocessing. In climate science, analogs in historical and climate projection data are used for attribution and impact studies. However, most of the time, those large weather and climate datasets are nearline. This means that they must be downloaded, which takes a lot of bandwidth and disk space, before the computationally expensive search can be executed. We propose a dimension reduction technique based on autoencoder (AE) neural networks to compress the datasets and perform the search in an interpretable, compressed latent space. A distance-regularized Siamese twin autoencoder (DIRESA) architecture is designed to preserve distance in latent space while capturing the nonlinearities in the datasets. Using conceptual climate models of different complexities, we show that the latent components thus obtained provide physical insight into the dominant modes of variability in the system. Compressing datasets with DIRESA reduces the online storage and keeps the latent components uncorrelated, while the distance (ordering) preservation and reconstruction fidelity robustly outperform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and other dimension reduction techniques such as UMAP or variational autoencoders.</description>

Abstract: We propose a combination of machine learning and flux limiting for property-preserving subgrid scale modeling in the context of flux-limited finite volume methods for the one-dimensional shallow-water equations. The numerical fluxes of a conservative target scheme are fitted to the coarse-mesh averages of a monotone fine-grid discretization using a neural network to parametrize the subgrid scale components. To ensure positivity preservation and the validity of local maximum principles, we use a flux limiter that constrains the intermediate states of an equivalent fluctuation form to stay in a convex admissible set. The results of our numerical studies confirm that the proposed combination of machine learning with monolithic convex limiting produces meaningful closures even in scenarios for which the network was not trained.</description>

      <title>Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm and Quantum-enhanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo: A Hybrid Approach to Data Assimilation in 4DVAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel hybrid quantum-classical framework that integrates the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and Quantum-enhanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo (QMCMC) with variational particle filters to tackle the computational challenges in Four-Dimensional Variational Data Assimilation (4DVAR). 4DVAR, widely used in numerical weather prediction, suffers from inefficiencies in high-dimensional, non-linear systems. Our approach, the Quantum Variational Particle Filter (QVPF), uses QAOA to optimize particle proposals and QMCMC to efficiently compute particle weights and resample, accelerating convergence while reducing the computational load.
  The QVPF framework addresses the curse of dimensionality by minimizing the number of particles required for accurate state estimation, thus improving efficiency in systems with complex dynamics. The hybrid model offers enhanced accuracy by integrating quantum algorithms into the variational particle filter, making it particularly suited for applications in climate modeling, space weather prediction, and defense. The potential for achieving unprecedented resolution in predictive models could transform sectors that rely on high-resolution forecasting.
  We present the mathematical foundations of the approach, along with discussions on algorithmic implementation and hardware requirements. Early results suggest that this hybrid framework could significantly improve data assimilation, with future implementations on near-term quantum devices offering a practical pathway for scaling up. This work demonstrates how quantum computing can address the growing need for more accurate and computationally feasible methods in large-scale data assimilation.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Deep-Learning Model for El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation in the Low-Data Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While deep-learning models have demonstrated skillful El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forecasts up to one year in advance, they are predominantly trained on climate model simulations that provide thousands of years of training data at the expense of introducing climate model biases. Simpler Linear Inverse Models (LIMs) trained on the much shorter observational record also make skillful ENSO predictions but do not capture predictable nonlinear processes. This motivates a hybrid approach, combining the LIMs modest data needs with a deep-learning non-Markovian correction of the LIM. For O(100 yr) datasets, our resulting Hybrid model is more skillful than the LIM while also exceeding the skill of a full deep-learning model. Additionally, while the most predictable ENSO events are still identified in advance by the LIM, they are better predicted by the Hybrid model, especially in the western tropical Pacific for leads beyond about 9 months, by capturing the subsequent asymmetric (warm versus cold phases) evolution of ENSO.</description>
