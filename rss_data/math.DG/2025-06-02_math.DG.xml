      <title>Morita equivalence of shifted symplectic Lie n-groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symplectic structures on higher objects like Lie groupoids have been studied for some time now, but not all of the proposed definitions are preserved under Morita equivalence of Lie groupoids, in turn giving rise to a consistent notion of symplectic stacks. Recently, this concept has been generalized to m-shifted symplectic forms on Lie n-groupoids, which are indeed preserved under Morita equivalence of Lie n-groupoids. In this paper, we give a rigorous proof for this statement.</description>

      <title>Bernstein-type theorem for constant mean curvature surfaces in the isotropic 3-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are many non-trivial entire spacelike graphs with constant mean curvature $H$ (CMC $H$, for short) in the isotropic 3-space $\mathbb{I}^3$. In this paper, we show a value distribution theorem of Gaussian curvature of complete spacelike constant mean curvature surfaces in $\mathbb{I}^3$, which implies a Bernstein-type theorem for CMC $H$ graphs in $\mathbb{I}^3$.</description>

      <title>Conformally compact metrics and the Lovelock tensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study conformally compact metrics satisfying the Lovelock equations, which generalize the Einstein equation. We show that these metrics admit polyhomogeneous expansions, thereby naturally realizing the Fefferman-Graham expansion, which is an important tool in conformal geometry and the AdS/CFT correspondence. In even dimensions, we identify a boundary obstruction to smoothness near the boundary that generalizes the ambient obstruction tensor in the Einstein setting. Under appropriate regularity and curvature conditions, we also construct a formal solution to the singular Yamabe-(2q) problem and provide an index obstruction for the conformally compact Lovelock filling problem of spin manifolds.</description>

      <title>Some Characteristics of Almost $\omega$-Bach Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce $\omega$-Bach tensor corresponding to one form $\omega$ and correspondingly introduce almost $\omega$-Bach solitons, thereby generalizing the existing notion of Bach tensor and almost Bach solitons. We characterize almost $\omega$-Bach solitons, when the potential vector field of the soliton generates an infinitesimal harmonic transformation or is an affine conformal vector field, or is a projective vector field or is a Killing vector field, when the $\omega$-Bach tensor is divergence free, or is a harmonic $1$ form or is a Killing $1$-form. We generalize some of the results obtained by P. T. Ho and A. Ghosh. One of the main results of this paper is that we explicitly find some of the gradient almost $\omega$-Bach solitons on the product manifolds ${\mathbb S}^2\times{\mathbb H}^2$, $\mathbb{R}^2\times{\mathbb H}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^2\times{\mathbb S}^2$. Our gradient almost $\omega$-Bach solitons generalize the almost Bach solitons on $\mathbb{R}^2\times{\mathbb H}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^2\times{\mathbb S}^2$ found by P. T. Ho. Moreover, finding of our gradient almost $\omega$-Bach solitons on ${\mathbb S}^2\times{\mathbb H}^2$ is a novel one and complements to the existing almost Bach solitons described by P. T. Ho.</description>

      <title>Finsler and sub-Finsler geodesics with chattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide examples of Finsler and sub-Finsler manifolds whose geodesics exhibit chattering, that is, a countable number of switches over an arbitrarily small time interval. We also present an explicit left-invariant structure on a Carnot group whose geodesics exhibit chattering. This provides a negative answer to Le Donne's question. Furthermore, the paper presents a sufficient condition for normal Pontryagin maximum principle extremals in (sub-)Finsler problems to exhibit chattering.</description>

      <title>The Minkowski problem for the $k$-torsional rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: P. Salani [Adv. Math., 229 (2012)] introduced the $k$-torsional rigidity associated with a $k$-Hessian equation and obtained the Brunn-Minkowski inequalities $w.r.t.$ the torsional rigidity in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Following this work, we first construct, in the present paper, a Hadamard variational formula for the $k$-torsional rigidity with $1\leq k\leq n-1$, then we can deduce a $k$-torsional measure from the Hadamard variational formula. Based on the $k$-torsional measure, we propose the Minkowski problem for the $k$-torsional rigidity and confirm the existence of its smooth non-even solutions by the method of a curvature flow. Specially, in the lower bound of $C^0$ estimation for the solution to the curvature flow, we've cleverly constructed a monotonic functional along the curvature flow to evade the mandatory conditions imposed on the density function $f$ by the classical argument.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of holomorphic curves and complex surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the geometry of holomorphic curves and complex surfaces from the perspective of singularity theory. We show that, with a suitable choice of a complex bilinear symmetric form, the families of functions and mappings that measure the contact between curves or surfaces and model objects become holomorphic. This allows the application of singularity theory, yielding analogues of classical results from the real case. Our approach enables the definition of geometric invariants of curves, which we call the $C$-curvature and $C$-torsion, as well as surface invariants such as the $C$-principal curvature and $C$-Gaussian curvature. It also gives geometric meaning to the complexification of of the families measuring contact of analytic surfaces in $\mathbb R^3$ with lines, planes and spheres.</description>

      <title>Branched $\alpha$-combinatorial Ricci flows on closed surfaces with Euler characteristic $\chi\le 0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates branched $\alpha$-flows on weighted triangulated closed surfaces with Euler characteristic \(\chi \leq 0\), focusing on establishing their connections with topological (combinatorial) and geometric structures. In Euclidean (\(\mathbb{E}^2\)) and hyperbolic (\(\mathbb{H}^2\)) geometries, we define branched $\alpha$-curvatures and corresponding branched $\alpha$-flows. By introducing branched $\alpha$-potentials, we prove the existence and uniqueness of constant branched $\alpha$-metrics through topological conditions, avoiding reliance on flow convergence. Key results include: 1. Exponential convergence of branched $\alpha$-flows to constant branched $\alpha$-metrics in both geometries. 2. Strict convexity of branched $\alpha$-potentials, ensuring unique critical points that correspond to constant curvatures. 3. Extension to prescribing-curvature problems via modified $\alpha$-flows, establishing admissibility conditions for prescribed curvatures and their exponential convergence to target metrics. These findings bridge discrete circle packing metrics with smooth geometric invariants, providing a unified framework for studying curvature flows on surfaces with branch structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1812.11199v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze a new geometric structure on topological surfaces generalizing the complex structure. To define this so called higher complex structure we use the punctual Hilbert scheme of the plane. The moduli space of higher complex structures is defined and is shown to be a generalization of the classical Teichm\"uller space. We give arguments for the conjectural isomorphism between the moduli space of higher complex structures and Hitchin's component.</description>

      <title>The Gauss formulas for Laplacians on submanifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are several types of Laplacians of a vector field on a Riemannian manifold. These include the Bochner and the Hodge Laplacian. The Gauss formula for the Levi-Civita connection relates the extrinsic connection to the intrinsic connection. We extend the Gauss formula for the connection to formulas for the different types of Laplacians of a vector field on a submanifold of any codimension $k\geq 1$. In the process, we derive a Gauss formula for the Ricci operator, formulas for the divergence of the second fundamental form, and a formula for the Laplacian of a $1$-form on a surface of revolution in terms of the Lie derivatives. The formulas have applications to the study of the formulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on a Riemannian manifold.</description>

      <title>Classification of almost abelian Lie groups admitting left-invariant complex or symplectic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify the almost abelian Lie algebras $\mathfrak g_A=\mathbb R e_0 \ltimes_A \mathbb R^{2n-1}$ admitting complex or symplectic structures. The matrix $A\in M(2n-1,\mathbb R )$ encodes the adjoint action of $e_0$ on the abelian ideal $\mathbb R^{2n-1}$, and the existence of complex or symplectic structures on $\mathfrak g_A$ imposes restrictions on the Jordan normal form of $A$. The classification essentially reduces to the case when $A$ is nilpotent, so we start by considering this case. It turns out that if $A$ is nilpotent and $\mathfrak g_A$ admits a complex structure, then $\mathfrak g_A$ necessarily admits a symplectic structure. This is not true in general when $A$ is non-nilpotent. Finally, several consequences of the classification theorems are obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18961v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an explicit description of the Fefferman metric for twistor CR manifolds in terms of Riemannian structures on the base conformal $3$-manifolds. As an application, we prove that chains and null chains on twistor CR manifolds project to conformal geodesics, and that any conformal geodesic has lifts both to a chain and a null chain. By using this correspondence, we give a variational characterization of conformal geodesics in dimension three which involves the total torsion functional.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an approach to Carrollian geometry using principal $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundles ($\mathbb{R}^\times := \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$) equipped with a degenerate metric whose kernel is the module of vertical vector fields. The constructions allow for non-trivial bundles and a large class of Carrollian manifolds can be analysed in this formalism. Alongside other results, we show that once an $\mathbb{R}^\times$-connection has been chosen, there is a canonical affine connection that is torsionless, but, in general, not compatible with the degenerate metric. The construction of an affine connection is intimately tied to a Kaluza-Klein geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.13215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eigenvalues of the Laplace-Beltrami operator and the integrals of products of eigenfunctions and holomorphic $s$-differentials satisfy certain consistency conditions on closed hyperbolic surfaces. These consistency conditions can be derived by using spectral decompositions to write quadruple overlap integrals in terms of triple overlap integrals in different ways. We show how to efficiently construct these consistency conditions and use them to derive upper bounds on eigenvalues, following the approach of the conformal bootstrap. As an example of such a bootstrap bound, we find a numerical upper bound on the spectral gap of closed orientable hyperbolic surfaces that is nearly saturated by the Bolza surface.</description>

      <title>An Infinite Double Bubble Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical double bubble theorem characterizes the minimizing partitions of $\mathbb{R}^n$ into three chambers, two of which have prescribed finite volume. In this paper we prove a variant of the double bubble theorem in which two of the chambers have infinite volume. Such a configuration is an example of a (1,2)-cluster, or a partition of $\mathbb{R}^n$ into three chambers, two of which have infinite volume and only one of which has finite volume. A $(1,2)$-cluster is locally minimizing with respect to a family of weights $\{c_{jk}\}$ if for any $B_r(0)$, it minimizes the interfacial energy $\sum_{j&lt;k} c_{jk} \mathscr{H}^n(\partial \mathscr{X}(j) \cap \partial\mathscr{X}(k) \cap B_r(0))$ among all variations with compact support in $B_r(0)$ which preserve the volume of $\mathscr{X}(1)$. For $(1,2)$ clusters, the analogue of the weighted double bubble is the weighted lens cluster, and we show that it is locally minimizing. Furthermore, under a symmetry assumption on $\{c_{jk}\}$ that includes the case of equal weights, the weighted lens cluster is the unique local minimizer in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n\leq 7$, with the same uniqueness holding in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n\geq 8$ under a natural growth assumption. We also obtain a closure theorem for locally minimizing $(N,2)$-clusters.</description>

Abstract: Supervised dimensionality reduction aims to map labeled data to a low-dimensional feature space while maximizing class discriminability. Directly computing discriminability is often impractical, so an alternative approach is to learn features that maximize a distance or dissimilarity measure between classes. The Fisher-Rao distance is an important information geometry distance in statistical manifolds. It is induced by the Fisher information metric, a tool widely used for understanding neural representations. Despite its theoretical and pratical appeal, Fisher-Rao distances between classes have not been used as a maximization objective in supervised feature learning. Here, we present Supervised Quadratic Feature Analysis (SQFA), a linear dimensionality reduction method that maximizes Fisher-Rao distances between class distributions, by exploiting the information geometry of the symmetric positive definite manifold. SQFA maximizes distances using first- and second-order statistics, and its features allow for quadratic discriminability (i.e. QDA performance) matching or surpassing state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets. We theoretically motivate Fisher-Rao distances as a proxy for quadratic discriminability, and compare its performance to other popular distances (e.g. Wasserstein distances). SQFA provides a flexible state-of-the-art method for dimensionality reduction. Its successful use of Fisher-Rao distances between classes motivates future research directions.</description>
