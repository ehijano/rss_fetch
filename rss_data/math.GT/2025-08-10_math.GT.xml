      <title>A note on the singularity conjecture for infinite covolume discrete subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider random walks on semisimple Lie groups where the support of the step distribution generates (as a group) a Zariski dense discrete subgroup of infinite covolume. When the semisimple Lie group has property (T), we show that the stationary measure on the Furstenberg boundary is singular to the Lebesgue measure class. This result does not require any condition on the moment or symmetry of the step distribution. When the semisimple Lie group has rank one and the step distribution has a finite first moment, we again show that the stationary measure on the Furstenberg boundary is singular to the Lebesgue measure class. For general semisimple Lie groups, we also obtain a sufficient condition for the singularity of the stationary measure and a general Patterson-Sullivan measure.</description>

      <title>Slope detection, taut foliations, and the relative L-space conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $L$-space conjecture asserts the equivalence, for prime $3$-manifolds, of three properties: not being an $L$-space ($NLS$), having a left-orderable fundamental group ($LO$), and admitting a co-orientable taut foliation ($CTF$). In this paper we introduce a relative version of the $L$-space conjecture for knot manifolds $M$, stated in terms of sets of slopes on $\partial M$ characterised (i.e. detected) by Heegaard Floer homology, left-orders, and foliations, respectively. We give a unified characterisation of slope detection, and conjecture that the relative $L$-space conjecture is equivalent to the $L$-space conjecture for toroidal manifolds. We confirm this equivalence for the properties $CTF$ and $NLS$.
  Much of our technical work lies in proving that the set of $CTF$-detected slopes on $\partial M$ is a finite union of possibly degenerate closed intervals with rational endpoints; in particular, it is closed in the space of slopes. This involves generalizing results of Tao Li on laminar branched surfaces to the setting of manifolds with boundary.
  Within the slopes detected by co-orientable taut foliations, we identify a special subset, which we call exceptional $CTF$-detected slopes. This set includes $CTF$-detected slopes whose associated Dehn fillings don't admit co-orientable taut foliations. We believe this exceptional set is important to understand. In this article, we show that the set of exceptional slopes is finite. However, many questions remain open.
  Finally, in the last section of the article we provide a structured synthesis of previous work in the area.</description>

Abstract: We describe some topological structure in the set of all surfaces with finitely many singularities in the 3-sphere.
  As an application, we prove that every Riemannian 3-sphere of positive Ricci curvature contains, for every g, a genus g embedded minimal surface with area at most twice the first Simon-Smith width of the ambient 3-sphere.</description>

      <title>An index formula for families of end-periodic Dirac operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a transgression formula for the renormalized Chern character of the Bismut superconnection in the context of end-periodic fiber bundles and families of end-periodic Clifford modules. The transgression is expressed in terms of the Fourier-Laplace transform of the Bismut superconnection using the renormalized supertrace of Mrowka-Ruberman-Saveliev. Consequently, we establish an index formula for families of Dirac operators on end-periodic manifolds. The index formula involves a new ``end-periodic eta form'' which generalizes both the Bismut-Cheeger eta form and the end-periodic eta invariant of Mrowka-Ruberman-Saveliev.</description>

      <title>A refined twist on Hurwitz numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a two-parameter refinement of the Jucys-Murphy theory, that we call the CJT-refinement, unifying Schur, zonal, and, conjecturally, Jack actions of the ring of symmetric functions on the Fock space. Applications of this formalism include a partial resolution of a recent conjecture of Coulter-Do, as well as cut-and-join recursion for $b$-Hurwitz numbers. The cut-and-join equations enable the derivation of the tropicalization of $b$--Hurwitz numbers. We also provide a first application of this tropical interpretation by answering an open problem of Chapuy-Do{\l}\k{e}ga on the polynomial structure of $b$-Hurwitz numbers.</description>

      <title>Induced Minors, Asymptotic Dimension, and Baker's Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asymptotic dimension is a large-scale invariant of metric spaces that was introduced by Gromov (1993). We prove that every hereditary class of bounded-degree graphs that excludes some graph as a fat minor has asymptotic dimension at most $2$, which is optimal. This makes substantial progress on a question of Bonamy, Bousquet, Esperet, Groenland, Liu, Pirot, and Scott (J. Eur. Math. Soc. 2023).
  The key to our proof is a notion inspired by Baker's technique (J. ACM 1994). We say that a graph class $\mathcal{G}$ has bounded Baker-treewidth if there exists a function $f \colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that, for every graph $G\in \mathcal{G}$, there is a layering of $G$ such that the subgraph induced by the union of any $\ell$ consecutive layers has treewidth at most $f(\ell)$. We show that every class of bounded-degree graphs that excludes some graph as an induced minor has bounded Baker-treewidth. We discuss further applications of this result to clustered colouring and the design of linear-time approximate schemes.</description>

      <title>Light bulb smoothing for topological surfaces in 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new smoothing techniques for topologically embedded surfaces in smooth 4-manifolds, which give topological isotopy to a smooth surface. As applications, we prove "topological = smooth" results in dimension 4 for certain disks and spheres modulo isotopy. A key step in our approach is to link Quinn's smoothing theory with ideas in Gabai's 4-dimensional light bulb theorem and succeeding developments of Schneiderman-Teichner and Kosanovi\'c-Teichner. As another application of our smoothing technique, we obtain a topological version of the Dax invariant which gives topological isotopy obstructions for topological disks in 4-manifolds.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a diagrammatic approach to Rasmussen's $s$-invariant, based on Bar-Natan's reformulation of Khovanov homology for tangles and cobordisms. This method enables a local computation of $s$ from a tangle decomposition of a knot diagram. As an application, we compute the $s$-invariants of all 3-strand pretzel knots.</description>

      <title>Infinite Ideal Polyhedra in Hyperbolic 3-Space: Existence and Rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the seminal work [27], Rivin obtained a complete characterization of finite ideal polyhedra in hyperbolic 3-space by the exterior dihedral angles. Since then,the characterization of infinite hyperbolic polyhedra has become an extremely challenging open problem. By studying ideal circle patterns (ICPs), we characterize the infinite ideal polyhedra (IIP) and resolve this problem. Specifically, we establish the existence and rigidity of embedded ICPs on the plane. We further prove the uniformization theorem for the embedded ICPs, which solves the type problem of infinite ICPs. This is an analog of the uniformization theorem obtained by He and Schramm in [22, 23]. Moreover, we demonstrate that, unlike He-Schramm's work, the type theory for infinite ICPs depends not only on the structure of the cellular decomposition but also on the selection of intersection angles. In fact, we construct Example 4.13 to show the difference. Consequently, we obtain the existence and rigidity of IIP with prescribed exterior angles. Due to the example, our results on the type problem of infinite ICPs and the existence of IIP are sharp. For ICPs with arbitrary angles, our example also demonstrates that the VEL-parabolicity and ICP-parabolicity are not equivalent (while in He and Schramm's settings, VEL-parabolicity and CP-parabolicity are equivalent), indicating that our setting is extremely distinct from He and Schramm's. To prove our results, we develop a uniform Ring Lemma via the technique of pointed Gromov-Hausdorff convergence for ICPs.</description>

      <title>Degeneracy slopes, boundary slopes and exceptional surgery slopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an upper bound on the distance between a degeneracy slope for a very full essential lamination and a boundary slope of an essential surface embedded in a compact, orientable, irreducible, atoroidal 3-manifold with incompressible torus boundary. There are three applications: (i) We show that a degeneracy slope for a very full essential lamination in the exterior of a prime alternating knot is meridional. This gives an affirmative answer to part of a conjecture posed by Gabai and Kazez. (ii) We obtain two bounds on boundary slopes for a hyperbolic knot in an integral homology sphere, at least one of which always holds: one concerning the denominators of boundary slopes, and the other concerning the differences between boundary slopes. This generalizes a result on Montesinos knots obtained by the author and Mizushima. (iii) We obtain two bounds on exceptional surgery slopes for a hyperbolic knot in an integral homology sphere, at least one of which always holds: one concerning the denominators of such slopes, and the other concerning their range in terms of the genera of the knots. Both are actually conjectured by Gordon and Teragaito to always hold for hyperbolic knots in the 3-sphere.</description>

      <title>Wormhole Nucleation via Topological Surgery in Lorentzian Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a model for the nucleation of a wormhole within a Lorentzian spacetime by employing techniques from topological surgery and Morse theory. In our framework, a 0-surgery process describes the neighborhood of the nucleation point inside a compact region of spacetime, yielding a singular Lorentzian cobordism that connects two spacelike regions with different topologies. To avoid the singularity at the critical point of the Morse function, we employ the Misner trick of taking a connected sum with a closed 4-manifold -- namely $\mathbb{CP}^{2}$ -- to obtain an everywhere non-degenerate Lorentzian metric. This connected sum replaces the naked singularity with a region containing closed timelike curves. The obtained spacetime is non-singular, but violates all the standard energy conditions. Our construction thus shows that a wormhole can be "created" without singularities in classical general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel and systematic approach to computing the $(2n-1)$-form Chern-Simons potential given the Pontryagin density, i.e. the $n^{\text{th}}$ Chern character, in arbitrary even dimensions $D=2 n \geq 2$. Throughout we work with a generic affine connection, that results in a non-vanishing torsion in general, and allows for non-metricity, which accommodates the existence of non-trivial Chern characters and hence Pontryagin densities. We outline an algorithm, with its implementation as a code, which lets one to determine the Chern-Simons potential given the Pontryagin density in an arbitrary even dimension.</description>
