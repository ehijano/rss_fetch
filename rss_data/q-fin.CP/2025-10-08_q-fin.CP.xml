      <title>From Classical Rationality to Contextual Reasoning: Quantum Logic as a New Frontier for Human-Centric AI in Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider state of the art applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in modelling human financial expectations and explore the potential of quantum logic to drive future advancements in this field. This analysis highlights the application of machine learning techniques, including reinforcement learning and deep neural networks, in financial statement analysis, algorithmic trading, portfolio management, and robo-advisory services. We further discuss the emergence and progress of quantum machine learning (QML) and advocate for broader exploration of the advantages provided by quantum-inspired neural networks.</description>

      <title>Smart Contract Adoption under Discrete Overdispersed Demand: A Negative Binomial Optimization Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective supply chain management under high-variance demand requires models that jointly address demand uncertainty and digital contracting adoption. Existing research often simplifies demand variability or treats adoption as an exogenous decision, limiting relevance in e-commerce and humanitarian logistics. This study develops an optimization framework combining dynamic Negative Binomial (NB) demand modeling with endogenous smart contract adoption. The NB process incorporates autoregressive dynamics in success probability to capture overdispersion and temporal correlation. Simulation experiments using four real-world datasets, including Delhivery Logistics and the SCMS Global Health Delivery system, apply maximum likelihood estimation and grid search to optimize adoption intensity and order quantity. Across all datasets, the NB specification outperforms Poisson and Gaussian benchmarks, with overdispersion indices exceeding 1.5. Forecasting comparisons show that while ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing achieve similar point accuracy, the NB model provides superior stability under high variance. Scenario analysis reveals that when dispersion exceeds a critical threshold (r &gt; 6), increasing smart contract adoption above 70% significantly enhances profitability and service levels. This framework offers actionable guidance for balancing inventory costs, service levels, and implementation expenses, highlighting the importance of aligning digital adoption strategies with empirically observed demand volatility.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Representation Bias for Investment Decisions in Open-Source Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly adopted in financial applications to support investment workflows. However, prior studies have seldom examined how these models reflect biases related to firm size, sector, or financial characteristics, which can significantly impact decision-making. This paper addresses this gap by focusing on representation bias in open-source Qwen models. We propose a balanced round-robin prompting method over approximately 150 U.S. equities, applying constrained decoding and token-logit aggregation to derive firm-level confidence scores across financial contexts. Using statistical tests and variance analysis, we find that firm size and valuation consistently increase model confidence, while risk factors tend to decrease it. Confidence varies significantly across sectors, with the Technology sector showing the greatest variability. When models are prompted for specific financial categories, their confidence rankings best align with fundamental data, moderately with technical signals, and least with growth indicators. These results highlight representation bias in Qwen models and motivate sector-aware calibration and category-conditioned evaluation protocols for safe and fair financial LLM deployment.</description>

      <title>FinReflectKG - EvalBench: Benchmarking Financial KG with Multi-Dimensional Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to extract structured knowledge from unstructured financial text. Although prior studies have explored various extraction methods, there is no universal benchmark or unified evaluation framework for the construction of financial knowledge graphs (KG). We introduce FinReflectKG - EvalBench, a benchmark and evaluation framework for KG extraction from SEC 10-K filings. Building on the agentic and holistic evaluation principles of FinReflectKG - a financial KG linking audited triples to source chunks from S&amp;P 100 filings and supporting single-pass, multi-pass, and reflection-agent-based extraction modes - EvalBench implements a deterministic commit-then-justify judging protocol with explicit bias controls, mitigating position effects, leniency, verbosity and world-knowledge reliance. Each candidate triple is evaluated with binary judgments of faithfulness, precision, and relevance, while comprehensiveness is assessed on a three-level ordinal scale (good, partial, bad) at the chunk level. Our findings suggest that, when equipped with explicit bias controls, LLM-as-Judge protocols provide a reliable and cost-efficient alternative to human annotation, while also enabling structured error analysis. Reflection-based extraction emerges as the superior approach, achieving best performance in comprehensiveness, precision, and relevance, while single-pass extraction maintains the highest faithfulness. By aggregating these complementary dimensions, FinReflectKG - EvalBench enables fine-grained benchmarking and bias-aware evaluation, advancing transparency and governance in financial AI applications.</description>

      <title>A Microstructure Analysis of Coupling in CFMMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The programmable and composable nature of smart contract protocols has enabled the emergence of novel market structures and asset classes that are architecturally frictional to implement in traditional financial paradigms. This fluidity has produced an understudied class of market dynamics, particularly in coupled markets where one market serves as an oracle for the other. In such market structures, purchases or liquidations through the intermediate asset create coupled price action between the intermediate and final assets; leading to basket inflation or deflation when denominated in the riskless asset. This paper examines the microstructure of this inflationary dynamic given two constant function market makers (CFMMs) as the intermediate market structures; attempting to quantify their contributions to the former relative to familiar pool metrics such as price drift, trade size, and market depth. Further, a concrete case study is developed, where both markets are constant product markets. The intention is to shed light on the market design process within such coupled environments.</description>

      <title>SAE-FiRE: Enhancing Earnings Surprise Predictions Through Sparse Autoencoder Feature Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting earnings surprises from financial documents, such as earnings conference calls, regulatory filings, and financial news, has become increasingly important in financial economics. However, these financial documents present significant analytical challenges, typically containing over 5,000 words with substantial redundancy and industry-specific terminology that creates obstacles for language models. In this work, we propose the SAE-FiRE (Sparse Autoencoder for Financial Representation Enhancement) framework to address these limitations by extracting key information while eliminating redundancy. SAE-FiRE employs Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose dense neural representations from large language models into interpretable sparse components, then applies statistical feature selection methods, including ANOVA F-tests and tree-based importance scoring, to identify the top-k most discriminative dimensions for classification. By systematically filtering out noise that might otherwise lead to overfitting, we enable more robust and generalizable predictions. Experimental results across three financial datasets demonstrate that SAE-FiRE significantly outperforms baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>FinReflectKG: Agentic Construction and Evaluation of Financial Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The financial domain poses unique challenges for knowledge graph (KG) construction at scale due to the complexity and regulatory nature of financial documents. Despite the critical importance of structured financial knowledge, the field lacks large-scale, open-source datasets capturing rich semantic relationships from corporate disclosures. We introduce an open-source, large-scale financial knowledge graph dataset built from the latest annual SEC 10-K filings of all S and P 100 companies - a comprehensive resource designed to catalyze research in financial AI. We propose a robust and generalizable knowledge graph (KG) construction framework that integrates intelligent document parsing, table-aware chunking, and schema-guided iterative extraction with a reflection-driven feedback loop. Our system incorporates a comprehensive evaluation pipeline, combining rule-based checks, statistical validation, and LLM-as-a-Judge assessments to holistically measure extraction quality. We support three extraction modes - single-pass, multi-pass, and reflection-agent-based - allowing flexible trade-offs between efficiency, accuracy, and reliability based on user requirements. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the reflection-agent-based mode consistently achieves the best balance, attaining a 64.8 percent compliance score against all rule-based policies (CheckRules) and outperforming baseline methods (single-pass and multi-pass) across key metrics such as precision, comprehensiveness, and relevance in LLM-guided evaluations.</description>

      <title>Tracing Positional Bias in Financial Decision-Making: Mechanistic Insights from Qwen2.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in finance exposes high-stakes decision-making to subtle, underexamined positional biases. The complexity and opacity of modern model architectures compound this risk. We present the first unified framework and benchmark that not only detects and quantifies positional bias in binary financial decisions but also pinpoints its mechanistic origins within open-source Qwen2.5-instruct models (1.5B-14B). Our empirical analysis covers a novel, finance-authentic dataset revealing that positional bias is pervasive, scale-sensitive, and prone to resurfacing under nuanced prompt designs and investment scenarios, with recency and primacy effects revealing new vulnerabilities in risk-laden contexts. Through transparent mechanistic interpretability, we map how and where bias emerges and propagates within the models to deliver actionable, generalizable insights across prompt types and scales. By bridging domain-specific audit with model interpretability, our work provides a new methodological standard for both rigorous bias diagnosis and practical mitigation, establishing essential guidance for responsible and trustworthy deployment of LLMs in financial systems.</description>
