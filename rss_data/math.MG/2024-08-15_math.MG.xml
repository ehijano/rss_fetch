      <title>Coarse structures on locally compact abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the study of the large-scale geometry of topological groups, we investigate particular families of subsets of topological groups named group ideals. We compare different group ideals in the realm of locally compact groups. In particular, we show that a subset of a locally compact abelian group is relatively compact if and only if it is coarsely bounded. Using this result, we prove that an infinite-dimensional Banach space cannot be embedded into any product of locally compact groups.</description>

      <title>The Z-Gromov-Wasserstein Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance is a powerful tool for comparing metric measure spaces which has found broad applications in data science and machine learning. Driven by the need to analyze datasets whose objects have increasingly complex structure (such as node and edge-attributed graphs), several variants of GW distance have been introduced in the recent literature. With a view toward establishing a general framework for the theory of GW-like distances, this paper considers a vast generalization of the notion of a metric measure space: for an arbitrary metric space $Z$, we define a $Z$-network to be a measure space endowed with a kernel valued in $Z$. We introduce a method for comparing $Z$-networks by defining a generalization of GW distance, which we refer to as $Z$-Gromov-Wasserstein ($Z$-GW) distance. This construction subsumes many previously known metrics and offers a unified approach to understanding their shared properties. The paper demonstrates that the $Z$-GW distance defines a metric on the space of $Z$-networks which retains desirable properties of $Z$, such as separability, completeness, and geodesicity. Many of these properties were unknown for existing variants of GW distance that fall under our framework. Our focus is on foundational theory, but our results also include computable lower bounds and approximations of the distance which will be useful for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Fixed and Periodic Points of the Intersection Body Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intersection body $IK$ of a star-body $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ was introduced by E. Lutwak following the work of H. Busemann, and plays a central role in the dual Brunn-Minkowski theory. We show that when $n \geq 3$, $I^2 K = c K$ iff $K$ is a centered ellipsoid, and hence $I K = c K$ iff $K$ is a centered Euclidean ball, answering long-standing questions by Lutwak, Gardner, and Fish-Nazarov-Ryabogin-Zvavitch. To this end, we recast the iterated intersection body equation as an Euler-Lagrange equation for a certain volume functional under radial perturbations, derive new formulas for the volume of $I K$, and introduce a continuous version of Steiner symmetrization for Lipschitz star-bodies, which (surprisingly) yields a useful radial perturbation exactly when $n\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Widths and rigidity of unconditional sets and random vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10098v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that any unconditional set in $\mathbb{R}^N$ that is invariant under cyclic shifts of coordinates is rigid in $\ell_q^N$, $1\le q\le 2$, i.e. it can not be well approximated by linear spaces of dimension essentially smaller than $N$. We apply the approach of E.D.~Gluskin to the setting of averaged Kolmogorov widths of unconditional random vectors or vectors of independent mean zero random variables, and prove their rigidity. These results are obtained using a general lower bound for the averaged Kolmogorov width via weak moments of biorthogonal random vector. This paper continues the study of the rigidity initiated by the first author.
  We also provide several corollaries including lower bounds for Kolmogorov widths of mixed norm balls.</description>
