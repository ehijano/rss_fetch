      <title>Interactive Speculative Planning: Enhance Agent Efficiency through Co-design of System and User Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agents, as user-centric tools, are increasingly deployed for human task delegation, assisting with a broad spectrum of requests by generating thoughts, engaging with user proxies, and producing action plans. However, agents based on large language models (LLMs) often face substantial planning latency due to two primary factors: the efficiency limitations of the underlying LLMs due to their large size and high demand, and the structural complexity of the agents due to the extensive generation of intermediate thoughts to produce the final output. Given that inefficiency in service provision can undermine the value of automation for users, this paper presents a human-centered efficient agent planning method -- Interactive Speculative Planning -- aiming at enhancing the efficiency of agent planning through both system design and human-AI interaction. Our approach advocates for the co-design of the agent system and user interface, underscoring the importance of an agent system that can fluidly manage user interactions and interruptions. By integrating human interruptions as a fundamental component of the system, we not only make it more user-centric but also expedite the entire process by leveraging human-in-the-loop interactions to provide accurate intermediate steps. Code and data will be released.</description>

      <title>From homeostasis to resource sharing: Biologically and economically compatible multi-objective multi-agent AI safety benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing safe agentic AI systems benefits from automated empirical testing that conforms with human values, a subfield that is largely underdeveloped at the moment. To contribute towards this topic, present work focuses on introducing biologically and economically motivated themes that have been neglected in the safety aspects of modern reinforcement learning literature, namely homeostasis, balancing multiple objectives, bounded objectives, diminishing returns, sustainability, and multi-agent resource sharing. We implemented eight main benchmark environments on the above themes, for illustrating the potential shortcomings of current mainstream discussions on AI safety.</description>

      <title>The Patterns of Life Human Mobility Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the Patterns of Life Simulation to create realistic simulations of human mobility in a city. This simulation has recently been used to generate massive amounts of trajectory and check-in data. Our demonstration focuses on using the simulation twofold: (1) using the graphical user interface (GUI), and (2) running the simulation headless by disabling the GUI for faster data generation. We further demonstrate how the Patterns of Life simulation can be used to simulate any region on Earth by using publicly available data from OpenStreetMap. Finally, we also demonstrate recent improvements to the scalability of the simulation allows simulating up to 100,000 individual agents for years of simulation time. During our demonstration, as well as offline using our guides on GitHub, participants will learn: (1) The theories of human behavior driving the Patters of Life simulation, (2) how to simulate to generate massive amounts of synthetic yet realistic trajectory data, (3) running the simulation for a region of interest chosen by participants using OSM data, (4) learn the scalability of the simulation and understand the properties of generated data, and (5) manage thousands of parallel simulation instances running concurrently.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Input and State Estimation for Multi-agent System with Dynamic Topology and Heterogeneous Sensor Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A crucial challenge in decentralized systems is state estimation in the presence of unknown inputs, particularly within heterogeneous sensor networks with dynamic topologies. While numerous consensus algorithms have been introduced, they often require extensive information exchange or multiple communication iterations to ensure estimation accuracy. This paper proposes an efficient algorithm that achieves an unbiased and optimal solution comparable to filters with full information about other agents. This is accomplished through the use of information filter decomposition and the fusion of inputs via covariance intersection. Our method requires only a single communication iteration for exchanging individual estimates between agents, instead of multiple rounds of information exchange, thus preserving agents' privacy by avoiding the sharing of explicit observations and system equations. Furthermore, to address the challenges posed by dynamic communication topologies, we propose two practical strategies to handle issues arising from intermittent observations and incomplete state estimation, thereby enhancing the robustness and accuracy of the estimation process. Experiments and ablation studies conducted in both stationary and dynamic environments demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over other baselines. Notably, it performs as well as, or even better than, algorithms that have a global view of all neighbors.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Automotive User Experience with Dynamic Service Orchestration for Software Defined Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increasing demand for dynamic behaviors in automotive use cases, Software Defined Vehicles (SDVs) have emerged as a promising solution by bringing dynamic onboard service management capabilities. While users may request a wide range of services during vehicle operation, background tasks such as cooperative Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) services can activate on-the-fly in response to real-time road conditions. In this dynamic environment, the efficient allocation of onboard resources becomes a complex challenge, in order to meet mixed-criticality onboard Quality-of-Service (QoS) network requirements while ensuring an optimal user experience. Additionally, the ever-evolving real-time network connectivity and computational availability conditions further complicate the process. In this context, we present a dynamic resource-based onboard service orchestration algorithm that considers real-time in-vehicle and V2X network health, along with onboard resource constraints, to select degraded modes for onboard applications and maximize user experience. To enable dynamic orchestration, we introduce the concept of Automotive eXperience Integrity Level (AXIL) which expresses a runtime priority for non-safety-critical applications. This algorithm produces near-optimal solutions while significantly reducing execution time compared to straightforward methods as demonstrated by simulation results. With this approach, we aim to enable efficient onboard execution for a user experience-focused service orchestration.</description>

      <title>Kinodynamic Motion Planning for a Team of Multirotors Transporting a Cable-Suspended Payload in Cluttered Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03394v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a motion planner for cable-driven payload transportation using multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in an environment cluttered with obstacles. Our planner is kinodynamic, i.e., it considers the full dynamics model of the transporting system including actuation constraints. Due to the high dimensionality of the planning problem, we use a hierarchical approach where we first solve the geometric motion planning using a sampling-based method with a novel sampler, followed by constrained trajectory optimization that considers the full dynamics of the system. Both planning stages consider inter-robot and robot/obstacle collisions. We demonstrate in a software-in-the-loop simulation and real flight experiments that there is a significant benefit in kinodynamic motion planning for such payload transport systems with respect to payload tracking error and energy consumption compared to the standard methods of planning for the payload alone. Notably, we observe a significantly higher success rate in scenarios where the team formation changes are needed to move through tight spaces.</description>

      <title>Incentive-Compatible Vertiport Reservation in Advanced Air Mobility: An Auction-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18166v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of advanced air mobility (AAM) is expected to become a multibillion-dollar industry in the near future. Market-based mechanisms are touted to be an integral part of AAM operations, which comprise heterogeneous operators with private valuations. In this work, we study the problem of designing a mechanism to coordinate the movement of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, operated by multiple operators each having heterogeneous valuations associated with their fleet, between vertiports, while enforcing the arrival, departure, and parking constraints at vertiports. Particularly, we propose an incentive-compatible and individually rational vertiport reservation mechanism that maximizes a social welfare metric, which encapsulates the objective of maximizing the overall valuations of all operators while minimizing the congestion at vertiports. Additionally, we improve the computational tractability of designing the reservation mechanism by proposing a mixed binary linear programming approach that leverages the network flow structure.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Obstacle Avoidance using Velocity Obstacles and Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Velocity Obstacles (VO) methods form a paradigm for collision avoidance strategies among moving obstacles and agents. While VO methods perform well in simple multi-agent environments, they don't guarantee safety and can show overly conservative behavior in common situations. In this paper, we propose to combine a VO-strategy for guidance with a CBF-approach for safety, which overcomes the overly conservative behavior of VOs and formally guarantees safety. We validate our method in a baseline comparison study, using 2nd order integrator and car-like dynamics. Results support that our method outperforms the baselines w.r.t. path smoothness, collision avoidance, and success rates.</description>

      <title>Iteration of Thought: Leveraging Inner Dialogue for Autonomous Large Language Model Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Iterative human engagement is a common and effective means of leveraging the advanced language processing power of large language models (LLMs). Using well-structured prompts in a conversational manner, human users can effectively influence an LLM to develop more thoughtful and accurate responses. Motivated by this insight, we propose the Iteration of Thought (IoT) framework for enhancing LLM responses by generating "thought"-provoking prompts vis a vis an input query and the current iteration of an LLM's response. Unlike static or semi-static approaches, e.g. Chain of Thought (CoT) or Tree of Thoughts (ToT), IoT adapts its reasoning path dynamically, based on evolving context, and without generating alternate explorative thoughts which are ultimately discarded. The three components of the IoT framework are (1) an Inner Dialogue Agent (IDA) responsible for generating instructive, context-specific prompts; (2) an LLM Agent (LLMA) that processes these prompts to refine its responses; and (3) an iterative prompting loop that implements a conversation between the former two components. We introduce two variants of our framework: Autonomous Iteration of Thought (AIoT), where an LLM decides when to stop iterating, and Guided Iteration of Thought (GIoT), which always forces a fixed number iterations. We investigate the performance of IoT across various datasets, spanning complex reasoning tasks from the GPQA dataset, explorative problem-solving in Game of 24, puzzle solving in Mini Crosswords, and multi-hop question answering from the HotpotQA dataset. Our results show that IoT represents a viable paradigm for autonomous response refinement in LLMs, showcasing significant improvements over CoT and thereby enabling more adaptive and efficient reasoning systems that minimize human intervention.</description>
