      <title>A Geometric Foundation for the Universal Laws of Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework where the dissipative structures of turbulence emerge from microscopic path uncertainty. By modeling fluid parcels as stochastic tracers governed by a variational principle the Schr\"odinger Bridge we demonstrate that the Navier--Stokes viscous term is the unique macroscopic operator consistent with isotropic microscopic diffusion. We derive two foundational pillars of turbulence from this single principle. First, we show that the Kolmogorov scale $\eta \sim (\nu^3/\epsilon)^{1/4}$ is not merely a dimensional necessity but a geometric diffusion horizon: it is the scale at which the kinetic energy of a fractal trajectory, scaling as $k \sim \nu/\tau$, balances the macroscopic dissipation rate. Second, we show that the universal law of the wall is the stationary solution to this stochastic process under no-slip constraints. The logarithmic mean profile arises from the scale invariance of the turbulent diffusivity, while finite-Reynolds-number corrections emerge as controlled asymptotic expansions of the stochastic variance. This framework offers a first-principles derivation of turbulent scaling laws without recourse to phenomenological dimensional analysis.</description>

      <title>Linearized instability of Couette flow in stress-power law fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the linearized stability of plane Couette flow for stress-power law fluids, which exhibit non-monotonic stress-strain rate behavior. The constitutive model is derived from a thermodynamic framework using a non-convex rate of dissipation potential. Under velocity boundary conditions, the system may admit three steady-state solutions. Linearized stability analysis reveals that the two solutions on ascending constitutive branches are unconditionally stable, while the solution on the descending branch is unconditionally unstable. For mixed traction-velocity boundary conditions, the base state is unique. Stability depends solely on whether the prescribed traction lies on an ascending (stable) or descending (unstable) branch of the constitutive curve. The results demonstrate that flow stability in these complex fluids is fundamentally governed by both boundary conditions and constitutive non-monotonicity.</description>

      <title>Measuring the effect of spatial dimension on hydrodynamic turbulence using direct numerical simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform direct numerical simulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation with forcing at different spatial dimensions and measure turbulent and chaotic properties. Lyapunov exponents, $\lambda$, decrease with dimension, and $\lambda &lt; 0$ for all simulations in six-dimensions up to $Re = 40$. These six-dimensional simulations display non-Gaussian statistics and other behavior similar to well developed turbulence despite their lack of chaos. Further, we find that small scale perturbations do not extend to the largest scales and that this terminal scale between correlation and decorrelation shrinks with dimension. We theorize that this change is related to the increased rate of vortex stretching. We find the interplay between turbulent and chaotic properties changes with increasing dimension.</description>

      <title>Large/small eddy simulations: A posteriori analysis in high Reynolds number isotropic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While direct numerical simulations (DNS) are the most accurate method for studying turbulence, their large computational cost restricts their use to idealized configurations and to Reynolds numbers well below those found in practical systems. A recently proposed method, Large/Small Eddy Simulation (L/SES), aims to overcome this limitation while still providing the solution fidelity comparable to that of DNS. L/SES represents a pair of coupled calculations: a lower-fidelity Large Eddy Simulation (LES), which captures the large-scale flow structure, and a high-fidelity Small-Eddy Simulation (SES) targeting a sub-region of interest of the LES, in which the small-scale dynamics is fully resolved. In this study, we demonstrate the accuracy and performance of L/SES in large Reynolds-number homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) up to Taylor-scale Reynolds number approximately 600. Turbulence properties obtained with L/SES are shown to be in close agreement with the literature, both in terms of global characteristics, such as kinetic energy spectra and dissipative anomaly, as well as small-scale properties, such as higher-order moments of the velocity gradients up to the 10th order and probability density functions of the intermittent quantities. Also using simulations of HIT, we systematically investigate various method parameters and determine their optimal converged values. Finally, we discuss the computational cost of L/SES and demonstrate that it is approximately 3 orders of magnitude lower than for a traditional DNS at the highest Reynolds number considered here. This highlights the potential of L/SES as a discovery tool, which brings high-fidelity simulations of realistic flows into the realm of feasibility.</description>

      <title>Self-similar multishock implosions for ultrahigh compression of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a class of self-similar solutions describing ultrahigh compression of a uniform-density target by spherically converging, stacked shock waves. Extending the classical Guderley model, we derive a scaling law for the final density of the form $\rho_{r}/\rho_{0} \propto \hat{P}^{\beta (N-1)}$, where $N$ is the number of shocks, $\hat{P}$ the stage pressure ratio, and $\beta$ a numerical exponent determined by the adiabatic index $\gamma$. One-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations confirm the validity of this scaling across a broad parameter range. Notably, the relation remains accurate even in the strongly nonlinear regime up to $\hat{P} \sim 70$, well beyond the perturbative limit, highlighting the robustness and practical relevance of the model. Owing to its volumetric geometry, this compression scheme inherently avoids the Rayleigh--Taylor instability, which typically compromises shell-based implosions, and thereby establishes a theoretical benchmark for instability-free compression in inertial confinement fusion.</description>

      <title>A simulation approach including under-resolved scales for multi-component fluid flows in multi-scale porous structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we develop computational models and methodology for accurate multi-component-flow simulation in under-resolved multi-scale porous structures. It is generally impractical to fully resolve the flow in porous structures with large length-scale difference due to tremendously high computational expense. The flow contributions from under-resolved scales need to be accounted for with proper physics modeling as well as simulation processes. Using pre-computed physical properties such as the absolute permeability, K0, the capillary-pressure-saturation curve, and the relative permeability, Kr, in typically resolved porous structures, local fluid force is conjectured and applied to simulation in the under-resolved regions that are represented by porous media. By doing so, accurate simulation of flow in multi-scale porous structures becomes feasible.
  In order to check the accuracy and robustness of this method, a set of benchmark test cases are performed for both single-component and multi-component flows in artificially constructed multi-scale porous structures, and simulation results are compared with analytic solutions and/or results with much finer resolution resolving the porous structures. Quantitatively consistent results are obtained with proper input of K0, capillary pressure, and Kr in all tested cases.
  Specifically, imbibition patterns, entry pressure, residual component patterns, and the absolute and relative permeability are accurately captured with this approach.</description>

      <title>A data-driven framework to identify restenosis-prone regions in femoral arteries from geometric and inflow waveform parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Haemodynamic indices derived from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), such as Time-averaged Wall Shear Stress (TAWSS) and Oscillatory Shear Index (OSI), are closely associated with restenosis risk in Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD). However, translating these insights into clinical practice may require computationally efficient approaches such as Reduced Order Model (ROM) or Machine Learning (ML). In this work, we developed an ML-ROM framework to predict critical, restenosis-prone, haemodynamic regions accounting for both vessel geometries and inlet flow waveforms. We generated 500 synthetic femoral-artery geometries parameterised by six geometric parameters, and created physiologically realistic inflow waveforms via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of patient data. CFD was used to obtain the Wall Shear Stress (WSS) distribution, from which TAWSS and OSI were computed. Critical regions were then defined by applying threshold-based criteria to the TAWSS and OSI. Four critical-region definitions were considered: two with vessel-specific relative thresholds (TAWSS&lt; 33rd percentile and OSI&gt; 66nd percentile) and two with absolute thresholds (TAWSS&lt; 0.5 Pa and OSI&gt; 0.2). Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) was then applied to these high-dimensional critical-region data to obtain ROMs; These were then used to train ML models from which the critical region regions could be reconstructed. Three ML architectures were explored: a Fourier-based architecture, a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) architecture, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. The Fourier models achieved the highest performance, with the median values of Balanced Accuracy (BA) exceeding 0.92 across all critical-region definitions. The ML-ROM framework also offered a substantial speed-up ratio, about nine orders of magnitude faster than traditional CFD.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann models for the hydrodynamic equations in multiphase flow with high density ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiphase flows with high density ratios, such as water and air flows, have recently been simulated using the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method. This approach corresponds to solving the phase field equations, such as the Cahn-Hilliard and Allen-Cahn equations, and the hydrodynamic equations, typically the Navier-Stokes and pressure equations for pseudo-incompressible fluids. Due to the high density ratio, the higher-order numerical truncation errors associated with spatial density gradients can become significant. These errors can lead to problems such as inaccuracies in shear stress, violations of Galilean invariance, and undesirable dependencies on absolute pressure for the pseudo-incompressible solutions. To overcome such problems, the moments of the distribution function and the equilibrium state must be carefully designed while ensuring robustness. In this work, we propose a new scheme based on the lattice kinetic scheme (LKS), which directly solves the velocity and pressure fields in the similar discrete space as the LB method. When mapping the LKS-based models to the LB models, the original LKS models are simplified for computational efficiency and the filter collision operator is implemented. Benchmark test cases confirm that the proposed scheme effectively addresses these issues, achieving high accuracy and robustness while eliminating the iterative steps typically required in the LKS. One of the most significant improvements is the accuracy of the airflow field induced by water motion, likely due to improved momentum transfer across the interface.</description>

      <title>Capillary flow simulation with the phase-field-based lattice Boltzmann solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase-field-based lattice Boltzmann (LB) model has been developed to perform high fidelity multiphase flow simulations. Its ability to accurately handle high density ratio and surface tension effects is expected to be beneficial for capillary flow simulation, leading to accurate reproduction of flow patterns such as slug flow, droplet flow, and film flow. This is critical in many engineering cases because the flow patterns significantly affect the velocity and pressure fields. In this study, on top of the LB models based on the conservative Allen-Cahn equation and the volumetric boundary conditions for the complex geometries, an optimized wettability and friction model are implemented. With these models, we conducted a set of benchmark test cases, including static and dynamic multiphase flow scenarios such as the droplet on the curved surfaces, water-filling channel for the Lucas-Washburn law, and the critical pressure in the three-dimensional channel, an air-driven multiphase flow in the experiments. In all of these cases, the solver produces results that are consistent with both theory and experiment, even with respect to the pressure field accuracy, which has often been overlooked in many previous studies.</description>

      <title>Variational quantum algorithm for anion exchange across electrolyzer membrane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a variational quantum algorithm that solves the one-dimensional diffusion problem with a space-dependent diffusion constant $D(x)$. This problem is relevant for the exchange of hydroxide ions across a multi-layer membrane in an alkaline electrolyzer. We use $16$ to $64$ grid points across the membrane, resulting from $n=4$ to $6$ data qubits for the ideal quantum simulations that are based on the Qiskit software. For these qubit numbers, the depth of the parametric quantum circuit has been chosen to ensure sufficient expressibility. The state preparation requires particular attention since the diffusivity $D$ is piecewise constant in the different layers with discontinuities at the interface. Furthermore, we compare different classical optimization schemes with respect to their convergence in the VQA method. We demonstrate the applicability of the quantum algorithm to a problem with non-trivial boundary conditions and jump conditions of the diffusion constant and outline possible extensions of the proof-of-concept application case of quantum computing.</description>

      <title>How do trout regulate patterns of muscle contraction to optimize propulsive efficiency during steady swimming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding efficient fish locomotion offers insights for biomechanics, fluid dynamics, and engineering. Traditional studies often miss the link between neuromuscular control and whole-body movement. To explore energy transfer in carangiform swimming, we created a bio-inspired digital trout. This model combined multibody dynamics, Hill-type muscle modeling, and a high-fidelity fluid-structure interaction algorithm, accurately replicating a real trout's form and properties. Using deep reinforcement learning, the trout's neural system achieved hierarchical spatiotemporal control of muscle activation. We systematically examined how activation strategies affect speed and energy use. Results show that axial myomere coupling-with activation spanning over 0.5 body lengths-is crucial for stable body wave propagation. Moderate muscle contraction duration ([0.1,0.3] of a tail-beat cycle) lets the body and fluid act as a passive damping system, cutting energy use. Additionally, the activation phase lag of myomeres shapes the body wave; if too large, it causes antagonistic contractions that hinder thrust. These findings advance bio-inspired locomotion understanding and aid energy-efficient underwater system design.</description>

      <title>On the analytical behavior of the $k$--$\omega$ turbulence model in buoyant-driven thermal convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01308v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The representation of buoyancy-driven turbulence in Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes models remains unresolved, with no widely accepted standard formulation. A key difficulty is the lack of analytical guidance for incorporating buoyant effects, particularly under unstable stratification. This study derives an analytical solution of the standard $k$--$\omega$ model for Rayleigh--B\'enard convection in an infinite layer, where turbulent kinetic energy is generated solely by buoyancy. The solution provides explicit scaling relations among the Rayleigh ($\Ra$), Prandtl ($\Pran$), and Nusselt ($\Nu$) numbers that capture the simulation trends: $\Nu \sim \Ra^{1/3}\Pran^{1/3}$ for $\Pran \ll 1$ and $\Nu \sim \Ra^{1/3}\Pran^{-0.415}$ for $\Pran \gg 1$. This framework quantifies the discrepancies in the conventional buoyancy treatment and clarifies their origin. Informed by this analysis, the buoyancy-related modelling terms are reformulated to recover the measured $\Nu$--$\Ra$--$\Pran$ trends. Only two dimensionless algebraic functions are introduced, which vanish in the absence of buoyancy, ensuring full compatibility with the standard closure. The corrected model is validated across a range of buoyancy-driven flows, including two-dimensional Rayleigh--B\'enard convection, internally heated convection in two configurations, unstably stratified Couette flow, and vertically heated natural convection with varying aspect ratios. Across all cases, it provides highly accurate predictions.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks for Predicting Permeability Tensors of 2D Porous Media: Comparison of Convolution- and Transformer-based Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Permeability is a central concept in the macroscopic description of flow through porous media, with applications spanning from oil recovery to hydrology. Traditional methods for determining the permeability tensor involving flow simulations or experiments can be time consuming and resource-intensive, while analytical methods, e.g., based on the Kozeny-Carman equation, may be too simplistic for accurate prediction based on pore-scale features. In this work, we explore deep learning as a more efficient alternative for predicting the permeability tensor based on two-dimensional binary images of porous media, segmented into solid ($1$) and void ($0$) regions. We generate a dataset of 24,000 synthetic random periodic porous media samples with specified porosity and characteristic length scale. Using Lattice-Boltzmann simulations, we compute the permeability tensor for flow through these samples with values spanning three orders of magnitude. We evaluate three families of image-based deep learning models: ResNet (ResNet-$50$ and ResNet-$101$), Vision Transformers (ViT-T$16$ and ViT-S$16$) and ConvNeXt (Tiny and Small). To improve model generalisation, we employ techniques such as weight decay, learning rate scheduling, and data augmentation. The effect of data augmentation and dataset size on model performance is studied, and we find that they generally increase the accuracy of permeability predictions. We also show that ConvNeXt and ResNet converge faster than ViT and degrade in performance if trained for too long. ConvNeXt-Small achieved the highest $R^2$ score of $0.99460$ on $4,000$ unseen test samples. These findings underscore the potential to use image-based neural networks to predict permeability tensors accurately.</description>

Abstract: The flow of a colloidal solution between two parallel disks rotating with the same angular velocity about two non-coincident axes was studied. The problem has been approached from two perspectives, the first wherein the stress is expressed in terms of a power-law of kinematical quantities, and the second wherein we consider a non-standard model where the symmetric part of the velocity gradient is given by a power-law of the stress. For a range of power-law exponents, the class of models are non-invertible. By varying the material and geometric parameters, changes in the flow behaviour at different Reynolds numbers were analysed. We find that pronounced boundary layers develop even at low Reynolds numbers based on the power-law exponents. The new class of stress power-law fluids and fluids that exhibit limiting stress also show the ability to develop boundary layers.</description>

      <title>Pre-Generating Multi-Difficulty PDE Data for Few-Shot Neural PDE Solvers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key aspect of learned partial differential equation (PDE) solvers is that the main cost often comes from generating training data with classical solvers rather than learning the model itself. Another is that there are clear axes of difficulty--e.g., more complex geometries and higher Reynolds numbers--along which problems become (1) harder for classical solvers and thus (2) more likely to benefit from neural speedups. Towards addressing this chicken-and-egg challenge, we study difficulty transfer on 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes, systematically varying task complexity along geometry (number and placement of obstacles), physics (Reynolds number), and their combination. Similar to how it is possible to spend compute to pre-train foundation models and improve their performance on downstream tasks, we find that by classically solving (analogously pre-generating) many low and medium difficulty examples and including them in the training set, it is possible to learn high-difficulty physics from far fewer samples. Furthermore, we show that by combining low and high difficulty data, we can spend 8.9x less compute on pre-generating a dataset to achieve the same error as using only high difficulty examples. Our results highlight that how we allocate classical-solver compute across difficulty levels is as important as how much we allocate overall, and suggest substantial gains from principled curation of pre-generated PDE data for neural solvers.

      <title>Chain of Unit-Physics: A Primitive-Centric Approach to Scientific Code Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic large language models are proposed as autonomous code generators for scientific computing, yet their reliability in high-stakes problems remains unclear. Developing computational scientific software from natural-language queries remains challenging broadly due to (a) sparse representation of domain codes during training and (b) the limited feasibility of RLHF with a small expert community. To address these limitations, this work conceptualizes an inverse approach to code design, embodied in the Chain of Unit-Physics framework: a first-principles (or primitives)-centric, multi-agent system in which human expert knowledge is encoded as unit-physics tests that explicitly constrain code generation. The framework is evaluated on a nontrivial combustion task, used here as a representative benchmark for scientific problem with realistic physical constraints. Closed-weight systems and code-focused agentic variants fail to produce correct end-to-end solvers, despite tool and web access, exhibiting four recurrent error classes: interface (syntax/API) hallucinations, overconfident assumptions, numerical/physical incoherence, and configuration fragility. Open-weight models with chain-of-thought (CoT) decoding reduce interface errors but still yield incorrect solutions. On the benchmark task, the proposed framework converges within 5-6 iterations, matches the human-expert implementation (mean error of $3.1\times10^{-3}$ %), with a $\sim$33.4 % faster runtime and a $\sim$30 % efficient memory usage at a cost comparable to mid-sized commercial APIs, yielding a practical template for physics-grounded scientific code generation. As datasets and models evolve, zero-shot code accuracy will improve; however, the Chain of Unit-Physics framework goes further by embedding first-principles analysis that is foundational to scientific codes.</description>

      <title>GPU-native Embedding of Complex Geometries in Adaptive Octree Grids Applied to the Lattice Boltzmann Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) reduces computational costs in CFD by concentrating resolution where needed, but efficiently embedding complex, non-aligned geometries on GPUs remains challenging. We present a GPU-native algorithm for incorporating stationary triangle-mesh geometries into block-structured forest-of-octrees grids, performing both solid voxelization and automated near-wall refinement entirely on the device. The method employs local ray casting accelerated by a hierarchy of spatial bins, leveraging efficient grid-block traversal to eliminate the need for index orderings and hash tables commonly used in CPU pipelines, and enabling coalesced memory access without CPU-GPU synchronization. A flattened lookup table of cut-link distances between fluid and solid cells is constructed to support accurate interpolated bounce-back boundary conditions for the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). We implement this approach as an extension of the AGAL framework for GPU-based AMR and benchmark the geometry module using the Stanford Bunny (112K triangles) and XYZ RGB Dragon (7.2M triangles) models from the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository. The extended solver is validated for external flows past a circular/square cylinder (2D, $Re = 100$), and a sphere (3D, $\text{Re}\in\{10, 15, 20\}$). Results demonstrate that geometry handling and interpolation impose modest overhead while delivering accurate force predictions and stable near-wall resolution on adaptive Cartesian grids. The approach is general and applicable to other explicit solvers requiring GPU-resident geometry embedding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01884v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a thermodynamic phase transition in chiral active matter. Low-frequency disorder triggers global synchronisation and energy dissipation, while high disorder activates a topological heat pump, generating an inverse energy cascade. This drives the system towards an Onsager dipole, which can be arrested into a metastable vortex glass if dispersion is insufficient to overcome the defect lattice. We propose topological gas dynamics as a universality class governed by the interplay of active disorder and topological sorting, unifying active swarms and classical inviscid fluids.</description>

      <title>Guided Unconditional and Conditional Generative Models for Super-Resolution and Inference of Quasi-Geostrophic Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Typically, numerical simulations of Earth systems are coarse, and Earth observations are sparse and gappy. We apply four generative diffusion modeling approaches to super-resolution and inference of forced two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic turbulence on the beta-plane from coarse, sparse, and gappy observations. Two guided approaches minimally adapt a pre-trained unconditional model: SDEdit modifies the initial condition, and Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) modifies the reverse diffusion process score. Two conditional approaches, a vanilla variant and classifier-free guidance, require training with paired high-resolution and observation data. We consider multiple test cases spanning: two regimes, eddy and anisotropic-jet turbulence; two Reynolds numbers, 10^3 and 10^4; and two observation types, 4x coarse-resolution fields and coarse, sparse and gappy observations. Our comprehensive skill metrics include norms of the reconstructed vorticity fields, turbulence statistical quantities, and quantifications of the super-resolved probabilistic ensembles and their errors. We also study the sensitivity to tuning parameters such as guidance strength. Results show that the generated super-resolution fields of SDEdit are unphysical, while those of DPS are reasonable but with smoothed fine-scale features; however, neither of these lower-cost models propagates observational information effectively to unobserved regions. The two conditional models require re-training, but reconstruct missing fine-scale features, are cycle-consistent with observations, and predict correct turbulence statistics, including the tails. Further, their mean errors are highly correlated with and predictable from their ensemble standard deviations. Results highlight the tradeoffs between ease of implementation, fidelity (sharpness), and cycle-consistency of the diffusion models, and offer practical guidance for deployment.</description>

      <title>Subtleties of UV-crosslinking in microfluidic particle fabrication: UV dosage and intensity matter</title>

Abstract: Curable hydrogels have tunable properties that make them well-suited for applications in drug delivery, cell therapies, and 3D bioprinting. Advances in microfluidic droplet generation enable rapid fabrication of polymer-filled droplets. UV-curable polymers offer a clear path toward using fluidic generation to produce monodisperse microgels with uniform properties. In flow, polymer concentration and UV exposure both control the degree of crosslinking. High UV intensity is often used to ensure complete gelation and avoid complications that may arise from partial curing. Optical microscopy can assess droplet and particle sizes in flow. However, optimizing formulations for mechanical properties usually requires removal of generated material and external measurement outside of flow. In this study, we couple droplet generation, microgel fabrication, and mechanics assessment within a single fluidic device. We make and measure soft polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) microgels by curing polymer-filled water drops in mineral oil. Crosslinking is tuned by varying UV dosage, allowing us to study how gelation degree influences microgel properties. Within the device, we use shape deformation in flow to measure the restoring stress of both droplets and particles. Our results suggest that PEGDA droplets gel from the inside out. If gelation is incomplete, a particle resides within a fluid drop. Independent measurements outside of flow corroborate this observation. Crosslinking PEGDA-filled droplets in a pendant drop geometry, with dye, suggests the persistence of an aqueous shell around the gel. Similarly, microparticles in PEGDA-filled drops undergoing gelation exhibit diffusive arrest near the drop center, while maintaining mobility in an outer region. Together, these results suggest the importance of considering the extent of gelation when fabricating microgels using fluidics.</description>

      <title>Weighted integral methods for fluid force diagnostics in incompressible flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whilst surface-stress integration remains the standard approach for fluid force evaluation, control-volume integral methods provide deeper physical insights through functional relationships between the flow field and the resultant force. In this work, by introducing a second-order tensor weight function into the Navier-Stokes equations, we develop a novel weighted-integral framework that offers greater flexibility and enhanced capability for fluid force diagnostics in incompressible flows. Firstly, in addition to the total force and moment, the weighted integral methods establish, for the first time, rigorous quantitative connections between the surface-stress distribution and the flow field, providing potential advantages for flexible body analyses. Secondly, the weighted integral methods offer alternative perspectives on force mechanisms, through vorticity dynamics or pressure view, when the weight function is set as divergence-free or curl-free, respectively. Thirdly, the derivative moment transformation (DMT)-based integral methods (Wu et al., J. Fluid Mech. vol. 576, 2007, 265-286) are generalised to weighted formulations, by which the interconnections among the three DMT methods are clarified. In the canonical problem of uniform flow past a circular cylinder, weighted integral methods demonstrate advantages in yielding new force expressions, improving numerical accuracy over original DMT methods, and enhancing surface-stress analysis. Finally, a force expression is derived that relies solely on velocity and acceleration at discrete points, without spatial derivatives, offering significant value for experimental force estimation. This weighted integral framework holds significant promise for flow diagnostics in fundamentals and applications.</description>

Abstract: The interaction of 'walking droplets' and capillary waves in a weakly subcritical Faraday wave experiment has been studied as a hydrodynamic analog to Bohmian quantum mechanics (see "Hydrodynamic Quantum Analogs", J. Bush and A. Oza, Rep. Prog. Physics (2021)). We report here experimental results of walking droplets interacting with supercritical Faraday waves with dimensionless acceleration of approximately 7.7, where the onset of Faraday instability occurs at dimensionless acceleration 6.3, in flat bath topography. Our working fluid is silicone oil with a kinematic viscosity of 20 cst that is placed as a 4.2 mm horizontal liquid layer in an intermediate-aspect-ratio circular bath with a radius to Faraday wavelength ratio of 5.8. We also use different 3D-printed subsurfaces that act as slit structures with local oil depth of 0.7 mm. We confirm expected behavior for walking droplets in the supercritical Faraday regime, such as erratic trajectories, droplets clustering together due to capillary effects, and spontaneous drop creation. We note a special case of walking-droplet behavior when the bath only partially displays Faraday waves. We discuss the influence of the lateral boundaries and slits on droplet trajectory in this chaotic regime and compare the measured trajectories found here to those single and double slit experiments previously studied in the subcritical Faraday regime.</description>

      <title>Escape from end-pinching in Herschel-Bulkley ligaments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Capillary retraction of Herschel-Bulkley ligaments displays a rich set of behaviors that depart significantly from the classical Newtonian picture. We focus here on the low-viscosity regime, where droplet detachment is controlled by the end-pinching mechanism. Using fully resolved axisymmetric simulations, we show that viscoplasticity and shear-dependent rheology reorganize the fundamental routes by which a retracting ligament may pinch off or escape breakup. Four dynamical outcomes are identified: inertial pinch-off, viscous escape driven by an attached vorticity layer, inertial escape caused by vortex-ring detachment, and complete arrest when yielding suppresses motion. These regimes appear in an orderly structure across the rheological parameter space, but their transitions are governed by a single unifying feature of the neck dynamics: whether inertia, viscous diffusion, or yield stress dominates the local collapse. When inertia dominates, the vorticity sheet detaches and rolls into a vortex ring, producing an inertial rebound of the neck. When viscous effects dominate, the vorticity layer remains attached and drives a back-flow that reopens the neck. When yield stress is sufficiently large, both mechanisms are suppressed and the ligament becomes motionless. This framework extends the Newtonian end-pinching and escape mechanisms to viscoplastic fluids and clarifies how non-Newtonian rheology reshapes capillary-driven retraction.</description>

      <title>Hardware-Accelerated Phase-Averaging for Cavitating Bubbly Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive validation, performance characterization, and scalability analysis of a hardware-accelerated phase-averaged multiscale solver designed to simulate acoustically driven dilute bubbly suspensions. The carrier fluid is modeled using the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The dispersed phase is represented through two distinct subgrid formulations: a volume-averaged model that explicitly treats discrete bubbles within a Lagrangian framework, and an ensemble-averaged model that statistically represents the bubble population through a discretized distribution of bubble sizes. For both models, the bubble dynamics are modeled via the Keller--Miksis equation. For the GPU cases, we use OpenACC directives to offload computation to the GPUs. The volume-averaged model is validated against the analytical Keller-Miksis solution and experimental measurements, showing excellent agreement with root-mean-squared errors of less than 8% for both single-bubble oscillation and collapse scenarios. The ensemble-averaged model is validated by comparing it to volume-averaged simulations. On an NCSA Delta node with 4 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, we observe a speedup 16-fold compared to a 64-core AMD Milan CPU. The ensemble-averaged model offers additional reductions in computational cost by solving a single set of averaged equations, rather than multiple stochastic realizations. However, the volume-averaged model enables the interrogation of individual bubble dynamics, rather than the averaged statistics of the bubble dynamics. Weak and strong scaling tests demonstrate good scalability across both CPU and GPU platforms. These results show the proposed method is robust, accurate, and efficient for the multiscale simulation of acoustically driven dilute bubbly flows.</description>

      <title>Effect of cross-sectional anisotropy on shock train dynamics in supersonic internal flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the effect of duct aspect ratio ($AR$), defined as the ratio of major to minor axis in an elliptical duct, on shock train dynamics for a freestream Mach number of 2.1. The aspect ratio $AR$ is varied from 1.0 to 3.0 while maintaining a constant cross-sectional area and identical upstream conditions, thereby ensuring the same inlet mass flow and nearly constant boundary-layer-induced blockage across all $AR$. This isolates shape-induced confinement effects. Simulations are performed using an embedded-boundary method with adaptive mesh refinement which enabled a finest resolution of 48$\mu$m resolving the shocks in the shock train. The results show that increasing $AR$ significantly modifies the shock train morphology. The number of discrete shock cells decreases, and the leading shock front elongates along the major axis while contracting along the minor axis. The normal shock stem prominent in the circular duct (AR=1.0) nearly disappears at AR=3.0. Despite these morphological changes, the wall-pressure trace and stagnation-pressure loss remain largely insensitive to $AR$. These results indicate that while duct cross-section governs the detailed shock train structure, the overall efficiency of flow deceleration and pressure recovery is dictated primarily by the effective blockage imposed by the turbulent boundary layer, rather than the aspect ratio itself for a given mass flow rate and pressure ratio across the pseudo shock.</description>

Abstract: Between the linear and nonlinear regimes, we identify a universal transition range centered on a characteristic halo mass $m_h^*\propto t$, within which gravitational dynamics self-organize the matter field toward an effective spectral index n=-1. In a bottom-up hierarchy, early collapse of low-mass halos preserves imprints of the primordial spectrum, whereas prolonged assembly of halos near $m_h^*$ erases that memory and establishes universality. We formulate a scale-to-scale cascade, the redistribution of mass and energy across scales, that yields universal scaling laws for the halo mass function and internal structure. Globally, the cascade drives a random walk of halos with mass-dependent waiting time $\tau_g\propto m_h^{-\lambda}$; A Fokker-Planck equation gives mass function $f_M\propto m_h^{-\lambda}$ and $\lambda=2/3$ for the gravity-dominant transition range. Locally, a radially directed cascade governs particle migration with waiting time $\tau_{gr}\propto r^{-\gamma}$, yielding density $\rho_r\propto r^{-2\gamma}$ and $\gamma=2/3$ on scales near $m_h^*$. The cascade drives the system toward a statistically steady state that continuously releases energy and maximizes entropy, characterized by scale-independent rates, preventing mass or energy buildup at intermediate scales. Scale-dependent dominance of the primordial spectrum versus gravity implies two effective exponents, producing double-$\lambda$ mass functions and double-$\gamma$ density in excellent agreement with simulations. Using Illustris and Virgo, we measure an inverse kinetic-energy cascade from small to large scales at $\varepsilon_u \approx -10^{-7}$m$^2$/s$^3$, a direct potential-energy cascade of $-1.4\varepsilon_u$, and a net dissipation of -0.4$\varepsilon_u$ via halo mergers and particle migration. The dependence of waiting time and step length on the particle mass suggests new constraints near $10^{12}$GeV.</description>

Abstract: The accurate solution of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) remains challenging due to steep gradients, discontinuities, and multiscale structures that make conventional solvers computationally demanding. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed the governing equations into the learning process, enabling mesh-free solution of PDEs, yet they often struggle to capture steep gradients, discontinuities, and complex nonlinear wave interactions. To address these limitations, we employ the Extended Physics-Informed Neural Network (XPINN) framework to solve the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett equation with a nonconvex flux, modeling immiscible two-phase flow in porous media. The computational domain is dynamically decomposed in space and time into evolving pre-shock and post-shock subdomains, allowing localized subnetworks to efficiently learn distinct flow behaviors, with coupling enforced via the Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition to ensure physically consistent flux continuity. We compare XPINN with standard PINNs and its variants, including PINN with artificial viscosity, PINN with Welge construction, and PINN with the Oleinik entropy condition, and across all cases, XPINN consistently outperforms the other methods, accurately resolving sharp fronts and capturing the correct physical behavior. Importantly, XPINN achieves this using the simpler Adam optimizer, whereas some PINN variants require more complex or higher-order strategies such as L-BFGS to reach comparable accuracy, demonstrating that XPINN is a robust and scalable approach for challenging hyperbolic PDEs without artificial diffusion or entropy corrections.
