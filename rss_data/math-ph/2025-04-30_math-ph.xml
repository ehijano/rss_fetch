      <title>An improved bound for the ground state of a Schr\"odinger operator on a loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a closed curve of length $2\pi$ with curvature $\kappa(s)$ and the Schr\"odinger operator $H$ with $\kappa^2$ as the potential term. Let $\lambda_\Gamma$ be the lowest eigenvalue of $H$. The Ovals Conjecture proposed by Benguria and Loss states that $\lambda_\Gamma \ge 1$. While the conjecture remains open, the present work establishes a new lower bound of $0.81$ on $\lambda_\Gamma$, improving on the previously best known estimate of $0.6085$.</description>

      <title>From Klein-Gordon-Wave to Schr\"odinger-Wave: a Normal Form Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we consider a Klein-Gordon-Wave system, which couples the evolution of a massive field and a massless one through a Yukawa interaction and we derive its Hamiltonian normal form to second order. To the first-order approximation, the normal form results in a Schr\"odinger-Wave system, while a Schr\"odinger-Poisson system is derived in the limit of vanishing perturbative parameter. A second-order approximation provides the successive corrections to the Schr\"odinger-Wave system, while higher-order approximations can be obtained by iterating our constructive procedure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the multiplicative statistics associated to the limiting determinantal point process describing unitary random matrices with a critical edge point, where limiting density vanishes like a power 5/2. We prove that these statistics are governed by the first three equations of the KdV hierarchy, and study the asymptotic behavior of the relevant solutions.</description>

      <title>Phase space of a Poisson algebra and the induced Pre-Poisson bialgebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first introduce the notion of a phase space of a Poisson algebra, and show that a Poisson algebra has a phase space if and only if it is sub-adjacent to a pre-Poisson algebra. Moreover, we introduce the notion of Manin triples of pre-Poisson algebras and show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between Manin triples of pre-Poisson algebras and phase spaces of Poisson algebras. Then we introduce the notion of pre-Poisson bialgebras, which is equivalent to Manin triples of pre-Poisson algebras. We study coboundary pre-Poisson bialgebras, which leads to an analogue of the classical Yang-Baxter equation. Furthermore, we introduce the notions of quasi-triangular and factorizable pre-Poisson bialgebras as special cases. A quasi-triangular pre-Poisson bialgebra gives rise to a relative Rota-Baxter operator of weight $1$. The double of a pre-Poisson bialgebra enjoys a natural factorizable pre-Poisson bialgebra structure. Finally, we introduce the notion of quadratic Rota-Baxter pre-Poisson algebras and show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between quadratic Rota-Baxter pre-Poisson algebras and factorizable pre-Poisson bialgebras. Based on this construction, we give a phase space for a Rota-Baxter symplectic Poisson algebra.</description>

      <title>Learning the Position of Image Vortices from Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The point vortex model is an idealized model for describing the dynamics of many vortices with numerical efficiency, and has been shown to be powerful in modeling the dynamics of vortices in a superfluid. The model can be extended to describe vortices in fluids with a well defined boundary, as an image vortex can be added to the equations of motion to impose the correct velocity profile at the boundary. The mathematical formulation of the image vortex depends on the boundary in question, and is well known for a wide variety of problems, although the formulation of an image vortex in a fluid with a soft boundary remains under debate, as the boundary condition is ill-posed. Such a boundary is common-place in the dynamics of a vortex in an ultra-cold atomic Bose-Einstein condensate, for example, which is typically trapped in a harmonic potential.
  In order to address this problem, the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics framework is applied to data from mean-field simulations to extract an approximate point vortex model for a vortex in a circular power law trapping potential. A formulation for the position of an image vortex in such a trap is presented, and the accuracy of this model is evaluated.</description>

      <title>Surmise for random matrices' level spacing distributions beyond nearest-neighbors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlations between energy levels can help distinguish whether a many-body system is of integrable or chaotic nature. The study of short-range and long-range spectral correlations generally involves quantities which are very different, unless one uses the $k$-th nearest neighbor ($k$NN) level spacing distribution. For nearest-neighbor (NN) spectral spacings, the distribution in random matrices is well captured by the Wigner surmise. This well-known approximation, derived exactly for a 2$\times$2 matrix, is simple and satisfactorily describes the NN spacings of larger matrices. There have been attempts in the literature to generalize Wigner's surmise to further away neighbors. However, as we show, the current proposal in the literature does not accurately capture numerical data. Using the known variance of the distributions from random matrix theory, we propose a corrected surmise for the $k$NN spectral distributions. This surmise better characterizes spectral correlations while retaining the simplicity of Wigner's surmise. We test the predictions against numerical results and show that the corrected surmise is systematically better at capturing data from random matrices. Using the XXZ spin chain with random on-site disorder, we illustrate how these results can be used as a refined probe of many-body quantum chaos for both short- and long-range spectral correlations.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Hermitian topology from non-Hermitian knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermiticity of the system gives rise to a distinct knot topology in the complex eigenvalue spectrum, which has no counterpart in Hermitian systems. In contrast, the singular values of a non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonian are always real by definition, meaning they can also be interpreted as the eigenvalues of some underlying Hermitian Hamiltonian. In this work, we demonstrate that if the singular values of a NH Hamiltonian are treated as eigenvalues of prototype translational-invariant Hermitian models that undergo a topological phase transition between two distinct phases, the complex eigenvalues of the NH Hamiltonian will also undergo a transition between different knot structures. We emphasize that the choice of a NH Hamiltonian whose singular values match the eigenvalues of a Hermitian model is not unique. However, our study suggests that this connection between the NH and Hermitian models remains robust as long as the periodicity in lattice momentum is same for both. Furthermore, we provide an example showing that a change in the topology of the Hermitian model implies a transition in the underlying NH knot topology, but a change in knot topology does not necessarily signal a topological transition in the Hermitian system.</description>

      <title>Perfectly Matched Layers and Characteristic Boundaries in Lattice Boltzmann: Accuracy vs Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial boundary conditions (BCs) play a ubiquitous role in numerical simulations of transport phenomena in several diverse fields, such as fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, acoustics, geophysics, and many more. They are essential for accurately capturing the behavior of physical systems whenever the simulation domain is truncated for computational efficiency purposes. Ideally, an artificial BC would allow relevant information to enter or leave the computational domain without introducing artifacts or unphysical effects. Boundary conditions designed to control spurious wave reflections are referred to as nonreflective boundary conditions (NRBCs). Another approach is given by the perfectly matched layers (PMLs), in which the computational domain is extended with multiple dampening layers, where outgoing waves are absorbed exponentially in time. In this work, the definition of PML is revised in the context of the lattice Boltzmann method. The impact of adopting different types of BCs at the edge of the dampening zone is evaluated and compared, in terms of both accuracy and computational costs. It is shown that for sufficiently large buffer zones, PMLs allow stable and accurate simulations even when using a simple zeroth-order extrapolation BC. Moreover, employing PMLs in combination with NRBCs potentially offers significant gains in accuracy at a modest computational overhead, provided the parameters of the BC are properly tuned to match the properties of the underlying fluid flow.</description>

      <title>Acceleration of Convergence of Double Series for the Green's Function of the Helmholtz Equation in Polar Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The well-known expressions for the Green's functions for the Helmholtz equation in polar coordinates with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are transformed. The slowly converging double series describing these Green's functions are reduced by means of successive subtraction of several auxiliary functions to series that converge much more rapidly. A method is given for constructing the auxiliary functions (the first one is identical with the Green's function of the Laplace equation) in the form of single series and in the form of closed expressions. Formulas are presented for summing series of the Fourier-Bessel and Dini type; they are required to implement the two steps of the procedure for accelerating convergence. The effectiveness of the functions constructed is illustrated by the numerical solution of the problem of the dispersion properties of a slotted line with a coaxial circular cylindrical screen.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work we consider properly defined two-parameter Wigner functions that, e.g., can be used as witness for quantum behaviour for pure states as expressed in terms of a self-adjoint observable angular position and the corresponding angular momentum operator L. It is shown that negative values of the corresponding Wigner functions may reveal the quantum nature of superpositions of angular momentum eigenstates with a fractional mean value of L but in an ambiguous manner. For a suitable choice of parameters these Wigner functions are positive and are in accordance with Borns rule in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>On the CFT dual of superstring on AdS$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the proposed duality between superstring on AdS$_3\times$S$^3\times\mathbb{T}^4$ with pure NS-NS flux and a deformed symmetric orbifold CFT. We extract the residues of 3-point string correlators at their next-to-leading poles, which can be written as some integrals. Because of picture changing, the integrand is not unique. We make an ansatz for its proper form which linearly combines three different picture choices. On the CFT side, we obtain the corresponding residues by doing a conformal perturbation computation at the second order. The result can also be written as some integrals, with the integrand being a five point function in the symmetric orbifold theory, which is calculated using covering maps. After unifying the integration variables of the two sides, we find that the two integrands match precisely, due to some novel mathematical identities of covering maps. Our calculation verifies the proposed marginal operator in the dual CFT of superstring on AdS$_3\times$S$^3\times\mathbb{T}^4$ and could be generalized to the CFT duals of superstrings on general backgrounds AdS$_3\times X$ with few modifications.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Dark Phases in Scalar Particles within the Schwarzschild-Kiselev-Letelier Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on the emergence of dark phases (dark energy imprints) in the radial wave function of scalar particles. We achieve this by presenting novel solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation in a spherically symmetric spacetime, encompassing a black hole, a quintessential fluid, and a cloud of strings. We determine the exact solution for the spacetime metric, analyze the admissible ranges for its physical parameters, and discuss the event horizon formation. Subsequently, we detail the solution of the Klein-Gordon equation and explore three distinct cases of dark phases, corresponding to the quintessence state parameter $\alpha_{Q}$ taking the values $0$, $1/2$, and $1$. Notably, the case where $\alpha_{Q} = 1$ holds particular significance due to current observational constraints on dark energy.</description>

      <title>Integrable black hole dynamics in the asymptotic structure of AdS$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work deepens the study of integrable asymptotic symmetries for AdS$_{3}$. They are given by an infinite set of integrable nonlinear equations known as the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (AKNS) hierarchy, characterized by an also infinite set of abelian conserved charges. We present their field-dependent Killing vectors and the computation of the canonical charges associated to the asymptotic metric, together with their corresponding charge algebra. We study black hole thermodynamics and show that the temperature for stationary black holes falling in the AKNS asymptotics is always constant, even in the case where the solutions are not axisymmetric. This is related to the existence of a hyperelliptic curve, which appears as a fundamental object in many integrable systems. We also present a special solution associated with the Korteweg-de Vries equation, that is a particular case of the AKNS integrable hierarchy. It is presented in the form of a periodic soliton leading to a cnoidal KdV black hole, whose temperature is characterized by two copies of hyperelliptic curves.</description>

      <title>The effect of finite duration sources on modes and generalization of the d'Alembert solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of dispersive waves governed by linear wave equations, where a finite duration source is applied. The resulting wave may be viewed as the superposition of modes before the source is turned on and after it is turned off. We consider the problem of relating the modes after the source term is turned off to the modes before the source term was turned on. We obtain explicit formulas in both the wavenumber and position representations. A number of special cases are considered. Using the methods presented, we obtain a generalization of the d'Alembert solution which applies to linear wave equations with constant coefficients.</description>

      <title>Inverse problems for the zeros of the Wigner function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider the inverse problem of determining the properties of a Wigner function from the set of its zeros (the nodal set). The previous state of the art of the problem is Hudson's theorem, which shows that an empty nodal set is associated only with generalized Gaussians. We extend this analysis to non-Gaussian functions. Our first main result states that, if the nodal set of the Wigner distribution of a function $f$ is bounded, then $f$ is equal to a generalized Gaussian times a polynomial. An immediate consequence of this result is that any open set is a uniqueness set for Wigner functions with bounded nodal set. Our second main result shows that the only Wigner function vanishing on a circle of radius $\sqrt{\hbar/2}$ and centered at the origin is the Wigner distribution of the first Hermite function. We prove similar results for the second and third Hermite functions. We also derive for Wigner functions a counterpart of the sign uncertainty principle of J. Bourgain, L. Clozel and J.-P. Kahane, which says that if the negative part of a Wigner function is contained in a ball, then the radius of the ball has a lower bound. Finally, we obtain various constraints on Wigner distributions whose bounded nodal sets contain circles, ellipses or line segments. As a by-product of our work we prove several non-trivial results about the zeros of Laguerre polynomials.</description>

      <title>Beyond Robertson-Schr\"odinger: A General Uncertainty Relation Unveiling Hidden Noncommutative Trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a universal strengthening of the Robertson-Schr\''odinger uncertainty relation, revealing a previously overlooked trade-off of genuinely quantum origin, particularly as the state becomes more mixed. Remarkably, this generalized bound supplements the standard commutator term and the covariance term with an additional positive contribution that depends on the commutator of observables. The relation also rigorously proves and extends a conjectured uncertainty relation previously proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 062215 (2024)]. For two-level quantum systems, the inequality becomes an exact equality for any state and any pair of observables, establishing that the bound is tight in the strongest possible sense.</description>

      <title>Dressed fields for Quantum Chromodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: String-localized QFT allows to explain Standard Model interactions in an autonomous way, committed to quantum principles rather than a "gauge principle", thus avoiding an indefinite state space and compensating ghosts. The resulting perturbative scattering matrix is known (at tree-level) to be insensitive to the non-locality of the auxiliary "string-localized fields" used in the construction. For the examples of Yang-Mills and QCD, we prove that it is actually equivalent to the perturbative S-matrix of gauge theory, restricted to physical particle states. The role of classical gauge invariance is revealed along the way. The main tool are "dressed fields", that are intermediate between free fields and interacting fields, and for which we give explicit formulas at all orders. The renormalization of loops, as well as non-perturbative issues are not adressed, but we hint at the possibility, enabled by our approach, that qualitative traces of confinement may be visible already at the level of the dressed fields.</description>

      <title>On three-dimensional ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetry: maximally supersymmetric backgrounds and massive deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the $SO ({\cal N})$ superspace formulation for $\cal N$-extended conformal supergravity in three dimensions, we derive all maximally supersymmetric backgrounds in the ${\cal N} =4$ case. The specific feature of this choice is that the so-called super Cotton tensor $X^{IJKL} = X^{[IJKL]}$, which exists for ${\cal N} \geq 4$, is equivalent to the scalar $X$ defined by $X^{IJKL} = \varepsilon^{IJKL} X$. This scalar may be used as a deformation parameter. In the family of $(p,q)$ anti-de Sitter (AdS) superspaces with $p+q=4$, it is known that $X\neq 0$ exists only if $p=4$ and $q=0$. In general, the $(4,0)$ AdS superspaces are characterised by the structure group $SL(2,{\mathbb R}) \times SO (4)$ and their geometry is determined by two constant parameters, $S$ and $X$, of which the former determines the AdS curvature, while the $R$-symmetry curvature is determined by the parameters $(X+2S)$ and $(X-2S)$ in the left and right sectors of $SU(2)_{\rm L} \times SU(2)_{\rm R}$, respectively. Setting $S=0$ leads to the so-called deformed ${\cal N}=4$ Minkowski superspace ${\mathbb M}^{3|8}_X$ introduced thirteen years ago. We construct general interacting supersymmetric field theories in ${\mathbb M}^{3|8}_X$ and demonstrate that they originate as massive deformations of the following two families of ${\cal N} =4$ theories in standard Minkowski superspace ${\mathbb M}^{3|8}$: (i) ${\cal N}=4$ superconformal field theories; and (ii) ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric gauge theories in ${\mathbb M}^{3|8}$ which are not superconformal but possess the $R$-symmetry group $SU(2)_{\rm L} \times SU(2)_{\rm R}$. Extensions of the theories in (ii) to ${\mathbb M}^{3|8}_X$ necessarily contain Chern-Simons terms at the component level. We also demonstrate the generation of topologically massive ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric gauge theories from radiative corrections in the hypermultiplet sector.</description>

Abstract: Non-Hermiticity appears ubiquitously in various open classical and quantum systems and enriches classification of topological phases. However, the role of nonsymmorphic symmetry, crystalline symmetry accompanying fractional lattice translations, has remained largely unexplored. Here, we systematically classify non-Hermitian topological crystalline phases protected by nonsymmorphic symmetry and reveal unique phases that have no counterparts in either Hermitian topological crystalline phases or non-Hermitian topological phases protected solely by internal symmetry. Specifically, we elucidate the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ non-Hermitian topological phases and their associated anomalous boundary states characterized by distinctive complex-valued energy dispersions.</description>

      <title>Trotterization is substantially efficient for low-energy states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trotterization is one of the central approaches for simulating quantum many-body dynamics on quantum computers or tensor networks. In addition to its simple implementation, recent studies have revealed that its error and cost can be reduced if the initial state is closed in the low-energy subspace. However, the improvement by the low-energy property rapidly vanishes as the Trotter order grows in the previous studies, and thus, it is mysterious whether there exists genuine advantage of low-energy initial states. In this Letter, we resolve this problem by proving the optimal error bound and cost of Trotterization for low-energy initial states. For generic local Hamiltonians composed of positive-semidefinite terms, we show that the Trotter error is at most linear in the initial state energy $\Delta$ and polylogarithmic in the system size $N$. As a result, the computational cost becomes substantially small for low-energy states with $\Delta \in o(Ng)$ compared to the one for arbitrary initial states, where $g$ denotes the energy per site and $Ng$ means the whole-system energy. Our error bound and cost of Trotterization achieve the theoretically-best scaling in the initial state energy $\Delta$. In addition, they can be partially extended to weakly-correlated initial states having low-energy expectation values, which are not necessarily closed in the low-energy subspace. Our results will pave the way for fast and accurate simulation of low-energy states, which are one central targets in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Chaos Around the Kerr Black Hole: its Effects on Entropy and the Shadow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massless or massive particles in unstable orbits around a Kerr black hole exhibit chaotic motion when perturbed. They either plunge into the black hole or escape to infinity after making some oscillations around the equatorial plane. In both of these cases, chaotic motion causes information production. In the case of the photons that escape to infinity, it was recently suggested that this information can be used to resolve the subring structure of the shadow image and obtain more precise data about the black hole mass and spin. Here, we extend this method to obtain more precise results by including the non-equatorial contributions to the Lyapunov exponents. In the other case of massive particles that plunge into the Kerr black hole, we show that the associated Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy derived from the Lyapunov exponents can be interpreted in the context of black hole thermodynamics and that it obeys Bekenstein's bound on the entropy of a physical material system. Thus, the perturbed unstable orbits, either ending inside the black hole or at the observer's screen, have physical consequences.</description>

      <title>Freezing Phase Transitions for Lattice Systems and Higher-Dimensional Subshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X = \mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{Z}^d}$, where $d \geq 1$ and $\mathcal{A}$ is a finite set, equipped with the action of the shift map. For a given continuous potential $\phi: \mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{Z}^d} \to \mathbb{R}$ and $\beta&gt;0$ (``inverse temperature''), there exists a (nonempty) set of equilibrium states $\mathrm{ES}(\beta\phi)$. The potential $\phi$ is said to exhibit a ``freezing phase transition'' if $\mathrm{ES}(\beta\phi) = \mathrm{ES}(\beta'\phi)$ for all $\beta, \beta' &gt; \beta_c$, while $\mathrm{ES}(\beta\phi) \neq \mathrm{ES}(\beta'\phi)$ for any $\beta &lt; \beta_c &lt; \beta'$, where $\beta_c\in (0,\infty)$ is a critical inverse temperature depending on $\phi$. In this paper, given any proper subshift $X_0$ of $X$, we explicitly construct a continuous potential $\phi: X \to \mathbb{R}$ for which there exists $\beta_c \in (0,\infty)$ such that $\mathrm{ES}(\beta\phi)$ coincides with the set of measures of maximal entropy on $X_0$ for all $\beta &gt; \beta_c$, whereas for all $\beta &lt; \beta_c$, $\mu(X_0)=0$ for all $\mu\in \mathrm{ES}(\beta\phi)$. This phenomenon was previously studied only for $d = 1$ in the context of dynamical systems and for restricted classes of subshifts, with significant motivation stemming from quasicrystal models. Additionally, we prove that under a natural summability condition -- satisfied, for instance, by finite-range potentials or exponentially decaying potentials -- freezing phase transitions are impossible.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic Quantum Dynamics and Bosonization of Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum systems that interact non-locally with an environment (or bath) serve as paradigms for exploring collective phenomena. These systems naturally arise in physical setups featuring long-range many-body interactions, and are experimentally realized in platforms such as Rydberg atom arrays, cold atoms in optical cavities, ion traps, and dipolar systems. They hold broad potential for applications in quantum computing and quantum sensing. In this work, we reveal an exact theoretical mechanism governing such non-locally and mesoscopically coupled systems. We demonstrate that the effect of general environments on the system exhibits a universal bosonic character. Specifically, the exact effect that environments have on the system, regardless of their microscopic details, is equivalently produced by the interaction with a reservoir of non-interacting bosonic modes. The emergent 'bosonization' of the environment results from the mesoscopic coupling in the thermodynamic limit and can be interpreted as a manifestation of the central limit theorem. While this effect has been observed in specific models before, we show that it is, in fact, a universal feature.</description>

Abstract: The aim of the present article is to give an introduction to the concept of quasi-unitary equivalence and to define several (pseudo-)metrics on the space of self-adjoint operators acting possibly in different Hilbert spaces. As some of the ``metrics'' do not fulfill all properties of a metric (e.g. some lack the triangle inequality or the definiteness), we call them ``distances'' here. To the best of our knowledge, such distances are treated for the first time here. The present article shall serve as a starting point of further research (see e.g. arXiv:2412.13165).</description>

      <title>A Complete Characterization of Passive Unitary Normalizable (PUN) Gaussian States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a complete characterization of the class of multimode quantum Gaussian states that can be reduced to a tensor product of thermal states using only a passive unitary operator. We call these states \textit{passive unitary normalizable} (PUN) Gaussian states. The characterization of PUN Gaussian states is given in three different ways: $(i)$ in terms of their covariance matrices, $(ii)$ using gauge-invariance (a special class of Glauber--Sudarshan $p$-functions), and $(iii)$ with respect to the recently obtained $(A,\Lambda)$ parametrization of Gaussian states in [J. Math. Phys. 62, 022102 (2021)]. In terms of the covariance matrix, our characterization states that an $n$-mode quantum Gaussian state is PUN if and only if its $2n\times 2n$ quantum covariance matrix $S$ commutes with the standard symplectic matrix $J$. It is well-known that the so-called gauge-invariant Gaussian states are PUN, but whether the converse is true is not known in the literature to the best of our knowledge. We establish the converse in affirmation. Lastly, in terms of the $(A,\Lambda)$-parameterization, we show that a Gaussian state with parameters $(A,\Lambda)$ is PUN if and only if $A=0$.</description>

      <title>RG analysis of spontaneous stochasticity on a fractal lattice: stability and bifurcations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the stability and bifurcations of spontaneous stochasticity using an approach reminiscent of the Feigenbaum renormalization group (RG). We consider dynamical models on a self-similar space-time lattice as toy models for multiscale motion in hydrodynamic turbulence. Here an ill-posed ideal system is regularized at small scales and the vanishing regularization (inviscid) limit is considered. By relating the inviscid limit to the dynamics of the RG operator acting on the flow maps, we explain the existence and universality (regularization independence) of the limiting solutions as a consequence of the fixed-point RG attractor. Considering the local linearized dynamics, we show that the convergence to the inviscid limit is governed by the universal RG eigenmode. We also demonstrate that the RG attractor undergoes a period-doubling bifurcation with parameter variation, thereby changing the nature of the inviscid limit. In the case of chaotic RG dynamics, we introduce the stochastic RG operator acting on Markov kernels. Then the RG attractor becomes stochastic, which explains the existence and universality of spontaneously stochastic solutions in the limit of vanishing noise. We study a linearized structure (RG eigenmode) of the stochastic RG attractor and its period-doubling bifurcation. Viewed as prototypes of Eulerian spontaneous stochasticity, our models explain its mechanism, universality and potential diversity.</description>

Abstract: Immersion (i.e., local embedding) is relevant to the physics of topologically ordered phases through the entanglement bootstrap. An annulus can be immersed in a disk or a sphere as a "figure-8", which cannot be smoothly deformed to an embedded annulus. We investigate a simple problem: is there an Abelian state on the immersed figure-8 annulus, locally indistinguishable from the ground state of the background physical system? We show that if the answer is affirmative, a strong sense of isomorphism must hold: two homeomorphic immersed regions must have isomorphic information convex sets, even if they cannot smoothly deform to each other on the background physical system. We explain why to care about strong isomorphism in physical systems with anyons and give proof in the context of Abelian anyon theory. We further discuss a connection between immersed annuli and anyon transportation in the presence of topological defects. In the appendices, we discuss related problems in broader contexts.</description>

      <title>XYZ ruby code: Making a case for a three-colored graphical calculus for quantum error correction in spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing and developing new quantum error-correcting schemes is one of the most prominent tasks in quantum computing research. In such efforts, introducing time dynamics explicitly in both analysis and design of error-correcting protocols constitutes an important cornerstone. In this work, we present a graphical formalism based on tensor networks to capture the logical action and error-correcting capabilities of any Clifford circuit with Pauli measurements. We showcase the formalism on new Floquet codes derived from topological subsystem codes, which we call XYZ ruby codes. Based on the projective symmetries of the building blocks of the tensor network we develop a framework of Pauli flows. Pauli flows allow for a graphical understanding of all quantities entering an error correction analysis of a circuit, including different types of QEC experiments, such as memory and stability experiments. We lay out how to derive a well-defined decoding problem from the tensor network representation of a protocol and its Pauli flows alone, independent of any stabilizer code or fixed circuit. Importantly, this framework applies to all Clifford protocols and encompasses both measurement- and circuit-based approaches to fault tolerance. We apply our method to our new family of dynamical codes which are in the same topological phase as the 2+1d color code, making them a promising candidate for low-overhead logical gates. In contrast to its static counterpart, the dynamical protocol applies a Z3 automorphism to the logical Pauli group every three timesteps. We highlight some of its topological properties and comment on the anyon physics behind a planar layout. Lastly, we benchmark the performance of the XYZ ruby code on a torus by performing both memory and stability experiments and find competitive circuit-level noise thresholds of 0.18%, comparable with other Floquet codes and 2+1d color codes.</description>

      <title>Phase-space gaussian ensemble quantum camouflage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extending the phase-space description of the Weyl-Wigner quantum mechanics to a subset of non-linear Hamiltonians in position and momentum, gaussian functions are identified as the quantum ground state. Once a Hamiltonian, $H^{W}(q,\,p)$, is constrained by the $\partial ^2 H^{W} / \partial q \partial p = 0$ condition, flow properties for generic $1$-dim systems can be analytically obtained in terms of Wigner functions and Wigner currents. For gaussian statistical ensembles, the exact phase-space profile of the quantum fluctuations over the classical trajectories are found, so to interpret them as a suitable Hilbert space state configuration for confronting quantum and classical regimes. In particular, a sort of {\em quantum camouflage} where the stationarity of classical statistical ensembles can be camouflaged by the stationarity of gaussian quantum ensembles is identified. Besides the broadness of the framework worked out in some previous examples, our results provide an encompassing picture of quantum effects on non-linear dynamical systems which can be interpreted as a first step for finding the complete spectrum of non-standard Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Periodic orbits on 2-regular circulant digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23417v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodic orbits (equivalence classes of closed paths up to cyclic shifts) play an important role in applications of graph theory. For example, they appear in the definition of the Ihara zeta function and exact trace formulae for the spectra of quantum graphs. Circulant graphs are Cayley graphs of $\mathbb{Z}_n$. Here we consider directed Cayley graphs with two generators (2-regular Cayley digraphs). We determine the number of primitive periodic orbits of a given length (total number of directed edges) in terms of the number of times edges corresponding to each generator appear in the periodic orbit (the step count). Primitive periodic orbits are those periodic orbits that cannot be written as a repetition of a shorter orbit. We describe the lattice structure of lengths and step counts for which periodic orbits exist and characterize the repetition number of a periodic orbit by its winding number (the sum of the step sequence divided by the number of vertices) and the repetition number of its step sequence. To obtain these results, we also evaluate the number of Lyndon words on an alphabet of two letters with a given length and letter count.</description>

      <title>Flat limit of AdS/CFT from AdS geodesics: scattering amplitudes and antipodal matching of Li\'enard-Wiechert fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08540v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the flat limit of AdS/CFT from the point of view of geodesics in AdS. We show that the flat space scattering amplitudes can be constructed from operator insertions where the geodesics of the particles corresponding to the operators hit the conformal boundary of AdS. Further, we compute the Li\'enard-Wiechert solutions in AdS by boosting a static charge using AdS isometries and show that the solutions are antipodally matched between two regions, separated by a global time difference of $\Delta\tau=\pi$. Going to the boundary of AdS along null geodesics, in the flat limit, this antipodal matching leads to the flat space antipodal matching near spatial infinity.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the local form subordination condition on the perturbation of a self-adjoint operators with compact resolvent, which is used to show the Riesz basis property of the eigensystem of the perturbed operator. Our new assumptions and new proof allow for establishing the Riesz basis property also in the case of slow and non-monotone decay in this subordination condition.</description>

      <title>Beta-deformation in Twistor-String Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate how the marginal beta deformation of the ${N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory manifests within the context of the topological B-model in the twistor space $\mathbb{CP}^{3|4}$. We begin by identifying the beta deformation as states living in a specific irreducible representation of the superconformal algebra. Then, we compute the ghost number two elements of the BRST cohomology of the topological model. A gauge-fixing procedure is applied to these states, allowing us to identify the elements living in the irreducible representation that characterizes the beta deformation. Based on this identification, we proceed to write the deformed topological action, and the corresponding deformed BRST operator.</description>

      <title>Soliton solutions associated with a class of third-order ordinary linear differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explicit solutions to the related integrable nonlinear evolution equations are constructed by solving the inverse scattering problem in the reflectionless case for the third-order differential equation $d^3\psi/dx^3+Q\,d\psi/dx+P\psi =k^3\psi,$ where $Q$ and $P$ are the potentials in the Schwartz class and $k^3$ is the spectral parameter. The input data set used to solve the relevant inverse problem consists of the bound-state poles of a transmission coefficient and the corresponding bound-state dependency constants. Using the time-evolved dependency constants, explicit solutions to the related integrable evolution equations are obtained. In the special cases of the Sawada--Kotera equation and the modified bad Boussinesq equation, the method presented here explains the physical origin of the constants appearing in the relevant $\mathbf N$-soliton solutions algebraically constructed, but without any physical insight, by the bilinear method of Hirota.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a specific type of atomic Higgsings of the 6d $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ theories, which we call the induced flows. For the conformal matter theory associated with a pair of nilpotent orbits, the induced flows are given by the inductions of the orbits. We also consider the induced flows for the orbi-instanton theories (as well as some little string theories) that are associated with the homomorphisms from the discrete subgroups of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ to $E_8$. This gives a physical definition of the inductions among these discrete homomorphisms, analogous to the inductions of the nilpotent orbits. We analyze the Higgs branch dimensions, the monotonicity of the Weyl anomalies (or the 2-group structure constants for LSTs) and the brane pictures under the induced flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Macdonald finite-difference Hamiltonian is lifted to a super-generalization. In addition to canonical bosonic time variables $p_k$ new Grassmann time variables $\theta_k$ are introduced, and the Hamiltonian is represented as a differential operator acting on a space of functions of both types of variables $p_k$ and $\theta_k$. Eigenfunctions for this Hamiltonian are a suitable generalization of Macdonald polynomials to super-Macdonald polynomials discussed earlier in the literature. Peculiarities of the construction in comparison to the canonical bosonic case are discussed.</description>

      <title>On minimizing curves in a Brownian potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a $(1+1)$-dimensional semi-discrete random variational problem that can be interpreted as the geometrically linearized version of the critical $2$-dimensional random field Ising model. The scaling of the correlation length of the latter was recently characterized in [11] and [12, Section 5]; our analysis is reminiscent of the multi-scale approach of the latter work. We show that at every dyadic scale from the system size down to the lattice spacing the minimizer contains at most order-one Dirichlet energy per unit length. We also establish a quenched homogenization result in the sense that the leading order of the minimal energy becomes deterministic as the ratio system size / lattice spacing diverges. To this purpose we adapt arguments from [9] on the $(d+1)$-dimensional version our the model, with a Brownian replacing the white noise potential, to obtain the initial large-scale bounds. Based on our estimate of the $(p=3)$-Dirichlet energy, we give an informal justification of the geometric linearization. Our bounds, which are oblivious to the microscopic cut-off scale provided by the lattice spacing, yield tightness of the law of minimizers in the space of continuous functions as the lattice spacing is sent to zero.</description>

      <title>Displacement Memory Effect from Supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explain the recent results on the displacement memory effect (DME) of plane gravitational waves using supersymmetric quantum mechanics. This novel approach stems from that both the geodesic and the Schr\"odinger equations are Sturm-Liouville boundary value problems. Supersymmetry provides a unified framework for the P\"oschl-Teller and the Scarf profiles and yields the critical values of the associated wave amplitudes for DME in a natural way. Within our framework, we obtain a compact formula for DME in terms of the asymptotic values of the superpotential and the geodesics. In addition, this new technique enables us to build plane and gravitational waves with 2-transverse directions using superpartner potentials. Lastly, we study DME within a singular wave profile inspired by supersymmetric quantum mechanics, which demonstrates the broader applicability of our method.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish a relation between the quantum corner VOA $q\widetilde{Y}_{L,0,N}[\Psi]$, which can be regarded as a generalization of quantum $W_N$ algebra, and Sergeev-Veselov super Macdonald polynomials. We demonstrate precisely that, under a specific map, the correlation functions of the currents of $q\widetilde{Y}_{L,0,N}[\Psi]$, coincide with the Sergeev-Veselov super Macdonald polynomials.</description>
